Smith: Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon. And welcome to our First Quarter Earnings Call. We're off to a strong start in 2014 delivering both revenue and adjusted EBITDA above the top end of our guidance ranges. As depicted on slide three in our presentation revenues were $580 million up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 12% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $260 million for the quarter up 8% over the same quarter last year. We delivered solid results across the regions in our metrics including MRR per cabinet, - and cross connect adds reflect continued health of the business and a competitive edge from platform Equinix.  We continue to be differentiated in the market as the only global interconnection platform which position us as the partner of choice for businesses with significant global requirements. Today 65% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple regions and that's up from 60% last year. And 80% of the recurring revenues comes from customers deployed across multiple metros, up from 78% last year. Looking at our top 100 customers 86 are deployed in more than one region across an average of 10 metros. A metric that demonstrates the value of platform Equinix, reflects the very diverse revenue base and correlates with high levels of customer retention. As our customers distribute their infrastructure to improve performance and reduce cost we remain focused on delivering a consistent experience in how we design, build and operate our IBXs as-well-as how we market, sell and support platform Equinix.  We continue to experience momentum across industry verticals and associated ecosystems. The network vertical delivered consistent growth with new bookings from service providers who are expanding their portfolio of cloud service and simultaneously upgrading our infrastructure to 100 gig and support explosive -- demand. Content also delivered strong bookings this quarter driven by global expansions from large players and continued growth of the advertising exchange or the Ad-IX ecosystems. Ad-IX wins include expansions from -- and MediaMath as-well-as new wins including -- a video advertising platform.  In financial services our win with BATS who is consolidating infrastructure in our -- campus is generating continued momentum in our financial ecosystems. This ecosystem remains one of our most diverse with over 800 customers across a variety of asset classes, market participants and information providers. We're also seeing positive signs in enterprise sub verticals including energy, oil and gas, professional services and insurance as-well-as new ecosystems taking shape in high -- deployment which I will cover in more detail shortly. At the heart of our success is the value we deliver to customers through interconnection. From our earliest days Equinix has focused on building communities among companies who gain business benefits from connecting with each other in a private, secure and high throughput manner.  As shown on slide 4, we've evolved our interconnection portfolio in response to customer demands and now offer the industry's most comprehensive suite of interconnection solutions. Cross connects or point-to-point fiber connections that delivery secure high performance connectivity between customers and represent the core of our interconnection business generating 85% of our interconnection revenue.  Today we've approximately 132,000 cross connects and these connections continue to grow with IT traffic increases which is indicative of the power of interconnections and a sign of the strengthen of our ecosystems. Operating in tandem with cross connects and also fueled by IT traffic growth are the various exchanges we run in over 20 markets around the world. These exchanges enable one-to-many connections and like any exchange the value to an individual customer is driven by the number and quality of participants on that exchange. Companies continue to select Equinix as the most efficient and effective place to exchange traffic.  Our exchange drives over 2.5 terabytes of traffic across 2,200 ports which is twice as many as our closest competitor. Traffic in our exchanges continues to grow over 20% yearly as network, content and cloud customer take advantage of the -- systems across platform Equinix. Combination of large scale exchanges available via both IP and Ethernet protocols and extensive private interconnection inside our IBXs has established Equinix as the global interconnection leader and interconnection remains at the heart of our strategy going forward.  Let me shift gears now and cover the cloud market and the Equinix opportunity. Cloud adoptions continues to ramp creating massive disruptions in how businesses consume IT services and creating significant opportunity for Equinix. We're experiencing a dramatic increase in traffic within the data center as enterprises leverage virtualized infrastructures and move data and applications into hybrid cloud architectures.  Platform Equinix is the home of the interconnected cloud delivering critical hubbing functions where customers seek to achieve rapid time-to-market, reduce capital and lower costs associated with directly accessing public cloud services while simultaneously enabling access to their private cloud. In fact -- index we formed projects that cloud traffic within data centers will triple over the next four years. Enterprises are eager to realize the benefits of the cloud but have significant concerns about relying on the open Internet for business critical applications and data.  With the need for higher performance, security, and control Equinix is seeing customers move critical data and applications off the public Internet taking advantage of the ability to directly connect to major cloud service providers such as AWS where they can achieve significant throughput performance gains.  As depicted on slide five, the tremendous choice of networks and cloud service providers available on platform Equinix has uniquely positioned us to deliver to enterprises the flexibility they need to confidently extend their networks and take full advantage of hybrid cloud.  As shown of slide 6, the proximity advantages of platform Equinix allow companies to move beyond really adopt or use cases like test and developments and empower forward thinking CIOs to leverage the cloud for mission critical workloads. These CIOs understand that latency is critical to application performance and many enterprises are reconfiguring their infrastructure to deploy hybrid cloud allowing them to retain control over critical data and enhancing application performance.  In fact at Equinix we ourselves have deployed a cloud optimize architecture globally to support our own enterprise by connecting to over 40 cloud services. Blending them with our own premise applications to create a hybrid cloud architecture optimized to run our business. While still early in the adoption curve we're seeing more-and-more businesses adopt this next generation IT architectures and leverage our performance hub offer to extend their enterprise, when to increase performance and lower costs. Enterprise wins this quarter include Lego, - and a leading aerospace and defense contractor. Cloud and IT services remains our fastest growing vertical delivering 15% year-over-year revenue growth. We continue to win business from -- cloud and network customers including a global deployment with Verizon in 15 markets and Microsoft offering its express -- services in 16 Equinix markets.  Today we're extending our leadership with the announcement of the Equinix Cloud Exchange. An advanced interconnection solution optimized to support today's cloud workloads. With Cloud Exchange Equinix is building upon its interconnection heritage to bring together cloud providers and cloud consumers in a new way to realize the benefits of cloud computing. Turning to slide 7. The Equinix Cloud Exchange extends the investment end and functionality of our Ethernet exchange to enable private secure connections between enterprises, networks and cloud service providers. With this solution enterprises can access multiple cloud and network vendors through a single port interface allowing them to quickly and efficiently deploy hybrid cloud infrastructure.  The Equinix Cloud Exchange enables IT workloads to be virtually provisioned in an automated fashion over a single physical port between multiple parties simplifying and improving integration, security and performance of cloud services. The cloud exchange is supported by a portal which allows CIOs and their infrastructure teams to interact with the exchange in a variety of ways including -- the list of cloud service provider locations by metro and region and self-provisioning virtual circuits to participating providers such as AWS and Microsoft. Available globally in 13 markets today the Equinix Cloud Exchange is expected to be available in 19 markets by the end of the year.  As we continue to focus on solutions for enterprise customers building hybrid cloud environments we expanded our alliance with Microsoft to offer -- route the Equinix Cloud Exchange in 16 markets spanning four continents. This removes many of the complexities and capacity limitations associated with setting up network connections to -- cloud service and enables enterprise customers to take full advantage of the cloud.  We're very excited about the benefits that Equinix Cloud Exchange offer our customers and its potential to strengthen an -- robust ecosystem of cloud and network service providers, delivering services to enterprises. We believe our position as the world's leading interconnection company underpinned by our strong ecosystem of 975 networks, 450 cloud service providers across more than 100 IBXs makes us uniquely qualified to be the home of the interconnected cloud. So let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Keith D. Taylor : Thanks, Steve and good afternoon to everyone. So let me get right into today starting with our bookings. We had a strong growth in net bookings quarter in each of our regions. Better than our expectations and the Americas delivered it's high export bookings activity on record reflecting the importance of our global platform. Also we delivered against both our revenue and EBITDA objectives. More specifically interconnection revenues continue to outpace overall revenue growth increasing by 15% over the prior year with very healthy gross additions for both our cross connect and exchange port offerings.  On a particular note exchange ports added in the quarter doubled across each of our three regions driven by network, content and social media customers. We continue to expect MRR per cabinet yields to remain steady allowing us to meet our targeted operating objectives and financial returns. Now looking at slide 8 from our presentation posted today. Global Q1 revenues increased to $580.1 million a 3% increase over the prior quarter and up 12% over the same quarter last year. Our Q1 revenue performance reflects that $2.5 million negative currency effect when compared to the average rates used in Q4. And a $400,000 negative currency effect when compared to our FX guidance rates. It's important to note that our FX hedges that we set against the Euro, Pound and Swiss Franc exposure offset the positive FX rate that you may have seen this past quarter by $1.1 million. Non-recurring revenues increased 14% quarter-over-quarter as we continue to provide customer sales orders and installation activities for our customers slightly greater than our expectations. We expect the custom sales order and installation activity to remain at a higher level for the rest of the year. Total cash cost of revenues were consistent with our expectations and cash SG&A expenses increased to $135.4 million for the quarter including approximately $10 million of REIT-related cash costs.  Total adjusted EBITDA was $260.4 million above the top end of our guidance range although down 1% over the prior quarter primarily due to fluctuations in salaries and benefits and anticipated higher REIT -- costs. Our adjusted EBITDA was 45%, our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance reflects a negative $1.6 million currency hit when compared to the average rates used in Q4 and a $700,000 negative impact when compared to our FX guidance rates. MRR churn was consistent with our expectations at 2.3%. As we noted last quarter we expect our Q2 MRR churn to increase. Our current estimate for the quarter is approximately 3%. This increase is solely attributed to the LinkedIn churn as they bifurcate a portion of their infrastructure at the end of Q2.  Given the LinkedIn churn will occur at the end of Q2 the MRR churn will be recognized in Q2 but the revenue impact will be felt in Q3. As mentioned last quarter this MRR churn has been fully contemplated in or 2014 guidance. For the full year 2014 we expect MRR churn to average approximately 2.5% per quarter therefore we expect lower churn in the second half of the year.  Now moving on to our comments on our REIT. We continue to progress with our plans to convert to REIT on January 1, 2015. While we're still awaiting a response from the IRS on our PR request we do not expect to delay to this time frame. On slide 9 we summarized the various expected REIT-related cash cost and taxes. In the second quarter we expect to incur approximately $11 million in REIT-related cash cost. For the year our estimated cash tax liability is now expected to range between $145 million and $200 million.  Turning to slide 10. I'd like to start reviewing our regional results beginning with the Americas. The Americas region delivered solid regional gross booking and exported a record level of activity to the other two regions. A testament -- to the success of our global footprint and service offering. Consistent with our expectations the Americas revenues increased 2% over the prior quarter and up 9% over the same quarter last year on a constant currency basis.  Moving to the Americas adjusted EBITDA but first a reminder. The Americas region continues to be fully burned with the corporate functions including corporate projects such as REIT conversion and -- customer one. Given this Americas adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis was down 6% over the prior quarter and up 5% year-over-year. Americas adjusted EBITDA margin was 45% for the quarter.  The sequential decline in adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to the partial reversal of our 2013 corporate bonus approved in Q4 and the -- reset in Q1 as-well-as higher than typical utilities expense due to the harsh winter across many parts of the U.S. We expect the Americas adjusted EBITDA margin to trend back to our Q4, 2013 level effectively 49% as we progress through the year. Americas net billing cabinets decreased by 100 in the quarter -- due to timing of customer installation and cabinet churn a similar phenomenon to what we experienced a year ago. While our MRR per cabinet remains steady at very attractive levels. Americas added 800 net cross connections in the quarter slightly lower due to our suite migration in our New York -- asset located in 111 8th avenue.  Absence of one-time events in the quarter Americas cross connect adds were above the four prior quarter trends. Equally important we added 106 exchange ports in the quarter which is more than we added in all of 2013 driven by demand from content network providers reflecting the competitive differentiation we have with our Equinix exchanges. Interconnection revenues as a percent of the regions recurring revenues increased over 20%. Now looking at EMEA please turn to slide 11. EMEA revenues on a normalized and constant currency basis were up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 19% year-over-year and reflect strong performance particularly in the UK and Netherlands as large multi and cross regional deals continue to benefit the region. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 4% over the prior quarter and up 24% over the same quarter last year.  Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 42% despite a number of one-off adjustments booked in the quarter. Absent these adjustments EMEA adjusted EBITDA would have been 44%. EMEA interconnect revenues increased 9% over the prior quarter and up 36% over the same quarter last year largely driven by the UK market to provide us our large increase in exchange port and fixed antenna service offerings. We added 1,300 net cross connections in the quarter and net cabinets billing increased by approximately 800.  We continue to expand in Europe progressing with our next phase in Amsterdam - . Located in -- Amsterdam -- is one of the world's most modern locations and designed to new standards and sustainability.  And now looking at Asia Pacific please refer to slide 12. Asia Pacific revenues were $98.6 million. Revenues on a constant currency basis increased 7% over the prior quarter and up 15% over the same quarter last year, driven by strength in our content cloud and network segments.  Adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis was up 10% over the last quarter and up 6% over the same quarter last year. MRR per cabinet on a constant currency basis remained strong and cabinets billing increased by 900 compared to the prior quarter. We added a record 1,500 net cross connects in the quarter and interconnection revenues remained at 12% of the region's recurring revenues. In 2014 we are expanding across all seven Asia Pacific metros which include the recently opened phases In Tokyo and Sydney. For new builds we are proceeding with the second phase of our new IBX in Osaka driven by strong interest from the cloud and content customers as well as expanding in Singapore with an additional bay in Singapore too.  And now looking at the balance sheet please refer to slide 13. We ended the quarter with over $1 billion in unrestricted cash and investments on our balance sheet. Our current liquidity position continues to remain healthy. Our net debt leverage ratio increased slightly to 3.1 times our Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA.  We also repurchased 732,000 shares for $127 million of Equinix stock through last Friday. Our stock repurchase program has offset at least in part this year is attributed to the convertible debt exchange agreement we entered into last week.  Now switching to slide 14. Q1 operating cash flow increased over the prior quarter to $171.7 million. Even though our DSOs increased to 33 days in the quarter, a trend we expect to reverse in Q2. For 2014, we continue to expect adjusted discretionary free cash flow, excluding REIT-related cash costs and taxes ranged between $620 million and $650 million and adjusted free cash flow to be greater than $200 million.  Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to slide 15. For the quarter capital expenditures were $105.9 million including ongoing CapEx of $44.9 million, below our current guidance due to timing of cash payments. We opened four new IDX phases in the first quarter including Dallas 6, which is a new build. We now currently have 12 announced expansion projects underway across the globe of which 10 are campus builds or incremental phase builds.  At this point let me turn the call back to Steve. Stephen M. Smith: Okay, thanks Keith. Let me now shift gears and cover our outlook for 2014 on slide 16. For the second quarter of 2014 we expect revenues to be in the range of $594 to $598 million. Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68% to 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to range between a $135 million and a $139 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $267 million and $273 million, which includes the $11 million in costs related to the REIT conversion.  Capital expenditures are expected to be $165 million to $175 million, including $60 million of ongoing capital expenditures. For the full year of 2014 we are raising revenue to be greater than $2.395 billion or greater than 11% year-over-year growth, which includes $7 million of positive foreign currency benefit compared to our Q1 guidance range.  Total year cash gross margins are expected to be 69%, cash SG&A expenses are expected to range between $530 million and $550 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be greater than $1.105 billion which includes $3 million of positive foreign currency benefit compared to our Q1 guidance range and also includes $37 million in cost related to our REIT conversion efforts.  We expect 2014 capital expenditures to range between $550 million and $650 million, including approximately $200 million of ongoing capital expenditures. So in closing we are off to a strong start in 2014 and are well positioned to deliver profitable growth while continuing to invest and innovate to fully realize the benefits of our global interconnection platform. We sit at the heart of the rapidly evolving digital economy and are the only data center company that brings together an extensive global footprint in the existing relationships with thousands of network, cloud, constant and enterprise customers.  Hybrid cloud is emerging as the clear IT architecture of choice for service providers and enterprises alike and we see this as a unique opportunity to capitalize on our market leadership. We will continue to invest in this opportunity by building next generation interconnection solutions and building a robust cloud eco-system that will meaningfully increase the inherent long term value of the business.  So let me stop here an open it up for questions. Rachel I'll turn it back over to you. Operator : Okay. And our first question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Please sir you have an open line. Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research : Thanks. Two questions. First if you could just go through the sales force and the size and the productivity and just -- areas of strength. And then I am looking at the sources of weakness within it. And then as well I'll just follow-up -- to the second question, please. Stephen M. Smith:  Okay. Mike I'll start out and we can pile on here. So generally speaking from a sales and bookings productivity standpoints. There is good steady state productivity and as you guys that we've said in the past quarters the ramp is bi-vertical. But we do have a high level of competitiveness going on particularly we're staying very disciplined in our deal reviews as you guys see in our MRR per cabinet results.  We do still believe there is upside as our reps continue to mature and we get better at our offerings that we're expanding as we talked about today we become more adept at -- the enterprise and as the cloud unfolds. So I think the team believes there is still more upside for the reps around the world. So overall there is a lot of positive momentum from our exit rate in fourth quarter and certainly the good start we had here in this quarter.  We haven't talked a lot about this but Charles has probably reported this we're augmenting our direct sales force which is around 220 to your specific question, Mike to-date -- heads in the direct sales engine. We starting to augment that with an indirect channel that we're starting to sell through and with platform partners and resellers as-well-as working with some referral partners to help generate new leads. There is a lot of activity going on both the direct and indirect front that total headcount on -- heads will probably go towards 240 maybe up to 250 as you think about full year into the year. So as Keith mentioned in his script we had very good results first quarter across the three regions. Actually in Americas they have the gross bookings since Q4 of '12 and as he said they had very good export bookings. And actually in the other two regions we exceeded both our growth in net bookings planned. So really good results in the quarter pipeline healthy, coverage ratios look good, conversion rates are up. So generally speaking sales engine is doing very well. Keith D. Taylor:  Yeah, Mike Charles had said to your question about performance across verticals. Good consistent performance again both regionally and vertically. I think particular strength as we've noted in the script and associated with the cloud opportunity and continuing the scale. Enterprise as we had said in the past little longer sales cycle we're really seeing some significant lighthouse wins continuing to see those and beginning to ramp and implement those in ways that are delivering the benefit to customers which we now intend to kind of repackage in the case study to push back out through both our direct channel and our partner channel that we think will accelerate that opportunity. Pretty good solid performance across the verticals and across the regions and again really strong performance from a global perspective. Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research : And let me just follow-up with the second question. On the REIT side you said there wasn't an uptick on the PLR but have you learned anything new from your advisor or the process, is there any further details on timing or expectations that you may have that you could share with us this evening? Stephen M. Smith : Well not allowed Mike but as Keith said in his script we're full speed ahead with all the system and process work to drive us towards that conversion of January 1, 2015. So as all of your probably saw over the last couple of weeks there was a good news with -- and CBS -- getting -- launch. And so with PLR starting to be issued that obviously is good to see that -- broken. But we don't have any specific update other than the IRS has informed us that it's actively working our PLR request and will respond in due course. So we don't expect as mentioned in the script any delay in the ruling on our PLR and we're full speed ahead towards 1-1-15. Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research : Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan [inaudible]. Okay, sir you have an open line. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Thanks for taking the question. Steve, I thought you did a great job of laying out sort of the density of the cloud platform that you are pulling together and how it could attract enterprises. We are hearing more and more about sort of the similar types of approaches from other folks and it seems like everyday somebody announces a connection to the platform or connection to AWS, and so I was wondering if maybe you could give us a little bit more perspective in terms of why somebody would be drawn to your cloud platform versus some of the others and then in terms of how you go in and get to the customers. Is this an outgoing call or is this sort of a responsive call in terms of putting out the offer to customers.  And then I did have one detail question, just to make sure I understand the linked in churn, it looks like it's about the bumped churn by 50 bps relative to MRR or the recurring revenue base, it's $2.5 million or $3 million worth of impact in the third quarter. Thanks. Charles J. Meyers: Yeah, I'll start with the front part relative to the cloud opportunity, agreed there is a lot of energy in the market, I think that people are -- lot of enterprises looking to capture the benefits of the cloud and I think there are a lot of people chasing after that. But what is very clear is that hybrid cloud has emerged as the IT architecture of choice.  And I think specifically to your question as to how -- what we do is differentiated the reality is that in order to capture those benefits the geographical reach of our platform the network density of the platform, the cloud density that already exists inside our centers with the 1,200 plus cloud service providers and 450 plus pure play cloud providers represent a very unique value proposition in terms of being to access that cloud density, to be able to get to the right network providers across the globe that are needed to generate the global reach that these customers need, to reach their end users. So I think it's a very differentiated opportunity.  In terms of the go to market there is probably a ways we will go to market today, a strong focus on continuing to direct basis go after the light house accounts that we think are going to be the thought leaders in the industry and are really going to drive through incremental demand from others who are looking to follow their lead. So that's happening on a direct basis. And we do that both direct and from an outside and an inside perspective. So there is calling activity that we marry up with our field force for an inside outside type of approach which is pretty common in this type of go-to-market design.  And then we are beginning to ramp the channel and there are a lot of companies out there that have extensive reach into the enterprise and as we make these offers like network performance and cloud exchange more channel ready we will push those into those partners and there's simply no way that we are going to achieve the market penetration that we want in terms of reaching enterprises with 230 odd quota bearing heads across the globe and so ramping that channel up and putting the offers into the hands of partners is going to be credible.  So that is the first part now I will let Steve or Keith take over. Stephen M. Smith: I'd add Jon to the question to what Charles said, I think he had it dead on but I'd add that one of the differentiators of the fact that we have an exchange platform deployed in 20 markets, almost 20 markets today. So other people are talking about building something, we are extending and enhancing our current Ethernet exchange fabric to just address this multi-cloud, multi-network feature requirement that we are starting to see.  So we are going to drive to a higher level of interoperability, we are going to have portals, we are going to have self-provisioning, we are going to have API development, so there is a lot of development going on underneath the requirements that we are getting from these big announcements that we are making. So the Verizon and the AT&Ts and the Microsoft and AWS requirements are driving us to develop a much higher level of capability that just doesn't exist in the market.  So I would tell you there is real differentiation because there is real capability out there today that we are just enhancing that doesn't exist with many of the other competitors. So Keith if you want to add\u2026 Keith D. Taylor: And Jon then on the linked in just to give you a perspective, so in Q2 is going to add roughly 70 bps to the churn. So absent linked-on our churn would be roughly 2.3%. At least that's our estimate for this quarter. And so on an average basis for the year it would take the average from 2.5% per quarter as I said to roughly 2.3% per quarter. From a revenue perspective\u2026 Unidentified Analyst : That's really helpful, thank you. Stephen M. Smith:  Okay. Good. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Sir you have an open line. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : Hi. Great. Actually I had two somewhat similar questions. As it relates to the cloud exchange is that technologically than your Internet or Ethernet exchanges or something out there that is just a rebranding effort. And then as part of that are you considering actually connecting your facilities not just within a region which I think you already did but actually from region-to-region to potentially have more of a distributed network architecture that some of those enterprises might want.  And then as it relates to LinkedIn and Keith sounds like you're going to say something out but I'd love to hear what that was but also just from a metrics perspective I was wondering if you could kind of us give us a sense how many cabs or cross connects we should think about so you can properly model this into our models? Thanks. Stephen M. Smith: Yeah Colby I'll start and let others jump as well. The absolutely the cloud -- represents an incremental technology investment on our part and much more than expansion or rebranding. As Steve indicated essentially we're building off of the existing Ethernet and Internet exchanges by beginning to integrate those exchanges and have invest significantly in terms of ATI development to really allow for interoperability automated provisioning, circuit provisioning on a realtime basis et cetera.  So there is a lot of investment that goes in well beyond what we've in the Ethernet exchange platform. So we're excited about that and there are actually future extensions of the technology that we will look forward to sharing at our Analyst Day in June that will give you a better picture of things. So very exciting and now we're getting really great response from our customers already. Charles J. Meyers: And Colby on the second part of your question. I was going to mention just dealing with the revenue aspect of LinkedIn, so as I said this is really going to affect us in Q3 not really much in Q2. So the impact of losing that piece of the business is roughly $4 million for the quarter and the Q3 quarter. Then on a range as it relates to sort of the cabinets think of it in the order of magnitude of sort of 500 to 600 cabinets but they were dense cabinets. And so when you look at it on a pricing basis it's relatively rich MRR for cabinet number over that 500 to 600 cabinets.  Now all those 500 to 600 cabinets I'd tell you that we've already ear marked replacement customers for all those cabinets, they have not billing yet, they have been identified and allotted the capacity but we've not yet provisioned or sold them out -- contraction. And again those are very high -- dense cabinets that we had deployed in LinkedIn. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : And any cross connected impact on it that we should think about it? Charles J. Meyers: To be quite open typically when you see a deployment of that magnitude is very typical to see much density from a cross connect perspective. There is certainly going to be some cross connect but if the on the margin inches it's not going to move in any direction. Stephen M. Smith: Yeah that's right, it's empowered ends but not air connection done. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : Great. Thank you. Stephen M. Smith: I did miss one piece of your question Colby relative to connectivity inter region connectivity. All I'd say is that I think we actively are looking at how we continue to deliver connectivity between our assets in a way that's responsive to the customer need. And so obviously we look at that more or so at a metro level first and then within the region. But what we want to be able to do is make sure that as companies deploy with us on a global basis which by the way the script talked about 86 of our top 100 customers deployed across an average of 10 metros globally. That means that what they want to do is deploy in a place that fits best with their needs but be able to gain access to the services, cloud service providers, networks et cetera that they need more globally. So that's going to require us to continue to assess our connectivity in our interconnection portfolio. But our initial focus is more on the metro and within the region. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from Mr. David Barden of Bank of America. Sir you have an open line. David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey guys. Thanks. So Keith I guess my first question is just on the guidance typically is but if I look at the midpoint of the second quarter revenue guidance and I added to the first quarter and then I subtracted from the full year guidance. The implication is that the third and fourth quarters will grow revenue assuming no currency changes about 15 million per quarter. Last year you had currency headwinds that were fairly strong and you grew revenue each quarter in the second half 18 million on average.  Are there any reasons to believe that your ability to generate revenue the second half of this year is currency neutral less than your ability to generate revenue in the second half of last year on a sequential basis? And then the second question if I could just kind of I know if touched on it couple every times. But I think may be Steve or Keith just generally speaking if you kind of looked for the soft spot and result it was North American cross connect slows down MRR is flat down on tiny amount the billable cabinets went down. And it just looks like basically North America didn\u2019t grow in the first quarter. So kind of can you read this that it is growing and that it will grow and little support kind of giving to your guidance for the year? Thanks. Keith D. Taylor:  Sure. So let me take the first part and David then I think Charles will step in and talk a bit about America that we can plan on accordingly. I think it's first it's important to know that when we strip or way all that sort of one else in the currency in Q1 we originally guided to roughly 2.1% at this point of guidance in Q1 2.1% growth rate coming at Q1 when you adjust for currency you adjust for sort of one of nature of you may have some custom fills order worked in the first quarter. We really adjust we grew by 2.6% , so when I think that and that includes the midpoint of that a Q2 guidance being 596 million.  When I adjust for currency I take out the impact of the Q1 custom sales orders recognize we\u2019ll get some we still get some in Q2. We are going to go back to roughly by 2.7% that leads me than to grow we are going to go for the rest of the year and more to your point what\u2019s your question. Clear there is a couple of things number one we increased our guidance and then reflect to three things. Number one our currency was working on a favorite for $2 million to $7 million as you know. Secondly we had not paid in our performance in Q1 and so we took that to the bank in addition we had a three incremental million dollars per quarter for the later three quarters of our guidance period year. They give you $50 million and then commit for guidance this quarter. I want to note though we said this is going to be greater than 2395.  And so when you draw the relationship to how we are going to perform this year versus last year we are deploying if you will the same strategy we think we can do better than that with the one point that I want to make. When you think about the latter half of the year the second half of the year guidance it is going to be impacted by the link insured in it is going to happen one tail school. We get -the entire Q2 quarter of LinkedIn revenue but we will lose that benefits starting at the beginning of Q3 and so you feel that impact very much like Asia Pacific did with the large content -- that last time Q1 of last year so they sort of separate through that one.  So my general pointing is that we feel good about 23 then 2395 I think it reflects an opportunity to continue see some upper growth in the back half of the year despite what I\u2019ve just said. Charles J. Meyers: Yeah this is Charles I\u2019ll take the question relative to the North American business. What I would say is that essentially if you look at the metric in the three you mentioned specifically are on cash billing cross connect adds and yields of cabinets. I think you are seeing a confluence of events that impact the measures and it really doesn\u2019t reflect I think the health in trajectory the business overall. We are pretty we are very comfortable it is continuing to grow yield continues to be at very attractive levels. Casual filing as you see if you look at the external metrics tracking to see it's we had the same kind of phenomena a year ago where we had a debt of about an almost identical and debt of about a 100 cabinets.  And as we\u2019ve said that and have said a number of time it's really a matter of the timing of installs and timing of turn that really make that metric a bit more valuable. So it's not something that we believe is a cause for concern, there is probably some effect there associated with some strategic wins that we\u2019ve had towards the end of last year and in Q1 that are probably on slightly longer ramps that affects our book to bill a bit but again we don\u2019t see it as a fundamental degradation of the house and format in trajectory of the business. I mean relative to cross connect adds also very much a series of kind of one-time events, some known grooming that occurred and then specifically as we mentioned us having to move out of the suite in the now Google owned 1-11/A, which is a very inner connection dense facility and required a lot of migrations of customers to different suites, a process that is ongoing but if you take out those one-time events we are actually above the fourth quarter trend on cross connects for the Americas and again feel very good about that.  And you add to that our court volume which has accelerated extremely well over the last couple of quarters and we feel like there is a strength to the business there particularly on the interconnection side continues to be very good. Bookings were solid for the regional bookings and extremely strong for the exports. So again we are seeing good overall production from the team and we expect the Americas business to continue to be competitive and perform well. David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Okay, our next question comes from Mr. Gray Powell of Wells Fargo. Sir, you have an open line. Gray Powell - Wells Fargo : Great, thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple if I may. So on the passage you guys have put up some very good cloud customer case studies, like Four Square and Box. I am curious, do you see an increase in pace of demand from companies that grow up on the AWS, hit a certain maturity level and then co-locate with Equinix to improve performance. And then without getting too customer specific, how big can a cloud customer's deployment with you be, relative to their total infrastructure needs? Stephen M. Smith: Why don't -- I will take the first cut at that and then you guys can jump in. Absolutely we see a trend towards customers that are attracted early on to the sort of variable costs trying to ramp the time to market benefit that public cloud implementation can offer. But typically those that begin to scale rapidly find two things, one that the economics of public cloud at a certain utilization levels begin to become sort of burdensome and substantially less attractive than going with full [pay model] and putting their own infrastructure in place.  And number two they struggle with the customization requirements or their ability to customize and respond to the evolution of their application in a public cloud environment. As a result almost inevitably what they move to is a hybrid cloud environment. They leverage, they continue to leverage the public cloud particularly for university type workloads or efforts where they are unsure about the growth or performance of an application and they often started out in public cloud and then move into a hybrid cloud environment. So that's absolutely something that we see. We expected that trend will continue. And then relative to the size of the deployment it is -- I would say in fact we commented that our average size deployment in Equinix is coming down. And that is because people generally are going to one, even within a colocation or an owned infrastructure environment are moving to multi-tiered architectures and they would typically put their network nodes and their service nodes which are, where they need the network density application performance et cetera inside of Equinix facilities and then may locate larger footprints implementations elsewhere where they can get substantially more aggressive rates.  And then you combine that with moving beyond multi-tiered architectures into true hybrid cloud. And I would say that we are going to see more sort of small to mid-size implementations but we are going to see a couple of factors that go with that. One they are going to be multi-metro, multi-region and as we said that is very frequently 8, 10, 12, 15 locations globally, number one and number two they tend to be more inter-connection dense and therefore perform better from a yield per cabinet basis.  And so that's really the essence of our strategy that improves customer retention. It is really the strategy that we believe is going to allow us to continue to mitigate churn and grow both the top line and the bottom line. Gray Powell - Wells Fargo : Got it, that's all. Charles J. Meyers: Greg, I'd add one point to that, obviously I can't share with you our top customer activity but if you just look inside our top 10 customers half of those customers today are almost pure cloud type workload deployments and it's just -- and it's going to get bigger and bigger. So if you worry about EPS and how big can these deployments get about names of customers some of this -- from our biggest customers is almost peer related work load. So it is really shifting. Gray Powell - Wells Fargo : Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks. Just a modeling question if I may. So if look at your footnotes and just back out great OpEx in 2013 and 2014 EBITDA guidance. Margins last year would have been just over 47% yet the footnote saying they guide for 2014 implies 48%, should we think about that a 48% as sort of a starting point when looking out into 2015? Stephen M. Smith: I agree as we said on last call we actually we see ourselves -- back of the year we should be getting up to this sort of that level of margin. Recognizing obviously would -- two major programs by that point. I am just -- how the costs are going to fall in 2015 is probably a little bit premature but certainly gives you a pretty good indication of what we think we can do entering 2015. And so I feel pretty good about that level of guidance. Gray Powell - Wells Fargo : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from Mr. Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Sir you have an open line. Frank Louthan IV - Raymond James : Great. Thank you. On the bookings can you quantify and give us an idea of kind of where they have been trending and where the upside was. And then looking at some of the non-recurring revenue a little bit higher and we're looking for it does that imply a kind of better growth from installed maybe later in the quarter that we should expect some revenue from how should we think about that trend? Charles J. Meyers: Yeah -- I think we saw as I said earlier our bookings performance was pretty consistent. So it wasn't like we had pockets of weakness in particular really saw good pocket of strengthens we did see a continuation of the trend in terms of strength on the cloud side and we saw solid performance across the regions as Steve indicated. And again without giving detail we don't normally give we would just simply say that we delivered against our internal targets and felt very good about the bookings quarter overall.  And from an MRR perspective yeah we absolutely are seeing an interesting trend which is we've become we've tried to focus very much and saying look how can we meet the install requirements in some of the other custom -- requirements of our customers. As a way not only to capture that revenue but as a way to be a more holistic trusted advisor to those customers. And so we see it very much as win-win it is incremental revenue process but a less attractive margin than our normal MRR but nonetheless very strong from a contribution perspective and something that continues -- some improve our account position with the customers overall. So as we said it seems to be going very, very well and we see that continuing throughout calendar year. Stephen M. Smith: If I could just add. I'd say that two regions that sort of benefited the most was the Americas roughly $- million of net benefit in the quarter that we recognized 50% of that would be I am sorry $1 million of that would have been in the Americas and roughly $2 million in Asia Pacific related to more specifically to Singapore environment. So that's where the sort of the $3 million uplifts had come. Again as Charles alluded to we tend to get lower margins on that type of business but it is very attractive business to us and that's reflected in our results. Frank Louthan IV - Raymond James : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from Mr. Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Sir you have an open line. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Company: Hi. Thanks guys. Two questions from me. Steve you alluded to the environment is really intense. Is the intensity increasing or do you think it will sort of decline a little bit what are you seeing from the open Ethernet exchanges -- at this point? And then I just want to follow-up on the cloud. Stephen M. Smith: Could you repeat the first part of that question I didn't. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Company: Oh, sorry. Is the competitive intensity increasing or decreasing at this point has it peeked or you think it's the supply that's kind of hitting the market is that slowing down at this point? Stephen M. Smith: Well certainly varies by region. We're significantly advantaged as you heard us talk about -- global requirement -- consistency. But the competitive intensity is heavy it's heavy in Europe, it's heavy in a metro certainly it's been more capacity that's come on board last two, three, four years. And so yeah we're competing for pretty much everything. But where you see a requirement, require multiple metro and multiple region types of port we start to find ourselves in significantly advantage. But I mean you have to go market by market to give you the competitive intensity texture it really varies market by market. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Company: Well then this is inverse or is it fairly stable. Stephen M. Smith: Probably stable I think the big -- tab in the last couple of years and is predominantly wholesale and I think we talked about that as expensively over last several quarters around the larger footprints there is much more wholesale capacity out there. But the type of retail network mutual global capacity that we bring on to the market still has put us in a very, very good position for the type work we need mission critical global footprint connectivity type issues are I think we are still in a big advantage there. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Company: Thanks and then as sort of hope on clouds much for that looks like great opportunity. Two questions there one do you think there are going to be dozens of different cloud providers are going to want to connect to this exchange you know everyone talks about the top two or three. But what you are seeing out there from others? And secondly IEE and bunch of others are trying to work on cloud standards kind of standardize storage and then processing definitions to make things more interoperable. And are you going to try that will enable more standardization and more if your operability is it really just more focused on the network connectivity? Thanks. Stephen M. Smith: Well Charles now take a quick at that. So on the standards certainly one of the requirements we are seeing out there is a requirement for common interfaces to drive the interoperability as you referred to it. So there is a clear opportunity for us with our cloud exchange to simply that interface for customers coming in with very complex requirements and we will do that to elute it to the earlier question that came out. And so yes there is there will be standardization driven not much different then we saw thirty years ago we went from mainframe to many and then we went to client serve and then we went to the desktop.  The next shift is cloud as a -- shift and there is going to be standards in common interfaces and methodologies and all kinds of things that are typical with the technology -on ships so yes and we will help associate that. Charles J. Meyers: Yeah and like to hit on two other portions of your question. One I don\u2019t there will be dozens I think there will be a 100\u2019s cloud service providers in fact there are already as we said we have 450 plus service providers in our environment today. And the number of them they will in the evolution of our technology platform which you get we will share further in June is that we are going to have we are going to integrate them in a way that is going to allow access to all of those post to be after participate in the exchange. And if you look at even us as a relatively modest size air price we already today access over 40 cloud service providers and use them as part of our overall IT infrastructure be our own hybrid cloud.  And so we have talked to customers' larger enterprise customers global multinationals to literally count the number of product service providers they are already using in the 100s. So we think it's well beyond that and will be a multi 100s of providers that are involved and even a much larger number of participants. And then the other thing that you mentioned briefly but I talked about that with at some link in the last call entering some of the reasons as why we feel very comfortable with our position there. And I guess what I would say is we continue to feel like we are highly differentiated. And if you look at the results in terms of the port volumes that we are driving through the pipeline I think the results are really big for them in terms of the competitiveness of that platform. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Company: Thank you. Operator : Okay. And our next question comes from Mr. Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Sir you have an open line. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets : Thank you. So I do want to ask what\u2019s driving the growth and exchange force is the customer profits is changing is the pricing driven are you repackaging the products and lot of it's predates to your cloud exchange announcement from this mornings. I am just interested in kind of the some of the moving parts there round the mix shifts. And then you had some bills leadership transitions in Germany and at China and I look I you kind of give us an update on what\u2019s happening in those markets. Stephen M. Smith: Always -- I\u2019ll talk first relative to the Open IX not to the RIX force in that momentum there. Its combination factors really I think it's one the continued growth of the number of testing\u2019s on that and the value prepositions that delivers to those customers. And as we have said before we continuously asses the pricing and of our products in the market and so there has been some adjustments pricing allows us to continue to be extremely competitive and I think just overall those are probably the key factors that have really driven that. And I think there is a demand side in fact some demand side factors as well which is some of the evolution over the top and other things that are driving interconnection and connectivity requirements for both our actually just increasing the appetite for IT traffic exchange. And so there is a demand side phenomena we're meeting that up with continued investment in the platform as-well-as ensuring that we remain competitive from a price standpoint and that's really serving us well. Charles J. Meyers: And on the second question particularly in Germany. We have a whole new team we're very stabilized in that market now we have new leadership country management level sales operations and in the finance part of the organization. So jobs \u2013 on that front I think this leadership team here has high expectations that, that business will get back on track record that what we've experienced in past years. So we're very stabilized there, very impressed with the new leadership team and it's heading in the right direction and had a very good quarter.  And then you asked about Shanghai we did put a new leader in Shanghai and he is just getting started but high hopes and \u2013 the executive growth in that market we're starting to see in the MNC activity pickup and we're actually starting to find some business in the local market there which was unexpected. So I think we have also high expectations that we will continue to scale that business. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets : Thank you. Operator : Okay. Our final question comes from Mr. Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Sir you have an open line. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley : Great. Thanks a lot. Thanks for fitting me in. You talked about the BATS win again, can you give just give us some sense of what's that in Q1 or what's the timing and any sizing around that. And just generally on \u2013 headlines around the high frequency trading can you just drill down on your financial services segment how much is sort of electronic trading, how much is high frequency related? Thanks. Stephen M. Smith: Yeah. Let me start and Charles then you may fill in some holes. On the BATS win, Simon significant wins for us as we mentioned in the comments today. The momentum has picked up around that deployment that's happening in our \u2013 campus. And we're starting to see BATS deploy, we're starting to see a lot of activity from customers that are going to connect into that. So it's really picked up the momentum particularly in the \u2013 campus. So big, big win for us with that assets.  On the high frequency front we're in a position given that we're servicing so many different clients and as you guys know we're up over 800 financial services clients of which I think a 150 or so are due to the exchange trading venues. We're significantly advantaged here because of the multiple asset classes and geographies and trading styles that we covered today with all the different client bases. So we're not suspect to any one part of that having regulation put in. So we feel pretty good about that I think we're going to remain trading \u2013 so we're helping these companies not just take advantage of trading faster but trading smarter. That approach is definitely being successfully as we're seeing we're buffering ourselves so many downturn in any specific market instrument asset class or trading style. So we're in a good position there and the diversity of the client base is an advantage and quantitatively it's roughly 1% of our global revenue could be \u2013 as high frequency trading type on business. Very difficult to have full visibility of all the trading styles and we don't have any of them in our top 50 customer.  So it's very little impact to us at the end of day but we're working with all these companies to try to help them satisfy the requirements the regulations as they come down. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley : That helps. Thanks. Charles J. Meyers: Little more color on the timing of BATS. Well, all I'd say I give you more information then \u2013 will comfortable with the areas they are consolidation their infrastructure and they have noted that publicly. And as a result I think we're going to see sort of series of opportunities for momentum where we can continue to consolidate our parties into our ecosystem. And so we're seeing that now in sort of the first wave very have had some great wins already, the funnel is building nicely. And again it's one of the factors contributing to our confidence about the remainder of the year and our to the adjustment of our guidance. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley : Thank you. Katrina Rymill :  Thank you. That concludes our Q1 call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

In the interest of wrapping this call in an hour, we'd like to ask the analyst to limit any follow-on questions to just one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Stephen Smith : Thank you, Katrina. And good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. In Q2 we delivered both revenue and adjusted EBITDA above the top-end of our guidance ranges, as the disciplined execution of our strategy continues to drive momentum in our business. As depicted on Slide 3, revenues were $605 million, up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 14% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $275 million for the quarter, up 6% over the prior quarter. We achieved record bookings and delivered positive fundamentals, including firm MRR per cabinet, stabilized churn and healthy operating margins, reflecting the strength of Platform Equinix. Interconnection revenue continue to outpace overall revenue, growing 16% year-over-year with cross connect growth driven across all verticals. With a strong focus on real-time applications, customers are taking advantage of a myriad of interconnection options we offer, to achieve higher levels of performance and enhance end-user experience. In the quarter, we added 3,600 cross connects and 153 ports, and we now have over 135,000 cross connects and 2,400 ports connecting our customers with their customers and their partners. With over 100 data centers in 15 countries, our geographic footprint is unmatched and remains a unique differentiator, as we deliver on increasing demand for a consistent global offer. Multi-region deployments continue to outpace single-region deployments, and are often associated with lower churn. Today, 66% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple regions, up from 62% last year and 80% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple metros, up from 78% last year. Last week, we acquired the remaining minority interest in ALOG Data Centers for approximately $225 million, demonstrating our commitment to Latin America and our optimism about the future growth of this important market. Turning to Slide 4. Equinix entered Brazil in early 2011, by acquiring a 53% majority stake in ALOG. ALOG is the leading carrier-neutral provider in Brazil, with approximately 1,500 customers across four data centers in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Since the initial investment, the ALOG business has exceeded our expectations and has grown revenue at a 24% CAGR for the past three years on a constant currency basis, while simultaneously expanding adjusted EBITDA margins over 500 basis points. The ALOG team has done an outstanding job, leveraging the company's strengths in Brazil, specifically in cloud and mobility, and has benefited from many Equinix customers expanding their infrastructure into Brazil, including CenturyLink Technology Solutions, Level 3, Microsoft, Orange Business Services and Telef\u00f3nica, to mention a few. Latin America is an important market for us and we expect continued investment in this region. Now, let me shift to an update on industry verticals. Secular and technology trends are making Equinix increasingly relevant to a larger universe of businesses, with over 4,600 customers, we are expanding and developing new ecosystems. This quarter, we passed a major milestone of having over 1,000 networks accessible on Platform Equinix. This network density combined with over 1,200 cloud and IT service providers is at the heart of value creation for our company. The network vertical continues to deliver consistent growth, as we expand the wireline and wireless carriers, who are evolving to deliver cloud services and upgrading their infrastructure to 100-gig to support continued bandwidth demand. In the financial services vertical, we continue to leverage our strong relationships in this market, establishing our leadership with trading exchanges, while also penetrating new sectors like electronic payments and insurance. This quarter, new wins include a leading global insurance broker, as well as Llyods of London, the world the world's specialist insurance market. In the electronic trading sector growth continues, particularly in New York, London and Chicago, and financial represents our largest connected ecosystem outside of network. We see continued growth opportunity in this sector, as the digital transformation of trading moves to other asset classes, like foreign currencies and fixed income. In the content/digital media area, AD-IX ecosystem continues to grow, with over 100 customers participating in real-time, bid-based digital advertising, converging into eight geographic hubs worldwide. Other areas of the digital media domain are experiencing growth, ranging from established broadcasters, the new streaming platforms related to the explosion of IP video traffic, and we remain focused on developing ecosystems where Platform Equinix delivers unique value to this industry./ Tuning now to cloud. Well, cloud and IT service delivered record bookings and rapid revenue growth at 19% year-over-year. Cloud wins accounted for a-third of new customers, including wins from Clear Gov a government certified, cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service provider; Digital Ocean, a cloud hosting service; and VeloCloud, cloud wide-area network provider. In this segment, we see many companies deploying in multiple regions, including both emerging cloud service providers and leading providers, such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. During the quarter, cloud players including Oracle, Workday, and Marketo expanded into additional global markets to capture the performance and user experience, benefits of customer proximity. This is creating a diverse inventory of providers across all regions, making Equinix even more attractive for these enterprises adopting cloud services. Private interconnection is an increasingly popular access methodology for connecting to the cloud, as public IP proves insufficient for the performance of security demands of mission-critical applications. There is a growing recognition that cloud application performance and user experience can be enhanced by connecting privately to cloud services and bypassing the public internet. Today, we offer private access to both fiber cross-connects and our Ethernet-based Cloud Exchange to over 50 cloud service providers, including AWS, Blue Box, Datapipe, GoGrid, IBM SoftLayer, Lucera and Microsoft Azure. The Equinix Cloud Exchange are advanced interconnection solution that enables on-demand direct access to multiple clouds and multiple networks is now live in 17 markets globally. The physical presence of key cloud service provider nodes in these markets offers customers the ability to access these services via single-port interface inside an Equinix IBX with low-latency and enhanced security. This is an important differentiator for us as customers began moving workloads in and out of the cloud. We are seeing rapid adoption of the Cloud Exchange from leading cloud, network and managed service providers and recently announced exchanged participants including Carpathia, EMC, Level 3, NetApp, Orange and TW Telecom. Shifting now to enterprise. This segment is increasingly looking at distributed architectures as a mechanism for improved to cloud resources as well as the ability to improve the performance of their owned-IT infrastructure. As a result, we see enterprises moving certain application at a private data centers and into co-location facilities on a worldwide basis. Launched earlier this year, the Equinix Performance Hub is an offering that extends enterprise IT infrastructure to the data center, allowing customers to create a private wide area network node inside Equinix, where they can host applications closer to end-users, optimize the network architectures and directly connect the multiple cloud and network providers. Locating performance-sensitive elements of enterprise IT infrastructure inside Equinix creates the ability to accelerate application delivery and network performance and improve the end-users experience. Often incorporated into a Performance Hub architecture is the Cloud Exchange, which further simplifies how enterprises manage connections between public cloud service and private cloud infrastructure, allowing on-demand interconnection to multiple cloud providers using one connection. We are helping customers design and deploy these new architectures through Solution Architects and are also leveraging our Solution Validation Centers to run proof-of-concept test for many large enterprise companies. Test results show that enterprises on average save over 25% on network bandwidth cost with a Performance Hub implementation. With the added benefit of being able to securely transfer data from the backbone network to cloud providers available in our data centers. We now have over 50 customers with Performance Hub deployment, and while still very early in the stages of adoption, we continue to land marquee accounts, including recent wins with Cerner, a leading provider for healthcare industry and MICROS Systems, a software and hardware solutions provider for the hospitality industry. So let me stop there and turn the call over to Keith, who'll go through some results in the quarter. Keith Taylor : Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone. I'd like to start my section of the call by saying how pleased we are with the performance of the business, both for the current quarter and year-to-date. The Equinix platform strategy is clearly going through to our operating results, driving strong growth with healthy returns. In the quarter, we experienced a number of record, related to our bookings activity, reflecting momentum in the business including the highest ever quarterly gross bookings for the company. Record bookings for both EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions, record bookings in our cloud and IT services vertical. Also, the Americas region delivered its second highest gross bookings production of all time, including strong exports for the other two regions, demonstrating continued importance of our global offering. Moving on to Slide 5 from our presentation posted today. Our global Q2 revenues increased to $605.2 million, a 4% increase over the prior quarter and up 14% over the same quarter last year. Our Q2 revenue performance reflects a $2 million positive currency effect when we compare to the average rates used in Q1, and a $1.1 million positive currency benefit when compared to the FX guidance rates. Our FX hedges offset the benefit of the positive currency rates by $1.8 million. Non-recurring revenues increased 2% quarter-over-quarter, higher than our expectations driven by our continued focus on selling incremental value-added services to our customers, such as custom installation work. In addition, in the quarter we received $3 million in early termination fees. These payments were reported in non-recurring revenues, they're typically one-time in nature. Interconnection revenues continue to outpace the overall revenue growth, increasing 16% over the prior year, as our comprehensive suite of interconnection solutions continues to drive healthy gross additions for both cross connects and exchange ports. Separately, given the lengthening of the average life of our customer installations. What we see is a positive trend, we lengthened the period by which we amortize our deferred installation revenue from four years to four-and-a-half years, effective at the beginning of the second quarter. This resulted in a $1.8 million negative impact to our Q2 revenues and EBITDA, and a $5.3 million decrease to our expected 2014 guidance. This reduction is a timing difference and the offsetting benefit will be recognized in 2015 and beyond. This change is fully absorbed in our revised guidance. Total cash cost of revenues were consistent with our expectations, and cash SG&A expenses increased to $139 million for the quarter, including approximately $9 million of REIT-related cash costs. Total adjusted EBITDA was $275 million, above the top-end of our guidance range and up 6% over the prior quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 45%. Our Q2 adjusted EBITDA performance reflects a $900,000 positive currency benefit when compared to the average rates used in Q1 and a $600,000 positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates. Our Q2 net income was $11.3 million, including the loss and debt extinguishment of $51.2 million related to the convertible debt exchanges this quarter. Excluding this loss, our pro forma net income would have been $49.3 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.94, a 15% increase over the prior quarter and up 9% over our pro forma diluted earnings per share last year. MRR churn was better than our expectations at 2.7%. This result includes the full impact of the LinkedIn churn that occurred at the end of Q2. As stated in our prior earnings call, the LinkedIn MRR churn had no meaningful impact in our Q2 revenues, but will reduce Q3 recurring revenues by $4 million. This has been fully contemplated in our guidance. We expect churn to decrease to 2.5% in Q3, and for the full year of 2014, we expect MRR churn to average approximately 2.5% per quarter. Now moving on to our comments on REIT. We remain in active dialogue with IRS about our pending PLR request, and are pleased with current momentum. Also we continue to be on track with our plans to convert to REIT on January 1, 2015, and recently finished a major milestone with the completion of our financial system conversion earlier this month. On Slide 6, we summarized various expected REIT-related cash cost and taxes. For the full year 2014, we now expect to incur approximately $35 million of cash cost and $18 million of capital expenditures on the REIT conversion. In the third quarter, we expect to incur approximately $8 million in REIT-related cash costs. For the year, our estimated cash tax liability is now expected to range between $145 million and $180 million. Well, turning to Slide 7, I'd like to start reviewing the regional results, beginning with the Americas. Americas revenues increased 4% over the prior quarter and 10% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Americas adjusted EBITDA was up 6% over the prior quarter and 4% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. As a reminder, the Americas region continues to be fully burdened with corporate functions, including cost of the corporate projects such as REIT conversion and Equinix Customer One. Americas adjusted EBITDA margin was 46% for the quarter. As announced last week, we're acquiring the remaining minority interest in ALOG for approximately $225 million. As a reminder, we already fully consolidate ALOG in our financial results. Americas net cabinets billing increased by 100 in the quarter, which includes the full impact from the LinkedIn churn. Americas added 1,400 net cross connects this quarter, 6% above the prior four quarter trend. We also added 85 exchange ports in the quarter, a significant uptick compared to 2013, driven by demand from content and network providers. MRR per cabinet remains firm at very attractive levels. And while up 1% quarter-over-quarter, we expect this metric to remain stable going forward. Interconnection revenues as a percent of the regions recurring revenues remained at over 20%. For new builds, we're proceeding with a third phase of our SV5 IBX build in Silicon Valley. This campus has one of two major peering locations in Silicon Valley and has had strong demand from both, network, cloud and content companies, resulting in attractive returns and firm pricing. Now looking at EMEA, please turn to Slide 8. EMEA revenues on a normalized and constant currency basis were up 4% quarter-over-quarter and up 15% year-over-year, and reflect strong performance in our Dutch and German businesses as well as an increase in the level of cross-regional deals for cloud. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 4% over the prior quarter and up 22% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin remains at 42%, due to a number of one-off adjustments booked in the quarter. Absent these adjustments, EMEA adjusted EBITDA would have been 44%. EMEA interconnection revenues increased 8% over the prior quarter and up 39% over the same quarter last year, largely driven by the U.K. and German markets. We added 1,200 net cross connections in the quarter and net cabinets billing increased by approximately 900. Interconnection revenues as a percent of the regions recurring revenues increased to over 8%. In addition to our expansion activity in London and Amsterdam, we're now moving forward with the next phase of our Paris 4 asset. With over 200 networks in Paris, this phased expansion will develop our position with cloud, network and enterprise customers. Now looking at Asia-Pacific, please refer to Slide 9. In Asia-Pacific, we passed an important milestone by generating over $100 million of revenues in the quarter. For Q2, revenues were $105.7 million, a 6% increase on a normalized and constant currency basis over the prior quarter and up 22% over the same quarter last year, driven by strength in our content and cloud segments. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 8% over the last quarter and 24% over the same quarter last year. Asia-Pacific added 67 new customers in Q2, 20% above the rolling four quarter average. MRR per cabinet remained strong and cabinets billing increased by 1,000 over the prior quarter. We added 1,000 net cross connects and interconnection revenues remained at 12% of the regions recurring revenues. And now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to Slide 10. We ended the quarter with $704 million of unrestricted cash and investments on our balance sheet, a decrease over the prior quarter level, primarily due to our share repurchase program and debt extinguishment activities. Also in July, we funded the $225 million to purchase the minority interest in ALOG, which will further reduce our cash balance. Our net debt leverage ratio decreased slightly to 2.9x our Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA. Under the share repurchase program, we repurchased 1.8 million shares since last December, including 1.5 million shares in 2014 to date. Our repurchase investment totaled $347 million, leaving a $153 million of capacity under our program. In the second half of the year, we plan to continue to evaluate additional opportunities to optimize our capital structure. Now, switching to Slide 11. Our Q2 operating cash flow decreased over the prior quarter to $99 million, primarily due to tax payments of $75 million related to both REIT and non-REIT related obligations, and $54 million of accelerated vendor payments due to our financial system conversion. We expect this offsetting benefit to be realized in Q3. Also our DSOs increased to 35 days, a trend we expect to reverse over the next few quarters. For 2014, we're raising our guidance for AFFO to be greater than $740 million, due to increased expectations from adjusted EBITDA and lowering recurring CapEx. As a reminder, AFFO includes $35 million of REIT-related operating cost in 2014 and $9 million of cost related to the FX Customer One program. In 2015, we expect our ongoing REIT-related cost to decrease to a range of $5 million to $10 million. We continue to expect our 2014 adjusted discretionary free cash flow to range between $620 million and $650 million, and adjusted free cash flow to be greater than $200 million, both of these metrics excluding any REIT-related cash cost or taxes. And now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to Slide 12. For the quarter our capital expenditures were $160 million, including recurring capital expenditures of $27 million, in line with our prior guidance. We opened two new IBX phases in Hong Kong and Sao Paulo in the quarter. We currently have 12 announced expansion projects underway across the globe, of which 10 are campus builds or incremental phase builds. As announced at our Analyst Day, we revised the breakout of our ongoing capital expenditures to align with our AFFO calculation, and now refer to this component of AFFO with recurring CapEx. Slide 13, maps out the details of both recurring and expansion CapEx, which we believe more appropriately reflect the true reinvestments and maintenance rate of the business. Since Analyst Day, we made some minor adjustments to our AFFO, slightly reducing recurring CapEx to reflect certain capital dollars, either increase revenue or reduce our cost. We will continue to review the components of AFFO, including recurring CapEx, through our reconversion date of January 1, 2015. And finally, turning to Slide 14. The operating performance of our stabilized CC9 global IBX and expansion projects that have been open for more than one year continue to perform well with revenues increasing 7% on a year-over-year basis. Currently these projects are 81% utilized and generate a 32% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested consistent with our targeted range of 30% to 40%. Now, let me turn the call back to Steve. Stephen Smith : Thanks Keith. Let me now cover our outlook for 2014 on Slide 15. For the third quarter of 2014, we expect revenues to be in the range of $614 to $618 million. Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68% to 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $140 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $278 million and $282 million, which includes $8 million in costs related to the REIT conversion. Capital expenditures are expected to be $175 million to $185 million, which includes approximately $25 million of recurring capital expenditures. For the full year of 2014, we are raising revenue to range between $2.425 billion and $2.435 billion or a 13% year-over-year growth rate, which includes $6.5 million of positive foreign currency benefit compared to our Q2 guidance range. As a reminder, this guidance includes a $5 million decrease to both revenue and adjusted EBITDA, due to the change in accounting estimate. This is a non-cash change-only and result of a longer estimated life for customer installations. Total year cash gross margins are expected to range between 68% to 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $550 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.105 billion and $1.115 billion, which includes $3 million of positive foreign currency benefit, compared to our Q2 guidance range, and also includes $35 million in cost related to our REIT conversion efforts. We expect 2014 capital expenditures to range between $600 million and $650 million, which includes approximately $115 million of recurring capital expenditures. So in closing, I would tell you that discipline execution of our strategy continues to drive positive results and solid momentum in our business. Innovation, including customer-enablement solutions like Performance Hub and Equinix Cloud Exchange is further differentiating us from our competitors. Our strategic priorities are focused on preserving and enhancing our competitive strengths. And we have the operating scale and financial strength to capitalize on our unique position to become the home of the interconnected cloud. So let me stop here and open it up for questions. And Rachel, I'll turn it back over to you. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Mr. Michael Rollins. Michael Rollins - Citigroup: If I could ask one clarification and more of the business related question. On the clarification, for the FX for the third quarter, what would be the potential benefit in the guidance, not relative to prior guidance, but relative to the average second quarter rate. And then I'll follow-up with the business question. Keith Taylor : That's $1.5 million, Michael. Michael Rollins - Citigroup: And then just taking a step back, if you could talk a little bit more about the cloud initiatives and the enterprise focus? And since the Analyst Day, you're seeing incremental progress, and is that contributing to some of the strength in sales productivity? Charles Meyers : Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Mike. It's Charles. Yes, I think that we certainly have seen incremental progress. Obviously, we're on steep part of the curve in terms of the advancement of our enterprise business, as well as, the overall dynamics of the cloud business in our industry overall and for us. And we continue to be very excited about how the cloud opportunity is playing out. What we've seen, as we talked about at the Analyst Day, that really hybrid cloud has emerged as, I think pretty unequivocally the IT architecture of choice. And what we're seeing is, virtually, every CIO we speak with, whether that'd be service provider or enterprise, are saying that they plan to segment their workloads and utilize really a blend of public cloud, private cloud, owned infrastructure, et cetera, to really meet for what is a pretty wide range of cost reliability, security, performance requirements, et cetera. And as they are moving away from sort of traditional homogenous infrastructures in their own data centers, they're really moving towards sort of a more modern cloud-based architecture and that is inherently multi-network, multi-cloud in nature. And the other thing that's happening is that they are increasingly finding the private access to cloud resources are going to be required in order to satisfy the performance and security requirements. So we talked a little bit about that in the script in terms of really to architecting around the public internet and finding that that doesn't meet their needs. It's certainly does for some workloads, but for many that's not the case. And so I think again, we are building off a heritage where similar to what we did in the evolution of internet pairing where there was no neutral, trusted, commercially set scalable mechanism available, that same dynamic result occurs now in the cloud environment. And we think Cloud Exchange really sort of meets that need. And so we are seeing great momentum. I think that it's still early days, as we said in the script, we've seen a number of big marquee sort of lighthouse wins over the last several quarters. We're beginning to build, both our professional services and our channel capabilities to be more responsive to certain large complex enterprise needs. And where we're seeing those winds, I wouldn't say an area of major contributor from a bookings perspective at this point. But we did see strength across the board in our other verticals and in our more mature ecosystems, which sort of combined into what we obviously feel like is a very strong and solid performance for the quarter. Stephen Smith : The only thing I think I'd add, Charles, and I don't know if you mentioned it was that, I think we pointed to in the script, Mike, is that we're live in 17 markets globally today. And we'll push that to probably over 20 markets by the end of the year. So we've got interest coming from several customers to expand it to Sao Paulo to Osaka, to Melbourne two of our new sites, as well as in Zurich, which wasn't considered in the original 16 or 17. So the demand is good. The pipeline is very large. And so we're working through all the challenges and requirements from our customers to make sure that we customize as much possible to get the implementation set up, but it's got a lot of momentum. Charles Meyers : And maybe another data point in order to be mentioned in the script 50 cloud service providers that are available via private access mechanisms, either Direct Connect or through the Cloud Exchange. And we've got pretty concentrated business effort underway to stimulate that ecosystem. And in the same way, we have made a pretty good living by differentiating ourselves on network density. We're seeing the same thing sort of repeat itself on the cloud side. And so we've got a big backlog of customers that we're trying to bring on to the Cloud Exchange and scale our interpretability efforts. And we already have enterprise customers that have joined the Exchange and already demonstrated the automated provisioning functionality of Cloud Exchange. So very exciting progress, and we're very pleased with it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. David Barden. David Barden - Bank of America : I guess two, if I could. The first one would be just putting a little flesh on the bones on ALOG purchase. We're all seeing the $225 million go out the investing cash flows. Could you talk about the valuation difference between what you bought it for, what you think it's worth now, and kind of what we're going to see happen on the cash flow statement as a benefit for that $225 million going off out the door. And then second, just on the North America cabinets billing, I think that it's been a noisy number. Last quarter we had the Level 3 cleanup. We had the Switch and Data lease expiration in the 111 8th Avenue. This quarter we've got LinkedIn. Could you talk about kind of an underlying core business momentum in the North American market that we can think about as being kind of the trend line for the second half of the year? That would be super helpful? Stephen Smith : Great questions, Dave. So let me take the first one on ALOG. As you know, we paid $225 million for the remaining 47%, put that in perspective for the first 53% we paid roughly $60 million. So to give you a perspective of sort of the value that accreted into business over the three years, since we became involved in the deal. And from a valuation perspective think of it as, we basically bought it for roughly our current trading multiple today, albeit with a much higher growth trajectory. And so I see that as the very positive transaction, not only for ourselves, but certainly for our partners. And then release the financials, I think that you will see is you see of course the $225 million cash flow statement but we already fully consolidate this asset. And so what you're going to see on a go forward basis, is basically as a company you'll get a full benefit now, if you will, from the cash flow, but it's not going to have any meaningful changes to our financial statement. Charles Meyers : This is Charles. I'll take the Americas business, particularly North American business. In a nutshell I'd say, we're very pleased with the momentum in progress of the business in North America. I think that as you said, it is in fact the MRR per cabinet earning about -- the billing cabinet is in fact a noisy number. And we would continue to caution you in that way that that it tends to bounce around a little bit based on timing of the install and other factors of large deals. And so we will probably continue to see some of that volatility. But again, I think if we look at it over a longer period of time, we see a solid upward trend, and we believe we'll continue to see that. And I think again, it's based on momentum across a range of portions of the business. We are seeing lower average deal sizes, as we talked about in terms of multi-tiered architectures, et cetera. This quarter we did actually see a number of larger implementations associated with some cloud wins, which was partially fueling some of the bookings strength that we saw. But across the board, the verticals are performing well, funnel continues to grow, interconnection activity at record levels, and again I think that's driving strong yield numbers. We are, as we talked about, at a very, very attractive level of yield in the Americas. And I think we would hope to continue to sustain those levels. But again, I think overall we're seeing solid momentum and good performance in the Americas business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley : Just touching on CapEx a little bit, it moved at sort of towards the higher end of the range. Is that reflecting some spend on Silicon Valley and Paris, the new expansions, or is that mostly 2015 spend, any color around that? And then on M&A, did you do anything on the land or facilities purchases during the quarter? Where does that stand today? And any thoughts about entering new markets beyond your current footprint? Keith Taylor : Why don't I take the first question, Simon, just on CapEx. Certainly, we have announced some incremental builds that are taking place. At the start of the year we look at -- again, CapEx is reported on a cash basis. We looked at a range of $550 million to $650 million. Now, that we're getting to the latter part of the year, we've been able to tighten that range, because we have a much better idea of what cash is going to flow-in and flow-out of the system, if you will, in the fiscal period. So part of it just really tightening it. But to suggest though, that we have decided to make some incremental investments as you alluded to. And Paris is the one that that comes at the forefront there, where we're going to spend a little bit of incremental capital to build out the next phase of our Paris 4 asset. And then Silicon Valley, again that asset is going to be build out over a period of time, both 2014 and 2015. So the majority of that investment will be made -- sorry, the majority of cash outflow will be made in 2015. Stephen Smith : On your M&A question, Simon, no real change in the historic representation about where we're looking in expanding the platform. It's predominantly in Asia and Europe. I would tell you in the U.S. market, domestic U.S., where we feel like we're in very good shape. As I alluded to in the script, I think in Latin America, I think as Karl Strohmeyer and his team continues to advance our strategy down there, there maybe more opportunity in the future in that part of the Americas business. But in Asia probably, it presents the biggest opportunity to go deeper into China, continue to stare at India. Korea continues to be an interesting market to watch. So no real change on the big markets that we're looking at in terms of M&A geographic orientation. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley : And any opportunities to buy any of your facilities? Charles Meyers : Simon, we continue to look at the opportunities, and as I sort of talked about at the Analyst Day, we're going to look at them sort of just based on what presents itself over a period of time. And I'd tell you, it doesn't always make sense for us, because we do have the economic control over many of our assets for an extended period of time. And to the extent something does present itself, we will look at it. And so there's a few things that are on the table, but there is nothing that's sort of worthy of announcement at this point. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co.: Two questions, if I may. One on growth, just kind of going back to your Analyst Day when you put out the guidance long-term for I think greater than the markets growth of 10%, and then I compare that with increase that you've given today to your revenue growth and what that implies. I'm just going back to conversation I remember having with Steve about how, if the cloud actually played out the way you guys expected, you thought that could actually lead to an acceleration in growth. And I'm just curious if you think that you're seeing ultimately that 10% guidance that you gave was really meant just to be floor more than anything else. And then also for Keith, just specific to a comment you made in your script, where you noted that you're also looking at other ways to optimize the capital structure. I was wondering if you could expand on that and perhaps give a timeframe for what it is you're thinking about? Stephen Smith : Why don't I start on the cloud question, Colby, or on the growth question? I would tell you, yes, the way we represented ourselves at Analyst Day was that to grow at or above market growth rate was in that high-single digit, call it low-double digit growth at the industry. We wanted to be at or above that growth rate. I think what you are starting to see now in the raised guidance is the cloud-enabled enterprise starting to play itself out. So we are, as Charles alluded to, we are dead in the middle of all the public private hybrid cloud players in the market, trying to get them to come in, and put access nodes, network nodes, all over these data centers to attract enterprise to come in. It's very early days, as Charles said. But there really isn't a deal in our pipeline that's not affiliated with how do I figure out how to start taking advantage of the cloud. And so it's unfolding, the on ramps are building, the off ramps are building, and I would call it the guidance predominantly behind our cloud-enabled activities to attract enterprises and the big cloud players themselves. I don't know if you want to answer that. Charles? Charles Meyers : No. Again, I think the posture that we articulated at Analyst Day remains intact that that is a level that we felt we could be comfortable with, without taking any kind of undue assumptions about the magnitude and timing of certain trends that we are seeing begin to take shape play out. And are we optimistic about that? Do we see early sign of success? Are we getting light house wins? Yes. For example, reflected in behind that success we're investing, as Keith articulated in making accelerated investment in our channels, which is in the second half of the year here to prepare for what we see as continued success in '15. And we certainly hope and believe that that may have the opportunity to invigorate growth in the business. But I think that our posture remains the same as it was in Analyst Day. We're being appropriately prudent in terms of what we're committing out there, and like again, seeing very good times. Keith Taylor : The second part of question was around the capital structure. I think there was a number of levers that the company will continue to look at to optimize capital structure. Number one, we saw the $153 million left in our share repurchase program. We will opportunistically look at what and when to buy incremental shares as those opportunities present themselves. That would be one. Number two, we'll continue to occur convertible instruments. But one of the things we've been trying to do with our converts is get them into the equity base, partly due to the fact that there's dilutive aspects to what occurs, if you don't get it into the equity base in a timely fashion, and sort of we're very, very pleased with the historical transactions that we've done. As we have offset, I mean the amount of dilution that would otherwise have happen. So we'll continue to look at our convergence. And again, asses whether it probably makes sense, again the deal where we're focused on is going to be a net present value positive transaction for us, and we're going to drive more AFFO with the system. And is it in fact a good economic decision, both for ourselves and presumably the people that are sitting on the other side of the table from us. And then the third piece plays, as I said, cash balance was $704 million, but when you take out the $225 million for the ALOG acquisition, you're at some $500 million of cash. And then we obviously have some payments to make through the latter part of the year, whether it's the E&P Purge or other tax payments. And so we're going to be very mindful of our cash balance. So the team is quietly looking at how to capitalize the business on go-forward basis. And one of the things that we would sort of somewhat communicate the market to already is we'll look for straight debt. We said if there is a debt transaction that would make sense, and we need to raise capital and will certainly be active in the market. But there is no urgency. I think by the end of the year just give you -- I think, if you will, we'll probably end the year somewhere between all else being equal between $300 million and $400 million of cash on our balance sheet. And so we're still on a very sort of comfortable position from a liquidity perspective, particularly in the operating line of credit. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Mike McCormack. Mike McCormack - Jefferies: I was thinking, it would be impossible that Windstream got a PLR before you guys did. A couple of questions, just thinking about I guess pricing and competition. But with respect to your various customer segments, can you just make a comment on sensitivity to pricing across those segments? And then secondly, just maybe some comment regarding the wholesale side, what you're seeing from their entry into retail as well as any Open-IX initiatives? Charles Meyers : Mike, this is Charles. I'll take that. I think pricing is often times -- although, there are probably some segments that has certain characteristic relative to their appetite for quality, reliability and service delivery and end-user experience that maybe less price sensitive on overall basis. And really I think the way we look it more typically is around applications and workloads. In that, where customers really value sort of the network density, performance benefits, global reach and mission critical reliability, et cetera that Equinix delivers. That's where we see quite rational decision on their part and willingness to sort of pay for the value that they get. And so again, I think there are probably some segments of the market that have greater levels of price sensitivity certainly. But what they have typically done in that is looked to tier their architectures as a way to meet their needs at lower cost. And that's one of the dynamics that we've seen impact the business. I think we are well ahead of that trend now in terms of understanding what application types are really going to work and really extract value or leverage the value that Equinix delivers. And in terms of from a competitive perspective, wholesale, as I've said, again and again for the most part, wholesalers play in a different level, in a different portion of the market. The wholesale, the large footprint portions wholesale are really going after that third-tier of the architecture. And very often, we are working with customers to combine purchase decisions they made for wholesale footprint with more mission critical, performance-sensitive elements of the architecture that are housing side of Equinix. And one of the things our Solution Architecture's doing are helping them develop those multi-tiered architectures and helping them develop them in a way that they can really leverage the benefits of hybrid cloud. And relative to Open-IX, again I went into some depth in that last couple of earnings calls. And we're not seeing any meaningful impact in our business. We continue to feel very good about the value proposition we deliver to our customers on our exchange. And I think the port adds that we've had and the acceleration of those port additions this year, really I think are a reflection of the competitiveness of our offering in the market. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Amir Rozwadowski. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital : From my side, I wanted to ask specifically about sort of the churn levels. I think they came in slightly better than expected. I would love to hear your thoughts in terms of how we should expect that trajectory going forward? I mean you folks continue to have gained notable traction in some of the international markets. I was wondering with respect to Europe, do you continue to see some capacity constrained in that market? I would love to hear your thoughts around competitive dynamics within that region? Charles Meyers : Maybe I'll take the first one, Steve, and you can pick up on Europe. From a churn perspective, again, we did come in slightly better than what we had guided to last quarter. And we did absorb the full LinkedIn into that number. So we saw a slight uptick, but not as much as we had anticipated. Some of that is probably timing. And as is often the case, some times the specific timing of churn isn't really precisely known and things can slip from one quarter into the next. And then probably some churn that we anticipate it could occur that we found a way commercially that we thought was attractable to maintain that business. But I think that generally, the 2.5% that we've guided to is an area that we feel comfortable in, as we've referred to it sort of a level of frictional churn that accommodate some of the realities in the market. Because as we said, there are continued and natural evolutions of people's infrastructure that they make towards more multi-tiered, sophisticated infrastructures, and that often does result in a level of turning in migration out of Equinix in some cases. Since 2.5% is a level that we're pretty comfortable with, we are happy with the performance this quarter. We probably did see some deferrals, but again that's probably the level that we're comfortable with, but always working to improve that. And I think the important piece is, as we've always said, getting the right business in the door upfront is our best defense against elevated churn down the road, and our teams are doing a great job of disciplined execution in the field. Stephen Smith : Thanks, Charles. And I think on the European question, I would tell you that our team in Europe tells and continues to signal that the economy remains challenged. But even within that environment, just in this quarter, as Keith alluded to, we had record bookings in EMEA, and we exceeded all our internal targets, very strong performance in the Netherlands and Germany. And as you know, a differentiator we have versus our competitors is we're inbounding a lot of bookings from our Americas and Asia business into that region. So there is an advantage, obviously that our team has from our global bookings. Interconnection is up to 8% of revenue now, so they're doing a very good job on that. I think we're separating ourselves from our competition with the Cloud Exchange that we've launched in those European markets. Pipeline looks very good, coverage ratios look good, cloud ecosystem is unfolding and our footprint in Europe. So MRR per cap this quarter was up $24. So there is a lot of positive signals in Europe this quarter versus the competition. So I would say there is any big change, it's still a very competitive market with the players that you're well aware of. But we're continuing to scale and build the core of our ecosystem strategy there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets : So a financial question and then a cloud question. On the guidance hit in the flow-through to EBITDA, the higher revenue guide, what would impede some of the margin expansion that you're guiding to? You referenced the REIT conversion cost, the one-time projects, is there anything else that is impeding some of the EBITDA margin growth? And then, in terms of cloud connectivity demand overall as a category, just manifest itself as is cloud existent [Technical Difficulty] traction, does that manifest itself more in exchange port growth or cloud connect growth? Keith Taylor : Jonathan, we're going to do two things here. I can answer the first question, but we're going to have to ask you to repeat the second question, because your line had broken up in proportionally. So we didn't get the full question. But as it relates to the guidance and takes the flow-through from revenue to EBITDA, whether you're looking at Q3 or for the total year, there is a number of things that are going on. And certainly, as I alluded to in my comments, first and foremost there is $3 million of early termination fee payments. One was up $2 million payment to one customer. So as those things don't typically recur on a very regular basis, and so we lose the benefit of that in Q3 and certainly that's one thing that affects the flow-through. The second thing that's impacting us is the deferred installation adjustment that I spoke of and Steve alluded to. Again, when we make those type of adjustments, it doesn't do anything to cash flow, but has a direct drop from the revenue line all the way down to EBITDA line, and as we said there is $5.3 million of hit to the year with respect to that. If I summarize it, well, the things there that are changing that you should -- if I take out the noise and I normalize everything, the one thing that I would tell you, there is two incremental cost that are coming into the system that we hadn't previously guided to. And one of them is higher utility. So normally from a volume perspective, so you see our revenues coming up and we're consuming more. And as a result, we're going to incur higher utilities than we originally anticipated and some of that is pricing. And I think of that for the year at roughly $4 million. And the other thing that we've talked about is channel. We expect to spend roughly another $3 million or expect to invest $3 million in channel in the latter half of the year, roughly $1 million in Q3 and $2 million in Q4. So that's $3 million of cost that we didn't originally anticipate. So when you adjust for all of that and you look at the flow-throughs, basically the numbers all work out, and work out with a consistent flow-through based on the revenue flow-through. Stephen Smith : Your question was on with the interconnection uptick that we've seen it mostly in cross connects or port or both, is that the nature of your question? Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets : Well, just cloud in general. If that continues to grow as you anticipate, does that growth manifest itself more in exchange port growth or cross connect growth? Charles Meyers : Yes. Stephen Smith : I mean, we're going to see in both. And Charles probably has a point or two. I'll you give you a couple fact away that will give you a sense of it. With the numbers I gave you in the script, we added 3,600 cross connects this quarter and 153 ports. So 3,600 cross connects, roughly 1,400 in Americas, roughly 1,300 EMEA and just under 1,000 in Asia. So you can see we've got good geographic coverage on the cross connect growth. And then there is port growth everywhere, but we have actually -- in the vicinity of 3,700 direct access cloud cross connects that have been accumulated here since we've been focused on the cloud, it gives you a kind of an order of magnitude that how much cloud density cross connects we're starting to see. But my guess, Charles, we're going to see it coming out of both channels. Charles Meyers : Absolutely. In fact, I guess what I would say is that one of the reasons why I think customers are finding Platform Equinix such a compelling platform to sort of base their hybrid cloud strategy off of, is because of the flexibility that it provides in matching workload to certain requirements. And so by implementing a performance out for example and attaching into cloud exchange, people can segment their workloads and say, hey, look, I've got workloads that actually are well-suited to putting into a public cloud environment over public internet. And by the way, they can do that very easily from within an Equinix facility and that would drive exchange ports. But increasingly over time, what we see is they're saying, look there are certain things that from a security or throughput perspective, I need something different. And so that's where our private access really portfolio comes in and they can either do that over a fiber cross connect, which we see a lot of uptick on or they now can begin to do that in an automated fashion over Cloud Exchange. And so over time it will drive Cloud Exchange ports and virtual circuit that are provisioned over that Cloud Exchange. So we expect over time that we will see that full portfolio of interconnection continue to grow, as people really play out there hybrid cloud strategy. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Partners : So I guess my first question would be on the book-to-bill or the commencement lag. I know last quarter we saw some unusual extensions. I was wondering if you give a little color on what happened in this quarter and what you're expecting for the remainder of the year. And then, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about sort of the professional services that you guys were delivering, I felt that was a very interesting part of your Analyst Day presentation. And since then we've been starting to think about how you're rolling that out, whether you're charging for it separately or has it become part of the sales process and package and whether there are any sort of longer-term margin implications? Keith Taylor : I'll take book-to-bill, Jonathan, and then I will pass the other one on to Charles or Steve. Certainly, when you look at the performance of the booking activity this past quarter, again very, very healthy bookings across our entire portfolio. And so the one thing I'll leave you with is, there is a fairly large, a lot of that happened in the third month of the quarter again. Again, even though it was maybe a more smoother quarter than was historically you've seen, we still had a lot of activity taking place in the month of June. So when I look at my book-to-bill perspective that will continue, that will feather into the system in Q3 and Q4. And so I want to give you maybe a hard point of view, when I think about incremental revenue that we'll see, and I'm adjusting for the one-off, the early termination fees, but I think about what's going to happen in Q3 relative to what happened in Q2. We're probably going to see more and more sort of organic revenue flow-through in Q3 than we saw in Q2. And likewise, as I look into Q4 versus what happens in Q2, again it's going to be up a light level from Q3 performance. All that to say is I think the book-to-bill cycle is starting to, there are some things that were in our backlog coming out of Q1, we're starting to see that relieve itself. And so I feel very good, more about a more consistent book-to-bill interval going forward. Charles Meyers : And then on pro service side, Jonathan, I'd say, still early days for us there. Today, the reality is that that we've significantly ramped our Solution Architect team, which is a bit filling that void in working with customers who we see as having significant opportunities and sort of filling in bit of that gap in terms of working with them on designing their infrastructure. And in particular, on Performance Hub implementations and helping customers understand the benefits on how to go about implementing a Performance Hub. And that's pretty typical I think of the way you would see in that sort of technology maturity cycle is, as those types of very highly technical resources doing that early on. But I think as we evolve, we would begin to envision a billable organization, billable threshold services organization delivering sort of packaged professional services type engagements to customers to very quickly assess and roll out some of those services. And over time, I think that we'll probably evolve from, we're doing those, a significant number of those with perhaps resources ourselves. And then we will actually start to engage partners, because we think we'll get a lot of leverage in the partner channel, we'll able to deliver those similar types product services. And over time that will move from sort of Performance Hub design into hybrid cloud type implementations on a broader scale, networking WAN optimization, and also continued services around data center migration. So those are all sort of areas of focus that we would have. It's still pretty early days, but we are starting to see customers really view us as a trusted advisor in looking at how to implement private hybrid cloud. Katrina Rymill : That concludes our 2Q call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Stephen M. Smith: Okay. Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. In Q3, we delivered both revenue and adjusted EBITDA above the top end of our guidance ranges despite significant currency headwinds as the global demand for Platform Equinix continues to drive our business. As depicted on Slide 3, revenues were $620.4 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 14% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $283.9 million for the quarter, up 3% over the prior quarter and up 14% year-over-year. We delivered near-record bookings fueled by solid performance in our core verticals, global expansion with key customers and accelerated momentum in the development of our cloud ecosystem. The strength of our ecosystem strategy continues to manifest itself in very healthy fundamentals, including firm MRR per cabinet, lower churn, rapid interconnection growth and healthy operating margins. Interconnection continues to be a critical differentiator and source of sustaining value for Equinix. Interconnection revenue outpaced overall revenue, growing 17% year-over-year. And the robust growth of both our established and emerging ecosystems generated a record 5,700 cross-connect adds, 36% higher than our previous record. Importantly, secure private access between cloud consumers and cloud service providers is now the fastest-growing category of interconnection at Equinix. Secular trends driving this cross-connect growth are also driving similar momentum in our leading digital exchanges. This quarter, we added 143 ports, 3x the net adds we saw on the same period last year. Strong port growth on our Internet exchanges has translated into 27% year-over-year growth in traffic to 2.8 terabits across 2,500 ports, with network content and cloud customers driving this increase. Our global platform also remains a unique differentiator and is a key driver of our bookings momentum and revenue growth. Today, 67% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple regions, up from 60% last year. And 81% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple metros, up from 78% last year. Global growth, robust interconnection and high levels of customer retention are a reflection of the disciplined execution of our ecosystem-centric strategy. From our early days, Equinix has demonstrated the ability to incubate, scale and extend digital ecosystems and continued success with this approach is driving solid performance across our industry verticals. But let me share some highlights from our vertical performance, with a particular focus on our progress in capturing the transformational cloud opportunity. Beginning with network, this ecosystem continues to be foundational to our competitive advantage and delivered steady growth in Q3 as wireline carriers actively upgrade infrastructure to deploy 100-gig services and develop their own cloud offerings. On the wireless side, as 4G networks begin to scale, mobile operators are now deploying inside Equinix in order to capture new sources of value and drive a superior customer experience in an increasingly complex mobile value chain. Mobile operators like Vodafone and China Mobile continue to expand with Equinix on our advanced peering hubs to access the wireline infrastructure and efficiently interconnect with large content players. In content and digital media, the advertising subsegment, anchored by the exchange ecosystem we refer to as Ad-IX, grew 26% year-over-year, driven by global expansions of ad exchanges, advertising networks and data aggregators such as BrightRoll, MediaMath and RadiumOne that utilize Platform Equinix to maximize revenue in the latency-sensitive world of digital ad placement. Our advertising segment is now approximately equal in size to our CDN segment and is driving healthy levels of interconnection. In the financial services vertical, we saw a healthy step-up in bookings over last quarter, driven by diversity of wins across exchanges, payments and insurance. Our win with BATS, who is consolidating the infrastructure on our Secaucus campus, is generating pull-through as additional clients migrate from competitive facilities in preparation for consolidation of the BATS matching engines inside of Equinix slated to go live in early 2015. We are also seeing growing traction in the electronic payments and mobile wallet space. Similar to what happened in the development of our electronic trading ecosystem, the business of moving money is facing pressure to process more and more transactions at a lower cost, and business models are beginning to monetize payment-related data. A new ecosystem is quickly taking shape as we bring together financial institutions, technology providers, mobile networks and retail companies pursuing these opportunities. Equinix is a trusted provider of top global payment card networks such as MasterCard, who recently expanded into Dubai with us. We are also building success with emerging technology players in this space such as iZettle, a mobile point-of-sale business, which is using the AWS Direct Connect offering. We are also leveraging our capital markets customer base to cultivate wins in the broader financial services enterprise business. Performance Hub is a core element of IT architectures in the financial enterprise as these companies seek to enhance interconnection and service delivery to support new business models. This quarter, we won a global Performance Hub deployment from one of the largest banking institutions in the world to support its online banking business. Our ability to nurture, grow and extend our more mature network financial services and content and digital media ecosystems continues to generate solid growth and drive superior returns on capital and remains a central focus. But the emergence of the cloud ecosystem represents a transformational opportunity and is our top growth vector as we move towards 2015. Cloud represents a fundamental disruption in how IT services are both delivered and consumed. And building a cloud equivalent of our network density advantage is critical to our ecosystem strategy. Equinix is shaping our customers' targeting, investment profile and go-to-market model to ensure that we can meet the needs of both cloud service providers and the broad range of enterprise customers who are rapidly adopting hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of choice. Our Cloud Exchange and the Performance Hub are key innovative offers to facilitate this new marketplace between service providers and enterprises. On the service provider side, we are actively engaged with hundreds of cloud service providers. And we are pleased with our significant progress in building out cloud provider density. We are helping these customers efficiently scale to reach their enterprise customers through integration with our Cloud Exchange, allowing for secure, private, scalable delivery of cloud services. We are the only exchange to offer an API capability that automates this provisioning for customers, which helps accelerate the onboarding process. And our product road map for the Cloud Exchange is designed to help cloud providers more easily adopt this interconnection model. These efforts have resulted in very strong cloud and IT service bookings and an uptick in larger footprint deal activity, driven by strong momentum with critical cloud magnets such as AWS, IBM's SoftLayer, Cisco, Microsoft, Oracle and Workday. We continue to grow our connectivity to a broad menu of cloud service providers and now offer private access to over 70 such providers through both fiber cross connects and the Equinix Cloud Exchange. The Cloud Exchange is enabling a new private multi-vendor cloud consumption model, and new customers announcing their commitment to participate in the Cloud Exchange include Cisco, Datapipe, Blue Box and CloudSigma. We also recently announced a unique strategic relationship with Cisco to accelerate connections between private and public clouds, and we are pleased to be a preferred Cisco data center provider. Although many cloud services are available in the market, the management and orchestration of workloads across multiple cloud and network providers is a significant barrier to wider adoption. Cisco intends to deploy intercloud-enabled capabilities in 16 Equinix data centers across Europe, Asia and the Americas. We are rapidly achieving critical mass in our cloud ecosystem. And the combination of robust direct connectivity and a rich feature set for Cloud Exchange are positioning Equinix as the home of the interconnected cloud. On the enterprise side, we are increasingly engaged with innovative CIOs who are transforming their IT architectures for today's digital world and who understand the importance of data center selection and interconnection offerings in achieving their goals. The Equinix Performance Hub, in tandem with Cloud Exchange, represents a truly compelling value proposition for enterprise customers to leverage the reach and service provider density within Platform Equinix. As IT architectures migrate to the hybrid cloud and become increasingly distributed in order to deliver high application performance and enhanced user experience, the Equinix Performance Hub serves as a key lever in enabling this transformation. Performance Hub wins this quarter include a U.S. automotive manufacturer, a global biopharmaceutical company and CDM Smith, a leading engineering and construction firm. CDM Smith is deploying Performance Hub with Cloud Exchange connections in 9 global IBX locations, leveraging a full solution created by Equinix and fulfilled together with managed services partners. This solution will allow CDM Smith to significantly optimize its private data network architecture and cost structure and enhance the performance of key applications serving their users located across 160 offices worldwide. This win is representative of the robust solution development that Equinix is bringing to enterprises, working together with key managed services and fulfillment partners. In line with these enhanced solution development efforts, we are also augmenting our go-to-market capabilities through a channel partner program designed to increase our reach and service to the enterprise. We are very pleased with our performance this quarter and remain encouraged by the strength and vitality of our ecosystem-centric strategy. Our mature verticals are operating at scale, with attractive customer acquisition costs, low churn and high levels of interconnection, which combine to drive healthy operating margins. The performance of these flywheel ecosystems allows us to invest in the emerging high-growth areas such as Ad-IX, electronic payments and most notably cloud through the intentional and disciplined targeting at larger strategic deployments that enables critical magnets to rapidly achieve global reach, and in turn, attract new participants. While others may strive to emulate our strategy, we believe that our scale, global footprint, network density and ecosystem reach give us critical advantages that position us as the long-term winner in an increasingly cloud-enabled world. So let me stop there and turn it over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Keith D. Taylor: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone. In the third quarter, we saw strong performance across all regions with near-record growth in net bookings. Our bookings activity produced record billable cabinet adds of approximately 3,400, 70% above the average 4-quarter trend. We added a phenomenal 5,700 cross connects and 143 exchange ports in the quarter. This clearly highlights the benefits of our current strategy. Also, as demonstrated by our financial results and the strength of many of our key operating metrics, our ecosystem effect not only increased our revenues but preserved the attractive yields we enjoy on a per cabinet basis. As Steve outlined, capturing the cloud and enterprise opportunity is the next phase of growth for Equinix, and we're in a unique position to lead and benefit from these market changes. To accomplish this, we need to make some investments. We need to target new and existing customers. We have to determine how to deploy our capital for new product initiatives such as Cloud Exchange and how do we augment our go-to-market efforts. We'll be making these investments alongside our key system initiatives being Equinix Customer One, which was rolled out in Asia Pacific earlier this month, in the Americas and EMEA earlier next year and our financial systems conversion to support the REIT compliance effort. So now let me move to Slide 4 from the presentation posted today. Global Q3 revenues increased to $620.4 million, a 3% increase over the prior quarter and up 14% over the same quarter last year. Our overperformance was due to higher gross bookings, continued custom sales order activity and lower-than-planned churn. For Q3, revenue performance reflects a $2.3 million negative currency impact when compared to the average rates used last quarter and a $3.7 million negative currency impact when compared to our FX guidance range. Currency volatility, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the Brazilian real, caused increased FX headwinds this quarter. We hedged our exposure for cost and favorable accounting treatment permit. Our cash flow hedges against the British pound, the euro and the Swiss franc reduced the FX volatility this quarter by $800,000. For Q4, we're approximately 75% hedged against our EMEA operating currencies. As we look to 2015, using the 2014 average FX rates, the strength in U.S. dollar is expected to create an FX revenue headwind of $40 million and an adjusted EBITDA headwind of $17 million. Compared to our prior guidance rate with -- sorry, compared to our prior guidance rates with current FX rates, the 2015 revenue impact is $65 million. Global cash cost of revenues were consistent with our expectations. And cash SG&A expenses increased $140.1 million for the quarter, including approximately $7 million of REIT-related cash costs. Global adjusted EBITDA was $283.9 million, above the top end of our guidance range and up 14% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46%. The Q3 adjusted EBITDA performance reflects a negative $1.4 million currency impact when compared to Q2 average rates and a $1.8 million negative impact when compared to our FX guidance range. Our Q3 net income was $42.8 million, which includes a substantial increase in our income tax expense, the result of a higher annual effective tax rate related to profit levels in certain jurisdictions. This higher tax impact will be mitigated upon conversion to a REIT. Diluted earnings per share was $0.79, up significantly over the prior quarter due to the Q2 loss on debt extinguishment. For Q4, as part of the process to convert to a REIT, we expect to write off the net deferred tax asset currently on our books. This charge to net income is expected to range between $330 million and $370 million, negatively affecting our earnings per share by approximately $6 per share. MRR churn was better than our expectations of 1.9%, a clear reflection of our strong deal discipline and our efforts to improve the overall attractiveness of our installed base. During the quarter, we were able to fully rebook the LinkedIn churn with key cloud and content customers, demonstrating our continued ability to manage and optimize our IBX assets. For Q4, we expect our MRR churn rate to be in the range between 2% and 2.5%. Now moving to our comments on REIT. We expect to receive a favorable PLR in 2014. And we've begun operating as a REIT from a financial perspective. In October, we declared a special distribution of $416 million to our stockholders, a key requirement prior to converting to a REIT. We expect the November 2014 distribution will pay out the entirety of our estimated pre-REIT earnings and profits. On Slide 5, we summarize the various expected REIT-related cash costs and taxes. For the full year of 2014, we now expect to incur approximately $32 million of cash costs and $21 million of capital expenditures for the REIT conversion. In 2015, we expect our ongoing REIT-related cash costs to be approximately $10 million. Now turning to Slide 6. I'd like to start reviewing the regional results, beginning with the Americas. The Americas had a strong quarter, delivering its third highest gross bookings production of all time, resulting in high fill rates and increased interconnection activity. Americas revenues increased 2% over the prior quarter and 9% over the same quarter last year. Americas adjusted EBITDA was up 1% over the prior quarter and 7% year-over-year. As a reminder, the Americas region absorbs higher seasonal utility rates in Q3, consistent with our expectation, as well as continues to be fully burdened by the cost of the corporate functions, including the corporate IT initiatives such as the REIT conversion and Equinix Customer One. Americas adjusted EBITDA margin was 46% for the quarter. Americas net billing cabinets increased by 1,500 in the quarter, one of its highest levels and added a record 2,600 net cross connects, which is double the prior 4-quarter average. We also added 101 exchange ports in Q3, a significant uptick. And we continue to see robust demand for interconnection products, particularly from content, cloud and network providers. To put this demand in perspective, over the last 4 quarters, we've added more ports than over the prior 3 years cumulatively, highlighting the strong demand for the Americas digital exchanges. MRR per cabinet remained firm at very attractive levels. And while up 1% quarter-over-quarter, we expect this metric to remain stable going forward as higher power density and increased interconnection activity offset the impact of IBX and product mix and our pursuit of selective strategic and critical cloud workloads. Interconnection revenues as a percent of the region's recurring revenues increased to 21%, a new milestone that we're very pleased with. With respect to the region's new builds, we're expanding on our Seattle 3 IBX, an important telecommunication hub with the Pacific Northwest and a distribution point for IP traffic to Asia Pacific. This build will help satisfy growing demand in the Seattle metro from cloud network and content companies. In Brazil, we're expanding our Rio de Janeiro 2 IBX to support cloud service providers and other multinational customers. We continue to expand our most strategic and interconnected campuses with an incremental phase of our DC11 assets in Ashburn. Now looking at EMEA. Please turn to Slide 7. EMEA revenues remain very healthy, up 5% quarter-over-quarter and 18% year-over-year on a normalizing constant currency basis. This reflects strong performance in our U.K., Dutch and German businesses, with particular emphasis on capturing new cloud opportunities. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalizing constant currency basis was up 10% over the prior quarter and up 20% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 43% due to higher interconnection revenues and a reduction in one-off costs compared to Q2. EMEA interconnection revenues increased 7% over the prior quarter and up 43% over the same quarter last year and now represents 9% of the region's recurring revenues. We added 1,100 net cross connects in the quarter, and EMEA MRR per cabinet was up 2% on a constant currency basis. Net cabinets billing increased by approximately 1,000. With respect to expansions, we accelerated the second phase of our Amsterdam 3 assets to respond to the increased demand from our cloud providers looking to store their critical data at this connectivity hub. Opened in October, this phase is already 20% booked from magnet cloud and content providers expanding into this European digital gateway. And now looking at Asia Pacific. Please refer to Slide 8. In Asia Pacific, revenues were $111.4 million, a 6% increase over prior quarter and up 24% over the same quarter last year on a normalizing constant currency basis, driven by strong gross bookings in cloud and IT services and network segments. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalizing constant currency basis was up 4% over last quarter and 32% over the same quarter last year. MRR per cabinet remains firm, slightly up quarter-over-quarter on a constant currency basis, and cabinets billing increased by 900 over the prior quarter. Net cross-connect addition has doubled from last quarter to a record 2,000. And interconnection revenues remained at 12% of the region's recurring revenues. We opened new IBX phases in our Osaka and Singapore markets this quarter, and we continue to expand across all our major Asian metros. In Japan, we're now moving forward with our new Tokyo 5 IBX, located adjacent to our successful Tokyo 3 IBX. This expansion will enable new customers to access our rich financial services ecosystem in Tokyo as well as support demand from cloud and content providers. And now looking at the balance sheet. Please refer to Slide 9. We ended the quarter with approximately $500 million of unrestricted cash and investments on our balance sheet, a decrease over the prior quarter level, primarily due to the purchase of our noncontrolling minority interest in ALOG. Our net debt leverage ratio increased slightly to 3.1x our Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA. Also, we settled the remainder of our 3% 2014 convertible notes in exchange for 1.6 million shares upon maturity in mid-October. Under the share repurchase program, we repurchased 43 million in Q3. As we finish out the year, we'll continue to evaluate additional opportunities to optimize our balance sheet and capital structure. Now switching to Slide 10. Our Q3 operating cash flow increased over the prior quarter to $216 million, a significant improvement over the prior quarter due to decreased tax payments related to REIT and non-REIT-related obligations and more cash interest payments. However, despite this positive trend, our DSOs increased to 39 days. As the organization continues to gain experience with our new billing system and processes, we expect this trend to reverse over the next few quarters. For 2014, we are raising our guidance for AFFO to be greater than $745 million due to increased expectations from adjusted EBITDA. And this absorbs the $5 million negative FX headwind compared to the prior FX rates. As a reminder, AFFO includes approximately $32 million of REIT-related conversion costs in 2014. We expect our 2014 adjusted discretionary free cash flow to now range between $590 million and $620 million and adjusted free cash flow to be greater than $160 million. Compared to our prior guidance, these cash flow metrics reflect changes in our working capital expectations as well as an increase in our capital expansion initiatives. And now looking at capital expenditures. Please turn to Slide 11. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $156 million, including recurring capital expenditures of $20 million, slightly below our prior guidance. We currently have 13 announced expansion projects underway across the globe, of which 11 are campus builds or incremental phase builds. And finally, turning to Slide 12. The operating performance of our stabilized 69 global IBX and expansion projects that had been open for more than 1 year continue to perform well, with revenues up 7% on a year-over-year basis. Currently, these projects generate a 31% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested and are 82% utilized. I'll turn the call back to Steve now. Stephen M. Smith: Okay. Thanks, Keith. Let me now cover our outlook for 2014 on Slide 13. For the fourth quarter of 2014, we expect revenues to be in the range of $627 million to $631 million, which absorbs $11 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to our prior guidance rates. Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68% to 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $139 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $291 million and $295 million, which includes $6 million in costs related to the REIT conversion and absorbs a negative foreign currency impact of $5 million compared to prior guidance rates. Capital expenditures are expected to be $210 million to $230 million, which includes approximately $35 million of recurring capital expenditures. For the full year of 2014, we are raising revenues to now range between $2.433 billion and $2.437 billion or a 13% year-over-year growth rate. This absorbs $15 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to prior guidance rates. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, the revised revenues range reflects a $20 million increase compared to our prior midpoint guidance. Full year cash gross margins are expected to range between 68% and 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $553 million. We are raising adjusted EBITDA to now range between $1.110 billion and $1.114 billion. This revised guidance includes $32 million in costs related to our REIT conversion efforts and absorbs $8 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to prior guidance rates. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, the revised adjusted EBITDA range reflects a $10 million increase compared to our prior midpoint guidance. We expect 2014 capital expenditures to range between $630 million and $650 million, which includes approximately $110 million of recurring capital expenditures. So in closing, we are executing our strategy of driving differentiated growth, reflected in the strong performance of our core ecosystems and record interconnection activity. We believe Equinix is the best location to access the variety of cloud services critical to managing enterprise workloads. And we continue to close strategic deals driven by the strength of new offers like Performance Hub and Cloud Exchange. Going forward, we remain focused on leveraging the advantages of our global footprint, driving both network and cloud services density and distancing ourselves from the competition through innovative products and investments in Platform Equinix. So let me stop here and open it up for questions. I'll turn it back over to you, Rachel. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Mr. David Barden of Bank of America. David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I guess a couple, if I could. Just first, Keith, I think you said you were going to maybe kind of look opportunistically at CapEx -- or capital structure and balance sheet opportunities in the fourth quarter. I believe the original intention for the stock buyback program was to complete it in 2014. I was wondering if you could kind of comment on whether that's still the intention. The second thing was just getting some questions on your assumptions that the euro and pound foreign exchange rates relative to your -- relative to spot rates are going to improve in the fourth quarter. I'm assuming that has something to do with your hedging game plan, but that'll be good to know. And then the last thing, again maybe for Steve or Keith. I think in Keith's comments, he referenced something about investments that need to be made to attack the cloud opportunity. And I was wondering if that was trying to foreshadow some kind of CapEx or operational type of expense that might be -- we need to start thinking about for 2015. Keith D. Taylor: Okay, David. So let me take the first couple, and then Charles or Steve will take the last one. I think when we look at capital structure, it's clear to me as we continue to move towards conversion to a REIT and recognizing where we may spend our capital dollars, all else being equal, given where the market is, there's still an opportune time to raise capital relatively inexpensively. And so one of the things that we've said before, to the extent that we do raise capital, particularly given that we've taken out the 2014 conversion over hopefully not too long distance, we'll take out the 2016 converts, we'll have the capacity to put more debt on the balance sheet and use it effectively. So that would be one thing that we will continue to look at. There's no commitments yet other than we are actively looking at the opportunities that are present in the marketplace. Also, I'd tell you that given the size of our revolving line of credit, that's another area that you expect us to change as we exit the year and start operating as a REIT effective 1/1/15 so that would be one other area that we would actually look at. As it relates to our share repurchase program, we have roughly 150 -- sorry, $150 million left on the program. And clearly, we will use the cash opportunistically, taking into consideration some of the other decisions that we're going to make about how to spend our capital. So clearly, that is what's spent, roughly $350 million to date. We'll continue to look at that opportunistically. As it relates to FX, a couple of things. Number one, when we look at the FX rates, particularly on the forward guidance relative to spot rate, you're absolutely right. We've had -- as I said in my prepared comments, where we can get favorable accounting treatment, that's particularly around the euro, the sterling and the Swiss franc, with the functional currency of our businesses effectively the U.S. dollar, and it is in that case, we will -- we can put hedges that actually effectively hedge against the lines in which we're trying to protect such as revenue or whether it's cost or EBITDA. So for that purpose, we have put some hedges in place. As I said, we're roughly 75% hedged for Q -- in Q4. We're less hedged as we move into 2015, but we're roughly 50% hedged in Q -- sorry, 80% hedged in Q1 and 60% hedged in Q2 of next year. Again, those rates will vary over a period of time. And I think, David, I want to leave you and certainly the rest of the investors with clearly when we put our hedging programs in place, what we're trying to do is mitigate, of course, the effect -- the volatility in currency. But over time, again, what we're -- to the extent that the euro is going to continue to trend down, what we're really doing is giving ourselves a soft landing as that currency continues to weaken, if at all. So I think we're well positioned from a hedging perspective as we look into 20 -- into Q4 and the beginning of 2015. Charles Meyers : Yes, and David, this is Charles. I'll take the last piece relative to some of the investments. As the results demonstrate, we continue to see very significant momentum in certain building the cloud ecosystem, both on the service provider side as well as sort of significant early traction on the enterprise or the buy side of the ecosystem. And we intend to continue to invest behind that momentum given that we see the cloud overall as really quite a transformational opportunity and growth opportunity for the company. So there's probably several categories in this of investment that we would be looking to incorporate into our 2015 plan and through the remainder of this year. One, on the product side, really building on the momentum of our Performance Hub and our Cloud Exchange offers to continue to add feature functions to those and make sure that those are the leading platforms from a cloud perspective in the industry, which we're very confident is the case. Secondly, on go-to-market, we're going to continue to invest in our solution architect team, which has really been critical to ensuring customers can leverage those offers to their benefit as they implement their hybrid cloud architectures as well as our -- we'll probably selectively augment the direct force in response to continued strong demand and then also continue to invest in our channel program, in our professional services capability, both of which are really designed around : one, completing whole offers by sort of adding third-party value-add to our core offers and then expanding our reach from a distribution perspective as we -- particularly as we tackle the enterprise market. And then finally, sort of targeted demand generation, again probably focused on the enterprise and really building off of our lighthouse wins, several of which we talked about in the script, and in fact, have talked about a handful of them in every script for the last several quarters. And now what we're beginning to see is a broader -- people sort of looking to those lighthouse wins and saying, \"Hey, if they're doing it, we ought to be considering it,\" and people who are implementing hybrid cloud and using Performance Hub and Cloud Exchange to do that. So we'll probably be putting money behind increased awareness and demand generation activity to build off of that momentum. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore. Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : I have a question about Open IX. A lot of the folks that I speak to, including myself, have been a little bit concerned about the development of Open IX in the U.S. And one of the things that Open IX talks about is kind of connecting its locations with a fiber ring and sort of extending its density that way, which is very much, as I understand it, the way that the London Internet Exchange works. Now you guys have been very successful across Europe, in London in particular, in terms of winning key customers. And maybe if you could give us some insight into how you compete there and how you differentiate there while sitting on that ring to give us a little bit more confidence in how you guys will defend against any sort of perceived move here in the U.S. Stephen M. Smith: Sure. Jonathan, this is Steve. I'll start and I'm sure Charles can probably supplement here. A couple of data points. First of all, after 16-plus years, we have a critical mass, as you all know, of cross connects and ports on our switch fabrics and a couple of switch fabrics now that we're deploying, one with the Internet switch fabric that's been around for a long time and more recently our cloud switch fabrics. So if you just purely look at the results that Keith mentioned in this quarter, just in the Americas, where the Open IX is -- I think the heart of your question is before we go to Europe. Just to remind you guys, we added 2,600 net cross connects just in Q3 and over 101 ports in the Americas alone. And as Keith mentioned, that -- over the last 4 quarters, we've added more ports in the U.S. than we have the prior 3 years cumulatively. So that tells you something that the value that we're delivering and the leadership position and the critical mass that we've accumulated is still advantaging us. So there's no discernible impact to Equinix really at this point. Like any competition, we are tracking it closely in the U.S. We'll continue to monitor these alternative exchanges. But our real focus is on the next generation of interconnection, advantaging our leadership position and continue to deliver a superior peering model to our customers. And I think the scale and advantage we have there is proving out in the metrics. I don't know, Charles, if you'll add anything. Maybe... Charles Meyers : Well, all I'd say is I think although the industry structure is slightly different in Europe than it is in the U.S. and Open IX is, I guess to some degree, attempting to shift some of that industry structure and introduce a dynamic that looks more like the European model, I would argue that the fundamental basis of competition on the exchange market -- or in the exchange market isn't meaningfully different across its various regions. At the end of the day, the customer is making a fundamental decision about how effectively they can peer their traffic. And they're looking at a range of options that goes from transit to private peering -- I'm sorry, to public peer to private peering. And the reality is the most effective way to do that, typically if you have -- particularly if you have large volumes of traffic, is to ensure that you can peer off traffic to the right counterparties most effectively. And when you look at the results that -- I mean, that Steve has articulated in terms of our port growth, it's very clear that customers are voting with their wallet relative to how they can do that most effectively and they're doing with Equinix. So they can move from : one, accessing transit partners; two, then peering their exchange -- their traffic over a public exchange inside the facility. And then quite importantly, when they get traffic between a counterparty to a certain level, they want to pull that off in private period over cross connect. And them being able to do that inside of an Equinix facility where we have a very high critical mass of participants is just much more effective for them. And so in the end, we feel very good about the product. We continue to invest in its future functionality. And I think if you look at our momentum compared to what limited growth and trajectory that we're seeing from Open IX participants, I think we feel very good about where we are. Stephen M. Smith: The only thing I'd add, Jonathan, is as Charles said, the traction in the U.S. is negligible. But in Europe, if you listen to our team in Europe, those 3 firms are doing well. And actually, they're growing in our facilities and we're benefiting from that. So we're -- they're getting the port growth and we're getting the colocation growth. So if you talk to Eric and his team in Europe, he's still growing on the back of the relationship that we have with all 3 of those in Europe. So the dynamics are a little different between the 2 regions. We're competing in Americas. We're working together in Europe. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I just wanted to touch on a bit of a bigger picture question here around the enterprise arena. I was wondering if you could give us a bit more color in terms of the type of traction you folks are seeing here overall in the enterprise. Clearly, it seems as though cloud-based opportunity seemed to be reaching a tipping point for you folks. But I was hoping that you could see how -- or at least get a little bit more insight on how we should think about when we should start to begin to see similar momentum on the enterprise front. Clearly, you guys have a number of partnerships, most recently with Cisco, as you mentioned on the prepared remarks. I would love to hear how these partnerships have been resonating with some of your potential customers. Stephen M. Smith: Why don't I start, Charles, and let's double team this again. I think there's a lot going on here in the enterprise. It's a good question, Amir. First of all, if you talk to any CIO or the head of applications or head of infrastructure in any company -- any enterprise company today, they're going to tell you that they're faced with a variety of disruptive forces going on. One, they've got congested network issues. They have performance and security limitations that they're challenged with. And then more recently, their user experience is becoming more social and more mobile. So most of the clients we're dealing with are pushing to rearchitect their IT to be able to access the hybrid cloud. So they're all studying. Some are further ahead than others. And they're doing that in a distributed hub architecture. So that's why you hear us, and that's why we develop a network Performance Hub, which is to address this distributed hub architecture that they're going to want to get to, to get to the -- to ultimately get to the hybrid cloud. So they're reinventing their wide area networks, their local area networks. Their workplaces are becoming virtual. Their hybrid cloud is the choice of the future. That's been validated pretty much anywhere you look or talk to. So there's a lot going on there. Now we have to get use cases built and we're doing that. You hear about that every quarter. Our approach to this is to get the cloud access nodes, the cloud service nodes, get our data centers as populated as possible with these access nodes so that enterprises can look inside of these data centers and see the cloud density and network density they need to put private workload in there to enable the hybrid cloud. They can connect private to public cloud access points and create the hybrid cloud. So there's a lot going on in the marketing function of the company to build these use cases. And as you get to an industry vertical and you get a use case started, then the rest of vertical will follow suit. So we have a lot of that going on today. Charles Meyers : Yes. I mean, just maybe a couple of things. I think that again, we're seeing very strong momentum on the service provider side of the cloud. We are getting these sort of key lighthouse wins on the enterprise side that leverage our Performance Hub offering. And interestingly actually, the momentum on the enterprise is across a range of enterprise types. We talk about enterprise distinctly from cloud, content, digital media, financial services, et cetera. But in reality, all of those companies are enterprises and they have very distinct enterprise needs. And what we've been able to do is actually to leverage our relationships with them and leverage the fact that they already use us for many of their revenue-facing applications to meet their enterprise requirements. And that is their ability to deliver distributed applications with high performance, get anything anywhere to all of their users in the enterprise, moving to a more distributed architecture that allows for the high-performance application delivery. And so those lighthouse wins are really starting to open the eyes of the broader enterprise community. And I think when we're -- so we see that momentum. And I think when we're really going to start to see it at a new level is as we ramp up our go-to-market capabilities. We have relatively small direct enterprise selling force today. We're selling across all -- our enterprise offers across all our verticals. But as we ramp the professional services in the channel, that's when I really think we're going to begin to see it contribute more meaningfully. And we've been prudent about what pace that's going to be in our planning, but we think we're excited about the investments we're making in 2015 and believe that we'll begin to see those very positively impact our numbers. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Yes. So I have a question around the interconnect. The networks are very strong, and Keith sounded very optimistic about the outlook going forward. And I just wondered how to think about that in terms of translating to gross margins starting to ramp and even margins starting to ramp. They've been fairly flat in most regions except for Asia Pac. So that's kind of my financial question. And then I wondered, we've been kind of talking around this in terms of sales headcount and solutions architect, but can you kind of quantify where you are now and what your targets are for sales force and solutions architecture? Keith D. Taylor: Good question, Jonathan. So a couple of things. Number one, yes, we are quite optimistic about what we're doing with interconnection and how we see that continue to scale, not only within the Americas but across the broader platform. So I think the benefit that you're going to see is interconnection revenues, there was roughly a 50 basis point improvement on a total company basis in interconnection revenue as a percent of our total recurring revenue this quarter. All 3 regions were up. The company therefore as a whole was up, and that's, obviously, a net positive. Equally, from a positive perspective, we are continuing to increase, if you will, the product density in some of our deployments. And both of those are driving, if you will, more profit into the system. The offsetting part of that, of course, is our product mix and also some of our IBX. And as we alluded to, we're also being very thoughtful about some of these larger cloud-based strategic footprints that we're taking. And so what offsets some of that -- some of the successes, of course, is some of those decisions we make. As Charles alluded to, I think we're being thoughtful and very prudent about the decisions we make, recognizing overall, we believe that cash gross margins are still -- we're still driving for a 70% or better cash gross margin line. And we're still driving towards a 50% or greater EBITDA line. All that said, we also want to make investments. Again, when you look at the size of the opportunity that we see out there, and again, Steve and Charles alluded to it, in a way that when you think about trying to capture that enterprise and continue to win the cloud business that exists in the marketplace, you got to scale the business. And one of the ways that we're going to scale is, of course, adapting our go-to-market strategy, looking at the channels, looking at the solution architects, looking at how we create more demand gen, investing our technology and our technology platforms behind Ihab and Brian Lillie. So for all those reasons, I would tell you that we're making great headroom -- headway and continuing to drive leverage in the business and scale and profitability. But we're taking some of that value and we're putting it into the future of our business because we think that's going to be really important as we look towards us being a much larger company than we are today. Stephen M. Smith: Sales headcount, Charles? Charles Meyers : Yes. So sales headcount, we are right now in the sort of 225-ish range globally for quota-bearing headcount. We had talked about 250 as a range that we could easily see getting to. I think we're doing that quite selectively in terms of where we see the demand there in markets or verticals that we -- where we want to make additions. So I think I can see us getting over a period of a few quarters up to that 250 type range. And then on the solution architect side, we're looking at probably adding another dozen or 2 of those over the course of the next several quarters just given the success we've seen in terms of them being able to really help our customers identify how Platform Equinix can fit in to most typically their sort of hybrid cloud architecture strategy. And so those are sort of the level of investments we're making. But importantly, I think also of note is that with the way we're going to get leverage in the long term is by also spooling up partners that can provide some of the professional service solution architect type capabilities as well as some of the sales reach from a distribution perspective. So we're looking at probably investing in the indirect side of our business from a channel program standpoint to the tune of 50 or more people in 2015. And obviously, we'll ramp that up in a disciplined fashion. But we can -- that's a big investment, a big focus area for '15. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then just real quick on the channel program, as that does start to ramp, how do we think about the margin impact on that? Does it affect either way if the channel partners do account for a bigger portion of your incremental sales? Charles Meyers : Not really. The cost of sale won't be meaningfully different, I don't think, for us in terms of the indirect. It might be, particularly in the early days as we probably look to invest in the level of channel harmony and making sure that we have a good collaboration between our direct force and the channel out there. You may have a slightly higher cost of sale. But I also think that we're going to be able to, particularly with some of those channels targeting certain enterprise segments with our Performance Hub and Cloud Exchange offers, which we believe have a very strong value proposition. I think we'll be able to sustain kind of the price points margins that we're accustomed to. So I don't see that as meaningfully different, and I certainly don't see it in terms of having any kind of meaningful negative impact on our overall margin structure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : I have 2. First off, as it relates to CapEx, when I look at your buildout in terms of cabinets the last few years, it's been fairly consistent. And also, the cost on a per cabinet basis is somewhere around $50,000. Is there any reason to think that as we go into 2015, the number of cabinets you tend to build out and also the cost of those cabinets would change very much? And then also, as it relates to the cloud business, you talked about adding some larger cloud deployments, magnet customers as you referred to them. What do you anticipate the overall impact of those deals being on MRR per cabinet, particularly in the United States or the Americas as we go into 2015? Charles Meyers : Yes, Colby, Keith and I can tag team this a bit. I think in terms of capital expansion, I think we're going to -- we're looking with some granularity as to where we need to invest given the demand. I don't think there would be a dramatic difference in terms of the pace of buildout. I do think we're looking at whether or not some of the large footprint opportunity that we are exploring and seeing in the cloud space will require us to make some incremental investment there. But that's something I think that we'll probably give you little more clarity around come our guidance in February. As to the cost per cabinet, we are constantly striving to sort of drive our cost per cabinet down while at the same time ensuring that we're delivering the premium quality service delivery that our customers require given the premium nature of their applications. So again, we're trying to drive it down to some degree from a continuous improvement standpoint. But I think the number that you articulate there, which is on the order of $50,000 a cab, is probably a reasonable planning number. And again, we'll probably continue to chip away at that, but that's probably not going to -- I wouldn't say change dramatically. And then lastly, as it relates to these big cloud footprints, honestly, we have been pursuing those as part of this sort of disciplined cloud ecosystem strategy for several quarters. And despite that, as you can see in our results, we've continued to maintain very attractive levels of yield. And that is because there are a number of levers available to us in terms of : one, driving interconnection growth, which as you can see, was very healthy this quarter; and continuing to manage power densities in the facilities with some rigor and some care that allows us to really sort of offset some of -- if we are taking on a cloud footprint that may not ramp from interconnection standpoint immediately or it will take some time to for an ecosystem effect to build to up around that, honestly, we continue to have levers that we believe will allow us to sort of maintain stability in the yield. And so that's where we are, and the results have showed that over the last several quarters. Keith D. Taylor: Colby, I would just add one thing. The other thing I think that's important to add to what Charles said, we also -- when we think about CapEx for 2015 beyond -- and beyond, we want to continue to be very disciplined about how we deploy that capital. But as you're aware, we also have 13 projects of size and scale today that are underway such as a Toronto or Singapore 3 or a London 6 large deployment. And so we're going to be very measured about how we deploy our capital on a go-forward basis. And I think Charles is absolutely right about the comment that we're going to -- it's going to be roughly in and around the same order of magnitude. But we're also going to reserve the right to take the opportunity when it exists. But as you can appreciate, it takes a long time to build out some of these assets. So as we continually think about how to deploy capital, our teams are already thinking about '15, '16 and '17. And so I feel we're in a very good position to moderate the consumption of our capital on a go-forward basis and be thoughtful and prudent about how that gets deployed. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Michael Bowen of Pacific Crest. Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division : A couple of housekeeping things. I'm not sure I heard on enterprise. I think you gave out the percentage of revs the last couple of quarters. If you could provide that, that would be terrific. And then with regard to the recurring CapEx definition as it pertains to AFFO, do you guys have an update on that? Has that been finalized? And then finally, with regard to Performance Hub, you announced some wins. How can we think about that as far as revenue impact and margin impact going forward? If you can help us think about that, that would be terrific. Keith D. Taylor: Okay. So let me take the middle one, if I could. And just as we get -- as we sort of -- and then Charles and Steve will take the other 2. So as it relates to AFFO, as I said, this quarter, we're raising our guidance to greater than $745 million. It includes a $5 million headwind relative to currency. And when you add in the $32 million of what I call REIT-related operating costs, you get a sense of roughly greater than $780 million. That also assumes, as you know, $110 million of recurring CapEx. There are still 2 lines. So when you look at basically the results that we've provided on the earnings deck, the PowerPoint presentation, there's a couple of areas that we're still looking at to make sure we look at our peer group, we look at [indiscernible] and we look at what makes a good sense for us. And so we're continuing to refine that. And so I'd ask that you just give us patience for at least one more quarter as we continue to work through that. But suffice it to say, when you look at CapEx, the $110 million that we allocate to recurring, which is about 4.5% of revenues, it has the potential potentially to change a little bit depending on how we allocate that small bucket of -- that bucket of cost. Stephen M. Smith: Could you remind us the initial question? Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division : Yes, the other question was with regard to Performance Hub, with regard to how impactful, with regard to revenue and how should we think about it from an incremental margin standpoint. The other was the percentage of revenue on enterprise. I think last quarter, if I'm not mistaken, it was 11%, up from 9% the prior quarter. If you have that, that would be great. Charles Meyers : Yes, I think the deck shows that again, you have to understand that we are -- we separate out an enterprise vertical that we distinguish from our other verticals, financial services, content, digital media, cloud, et cetera. And that one is also -- that 11% now is shown in the deck, I think on Page 15 of the deck that we posted today. But one thing that is very important to remember is that the momentum of our enterprise class offers, if you will, is not necessarily reflected just in that number because the number of the buyers of those are customers who live in other verticals at least in our classification. In fact, our largest wins to date have been with customers -- well, some of our largest wins today have been with customers that live in the other verticals in our categorization. So for example, we referenced a very large global Performance Hub with an online banking -- for an online banking application that we have this quarter. That would be -- that would fall in our financial services revenue line. And we also had some with content and digital media or cloud customers that would be in there. And so that's what we're seeing in terms of momentum for our enterprise class applications. Having said that though, we definitely are seeing momentum in what we categorize as the rest of the broader enterprise or what our CMO likes to refer to as the other -- the rest of the enterprise. And in fact, that category is our largest source of new logos, and we've been very effective in getting in there, getting admittedly smaller wins and then really being able to land and expand from a geography and a product set standpoint with them. Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division : Okay, great. And I guess where I was going with the Performance Hub, Steve, was maybe to put a finer point on there. Principally, the question is one of the things that I've been getting questions on is with regard to Performance Hub and Cloud Exchange. Technically, I guess, isn't there an opportunity cost for incremental revenue that might be going directly to the cloud provider rather than incremental revenue within your data center? But I'm assuming you're going to answer that in a way that -- or in a manner in that the overall incremental impact is positive. But can you help us think about the puts and takes there as far as opportunity cost but then offset by an increase in revenue to the -- for the Direct Connect to the cloud provider? Charles Meyers : Yes, I mean, I think what you're getting at is probably a very common question that we get, which is if people are taking workloads and moving them directly into the public cloud, doesn't that represent a net reduction in the sort of colo opportunity? And the reality is, is that in aggregate, that may be true across the broad colocation market. But as it relates to Equinix, who tends to play in a very specific sort of premium application segment where people are moving workloads that are -- require network density, global reach, ecosystem reach and sort of mission-critical performance, we see it as a very sort of net positive opportunity for us. And so what we're able to do is we look at enterprises who may, in fact, be looking to move certain applications from their basement into a hybrid cloud architecture. And they may take stuff that was living in their data center and move some of that, particularly back office applications or other nonperformance sensitive applications, into a cloud environment. But the way they're going to do that is they're going to purchase a Performance Hub implementation from us across probably a global reach, a global opportunity for us, 3 or 4 or 5 locations, interconnect that to Cloud Exchange and then move their workloads through that Performance Hub. And so we see it very much as an upside opportunity for us. Stephen M. Smith: Michael, the simplest way to think about this, these are service offerings, both of them, that help customers connect their workloads to public cloud access points. So the cloud exchange is trying to accelerate that specifically. The network Performance Hub, we've been utilizing for several quarters. And it's to help a CIO who's distributing their wide area network in a more optimized, cost-effective, higher-performance way to get -- to solve all the challenges that they're all seeing with mobile, social, cloud, et cetera. So these are service offerings that actually is helping customers connect to cloud access points -- or access nodes. And when you consider that 80-some percent of the IT spend in the world today is sitting in-house, on-premise and a lot of that stuff is being predicted to come out to the market, get colo-ed or outsourced or managed service, we're going to catch a lot of that workload that's coming out to the market in the future because they're going to look inside of Equinix and they're going to see all this network density. They're going to see all this cloud density and they're going to say, \"That's how we can build a solution, the multi-cloud, multi-network drives that I need to go run my company.\" As we've mentioned to you guys multiple times, even Equinix as a $2.5 billion company uses 30 to 35 cloud providers just to run our IT. That's exactly what we see happening with enterprises today. We're trying to figure out how to get to the multi-cloud environment. And these too -- these are offerings to help them do that. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Mr. Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Michael McCormack - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Maybe just a comment, Keith, that you gave on the MMR (sic) [MRR] outlook in the 4Q. What are the key drivers around that? And then thinking about cloud installments in particular, any differences in what you're seeing in churn among those installments? Keith D. Taylor: Yes, Mike, at least from an MRR perspective or we refer to as yield, there's really no change that we're -- no meaningful change that we're expecting in Q4. And again, as you can appreciate, given the size of our installed base now, any movement in either direction is going to be relatively dramatic over a short period of time for us to meaningfully adjust those metrics. So that all said, we feel confident in the firmness of our metric both on a global basis as we calculate globally. We're up roughly 1%, I think, quarter-over-quarter and 3% year-over-year. We feel very good about the firmness of that metric. And it gets supported by the fact that, as I said earlier, increasing infrastructure density and the deployment, increasing interconnection and then just the volume of opportunity we see. All of that would lead me to believe that we're going to continue to be playing in this range for the foreseeable future. Charles Meyers : Yes, and Michael, let me take the second one with regard to the sort of cloud footprint and the churn dynamics around those. What I would say is that for the most part, cloud is a relatively newer phenomenon over the last several years in terms of driving significant deployments. And so we're probably inside of the sort of contract length on many of those. But what I would say is that we have developed over the last several years a very robust understanding of the churn dynamics in our business and what represents a deployment that is going to be sort of subject to churn or price compression versus those that are going to have high -- very high levels of retention and therefore higher customer lifetime value. And what I would tell you is that the dynamics of churn -- of cloud deployments tend to really favor them being high retention, high lifetime value deployments. And the reason is several-fold: one, they tend to be revenue facing; two, they tend to be very well interconnected; and three, they tend to be global and so they're deployed cross region, cross metro. And we actually have a pretty hard handle, analytical handle, on something we call our -- it's basically an index that we have where we can calculate the likely retention of deployments based on those dynamics. And I would tell you that generally, cloud deployments stack up very well along those dimensions. Katrina Rymill : Thank you. That concludes our Q3 call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Before we walk through the results of the quarter, I'd like to reflect on the milestones that we achieved in 2014. To start, turning to slide three, we leveraged significant market momentum to deliver another strong year of financial results generating $2.44 billion of revenue, up 14% year-over-year and over $1.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA or 46% margin, and growing AFFO 12% to $762 million. Second, we established Equinix as the home of the interconnected cloud by partnering with an all start list of cloud providers including AWS, Cisco, Google, IBM, and Microsoft, and won business from a host of enterprises, who are taking advantage of their presence to implement hybrid cloud architectures at Equinix. We have continued to innovate and enhance our offer set to help transform enterprise IT launching two new solutions in 2014, Performance Hub and Cloud Exchange. The traction we are seeing is very compelling, as hundreds of customers are now using these solutions to improve network and enterprise application performance as well as accelerate cloud adoption. Third, we expanded our global platform completing 10 major IBX expansions in 2014, including projects in Amsterdam, Dallas, Sao Paulo, Singapore, Sydney, and Tokyo. We are successfully creating value over the long-term through our development pipeline achieving attractive returns and healthy yield on stabilized assets with our premium value proposition. Given the market strength, we are continuing to grow our presence in core markets. And in the first half of this year, we are opening five new IBXs in the financial and network hubs of London, New York, Singapore, Toronto, as well as a new metro in Melbourne, Australia. Fourth, we extended our position as the global interconnection leader. With interconnection revenue continuing to outpace overall revenue, growing 16% year-over-year and further demonstrating the strength of our ecosystems. Customers interconnecting across Platform Equinix resulted in 18,500 new cross-connects in 2014 with a notable uptick in the latter half of the year, driven by strong growth to networks and acceleration in private connections to the cloud. Our digital exchanges also saw a sizable increase in both traffic and sales, adding approximately 600 ports in 2014, about 2.5 times more adds than the prior year. And finally, we successfully began operating as a REIT on January 1 and are very pleased to announce our first quarterly dividend program. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet, including raising and refinancing our high-yield notes and senior debt in the fourth quarter, and feel very good about our liquidity position and capital structure. This strategic and operational flexibility will allow for continued re-investment in our business and new market development along with distributions to our shareholders on a quarterly basis. As we enter 2015, we see continued momentum in our core business and are well positioned to execute on emerging growth opportunities by expanding our routes to market and further enhancing our solutions portfolio. As the applications become increasingly interactive, solving complex interconnection scenarios is mission critical for today's business. We believe our global scale, as well as our network and power density puts us in a unique position to solve these challenges. Today, we have over 4,800 customers and expect to significantly expand our customer base over the next several years as Platform Equinix becomes increasingly relevant to a large universe of buyers. Now turning to the quarter; we deliver record gross and net bookings driven by strong performance across all three regions, solid new customer additions, and continued expansion of our cloud ecosystems. An increasing global deployment and accelerated interconnection growth are helping contribute to firm yield and reduce churn. We continue to see customers expand their geographic with Platform Equinix, and today, 67% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple regions up from 63% last year and 81% of recurring revenues come from customer deployed across multiple metros, up from 79% last year. Now let me show the highlights of our industry vertical performance this past quarter. Our network vertical delivered steady growth as wireline carriers upgrade core node infrastructure to support exponential traffic growth in new services. And several of our non-strategic customers began to bundle Equinix into their custom enterprise solutions. Network interconnection also experienced strong growth as both connections to and from our network customers grew more than 20% year-over-year. Emerging demand for mobile platforms is generating new business and wins in this vertical include EE, the UK's largest 4G operator, and Truphone, a global mobile network operator. Content and digital media delivered a record quarter with healthy demand from large content players and rapid growth in our advertising sub-segment, which is gaining traction as real-time ad placement becomes a cornerstone of the company's advertising strategy. Cloud adoption is on the rise among content and digital media companies as they leverage the scaling advantages offered by cloud and seek the low latency required to deliver the highest quality user experience. For example, global publishing company HarperCollins recently chose to connect to Microsoft Azure through the Equinix Cloud Exchange inside our London IBX, in order to achieve guaranteed levels of security and latency with improved operational resilience and flexibility. Turning to financial services, we saw steady growth and continued progress in diversifying our financial services business across insurance, retail banking, and digital payments and processing. Our five largest financial deals of the quarter came from these sectors, including a top 15 global retail bank, a top five global insurance firm, and the third largest global payments and analytics provider. Electronic payments in particular is an area, where we have been increasingly focused and we see potential for a digital commerce ecosystem to emerge spanning multiple industries. We have captured over 50 customers in the digital commerce space, including Adyen, a global payments technology provider, leveraging Equinix's network density and cloud connectivity to enable global payments for merchants from anywhere in the world. Turning to our cloud and enterprise verticals, the enterprise shift from centralized in-house IT infrastructure to distributed hybrid and public cloud architectures is driving an incremental and transformational opportunity that we expect to be Equinix's top growth vector over the next several years. In the fourth quarter, cloud and IT services again delivered record bookings. And we now have over 1,250 cloud and IT service companies driving 27% of our revenue. Expansions on AWS, Oracle, Microsoft, and T-Systems drove strong momentum in the quarter and we saw an uptick in larger footprint deals as the size of deployments for public and private cloud access nodes have expanded given the rapid growth in this market. Cloud service providers continue to choose Platform Equinix to support rapid global deployment, cutting edge application performance and unmatched reliability. The Equinix Cloud Exchange, our intelligent switching platform that enables companies to connect directly and securely to multiple cloud and network providers continues to scale and is now live in 19 markets globally. Over 100 companies, enterprises, networks and cloud service providers have joined the Equinix Cloud Exchange and new wins include Google, IBM Software, Fusion Apps as well as PacNet, Tata, and Telecom Italia. Google and IBM Software are two important platform wins that enhance the value and diversity of our cloud ecosystem. Equinix will offer high-performance direct access to Google Cloud platform in 15 markets and to the IBM Software platform in 9 markets this year. On the enterprise side, as leading companies around the globe operate increasingly interconnected and on demand business models, we're experiencing significant momentum in the enterprise market. Over 100 customers have deployed Performance Hub, our targeted solution that allows customers to deploy IT resources closer to user population and provide secure high-bandwidth connectivity to a variety of networks in cloud. This distributed interconnection based approach to data center computing provides significant benefits in both application and network performance. Enterprise wins include General Electric, as well as GP Strategies, a management consulting and engineering services firm, and Metso, a leading process provider for mining and oil and gas. So let me stop here and turn the call over to Keith to provide some deeper results \u2013 deeper details on the results for the quarter. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Great. Thanks, Steve. And good afternoon to everyone. To start, I'd like to first review some of our 2014 highlights, and then I'll turn to our fourth quarter performance. We reported revenues of $2.44 billion representing an almost 14% year-over-year growth rate. All three regions delivered better than expectations, with EMEA and Asia-Pacific show reported growth of 21% and 19% respectively, while the Americas region produced greater than expected growth of 9% on its much larger base. We continue to balance margin expectations with the reinvestment in the business to drive our future growth. Our gross profit margin was 51% and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46% after taking into consideration significant investment and expansion activities across the regions, as well as directing approximately $30 million in operating expenses to fund new product innovations, such as Cloud Exchange and Performance Hub. Also in 2014, we continued to scale our go-to-market efforts to better position ourselves to attract the enterprise customer. Despite these investments, our margins remain stable and we continue to target a longer-term objective of achieving 50% adjusted EBITDA margins or better. We continue to focus on the balance sheet and finding ways to optimize our capital structure. During the fourth quarter, we refreshed our debt structure and secured $2.75 billion of new financings. This puts us in a great position to fund both our existing and new initiatives, invest in the development pipeline, and fund our quarterly dividend. So, let me now turn to slide four. As I'd like to highlight how we allocated the resources in 2014. First, we generated approximately $709 million in adjusted cash from operations, and then reinvested $660 million of this cash into development and other projects that have consistently high levels of return, including our newly opened Melbourne and Singapore IBXs. We now have 103 data centers across 33 markets, the largest global retail data center footprint in the world. We purchased the remaining shares of ALOG in Brazil, and now own 100% of this important South American asset. Also we continue to increase the number of assets owned and developed with the purchase of land for our current and our future Melbourne IBXs. And finally, we repurchased $298 million of Equinix stock in 2014 and completed $416 million special distribution for stockholders, which included $83 million in cash. Returning to the fourth quarter, simply put, it was another outstanding quarter for the Equinix team. Our strategy continues to deliver better-than-expected results across the company. At the global level, we had record gross and net bookings, and our quarterly key metrics remain solid including MRR per cabinet especially on an FX neutral basis and net cabinets billing. Also our interconnection metrics were again outstanding as we added 5,600 net cross-connects, and 130 exchange ports this quarter alone. As depicted on slide five, global Q4 revenues were $638.1 million, our 48th consecutive quarter of top line revenue growth, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 13% over the same quarter last year. Our over performance was due to higher gross bookings, lower than planned MRR churn, and continued custom sales order activity. Our Q4 revenue performance net of our FX hedges absorbs an $8.5 million negative currency impact when compared to the average rates used last quarter, and a $1 million negative currency impact when compared to our FX guidance rates. Currency volatility against all of our operating currencies continues to cause significant FX headwinds this quarter and meaningfully affected our 2015 guidance. Our largest exposure to FX movement related to the weakening of the Brazilian real, the British pound, and the euro. For 2015, we have layered in new hedges approximating 80% coverage against our EMEA operating currencies for the full year. Besides the negative FX impact on our 2015 guidance, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has created a $100 million FX headwind against revenues and a $47 million headwind against our adjusted EBITDA. Cash SG&A expenses increased to $147.8 million for the quarter, higher than guidance primarily due to a December change in our commission practices, where our sales reps will now earn their sales commissions when their order is booked versus when the order is billed. This change was made to better align our comp practices with the market and to enable us to better track these costs as we measure our business performance. As a result, we accelerated on a one-time basis $7 million of sales commission cost into the fourth quarter. This was not included in our prior guidance. Global adjusted EBITDA was $294.4 million, at the top end of our guidance range and up 12% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46%. Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a negative $1.1 million currency impact when compared to the average rates used last quarter and a $3.4 million net positive impact when compared to the FX guidance rates. In the fourth quarter, we reported a net loss of $355.1 million. Consistent with our comments from the last earnings call, a large portion of this loss relates to write-off of deferred tax assets totaling $324 million as we formalized our conversion to a REIT. Also we recorded a $106 million loss on debt extinguishment related to our refinancing efforts. Our Q4 operating cash flow decreased slightly over the prior quarter to $202.3 million, largely due to increased cash interest and taxes paid. Also our DSOs improved two days to 37 days. Our AFFO for the year was $761.7 million, higher than our expectations mainly due to lower than expected recurring CapEx and cash taxes. MRR churn was better than anticipated at 1.9%, the second quarter in a row where we are below the 2% threshold and we believe reflects some level of stabilization of this key metric. For the full year 2015, we expect our MRR churn rate to range between 2% and 2.5% per quarter, although we do expect the average to be at the lower-end of this range. Now moving on to our comments on REIT; well, we've officially began operating as a REIT as of January 1, 2015, which is a significant and exciting milestone for the company. That said, to give you a perspective on how we've structured our REIT assets, we placed the majority of our U.S. and European assets along with our Japanese assets under the qualified REIT structure or QRS, with the rest of Asia, Brazil and Canada placed in our TRS or taxable REIT structure. This is important to note as the taxable income from our QRS business is what drives our dividend payout requirements. In addition, while we don't yet have our PLR in hand, we continue to expect to receive a favorable PLR in 2015. On slide six, we summarize our expected REIT related cash cost and taxes. We expect our second special distribution to range between $580 million and $680 million and to be paid in Q4 of 2015. Our REIT-related cash cost should approximate $12 million in 2015 including $2 million of one-time costs to finalize the REIT structure. And finally we expect our effective worldwide tax rate excluding REIT-related cash taxes to range between 10% and 15% in 2015, although this range may narrow as we continue to review our tax operating structure. Turning to slide seven, I'd like to start reviewing the regional results beginning with the Americas. The Americas had a strong quarter, delivering its second highest gross bookings activity with record cross-connect addition. These results clearly show the benefits from our core strategy. The Americas revenues increased 4% over the prior quarter and 10% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Americas adjusted EBITDA was up 5% over the prior quarter and 6% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Americas adjusted EBITDA margin was 47% for the quarter, a step-up over the prior quarter due to lower seasonal utility expenses. In 2015, we expect to spend approximately $7 million to integrate our ALOG business. Americas net cabinets billing increased by 500 in the quarter, lower than last quarter, largely due to timing of installations. We added a record 3,500 net cross-connects and 95 exchange ports in Q4, highlighting the strong demand for our Americas digital exchanges. With respect to the region's new builds, we're expanding our Dallas 2 IBX in the Infomart, which is the primary interconnection building in the Dallas market. Now, looking at EMEA, please turn to slide eight. EMEA delivered a strong quarter with record gross bookings with particular strength coming from our Dutch and German businesses. Revenues were up 6% quarter-over-quarter \u2013 pardon me, and 17% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our EMEA business continues to capture market share, growing twice as fast as our regional competitors. Also, we would like to highlight the improved German performance throughout the year, the result of new leadership, better execution, and renewed focus across our German team. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 1% over the prior quarter and up 18% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased slightly to 42% due to one-off cost in the fourth quarter. EMEA interconnection revenues increased 2% over the prior quarter and up 29% over the same quarter last year and represents 9% of the region's recurring revenues. We added 1,200 net cross-connects in the quarter and EMEA MRR per cabinet was up 2% on a constant currency basis. Net cabinets billing increased by approximately 600. Moving to expansion opportunities, the Frankfurt market has performed very well in 2014 and we've seen a substantial increase in our fill rate compared to the prior year. To support this demand, we're expanding both our Frankfurt II and our Frankfurt IV IBXs. We're also accelerating the third phase of our Amsterdam-3 asset to respond to sales momentum in the Dutch business. Located on the Amsterdam Science Park, this is the second most cloud dense location in Europe and an important interconnection hub for our customers. And now looking at Asia Pacific, please refer to slide nine. Asia Pacific revenues were up 7% over the prior quarter and 29% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis driven by record gross bookings in the cloud and IT services and network segment. Adjusted EBITDA on normalized and constant currency basis was up 9% over the last quarter and 34% over the same quarter last year. MRR per cabinet on a constant currency basis went up 3% quarter-over-quarter largely due to increased power density and a steady increase in interconnection revenues. Also, cabinets billing increased by 700 over the prior quarter. We added 900 net cross-connects and interconnection revenues remain at 12% of the region's recurring revenues. In December, we opened our first data center in Melbourne, Australia expanding Platform Equinix to 33 markets. The Melbourne business already logged more than 40 new customers including our 11 network service providers. We're also expanding into Hong Kong market with new phases in both Hong Kong I and Hong Kong II IBXs to support deployments from the digital, media and financial verticals. And now looking at our balance sheet, please refer to slide 10. Fourth quarter was very active from a capital structure perspective. We settled our 2014 converts, we completed two new debt deals securing $2.75 billion in fundings. We used the proceeds from these offerings to redeem our 7% senior notes, did all the make whole payment and repay our prior term loan. These transactions effectively lowered the average cost of our debt financings to 4.93%. We ended the quarter with over $1.1 billion of cash and the net debt leverage ratio decreased slightly to three times our Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA. Now switching to AFFO and our dividend outlook for \u2013 on slide 11. For 2015, we expect the AFFO to be greater than $810 million or growing 12% on a constant currency basis. This guidance absorbs $43 million in negative FX headwinds, as well as an incremental $27 million in interest expense related to our November financing. Also today, we're excited to announce our first quarterly dividend of $1.69 per share, a very important milestone for Equinix. We expect to pay out 100% of our QRS's taxable income. Our current AFFO payout ratio approximates 48%, the result of significant international assets still structured under our TRS as well as significant tax depreciation and stock based compensation expenses. For 2015 and beyond, we'll continue to review our QRS, TRS REIT structure. It's important to note that our goal is to maximize total shareholder return. This is facilitated by our flexibility to support a growing cash dividend, as we continue to scale our business and more of our assets move into the QRS structure, while continuing to invest in our development activities. Turning to slide 12, given the cash on the balance sheet add to that our growing cash flows plus our debt capacity we are well positioned to fund our 2015 development activities, pay our quarterly dividends including the 2015 special distribution and service our debt obligations. As a REIT, our target net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio will remain at 3 times to 4 times. This level of debt provides us the strategic and operational flexibility, we need to execute against our business needs. Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to slide 13. For the quarter, cap expenditures were $238.5 million including recurring CapEx of $33 million in line with our guidance. We currently have 16 announced expansion projects underway across the globe of which 15 are campus builds or incremental phase build. Also note we have finalized the breakout of CapEx between recurring and non-recurring for our AFFO definition. This is the format we'll be reporting on, on a go forward basis. Turning to slide 14, the operating performance of our stabilized 69 global IBX and expansion projects that have been open for more than one year continue to perform well with revenues up 6% on a year-over-year basis. Currently, these projects generate a 32% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested and are 82% utilized. And lastly one final point, as part of the REIT conversion, we'll continue to rollout incremental financial data to enable our investors to sit back and analyze the business. This quarter, we added a supplemental section to our earnings deck, which now includes our non-financial metrics and expansion sheet, as well as some additional disclosure. Starting in Q1, we expect to add additional materials to this earnings deck, including the components of NAV and NOI. So let me stop there and turn it back to Steve. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, Keith, thanks. Let me now cover our 2015 strategy and outlook on slide 15. Our focus in 2015 is driven by three strategic priorities, designed to further differentiate our global data center services and extend Platform Equinix. First, we will continue to drive differentiated growth by deepening our existing ecosystems and applying particular focus on capturing the expanded opportunity in cloud and enterprise. With both network and power density that is unparalleled, we aim to become the provider of choice for the new age of enterprise IT. We will continue to invest meaningfully in innovation to deliver enhanced offers for multi-cloud consumption and build-out our cloud service provider ecosystems, anchored by cloud technology leaders. Second, to tackle these opportunities effectively, we will also invest in our go-to-market and our global platform to broaden our reach, scale, scale our organization and deliver premium customer services. We will do this by expanding our channel program to enhance our reach into the enterprise through agents, resellers, systems integrators, and key platform partners such as Microsoft, NetApp, and Cisco, working in tandem with our direct sales engine. Additionally, we're delivering on our commitment to build a professional services practice that aids enterprises in designing and deploying next-generation architectures, starting with our acquisition of Nimbo, an established market leader in enabling hybrid cloud. In parallel, we're expanding our sales support and enablement functions including our solution architects and sales engineers that facilitate the selling process. To support these efforts and the growth of our sales engine, we're driving global consistency and alignment through our Equinix Customer One program. This initiative is enhancing our customers' experience through global standardization of our products and streamlining our quote to cash process. We successfully rolled this out in Asia in the fourth quarter and will implement the EMEA and Americas regions by mid-2015. And finally, we will continue to refine our capital allocation strategy of profitable growth through organic and inorganic investments and the distribution of dividends, while driving return on invested capital. We continue to ensure that our expansion CapEx supports our growth objectives and optimizes capital outlays, while balancing project risk and customer needs. Equinix has a long history of achieving attractive returns in the development of new properties. This is done by building campuses that can be extended with additional premium priced space connected to our mature datacenters where interconnected communities of customers have already been established. The vast majority of our new development is in existing markets and our unique market intelligence gained from working with customers, gives us visibility into a market's demand, pricing and returns. This knowledge helps us make prudent capital allocation decisions and enables us to maintain highly differentiated project returns. Last I'll cover our outlook for 2015 on slide 16 to slide 19. For the first quarter of 2015, we expect revenues to be in the range of $634 million to $638 million, which absorbs $19 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to Q4, 2014 average FX rates and normalized and constant currency growth of 3% quarter-over-quarter. Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68% to 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $146 million to $150 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $287 million and $291 million, which includes $12 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to Q4 2014 average FX rates and normalizing constant currency growth of 3% quarter-over-quarter. Capital expenditures are expected to be $195 million to $205 million, which includes approximately $25 million of recurring capital expenditures. For the full year of 2015, we expect revenues to be greater than $2.63 billion, which absorbs $100 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to 2014 average FX rate, reflecting a normalized and constant currency growth of 12%. Full year cash gross margins are expected to range between 68% and 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $580 million to $600 million. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be greater than $1.22 billion or a 46% EBITDA margin, an 80 basis point improvement over the last year. This guidance absorbs $47 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to 2014 average FX rates. We expect adjusted funds from operations to be greater than $810 million, a 12% constant currency growth year-over-year. And finally, we expect capital expenditures to range between $700 million and $800 million, which includes $115 million of recurring capital expenditures. For 2015, we expect 95% of this expansion capital expenditure will be for campus and existing market build, and roughly 5% for new market development. So in closing, we are leveraging our leadership position to build unique customer offers and enhance our ecosystems while scaling the business globally. We're successfully expanding our ecosystem of cloud services, which coupled with our network density will drive growth across our entire platform. The rapid growth of interconnection reflects the importance of Equinix as the place where leading companies come to connect their customers and partners to accelerate the growth of their business. I'm very pleased with our position going into this year and look forward to continued progress against our objectives. So let me stop here and open it up for questions. Liz, I'll turn it back over to you. Operator : Thank you. We'll now open for questions. Our first question comes from David Barden with Bank of America. Your line is open. David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, if I could just three quick ones, first, Keith, could you talk about the difference in the rate of I guess taxable income or AFFO growth whichever one you think is more relevant for the QRS and the TRS, so that we can understand what the growth possibilities for the dividend are as they're propelled by the results of the QRS itself. I guess the second question is for you, Steve, which would be could you kind of elaborate on your appetite for a large scale consolidating European transaction and if so give us details on that? And then the third question I guess is the obvious one which is \u2013 a year ago we heard that the PLR was coming in 2014, now we're hearing in 2015 \u2013 that it's coming in 2015. The question I get 10 times more often than any other fundamental question is, what possible reason could there be that you don't have it already, you've paid a lot of people a lot of money to help you in this process, they must be telling you something, could you please tell us what it is? Thanks. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Okay, well, I will start first and foremost with the \u2013 sort of the AFFO and really talk a little bit about the REIT structure, and just having it from the \u2013 in the prepared remarks, and you think about the QRS, it has majority, it has the American business, which is as you know, as I reported, our slowest growing business albeit on a very large base. So, our European business on a currency adjusted basis is our second fastest-growing and then the Japanese business those are all sitting in the queue. What's not sitting in the queue is the rest of our Asian business, and no surprise to you that is Hong Kong, that's Australia, that's Singapore. And so, when you look at \u2013 sorry, and there is Canada and Brazil. Brazil, because it's a managed services business, you can appreciate it. It doesn't have the revenue type that's fully suitable for REIT, and so think of Brazil as staying inside the T on a continuous basis. For the remaining assets, you can get a good sense, if you think about Singapore, you think about Australia, you think about us opening up our Toronto 2 asset in Canada. You're going to have a lot of growth still coming from inside the T. And, over time, the reason that we \u2013 the reason that we're structured today as is we're trying to do it tax efficiently, but we also have to meet the REIT compliance test in 2015 with it being a conversion year, we have to be very thoughtful about what assets you move in over what period of time. All that is to say, when you look at the Q, or you look at the T, these both have very good growth potential. And, over time, not only growth in the overall business, but certainly as we move assets from the T into the Q that will give you the opportunity to get growth on the dividend. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, let me take the second one, David. I guess I'd start with reminding the audience on the phone that our priorities for inorganic growth really around three areas. One, scaling our platform globally, very similar to what we did in Brazil and Dubai for example, entering those new markets over the last 18 months to 24 months. That's still of high interest to growing our platform globally. I guess the second component might be our continued focus on enhancing our interconnection and growing that platform very similar to what we did in Germany with the ancotel acquisition. So I would tell you that we look for those kinds of plays constantly. And then, third, certainly, grown over the last couple years is capturing the cloud ecosystem and enhancing the enterprise capabilities to connect to the cloud ecosystem and the acquisition of Nimbo is professional services capability that's aimed at enterprise hybrid cloud enablement is a step in that direction to accelerate our ability to prosecute the cloud business. So, we look at a lot of things as you well know, the new markets include big, big regions like South Korea and India, and going deeper into China and going deeper into Latin America. So, we're looking at lots of regions of the world, South Africa is of interest to us. So, we've been pretty consistent on the places that scaling the platform are of interest to us. Europe is still obviously a very interesting marketplace for us. I wouldn't want to comment specifically on anything that we're all reading about here recently. With respect to our European business, we're very pleased with where we are with that business, and as Keith mentioned, it grew 21% year-on-year. It's growing substantially faster because of the inbound bookings we pushed into that region from the other two regions, interconnection growth grew 30% year-on-year. So, it's doing very, very well. Our focus here is to continue to grow that business as it is today and we'll continue to compete with the regional players in all parts of the world. We think we've done that very successfully. Our mantra is to continue on this global platform focus. So, I don't know if anybody would add anything there, Charles or Keith, on the European question? On the PLR, top of everybody's mind, I think given our position on our first quarterly dividend, David, I guess all I can tell you is that we're still highly confident that we're going to get a response here in 2015 and that's based on the existing legal precedence that's out there today, the fact that many other data center companies are currently operating as REITs. So, we believe, we qualify for taxation as a REIT. Unfortunately, it's out of our hands right now. The ball is in the IRS's court. We've provided them everything that they need, and you have to remember here also that the previous couple of players that went through this process, I think, Iron Mountain and Lamar, and I forget a couple others, actually all received their \u2013 a couple of those guys received their PLRs post conversion. So, these conditions that we're living in today are not terribly unusual. I think everybody is frustrated about it but we still remain highly confident that we'll get a positive response here in 2015. David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right, guys. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore. Your line is open. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, I'd like to ask a question about the investment into the professional services organization, maybe two elements to that. One, could you give us an example of the advice, the problem solution that you're providing to your customers through that organization? And then secondly as we think about that business becoming more important to Equinix over time, are there any margin implications that we should be considering? Thanks. Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Hey, Jonathan, it's Charles. I'll take that one. I think that \u2013 a couple things. Again, what we're seeing is our investment in pro serv is really a response to what we're seeing from our enterprise customers in terms of what they need to implement hybrid cloud effectively. And what we're finding is, is that they're at a stage where they are still examining how hybrid cloud fits, how they can implement it, which workloads they would want to consider moving into a hybrid cloud environment, which ones they may want to keep in a more traditional colocation setting, what workloads lend themselves well to a public cloud, interconnect, and then how to implement that over time, particularly in a highly distributed fashion globally for larger players. So that's the type of advice that they are looking for before they make commitments and execute plans on hybrid cloud implementation. And Nimbo was already actively engaged with customers of ours and with partners of ours like Microsoft in those types of discussions. And so we're very excited about the opportunity and in fact have gotten a ton of positive feedback from partners like Microsoft and existing customers about that capability. And so that's the essence of what they're doing and again it's early days. But we continue to be really optimistic about what that means for us and for our customers, as they look to implement hybrid cloud. In terms of our desire, I would say that the overall scale of the business is a couple things. We are \u2013 our objective here is not to grow a professional services firm for the purpose of growing our top-line, it is really to draw pull through and demand for Platform Equinix over time as a hybrid cloud enablement platform. And so we are going to do that kind of business and we'll do it at reasonable margins. They will certainly be lower than our services business, but the overall scale of the business will be relatively immaterial and not have a significant impact on the overall margin structure. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker): All right. Thank you for taking the questions. Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Your line is open. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. First question I had was, if you could just share with us what the sequential currency headwind was in the fourth quarter from the average rate in the third quarter? Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, the \u2013 so on a total basis, Michael, it's \u2013 the net exposure is $8.5 million on the top-line. Having said that, the currency hedges themselves offset a fairly meaty piece of that exposure, but overall, it's a net hit of $8.5 million. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And, just secondly when you look at the flow through to revenue in the quarter, on a sequential base if you add back some currencies above the average of the last few quarters, would you say that this is a result of the stronger bookings and sales activity or is it some of the book-to-bill that you highlighted in the past catching up? Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Michael, really it's a combination of all three things. I'd tell you, it's not only the fact that we're pushing more volume into the system, and as Steve alluded to, we had record gross and net bookings this quarter, effectively Americas second best quarter ever, and the other two regions, their best ever. If you combine that with churn being lower than our expectation, that's a great output to our revenue line, number one. And number two, the book-to-bill interval, so certainly there're some of that that bleeds into the results. And then the last piece, which is something that we've spent a little bit more energy on this year, relative to last year. We actually do more nonrecurring activities as well. I would tell you, as we look in this quarter, it's roughly just over \u2013 NRR is roughly 5% of our revenues, but relative to where we'd come from we do a little bit more, and so for those three reasons alone you see a nice step up in our activity. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And one last question if I could. You're carrying a balance of cash, I think, you referenced it a little over $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): If you take the average interest rate, multiply that against the $1.1 billion, if I'm calculating this correctly, it's almost $1 per share of pre-tax interest. How should we think about what kind of cash balance you're going to carry going forward and how to think about the cost of that cash balance? Thanks. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. It's a very good question. I think look, certainly, we went to the markets opportunistically at the end of November, or sorry in November. And we did that for a couple reasons. One, we felt it was a good time to go and refinance, we wanted to take out our 7% senior notes, we wanted to put a new term line in place. We also wanted to have a revolving line of credit. And that $1.5 billion facility between the term-loan and the line of credit is very, very cheap money for us, it's up 2%. If you think about the high yield that we did on a blended basis between 7% and 10%, it's a 5.52% cost of capital. All of that to say, as I said in my comments, our cost of funds today on a blended basis for all of our financings is 4.93%. So that's the first thing. The second thing I want to leave you with is the $1.1 million, as I said, we opportunistically went to market in November. It is not our expectation that we're going to carry that level of cash on a go-forward basis. And, suffice it to say when you think about the capital investment that we're going to be making this year and you add to that basically the dividends that we're going to be disbursing, plus perhaps some asset acquisitions, some land or some buildings, all of a sudden you can get a pretty good sense of what we're going to consume a fairly meaty piece of that $1.1 billion. And, therefore, as you roll forward in time beyond 2015, I would expect that you would see us either continue to consume cash from the balance sheet, as we generate it, but also go into our revolving line of credit. And then, as times permit we go back to the market and raise more debt to fund the future growth. And so, that's how we're sort of seeing it. I would tell you I don't think that you're going to see a lot of cash left on our balance sheet on a regular basis given the fact that we've now converted to a REIT. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen and Company : Great. Thank you. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're seeing an uptick in larger footprint deals and I wanted to know how are you able to potentially dynamically adjust your own offer or investment in your facilities to continue to get what you would deem the proper return. And then the second question is, I noticed in your AFFO calculation, you changed how you account for installation of revenue adjustment, and I was wondering why you may have done that and is the AFFO formula you have out there now something we should consider to be the finalized version. And then just one point of clarification, you mentioned for example in the first quarter that you're observing $19 million in FX headwinds. How much of that is actually being covered by the hedge itself? Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Thanks. Hey, Colby, this is Charles. I will take the first piece around large footprint, and then let Keith handle the other ones. As we've said consistently over the years our ecosystem centric strategy is very focused on putting the right customers with the right applications into the right assets and that really continues to be the case. But undoubtedly as we did comment in the script we're seeing an uptick in the requirements around the large footprint, particularly for cloud service providers who are looking to rapidly scale their business on a global basis. And that's \u2013 again we been \u2013 we've sort of always had that posture of, hey, there are large footprint deals that we believe are accretive to the overall ecosystem story that we will pursue and that we believe can sort of because of their ecosystem power, sort of support the right kind of long-term blended returns. And we are seeing those and winning that type of business and in terms of how we accommodate it, I think that and I would say in Asia and Europe we have typically sort of managed our facilities as some are blended facilities anyway with a combination of sort of small, medium, and large footprint deals going into those facilities. In U.S. it has been a little different. In that, there are specific assets where we are in a better position to accommodate large footprint at the right kind of price points with the right dynamics for customers. And we continue to have that capacity available to us and so we're looking at selectively putting those into \u2013 in the markets around the world and we are also looking to expand our capabilities and looking at our investment portfolio and plan to continue to put the right kind of capacity in the right places and looking at evolving the offer so that we can deploy essentially hybrid infrastructures that allow us to ebb and flow with the market demand and put the right mix of larger footprint and traditional premium retail into a market at once, and doing that in a way that we also are looking to sort of phase the capital more aggressively by really doing it as just in time as possible and that's another thing that our global designing and construction teams are actively looking at. So, those are the things that are going on right now, in terms of us being able to respond to that. We do see plenty of opportunity and we're going to be selective about that, because not every deal is something that we're going to chase. But the ones that we think are critical to winning in the cloud are things that we will pursue. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : So, Colby, then on the other two questions, as it relates to AFFO, what I would say first and foremost is, I think we are \u2013 we are now firm on what our calculation is going to be on a go-forward basis. We feel good about \u2013 I mean, the biggest area that we're really focusing in was CapEx and making sure we got the recurring CapEx, consistent with how we think we should be measuring this metric. So we've proven that up, and I'll tell you that AFFO on a principle basis is firm. And so we'll continue review it, but I feel very, very comfortable with our current definition. As you can see by all the disclosures we have, we've done a very good reconciliation of what we include between the FFO and the AFFO, and we reconciled also from EBITDA to AFFO. So that's, that's what we feel comfortable with. And we'll tell you that the $810 million increase, the $810 million as I said currency is impacting that number by $43 million, interest based on the November financing, again that was an opportunistic financing, relative to our expectation that adds another $27 million. If we hadn't done that our number would have been looked more likely $880 million on a constant currency basis or roughly 16% up quarter-over-quarter. And then \u2013 going then back to the comment just on currencies. If we look at currencies, again we did some bridges in our presentation, and so, when you go to pages 16 and 17, you get a pretty good sense of how currency has impacted it. Suffice it to say, I don't have the exact number, but what we gave was in the press release, we told you the rates of exchange that we're using for our currencies. And embedded in that of course, if you take euro, for example, it's trading spot today is roughly $113 and we've got a blended rate of $120. And it's no different than what we experienced last quarter where basically spot was roughly $126 and we're guiding you at $132. And all that to say is that we are looking at our relatively big currency impact on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And so, as we sort of presented in our reconciliation, in our bridges, you will see absent \u2013 taking out currency, we're reporting revenues flat quarter-over-quarter, currency is having a 3 percentage \u2013 3 growth point \u2013 I'm sorry, 3 points of growth impact on our Q1 results. And so we've now got \u2013 we've got this \u2013 the guidance range, we have got the \u2013 what we think is the size of the impact, and that should give you a good step forward in how to look at the business. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen and Company : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. So, I wanted to go back to the European situation and I just wondered how that M&A deal that's been proposed would affect you from a competitive standpoint given that it would create a clear new leader in the colo sector over there. And then just turning to your comments where you ended up Microsoft to NetApp, and I just wanted to get a sense about indirect channel and if you could quantify the contribution of the indirect channel today and then how large do you see that growing over time? And then finally just on the churn, it's been the lowest it's been for a while, and I wondered if that's sort of a sustainable level or how we should think about churn? Thank you. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right, Jon. Why don't I start, this is Steve, and then Keith or Charles you guys might want to give your opinion here on the European thing. I think I've stated \u2013 I tried to be clear in the first question that was asked about this, about where our priorities are for inorganic growth. And that's where the focus is. So, the combination that you're referring to over there, we're obviously have watched it, will watch it, are \u2013 those kinds of styles of companies have been on our gameboard for ever. Our interest is again back to what I said earlier which is to scale this platform globally to bolt more things on like Brazil and Dubai. We feel like the business that we're doing in Europe which is growing faster than both of those assets is doing exactly what we wanted it to do. If you'll remember when we went into Europe 2008, the IX Europe asset was the third largest player. I think, at the time Telecity if I remember correctly was number one, Interxion was number two. Five years later now with the global platform wrapped around our EMEA business, this business is growing two times as fast as our competitors. So, it's doing exactly what we wanted it to do and that's where our priority and focus is going to remain. And we'll compete with regional providers all over the world, I think, it will be no different as we look at this potential combined competitor. Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. I guess, all I'd add Jonathan is that again we really operate primarily and compete primarily as a global platform. And so, in our view the combination wouldn't meaningfully change the competitive dynamic there, the assets that are in play in terms of how they meet the customers' needs are essentially the same in a post-combination world. And again most of the customers who really resonate with the Equinix value proposition are often looking for a global player. As we've talked about, and I think, highlighted here in the metrics in our business, a substantial portion of our revenue is from customers who are operating with us in a multi-region way. And so, we're going to continue to sell into those opportunities and we think we can compete very effectively with those companies either independently or in combination. And then as it relates to the platform players we're very excited about the momentum we're seeing in terms of platform players and the reach that they have into the market particularly from a cloud perspective as customers look at the hybrid cloud implementation and so that's one of the significant investments, we're making is putting channel partners and channel program investments sort of into the system on a global basis and we are seeing levels of engagement between ourselves and the sales teams of key partners like a NetApp, like a Microsoft, et cetera, as being a very meaningful way that we're going to gain access to the enterprise market. And then when you look at that \u2013 I mean, as we talked about at Analyst Day, it's a huge addressable market, several hundred thousand possible target customers for the services that we deliver and we're simply not going to reach those with our direct quota bearing head count and so it's critical that we invest in the programs and the channel sales resources to partner up with those types of players. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : And then the third question, Jonathan, the... Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Churn. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : It was churn, and so 1.9% that's the second quarter in a row where we've been below that threshold of 2%. Clearly, we love to be at this level on a continuous basis, but we think it's appropriate to say, we think it stabilized, this is an important metric that has stabilized, number one. Then number two we're guiding on a forward basis 2% to 2.5% recognizing, we think the average is going to be at the lower end of the range, as I said. But the other part is, the reason we give range is, as you can appreciate churn, it has variability to it, and we wanted to make sure that we share that with the investors and on the call here. So for all those reasons, I think, we feel very comfortable that we're seeing stabilization and as we sort of look forward, we feel good with our guidance there. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I guess, the only thing I would add is... Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: \u2013 what we always talked about is that the best protection, the best way to manage churn over time is to get the right business in the door to begin with, and I think we've been very disciplined about that and I think we're seeing the benefits of that. And there is some volatility in it, but we continue to see things very positively from the churn perspective. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Your line is open. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess just a quick follow-up on the churn side. Taking a longer term, Keith and Charles, given the wake of optimization, is there a way that we can sort of wind this thing or trend it lower or is just there a natural resistance that you guys bump up against. And then secondly, not to keep plugging away on inorganic things, but it sounds like domestically AT&T is interested in probably getting out of some of the data centers. Just trying to get a sense for what you guys think about that asset or the carrier assets that will be a good fit structurally, any thoughts around that would be great? Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, Mike. I'll jump in and start on the first one. I don't know that we know exactly what the natural sort of frictional churn in our business would be, and I think, we're constantly \u2013 we're obviously very focused on continuing to reduce churn and make sure that there are no regrettable churn losses in our business. And candidly, there are very few today. For the most part, what we see is frictional churn associated with people optimizing platforms and footprints over time and resolved to a changing dynamic in their business. And so, I don't know that we could answer whether \u2013 certainly I think that we have the opportunity to continue to reduce it over time, but I think that the range that we've given you and kind of where within that range we expect to operate is our best current view. Over time, particularly as we scale the enterprise opportunity and if we're winning the kind of business that we expect to win around Performance Hub implementations, attached to Cloud Exchange as part of an overall hybrid cloud implementation, we believe that will be very sticky business, like much of the rest of what we offer today. And so, yes we would strive to be driving that lower. That increases customer lifetime value and creates long-term intrinsic value for the business. So we're going to \u2013 we would strive for that, but I think that the range that we've given is probably where we would be comfortable with providing right now until we learn more. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Charles, I'm sorry. Is there a significant difference in the enterprise base with respect to MRR growth or MRR churn? Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Well, I mean, I think that we are \u2013 right now we are seeing our logo \u2013 new logo wins are actually very focused on the enterprise, the bulk of our new logo wins are in the enterprise space. It was I believe our fastest growing bookings segment in the enterprise and so we are probably seeing that segment over index. It's probably easier for it to over index, as it's a bit smaller than the others, but that is certainly a sign of momentum. And then churn wise I would say to be determined, right, because these new implementations, these new enterprise implementations particularly Performance Hub is a new offering for us. Again, we believe based on what we're seeing because of how it leverages our network density and how it leverages our cloud density, we think they're going to be very sticky over time. And again the interconnection momentum we're seeing sort of indicates that. So that would be my comment on that. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think on your second question Mike, on the AT&T assets, yes, from time-to-time we look at opportunities like this, very frequently and very quickly we fall back to our priorities. It unlikely puts us into a new market where customers want us to go to extend the platform, if it's an interconnected asset, it might be of interest to us, if it's going to extend the cloud ecosystem, or allow us to prosecute enterprises better in some market would be interesting to us. But typically when you're looking at those older assets you're not really buying forward, you're more buying backwards and so not very often do we find an asset from those types of companies. But there are examples and you would know of them. There's examples in some of those companies that \u2013 particular assets that would be of interest to us. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : If they were to deemphasize that business, would it have any meaningful impact on industry dynamics, industry pricing here? Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You mean, being in the co-lo part of their business? Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : If they start to get out of it, or they sell to somebody else, will that have an overall impact on the pricing environment? Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't think so, I mean, as you guys, you know we compete with a lot of carriers on that part of their business where they have co-lo assets in certain markets and I think if that share shifted somewhere, it wouldn't be a big impact on us. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our final question comes from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Your line is open. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. Obviously we've spoken a bit about the foreign currency here and impact. And I was wondering if we could take it just from a different dynamic, I mean, as you look to build out the global platform, perhaps not even just from an inorganic perspective, but is there an opportunity here to leverage some of the near-term disruption in currency to accelerate some of the investments for building out certain assets in areas where your customer pull has really been driving you? And then a follow-up on that is from a capacity perspective, obviously we saw a couple of quarters ago, there was some rattling in the marketplace in terms of pricing and some builds on capacity. I would love to get an update in terms of where you're seeing sort of pricing trends right now and the capacity that you're seeing in the marketplace? Thank you very much. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, why don't I take the first one, and I want to also supplement it with a comment just on margins as well. I think like anything, when the currencies, when our functional currency, which is USD, is strong, clearly it gives you an opportunity to look at initiatives. And from our perspective, because we're already investing quite handsomely across our portfolio and across the regions, I would tell you, it's not going to make us do anything radically different, but like anything when you look at it and you look at the decisions on when to put capital to work in a given market, clearly it can work to your advantage. And so whether it's a U.S. \u2013 sorry, whether it's the Canadian dollar or the Australian dollar, or for that matter the Singaporean dollar, to the extent that we can use it to our advantage, we certainly will. I think what's most important though is, if I step back though and just talk overall about our margins, which is something I really wanted to get out, because there has been a number of questions that we've received on that. When I take, when I look at 2015, and then we look forward and the impact that currency has had on our margins, I want to sort of just walk you all through something. First and foremost with the guidance that we have delivered, we said for the year we can do greater than $1.22 billion on EBITDA line. If I take you to 2014, we did $1.114 billion, but included in that number of course are the REIT costs. And the REIT cost, recognizing most of those are going to go away, I add $17 million, say \u2013 we spent $29 million in 2014, we're only going to spend $12 million in 2015.Therefore, on an adjusted basis, our margin is 46.3%. So what we've said is, just on the guidance that we've delivered, we said we can do greater than $1.22 billion, that's 46.4% margin. As we look forward, we've announced two things that we're going to do, and Charles has talked to one, which is investing in the channel which is $20 million and integrating ALOG which is $7 million. If I add those two things back that's 47.4% margin. But the other thing, currency, because we're a U.S. dollar denominated company, a lot of our costs reside in U.S. dollars. The impact of the currency affecting our revenues and our EBITDA, it's affecting our margin by another 90 basis points. So, all that to say is when I reconcile out 2015 relative to 2014, we see basically a 48.3% margin business with some discreet investments that we're making in channel and the one-off investment in ALOG. That relative to what we exited 2014, which is really an adjusted 46.3%. So, overall we feel that the business is performing well, currency, yes is working against a little bit today, but given our ability to reallocate our resources and invest in the right things for our future growth, we think it's the right investment decisions to make. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : And then, I'll wrap up with a commentary on sort of overall pricing environment, supply/demand characteristics in the market. We tend to look at pricing in sort of two primary ways, really the most important being yield and our MRR per cab metrics. As you can see in our regional results, we saw strength across all three regions on a constant currency basis in our MRR per cab. So we continue to really benefit from how we're managing the business both in terms of entry price points on deals as well as \u2013 which is really driven by deal discipline, as well as some interconnection and then managing power densities effectively. And so those levers really have given us strong performance on a yield basis. The other dimension of pricing is really as I said entry level price points on deals and obviously the sort of supply demand characteristics in the market influence that heavily. And I guess what I would say is one, where we are \u2013 we've been very \u2013 continue to be very disciplined about the deals we are pursuing and pursuing those where we have a unique and differentiated value proposition and so continue to see firm pricing there. And even where there are \u2013 where we would want to selectively pursue, say larger footprint deals or deals where the competitive overlap with other players maybe higher. What we are seeing is, I would say a favorable balance in overall supply demand across many of our markets and a general stabilization in the pricing environment.

Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. This marks our 49th quarter of consecutive revenue growth, delivering both revenue and adjusted EBITDA significantly above the top end of our guidance ranges as demand for interconnection continues to drive strong performance in all three regions. As depicted on slide three of our presentation, despite strong currency headwinds, revenues were $643.2 million, up 1% quarter-over-quarter and up 11% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $305.7 million for the quarter, up 4% over the prior quarter and up 17% year-over-year, delivering a 48% margin. AFFO grew 28% year-over-year, $221.8 million. We continued to experience strong momentum, delivering solid gross and net bookings and healthy fundamentals, including firm MRR per cabinet on a currency-neutral basis, low churn and strong margins. I'm extremely proud that we were added to both the S&P 500 and the FTSE NAREIT indices, reflecting our scale, REIT structure and the important role that we play in the technology infrastructure industry. We're also working closely with the other REIT indices as we begin our journey in this new category. This is our first quarter reporting as a REIT and we are evolving our methods to the market as we diversify our shareholder base. We believe that many of the characteristics our traditional investor base find attractive about Equinix will translate well into the REIT domain, including our unique portfolio of assets, solid stabilized asset growth, and a long history of success with new development. We continue to roll out incremental financial data to enable our investors to track and analyze our business, including adding disclosures around NOI, NAV and owned assets. These new segments of revenue, categorized by stabilized, expansion and new, and by owned versus leased, highlight the diversity and strength of our offers. They also demonstrate how our ecosystems in interconnection translates into strong NOI, stable pricing, and recurring and predictable bookings and returns. We now have over 6,300 customers around the globe, which includes 1,400 customers from our ALOG acquisition, which we now have integrated into our metrics. Today, 68% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed in more than one region, up from 65% last year, and 82% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple metros, up from 80% last year, demonstrating the extraordinary strength of our global platform. Revenue from interconnection grew 17% year-over-year, and we added 5,500 cross-connects this quarter which takes us up to over 155,000 cross-connects across Platform Equinix. Customers in our network, content and cloud verticals are strong drivers of interconnection growth, and we're also seeing growth in interconnection from the enterprise. Cross-connects from enterprise companies to all other verticals has ramped over 30% year-over-year growth. Also, our Internet exchange traffic grew over 65% year-over-year and in response to the robust demand for high-bandwidth connectivity, we are now offering 100-gigabit port speeds to complement the 10-gigabit increments that customers have historically purchased and continues to deliver the industry's most complete interconnection portfolio. This quarter, we opened five new flagship data centers, boosting data center and interconnection capacity in the financial and network hubs of London, New York, Singapore and Toronto as well as a new metro in Melbourne, Australia. We now have 105 data centers across 33 markets, the largest global retail data center footprint, offering more than 11 million gross square feet of capacity. Given strong fill rates, particularly from cloud providers expanding in Tier 1 metros, we are moving forward with expansions in critical markets. The majority of our development pipeline for the year is focused on campus expansions and augmenting existing data centers, which helps drive operating scale and improves predictability of returns. The stability of our business model continues to deliver attractive growth on our new developments and our stabilized assets, which are tracking to over 33% yields on our gross PP&E investments. We continue to increase the number of owned data centers, including the addition of London-6 this quarter, and owned properties now generate 37% of our recurring revenue and 39% of our NOI. Many of our owned facilities are in high-demand metros, including Amsterdam, Ashburn, Frankfurt, London and Silicon Valley, and we expect NOI contribution from these assets to continue to grow as we expand in these markets and selectively pursue asset purchases in other key markets. This quarter, we invested $38 million to acquire four acres of land next to our Silicon Valley campus, which provides important expansion opportunities for this highly interconnected metro. In Ashburn, with the final expansions of DC10 and DC11 underway, we expect to start developing Ashburn North, a 44-acre plot purchased in 2012 that we intend to build out over the next seven years. Over time, we expect more of our organic growth to come from owned properties as we build out these core campuses. For the newer REIT investors, business ecosystems inside our data centers are at the heart of our strategic operating model and a significant differentiator for Equinix. Ecosystems are simply communities of customers who derive value from locating in the same data center to connect to each other to achieve greater application performance and simplify network architectures. The interconnection created as an ecosystem growth generates higher returns for our sites and increases in value to our customers. For example, some of our more mature campuses, where ecosystems are established (7:55) are the most profitable and differentiated, and we typically build new assets adjacent to these sites to capitalize on this value while de-risking our returns. Strong interconnection exists in each of our major metros and sites including those in Singapore, Frankfurt, London, Chicago, New York, Ashburn and Silicon Valley, having over 10,000 cross-connects. About 94% of our co-location square footage is in a metro with at least 1,000 cross-connects or more. Now let me shift to the quarterly highlights of our top ecosystems. Our high network density continues to create significant interconnection opportunities for a myriad of industries and is driving strong network-to-network cross-connect demand, as service providers use Platform Equinix to extend their networks and generate new revenue. Our new IBX in Melbourne is a testament to this opportunity, with more than 17 global network providers already committed to deploying in this data center. We are also enabling network service providers to deliver new cloud services by leveraging both the Equinix Cloud Exchange as well as traditional fiber cross-connects. Mobility remains a fast-growing sub-segment in the network vertical, with mobile providers, including Lycamobile, T-Mobile, and Truphone joining this emerging ecosystem. For the content and digital media industry vertical, we continue to attract top content magnates that are expanding across multiple regions. Our advertising sub-segment is thriving, propelled by the shift away from traditional advertising towards digital and mobile advertising, placed by transacting on digital exchanges, resulting in a rich and fast-growing ecosystem. Content and digital media companies are also contributing to significantly \u2013 to the parent traffic on exchanges, as well as driving growth in interconnection. Turning to our financial services vertical, we are expanding our electronic trading business across new geographies and asset classes. Wins include OANDA, a leading Canadian foreign exchange broker that is an ecosystem anchor in our Toronto 2 data center, and BATS, one of the largest equities operators in the U.S., that's expanding in London in addition to consolidating its U.S. matching engines at our Secaucus campus. Further, we continue to see progress as we diversify our financial services business to insurance, retail banking, and digital payment collectors. We have won several anchors in the emerging electronic payments ecosystem, including a key win with the largest pan-European credit card payment process. Turning to cloud and IT services, this vertical delivered strong bookings, driven by new wins and expansions with AWS, Cisco, Datapipe, Oracle, and T-Systems. We are excited about how the cloud opportunity is playing out, and we have another quarter of significant progress as cloud service providers choose Platform Equinix to support rapid global deployment. The Equinix Cloud Exchange, our interconnection switching platform that enables companies to connect directly, securely and dynamically to multiple cloud and network providers, continues to scale and now has over 120 participants and is live in 20 markets globally. Turning to the enterprise vertical, we are seeing strong momentum as enterprises move beyond the exploratory phases of cloud and are beginning to re-architect their IT infrastructure to capture the significant cost, flexibility and security benefits of hybrid cloud deployments. We are seeing strong response from both customers and channel partners through our Performance Hub offer, a solution that distributes an enterprise's data center infrastructure across multiple locations to accelerate application delivery and enable efficient secure access to key network and cloud services. Over 130 customers have deployed the Equinix Performance Hub solution, and this quarter, we saw strong growth in existing deployments as well as critical new logo wins. Notably, this quarter marked one of our largest channel deals to date, as we were able to secure a key infrastructure deployment with one of the world's largest providers of athletic apparel, the result of a highly successful joint sales engagement with Datapipe, one of our leading global partners. Other enterprise wins this quarter include BRB (12:00), a sporting goods retailer; Pella, an automotive component manufacturer; NetHealth UK (12:08) a healthcare company; Red Lobster, an American restaurant chain; Ryder, a transportation and supply chain management provider; and Valmet, a supplier of services for paper and energy industries. Expanding our global channel program is a top strategic initiative for Equinix, and we are investing significant resources to ensure our partners are well-equipped to deploying compelling IT and cloud solutions for their end customers via Platform Equinix. Along with technology partners, AWS, Cisco, Google and Microsoft, other companies that have recently joined the channel partner program include ABT (12:40), Datalink and Unitas Global. So, let me stop there and turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Great. Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone. Well as they say, the only thing better than a strong Q4 and a recurring revenue model is following it up with a strong Q1, and our Q1 results represent a great start to 2015. Our global interconnected platform continues to deliver strong gross and net bookings and this drives leverage across each of our regions. Our key operating metrics remained solid, such as net cabinets billing, MMR per cabinet and the MMR churn rate. And our interconnection trends remain very positive too, both nominally, but more importantly, the value that they bring to the health of our ecosystems. Interconnection revenues now represent 17% of our global recurring revenues, a 17% year-over-year increase with strength across each of our regions. Also, our key operating margins continued to improve. Each of our gross profit, cash gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and operating profit experienced a nice step-up this quarter. The result, a strong revenue pull-through and lower than planned costs. We remain pleased with our performance, while consistent with our comments from the last earnings call, we do plan to continue to invest in our go-to-market strategy and other key initiatives through the end of this year. Yet, given the success of the first quarter, as Steve will discuss shortly, we're now able to increase our adjusted EBITDA guidance on a currency-neutral basis by $17 million for the year. So, one additional comment before I get into the earnings slides; we're very pleased to have completed our first quarter operating and reporting as a REIT and of course, this includes the issuance of our first quarterly recurring cash dividend. We continue to expect to receive our favorable PLR in 2015 and look forward to sharing the news with you when received. Now moving to the slides, as depicted on slide four, global Q1 revenues were $643.2 million, up 1% quarter-over-quarter and up 11% over the same quarter last year. We're now in our 13th year of consecutive quarterly revenue growth. Our revenues' over-performance was due to a number of factors, including favorable net pricing actions and higher than expected custom installation activities. Q1 revenues, net of our FX hedges, absorbed a $9.5 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rates last quarter and a $1.5 million negative currency impact when compared to our FX guidance rates. Although currency volatility across all of our operating currencies continues to cause significant FX headwinds, we put in place net cash flow hedges covering greater than 80% of the value at risk related to our EMEA operating currencies. This provides for a smooth flight path into 2016. Global cash SG&A expenses decreased to $145.3 million for the quarter, primarily due to lower-than-planned advertising and promotion expenses as well as the one-off sales commission expense incurred in Q4 due to the change in our internal policy. We expect our cash SG&A expenses on a quarterly basis to remain roughly flat for the rest of the year. Global adjusted EBITDA was $305.7 million, up above the top end of our guidance range and up 17% year-over-year. This was driven by stronger-than-anticipated cash gross margins, the result of lower-than-expected utility rates, and the favorable FX hedges in EMEA. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 48%. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a negative $800,000 currency impact when compared to our average rates used last quarter, and a $3 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance range. Global net income was $76.5 million or diluted earnings per share of $1.34, a strong step up from last quarter which was impacted by the write-off of our deferred tax assets due to the reconversion and a loss in debt extinguishment related to our Q4 financings. Our Q1 operating cash flow increased over the prior quarter to $232.8 million, largely due to lower cash interest and taxes, and a reduction in our net working capital position. Our Q1 MMR churn was below our expectations of 1.9%, although including ALOG we'll be reporting 2%. We continue to expect our quarterly MRR churn rate to be at the lower end of our 2% to 2.5% guidance range over the remainder of the year. And one final note before I just discuss the regional performance. Our non-financial metric sheet is now fully consolidated including ALOG, with one exception. We do not include ALOG revenues in our MRR per cabinet metric, given the level of managed services in the revenue line. Also, as part of the Equinix Customer One initiative, we've upgraded and automated our inventory tracking systems. Also, we've globally standardized the cabinet equivalent definition and as a result we have updated our cabinets billing by utilization at our MRR per cabinet metrics, including the comparable periods to incorporate this change. As you can see, this change left our operating trends intact. Now turning to slide five, I'd like to start reviewing our regional results beginning with the Americas. The Americas had a strong revenues quarter, the result of favorable net pricing actions, lower-than-planned MRR churn and an 8% quarter-over-quarter increase in our non-recurring revenues, largely the result of increased custom installation activity. Americas adjusted EBITDA was up 4% over the prior quarter and 17% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, largely due to strong cash gross margins offset in part by the higher seasonal FICA charges. Americas interconnection revenues now represent 22% of the region's recurring revenues, and we added 1,800 net cross-connects. Americas' net cabinets billing increased by 1,200 in the quarter, and we added 85 exchange ports in Q1, which included the sale of our first six 100-gig ports. Now looking at EMEA, please turn to slide six. EMEA delivered another strong quarter, with particular strength coming from our Dutch and German businesses, although FX continued to impact our as-reported results. Revenues were up 5% quarter-over-quarter and 19% year-over-year on a normalizing constant-currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA, on a normalizing constant-currency basis, was up 13% over the prior quarter, and 28% over the same quarter of last year largely due to a 17% quarter-over-quarter decrease in SG&A, the result of a strong U.S. dollar and the $3 million hedge benefit. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 46%, although normalized for the FX benefit, adjusted EBITDA margin would have been 44%. Due to strong traction in our cloud vertical, including momentum from our support of large cloud providers, like Azure and AWS, we had another solid quarter of cross-connects adding 1,500 net cross-connects in the quarter. EMEA interconnection revenues represent 9% of the region's recurring revenues. EMEA MRR per cabinet was up 2% on a constant-currency basis. Net cabinets billing increased by 900. And now looking at Asia-Pacific, please refer to slide seven. In Asia-Pacific, we had record gross and net bookings this quarter. Revenues were up 4% over the prior quarter, and up 25% over the same quarter last year on a normalizing constant-currency basis, driven by strong sales momentum in cloud and IT services, enterprise and network verticals. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and a constant-currency basis was up 6% over the prior quarter, and 30% over the same quarter last year, largely due to a 4% decrease in Q1 SG&A, the result of a strong U.S. dollar and lower-than-expected discretionary spending. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 50%. MRR per cabinet, on a constant-currency basis, was up 2% quarter-over-quarter and cabinets billing increased by 900 over the prior quarter. We added a record 2,200 net cross-connects. Interconnection revenues remained at 12% of the region's recurring revenues. Now as we continue to scale our APAC business, we have eight expansions currently underway across six metros, including new phases of our newly opened IBXs in Melbourne and Singapore. Also, given the success in the Sydney market, we're now proceeding with the building of our Sydney 4 asset to capture this opportunity. And now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to slide eight. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and our net debt remains consistent with the prior quarter. Our net debt leverage ratio decreased slightly to 2.9 times our Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA, the result of stronger operating performance and a higher-than-expected cash balance at the end of the quarter. A significant portion of this cash will be consumed throughout the remainder of the year, largely from the payment of our quarterly dividends and special distribution, the funding of our capital expenditures, and the payment of liabilities on our balance sheet. We continue to have a tremendous strategic and operational flexibility built into our balance sheet and capital structure. This allows us to continue to plan for growth and meet the funding needs for our shareholder distributions. Now switching to AFFO and dividends on slide nine, for 2015, we now expect AFFO to be greater than $830 million, or growing 15% on a constant currency basis, the benefit of a strong operating performance and a decrease in our planned net interest expense. Our AFFO payout ratio decreased slightly to 46%. Also, as noted previously, we paid our first regular cash dividend and expect to announce our Q2 dividend shortly. Important to note that the taxable income from the QRS part of the business ultimately drives the dividend payout requirements. As you may appreciate, there isn't always a direct correlation between AFFO and our REIT taxable income. As an example, AFFO represents a global consolidated metric, whereas the REIT taxable income solely relates to our QRS entities. We continue to expect to distribute 100% of our QRS's taxable income. Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to slide 10. For the quarter, CapEx was $150.1 million, including recurring capital expenditures of $22 million, lower than our guidance range, primarily due to timing of cash payments. As presented on the expansion tracking slide, we currently have 19 announced expansion projects underway across the globe, of which 18 are cabinets builds or incremental phase builds on over 15 markets. We continue to believe that spreading our capital expenditures across multiple regions in phases is the best way to invest in our growth. These 19 projects will increase our current inventory by 10%. We expect our recurring CapEx to remain consistent with our prior expectations of $115 million. Turning to slide 11. The operating performance of our stabilized 76 global IBX and expansion projects that have been open for more than one year continued to perform well. Revenues were up 6% year-over-year and we continue to enjoy healthy yields on the stabilized assets, reflecting the premium value that is placed on these assets. Currently, these projects generate a 33% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested and are at 84% utilized on our recalibrated available inventory capacity. So before handing the call back to Steve, I would like to remind you that we've appended our supplemental financial and operating data deck to the earnings presentation starting on slide 16. There are a number of incremental disclosures including details related to how we segment our business between expansion and stabilized assets over our owned and leased portfolio. Of note, you'll see that our cash gross profit grew 14% over the prior year, our adjusted cash NOI increased 15% over the prior year to 61%, and our corporate cash SG&A as a percent of total revenues decreased to 9%. And finally, we provided you with the key components to our NAV on slide 30. So now, I'll turn back the call to Steve. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thanks, Keith. Let me know cover our 2015 outlook on slide 15. For the second quarter of 2015, we expect revenues to be in the range of $654 million to $658 million, which includes $6 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to average Q1 2015 rates and normalized in constant currency growth of 3% quarter-over-quarter. Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68% to 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $144 million to $148 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $304 million and $308 million, which include $5 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to average Q1 2015 rates. Capital expenditures are expected to be $210 million to $220 million, which includes approximately $30 million of recurring capital expenditures. For the full year of 2015, we are raising revenues to be greater than $2.635 billion or a 13% year-over-year growth rate on a normalized and constant currency basis. This guidance includes $25 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to prior guidance rates. Excluding this negative impact, the revised revenues is a $30 million increase compared to our prior guidance. Total year cash gross margins are expected to approximate 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $580 million to $600 million. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to be greater than $1.23 billion or a 47% adjusted EBITDA margin. This guidance includes $7 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to prior guidance rates. Excluding this negative impact, the revised adjusted EBITDA is a $17 million increase compared to prior guidance. We expect adjusted funds from operations to be greater than $830 million, a 15% constant currency growth year-over-year, effectively a $26 million raise adjusting for currencies. We expect 2015 capital expenditures to range between $740 million and $800 million, which includes $115 million of recurring capital expenditures. So in closing, our strong results this quarter reflect the continued strength and momentum in our business. The global reach of Platform Equinix along with unparalleled network and cloud density and thriving business ecosystems positions us to solve the many challenges faced by today's CIOs. The strength and uniqueness of our global platform is translating into solid operating performance and the importance of our reach is evidenced by the rapid growth of customers deployed across multiple metros and regions. Our disciplined execution of our strategy continues to drive momentum as we strike a balance between revenue growth, margin expansion, yield and attractive returns on our invested capital. So, let me stop here and open it up for questions. So, I'll turn it over to you, Leslie. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And we have our first question coming from the line of Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays. Sir, your line is open. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much and good afternoon, folks. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Amir. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I was wondering if you could talk a bit about sort of margin progression here. I mean obviously, there's been a lot of puts and takes : the conversion to the REIT reinvestment and supporting channel expansion. Obviously, if we look at particularly on adjusted basis with your EBITDA guidance there is a tick-up in expectation. Just trying to think about sort of how the longer term progress margins are particularly when we look at sort of where your longer term targets were and how we should think about the trajectory and the ability to get that level? Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : I think it's a great question, Amir. I mean so, most fundamentally we're very much committed as a company to driving towards our 50% EBITDA margin target or better and clearly, we showed a little bit of momentum when we issued our guidance at the first part of this year assuming when you adjusted for currency. And then coming out of the first quarter, we're able to moderate that up slightly as well. So very pleased with the direction in which it's going. I'd tell you though as you sort of step back, Q2 \u2013 in my comments I said, look, SG&A you should expect it to be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. So, as a result, what I think you're going to get as you sort of progress through the year absent some of the timing issues that we're going to see in Q2 is a bias towards an upward trend through the latter part of fiscal year 2015. And that positions us very good as we go into 2016. My only comment would then be to continue to look at and assess where we need to make investments and to the extent that we can create value and further the business opportunity we have in front of us, we'll continue to make those investments. So I don't want to pre-commit to where 2016 will be, but suffice it to say the direction is very, very positive as we exit 2015. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So perhaps a quick follow-up there; if we think about 2016 then from a directional perspective, given some of the moving factors that have impacted you folks in \u2013 or expected to impact you folks in 2015, should we expect that sort of directional upward bias? Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : We certainly believe there's an upward bias, but again we want to reserve the right similar to what we did this year. We took some of the money that we were going \u2013 that we were in fact saving from the REIT project and we decided to put it back into the business because it made infinite sense to go invest in our go-to-market strategy and all the components around that. Again, as we look into 2016, we'll make that decision as we get closer to time but my message to you would be right now there's an upward bias as we exit the year. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much for the incremental color. Operator : Thank you. And we have the next question coming from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut. Sir, your line is open. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : Good evening. Thanks for taking the questions, two if I may. First, in terms of the revenue outlook for the year, given the 1Q report in the midpoint of the 2Q guide implies a fairly slow ramp in the third quarter and fourth quarter, I don't know, maybe $11 million or $12 million sequential net revenue growth. So I was just wondering if there's any sort of churn or other things in that number as we look out the remainder of the year that should \u2013 that we should be aware of? And then as a second question, you've had another strong quarter of bookings here, and I'm wondering if you might update us on sort of your visibility, level of confidence and so looking into the future, commencement lag, things like that, that allow you to raise the guide for the remainder of the year? Thanks. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Good questions, Jonathan, let me take the first one and then I'll perhaps pass it to Steve or Charles for the second. I think first and foremost when you look at our guide for Q2 on a revenue basis, when you adjust for currency, so take out the benefit of the hedge that's sitting in revenues in Q1 and you adjust for basically the forward exchange rate, you're looking at about a 3% quarter-over-quarter increase. And so we're happy with where we sit with Q2. As we look into Q3 and Q4 similar to what \u2013 as we came out of last year, we're less comfortable in predicting the amount of non-recurring activity that we have in the latter half of the year. And that's what we experienced this quarter. Part of the reason for the over-performance is we saw \u2013 we did more non-recurring activities than originally anticipated. And I'd tell you that we hold that \u2013 we're holding that path forward, sort of bypass through for the latter part of the year as well. That coupled with the fact that there is some seasonality in, just in our booking activity. So there's a little bit of churn that we know that's forthcoming and yet I feel very comfortable with the 2% to 2.5% range and probably biased more towards again the lower end of the range, but relative to where we've come from we'll have slightly more elevated churn in the latter part of the year based on what we see. And then the last part is just timing, timing of when we install, and there's a recognition as we roll out our global, our global systems. Like anything, that can create some level of drag and we're just being a little bit conservative right now, until we actually roll those out and start operating it, if you will, with those new systems. Americas is May; Europe is going to be in the July timeframe, and so we're going to go through that implementation cycle. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And Jonathan, let me start and Charles might have some comments here to add on to this. But on the bookings question and visibility, as you heard from the comments today and from the previous quarter, we've had a very good start, strong start to 2015. And you see the results in increasing top-line guidance for 13% year-on-year constant currency growth. And across all the industry verticals we're seeing very good activity. We've got good coverage ratios. The pipeline is strong. We're holding yields across all three regions. The impact of the investments that we've been talking about with channel professional services, the innovation that our marketing team is doing with our product, the enterprise awareness activities, the sales enablement stuff, so all the investments that were bundled into that $20 million message we gave you last quarter, are all taking hold, and you can see the results showing up across all industry verticals. So, Charles, you may have a comment or two to add to that? Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : No. I think you hit most of the key ones from my perspective. I would say that one of the things that is not evident; we did make some adjustments to our sales structure and territory alignment and account allocations in the first quarter, which inevitably creates a little bit of drag. And yet, I think we powered through that, delivered strong results. And the objective of that alignment was really to ensure that we continue to capture the momentum that we're seeing in the cloud ecosystem overall, both on the supply side with cloud service providers, and on the demand side, if you will, or the buy side with enterprises. And those two verticals are generating about 60% of our new logos, continued strong momentum in bookings and new wins there, and as Steve said, the key metrics like funnel size, conversion, rep productivity, book-to-bill interval, all looking solid. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Jonathan. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jonathan. Operator : Thank you. We have our next question coming from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks so much, and thanks a lot for the new disclosure. It's very helpful. I'm looking at page 25, the same-store operating performance and you've broken out the stabilized and expansion. As you mentioned earlier, the stabilized return on gross PP&E was 33%. The expansion is 19%, up from 15%, a nice year-over-year improvement. Perhaps you could just talk us through how the 19% evolves over time. Is that tied to utilization and is it reasonable to think that that becomes 33% over \u2013 or something else, four years or five years in, gets up to that sort of stabilized level? So any color around that would be great. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Simon, just so I'm making sure that you and I are looking at the same thing, so when you're looking at the percent growth year-over-year, when you talk about the 19% in the expansion, is that what you want us to refer to? Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: It's the cash return on gross PP&E, the last column on that page. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Okay. Generally from our perspective, I think there's a couple of things. Clearly, as you think about our stabilized assets, again those are assets that have been \u2013 all phases have been open for more than one year, and effectively that one year for us is January 1 \u2013 starting January 1, 2014, looking at that relative to the expansion activity. Our sense is when you think about expansion, because an expansion could be two, three and, in some cases, four more phases, you can appreciate that the net sort of the drag, if you will, perhaps taking on that full obligation whether it's a lease, whether it's the land and other related costs. Until you get more to more fully utilize, you're not going to get the economic return that you're looking for relative to a stabilized asset. So as a result, this is a path, if you will, that's very consistent with our expectation, recognizing there's a relatively large portfolio of assets. There's 31 assets in the expansion bucket. They're going to be at all different levels of delivery, if you will. And so probably leaving it with you, I think you're going to see that number move up and towards the 33% as we continue to pass time and then fully utilize those assets. And the other thing I'd leave you with is the team has done a very good job over the years recognizing stabilized assets are only 84% utilized, the team does a very good job of optimizing the assets. So not only do I continue to expect the expansion to move up, quite openly we also expect the stabilized to move up into the right as well. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. That's helpful. Thank you. Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, the only color I might add to it, Simon, is that I think there's \u2013 if you look at the mix of the stabilized asset group there and the expansion asset group there, there would certainly be no reason to believe that the long-term performance would be meaningfully different since they're likely to have similar mixes. And so it's just a matter in some cases if they're very large, large-scale projects, it may take a longer period because they're multi-phases of investment but would trend towards that endpoint. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And we have our next question coming from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Sir, your line is open. David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Good quarter. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess two if I could. Just, Keith, number one on the dividend, obviously we don't see the QRS or kind of have a picture of where the growth trajectory for the QRS which is going to fuel the dividend growth is. Could you kind of address what we should be expecting on that front and whether you have an appetite to reflect the QRS growth in a quarterly or annual fashion in the dividend? And then the second question on the balance sheet, we've dipped now below the long term leverage target; if you went back to the midpoint, we could buy back 5% of the stock. You've been very cautious about using the balance sheet as you kind of went into the reprocess, because there were obviously reasons to kind of be cautious and keep dry powder, but what can we expect Equinix is going to do for shareholders in terms of using that balance sheet on a go-forward basis? Thanks. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Two very good questions, David. Let me start with the dividend. I think first and foremost, as you know, when we issued our dividend at roughly $1.69 per share on a quarterly basis and we said annualize that at $6.76 per share, or roughly a 3% yield where the stock was trading at the time, and so we're very, very comfortable with that, recognizing this is the transitional year for us as a company, transition in the sense that we're being very mindful of the assets that should be inside the Q and those assets that sit outside in the T, primarily to limit the amount of taxes we pay and certainly at the same time meet the REIT requirements. So what I would like to leave you with at least for 2015 is right now make the assumption at least for next quarter that we're going to hold things stable. As we look forward, as you think a little bit about the assets that sit outside of the Q, so you have Canada, Australia, Singapore, and Hong Kong, which are the big four, that's going to give us the flexibility to change, if you will, the dynamics in what that dividend will be, in addition though to effecting the growth. It's fair to say that a lot of the assets, particularly Europe, which most of Europe sits inside the Q, that's going to continue to grow. And as we said on a currency adjusted basis it grew 19% this quarter over same quarter last year, and all of last year grew at 21% over the prior year. So we're very confident and comfortable that we think that there's going to be good, if you will, growth in the Q, so that that allows us to continue to manage, if you will, the dividend on a go-forward basis. As it relates to balance sheet, you're absolutely right. It's \u2013 we sort of anticipated that this question might be forthcoming. Part of the reason I put in disclosure is that a good portion of the cash that sits on the balance sheet, the $1.1 billion, just from what we see today a good portion of that's going to get fully consumed. And that's effectively \u2013 we consume almost \u2013 for all intents and purposes, that reflects one turn, if you will, of net leverage. And so from our perspective, if we consume that capital, which we \u2013 or cash, which we intend to, our leverage is going to get into a much more, it'll get within the guidance range that we have shared with you. And then the last piece I would tell you is to the extent we always \u2013 it's fair to say we always think of highest and best use of our capital, and right now given the success that we're seeing in the business, if anything you're going to see more of a bias towards continuing to invest in our future, which means investing more in the capital expenditure side of the equation and less about maybe some of the other alternatives we could use with the cash. David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks, Keith. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is coming from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Sir, your line is open. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two if I could, one follow-up and an additional question. So when you're talking about I think the utilization of the stabilized assets and the opportunity to increase utilization on the expansion assets, where do you see the long-term utilization for stabilized assets? What's the mature level that you think on average each asset can get to? And then secondly, if you could talk a little bit more \u2013 at the beginning of the call, I think, Steve, you mentioned that part of the revenue growth in the quarter was based on some favorable pricing. I'm curious if you can go into little bit more depth as to where you saw the pricing and maybe what was different about this quarter maybe relative to the last few quarters in terms of the pricing commentary? Thank you. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : So let me take the first one, then I'll pass it to Steve and Charles for the second one. As it relates to stabilized assets, right now as I said we're at 84% utilized. I think for all intents and purposes we would target between we think 90% or greater, and realistically somewhere between 90% and 95% is a realistic assumption that we should be able to drive our utilization level to. I think that's an area of comfort, Michael, that over a period of time recognizing some of these assets we're very selective in how we fill them up. And what I mean by that, if it's a network dense asset and we don't have a lot of incremental capacity, we're willing to let that asset sit there for a period of time looking for the right customer with the right application to go into that asset. And so once we get there, I think it's reasonable to assume you're 90%-plus utilized. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And on the revenue growth and favorable pricing, Mike, I'll just give you a little color, and maybe Keith and Charles might have something to add. But I mentioned in my comments in the beginning that yield across all regions continues to be strong, and actually, our global yields was up $40 or 2% quarter-on-quarter on a constant currency basis. So that was roughly 0.5% in the Americas, 2% in Asia and Europe, so pretty strong pricing in the regions, primarily because of the focus that our sales and marketing teams have on targeting specific workloads and focusing our value propositions around that type of application workload. And as \u2013 historically as we've always mentioned, blended in with that, where appropriate we're pursuing larger magnetic footprints that are helping the overall ecosystem value. And you should expect us to continue to compete for those, that'll advance our cloud agenda, but generally speaking we're doing a very good job of qualifying and bringing the right types of workloads into the right locations, and that's served us very well from a churn perspective and that's served us very well from a MRR per cab, and we expect it to remain firm, going forward. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Operator : All right. Thank you. And our next question is from Jonathan Atkin from RBC. Sir, your line is open. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yes. I wonder if you could comment on M&A, just given some of the recent news around (47:04-47:09) and then, thinking about kind of the European Telecity Interxion situation. Any reaction from your customer, any commercial changes that you're seeing (47:18-47:23)? Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jonathan, we did not hear all of that. I think I have the gist of your question, which was to comment on M&A and the activity we see around the world. Is that the gist of it? Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. M&A, and then specifically whether your European business is seeing any impacts from the pending deal going on in Europe between Interxion and Telecity. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, sure. Sure. I'll start and maybe Charles, you might \u2013 if you have anything to add, please jump in here. Fair to say, guys, that we have our eyes on the same consolidating activity that you're all reading about in our industry. We're still focused, as I mentioned last quarter, on our inorganic strategy to extend our current leadership position around cloud and network density, secondly around scaling our platform, and then third around enhancing our interconnection position. So we're always evaluating options to accomplish those three objectives, and we'll continue to do that. And if there was a transaction that might complement that strategy and create significant shareholder value, you should feel confident that we'll consider it. But in terms of our Europe business, we're continuing to be very pleased with what's going over there. And our results off last quarter and certainly this quarter, as we mentioned in previous calls, our business in Europe grew 21% last year. And on a first quarter year-on-year basis grew 19% in this first quarter. So our European business, because it's connected to a global platform, is growing faster than the broader EU market. And as you also heard we have significant momentum on interconnection in Europe. So all in all, yes, we're watching this stuff and our business in Europe we're very happy with. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then on the cloud growth, I'm interested, is that becoming more indexed towards top five global platforms? Or is that more diversified or becoming more diversified to smaller cloud operations? Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Charles, do you want... Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : I'll take that, Steve. I think it's a combination of those things. We certainly see strong momentum with I would say the top six to eight cloud providers that I think you would immediately think of. And they are \u2013 most of them are deploying now with us in anywhere from 8 to 16-plus markets around the world. And we're seeing significant activity, not only in their deployments but I think more excitingly cross-connect activity and Cloud Exchange activity driving interconnection back to those clouds from within our facilities, which is really the essence of the sort of building the cloud ecosystem. And so \u2013 but then we also are really seeing good new logo capture and growth with existing new logos in a bit more of the longer tail around cloud service providers in a variety of forms. And so I think it's both, and I think both are really critically important because I think that what we're seeing is that those big magnets like an Azure or an AWS are often the catalyst for somebody to say, yes, I need high bandwidth secure connectivity into these cloud providers as I begin to move workloads into the cloud. But then they \u2013 as they evolve their hybrid cloud they really want access to a much broader range of cloud services as quickly and cost-effectively as possible and the ability to seamlessly and efficiently move workloads across various cloud providers. So both seeing good momentum and both critical to long-term health of the ecosystem. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : All right. Thank you. And we have our last question coming from the line of Tim Horan from Oppenheimer. Sir, your line is open. Tim K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks, guys. Do you expect the average size of the customer to keep getting \u2013 maybe start getting smaller at this point as you move more to the enterprise market? It seems like you've kind of focused on the major cloud providers the last couple years, building up the cloud exchanges and, correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm assuming enterprises are now starting to use you guys to connect to these exchanges. And I guess have we hit the tipping point with enterprises? Thanks. Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, I'll start, Steve, and if you or Keith want to jump in. I would say yes. I think that the business will trend that way over time. I wouldn't say we've reached a tipping point per se in that I think we have a lot \u2013 are in the very early innings of enterprise adoption of hybrid cloud. But again, we're seeing good momentum. Our lighthouse accounts are showing very strong land-and-expand type performance with some of our key customers, starting with two to three locations and rapidly expanding in their Performance Hub implementations to 6, 10, even 20 sites. And so what I think we will see is an extremely favorable trend for us, which is average deal size for a new \u2013 or average implementation size perhaps trending somewhat down, although balanced in part by the fact that we're going to continue to selectively pursue strategic large footprint type activity where it's really accretive to the strategy. But I think, we will see average implementation size trend down as we really gain some traction in the enterprise, both through our direct force and our channel. But interestingly, I think that the \u2013 we'll begin \u2013 we'll be able to grow those customers over time and so see the average billing volume for a customer continue to be strong. So I do think we will see that trend. I think it's a very favorable trend potentially for our yield over time. But I think it's still very early days. Tim K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We still have a next question coming from the line of Mike McCormack from Jefferies. Sir, your line is open. Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks. Maybe, Keith, just a clarification on some of the cost being brought into Q2, which I'm assuming are in the guide. But the utilities, the discretionary spend, and the merit increases, I assume that's all part of the guidance, the $308 million? And then secondly, the interest expense decrease and revised capital interest, can you just give us a little more clarity on that? Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Yeah, Mike, you're dead on. Just as we look to Q2, so not only do we have the merit increases that took effect in March, so we see that, if you will, the cost associated with that moving into Q2 and beyond, we have all the new head count, so all the \u2013 of the new hires. Then we have a higher utility line coming in in Q2 as well. As you know, typically from a seasonal perspective, our highest cost of utility comes in the second quarter and the third quarter in the Americas region. And so we're absorbing roughly another, if my memory serves, it's another $6 million to $8 million of utilities in the second quarter relative to what we were going to spend in Q1. And then there's \u2013 we're continuing to progress with our integration of the ALOG investment. And so we spent about $1 million in Q1 on the ALOG integration and so we expect to spend more in Q2 also with the rollout of our eco initiative. All that to say is there's some timing and, therefore, that's why you see \u2013 despite that you see some step downs costs that we had in Q1 will be replaced with costs that I just talked about in Q2. And then we think that we can hold our SG&A relatively flat for the rest of the year. As it relates then to just the net interest expense my reference to the fact that there's a certain amount of interest that gets capitalized into our assets and it was roughly a $12 million change from what we previously disclosed. And because of that, although you see an improving AFFO the real value of the AFFO increase at this stage of the game was the improved operating performance. $10 million was really to capitalization and that, of course, that has no meaning. Even though our AFFO payout ratio goes down, there is no fundamental shift that really took place because that capitalized interest it gets treated differently for tax purposes. So that's the primary reason for the interest step down. Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks, guys. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. And our very last question coming from the line of Colby Synesael from Cowen & Company. Sir, your line is open. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you for fitting me in. So I just want to talk about the competitive landscape for a moment. It seems like there's just a lot going on, whether it's some of the wholesale guys trying to offer more retail products, everybody I guess to some degree trying to offer some form of interconnection whether it's with Open IX or their own exchanges, increasing demand it seems like for colocation facilities in Tier 2 markets, even metered power to some degree seeming to squeeze into the sub-500 kW type deals. I was wondering if you could just comment on what if any impact you're seeing from some of these trends that I just mentioned. And then the second thing is as customers do start to ask for more flexibility in what they want from you, whether it's in terms of what we'd refer to as wholesale space or bigger space or perhaps even different power requirements, is it going to require that you start to be more flexible in how you build your facilities? And could that over time change the cost on a per megawatt basis that you're investing when you build out a facility? Thanks. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We're seeing all those things, Colby. Charles, do you want to take a crack and I'll... Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. I'll jump in, you guys can add color. You're right. Steve's absolutely right. We're seeing all those things at some level, although what I would argue is that continued \u2013 we've said over and over again we're focused on getting the right applications, right customers with the right applications into the right assets. And that really centers around this sort of ecosystem-centric strategy. And so I think if we're disciplined in that strategy I think that we see that the dynamics of the \u2013 some of the competitive things that you're \u2013 that you referenced have a much lesser or more marginal impact on our business. I think that you're right, certainly wholesalers \u2013 some of the wholesalers are indicating a desire to \u2013 and offer smaller footprints and begin to dabble in the retail space. As I've said on a number of calls before, the requirements to operate a world-class at-scale retail business and the investments necessary to do that are substantial. And I think what we're finding is that customers who really need the application performance, the global reach, the mission critical reliability for these retail-type applications are typically choosing Equinix based on the superior value delivered. And so while I think there's probably some, as I've said, minor overlap between our businesses in terms of workloads that could be pursued by those types of players, if we're consistent and disciplined in our strategy I think we're seeing relatively limited impact. You mentioned Open IX and a broader desire for people to talk about it and try to offer interconnection. I think that's also true, but I think the substance that we see in the market as compared to the hype and the PR, we see a big difference between those things. And I think we feel very confident that we have a \u2013 the interconnection portfolio in terms of both offers and reach that really is delivering the value to customers. So again, we see very limited impact there. In fact, the momentum continues in our IX, our Internet Exchange offering. We've sold more ports in the last four quarters than we did in the last several years, and really continuing to see incredible strength in that market. So customers are kind of voting with their wallets. So \u2013 and then to the last question about is our need to and our desire to at least be able to in a targeted way pursue large footprint opportunities that we think are strategic control points, does that modify the way we think about our facilities? I would say yes to some degree, but that and a number of other factors have us constantly revisiting whether or not the design of our facilities and our ability to implement a flexible architecture and one where we can match capital spend as quickly and as closely to demand as possible, that's always an objective of the business. And so we definitely have resources. And in fact, have increased the number of resources we've spent looking at that opportunity. And we think we will continue to evolve the offer to be as just-in-time as possible and as flexible as possible to meet the range of requirements that our customers are asking for. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Thanks, Charles. Colby, that was very thorough. And I \u2013 the only thing I'd add to that to \u2013 it was a great question because there's a lot of activity going on. I think, as I said in the comments in the beginning today, our strategy is working, you see the results from the firm yield and the other metrics, interconnection continues to grow, we feel like we're executing on all the right items, so you should expect us to continue this, more of the same. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Katrina Rymill - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. That concludes our Q1 call. Thank you for joining us today.

This momentum reflects our strategic position in the digital economy and the value of our global platform in addressing customer needs. Additionally, we are extremely well positioned to capture a sizable share of enterprise demand, driven by a variety of factors, including a rapid adoption of hybrid cloud as the architecture of choice. As depicted on slide 3, revenues were $665.6 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 10% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $311.3 million for the quarter, up 2% over the prior quarter and up 13% year-over-year, delivering a 47% margin. AFFO grew 18% year-over-year to $221.4 million. The benefits of operational discipline and a strategic approach to meeting customer demand, continued to manifest and stable pricing, firm yields, and one of the lowest churn quarters on record. We now have 6,300 customers around the globe, including more than 100 of the Fortune 500. Over 4,000 Equinix employees support our operations, product development and the execution of our go-to-market strategy, to offer the only global interconnection platform in the largest retail data center footprint worldwide. With over 161,000 cross connects and vibrant use of our internet and cloud exchange offers, we sit at the crossroads of the internet, where customers locate inside Equinix to innovate and accelerate their businesses. Interconnection is 17% of our recurring revenue, making it a $400 million annual business, $400 million. The scope, scale, reach and diversity of our platform remain without parallel. We are continuing to invest in systems, processes and people, to ensure consistent service delivery on a global basis and manage the complexities associated with a massively scaled retail business, rapidly approaching 20,000 customer deployments and generating over 0.5 million customer interactions each quarter. We are now live across all regions with Equinix Customer One; our initiative to streamline our 'Quote to Cash' process and standardize our products and services worldwide. This is a major milestone in our drive for global consistency and a critical capability to scale our sales engine and provide a high quality experience for customers. The importance of global selling is reflected in the business we are winning. Today, over 50% of our revenue comes from customers deployed globally across all three regions and over 80% is from customers deployed across multiple metros, showcasing how customers leverage platform Equinix to support their businesses. Turning to the Telecity acquisition, we continue to expect this compelling combination to deliver solid value to shareholders of both companies. Telecity announced solid quarterly results this morning, which were consistent with our expectations. Regarding the regulatory status of the deal, Equinix has received approval of our request to work through the EU Commission to secure clearance for the acquisition and the efficient process that will use a single regulatory authority to evaluate this transaction. In anticipation of the expected close in the first half of 2016, we have multiple teams working together to map out an immigration plan and determine the optimal organizational structures. We continue to believe the deal offers the opportunity to increase networking cloud density to better serve customers and will enhance our existing European portfolio. As it relates to the broader M&A landscape, we have our eye on the consolidation activity happening in our industry, and will continue to be both proactive and highly selective in pursuit of opportunities that we believe complement our strategy and create significant shareholder value. Interconnection is a critical source of sustaining value for Equinix and we continue to invest here, in order to maintain market leadership and execute on our highly differentiated strategy which is centered on creating and curating digital ecosystems. Revenue from interconnection grew 15% year-over-year and we added over 6,100 cross connects this quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter delivering at this level. Connection to cloud providers from buyers across all vertical markets is a strong driver of interconnection; and we also see growth in connectivity among content in network companies, as the exponential growth in data drives the need for more pairing. Our digital exchange has experienced a sizable increase in both traffic and ports, with a step up of 158 ports added on our internet exchange. Fiber and ecosystems where multiple customers are interconnected within a datacenter, generate attractive returns. Our portfolio of stabilized assets continues to grow at 4% and is tracking to over 32% yields on our gross PP&E investments. The majority of our development pipeline is allocated to current campus expansions to meet demands of existing customers and achieve operational scale that maximizes returns, while mitigating risk. Now let me shift to cover the quarterly highlights from our vertical industries. Inside our datacenters, networks, clouds IT service companies and enterprises are interconnecting to offer businesses, improve service delivery and performance by putting systems, applications and data closer to end users. In the network vertical, we delivered solid growth this quarter, with network expansions across all regions to support traffic growth and deliver new cloud services. Network-to-cloud-cross connects doubled year-over-year, as providers deploy new routes to connect traffic and services. There are a variety of catalysts generating growth in the network segment, including mobile computing, which is changing how service providers and enterprises interact. Equinix is benefiting from the proliferation of mobile applications and content, with increased demand driving new interconnection activity. Mobile operators and major content companies are using Equinix data centers to peer mobile content, aggregate networks, facilitate mobile payments, and deploy roaming exchanges. For the content and digital media vertical, growth was driven by global expansions from players including Criteo, a global French technology company specializing in performance marketing; and Tencent, a Chinese media and entertainment and internet firm. We are also seeing an emerging opportunity to support media and entertainment companies that are moving workloads to the cloud, leveraging Equinix and the cloud services inside our facilities to collaborate on production and editing. Turning to the financial services vertical, we see continued diversification in this segment, with a series of lighthouse wins in insurance, electronic payments and asset management. New customers this quarter include AIA, a top Asian insurance firm. Currenex, a top 10 foreign exchange, that is deploying performance hub, as well as its matching engine in our Secaucus campus; and a top five global asset management firm that is deploying across Asia. Turning now to cloud and IT services, we are experiencing continued momentum across the cloud ecosystem, which drove strong bookings this quarter, as major cloud players such as AWS, Datapipe, Oracle and ServiceNow continue to expand. Last quarter, we were a major partner of both Microsoft's worldwide partner conference, and a Google Cloud Platform Global Roadshow, where developers and partners were educated on how to leverage our industry leading cloud exchange capabilities. Software based provisioning and control capabilities offered by the Equinix Cloud Exchange are a critical innovation in allowing customers to dynamically create and manage private, secure virtual connections to multiple cloud services over a single port. We continue to see momentum on the exchange, which is live in 21 markets globally, and has over 180 customers provisioned. In the second quarter, this solution was awarded the most innovative carrier cloud service by Light Reading, a powerful recognition of our progress and our commitment to delivering steady innovation. To-date, our effort to build cloud density inside Equinix has primarily been focused on private connectivity. Particularly for leading infrastructure-as-service platforms, including AWS, Microsoft Azure and the Google Cloud platform. As customers expand their use of hybrid cloud, we are responding to offer cloud connectivity options, that significantly improve the end user experience for a wide range of software-as-a-service applications. Software-as-a-service is the largest segment in the cloud market, and is experiencing rapid adoption on [indiscernible] enterprises. We have expanded our relationship with Microsoft, and later this year, we will begin offering direct access to Microsoft Office 365, breaking new ground with secure private connectivity, to one of the most widely used enterprise SaaS applications. We are building features and functionality on the cloud exchange to support this application, which paves the way for additional SaaS providers to deliver similar services. We also continue to expand the diversity of service providers leveraging the cloud exchange, to deliver services to their customers. This quarter we announced an agreement with Aliyun, Alibaba's cloud computing arm, to provide dedicated and secured direct access to Aliyun's full suite of cloud services. Turning now to the enterprise vertical; the enterprise vertical delivered record bookings, and we are seeing traction in penetrating these verticals, as customers seek to rearchitect their IT, to connect people, locations, clouds and data. We added a record number of new customers, including multiple Fortune 50 firms and secured performance hub wins with Carestream, a healthcare medical device company, and Harman, a premium audio equipment maker. Our performance absolution is now the primary entry point for enterprise clients. Over 190 customers have deployed performance hub to optimize network architectures, distribute applications closer to end users, enable critical big data use cases and provide efficient secure private access to cloud services. By deploying these solutions, customers are reducing operating expenses and improving application performance, as well as end user experience. For example, a global engineering and construction customer that deploy their performance hub solution at Equinix, increased bandwidth per employee by 2.5 times. They have reduced their operating expenses by 25% and improved application latency by 38%, which was critical for global workforce collaboration. A Fortune 50 industrial conglomerate customer that migrated to a hybrid cloud architecture at Equinix, achieved a 30% cost reduction in cloud connectivity per acquisition, and over $8 million in annual operating savings. Turning to our go to market strategy, we are expanding our routes to market through our global channel program, which now has over 200 partners, including referral partners, agents, resellers and cloud and technology partners, who are all implementing sell-through and sell-with models. The initial focus is on building the framework, programs and tools necessary to allow partners to effectively embed Equinix as a foundation for their enterprise solutions. Particularly with our resellers, who today are driving the majority of channel bookings. For example, Telefonica, a leading global telecommunications provider and an Equinix certified reseller, is helping a key mobile company move to a cloud based business model. This customer required a large infrastructure enabler to help with their transition to cloud, and Equinix delivered a compelling global solution sold through Telefonica. So as we continue to see broad adoption of the hybrid cloud, we expect an increase in proportion of new growth to come through the channel. So let me stop there and turn the call over to Keith, to cover some of the details and results for the quarter. Keith Taylor : Great. Thanks Steve and good afternoon to everyone on the call. I am pleased to have this opportunity yet again to provide you an update on our quarterly performance. Q2 was another very strong quarter, with all three regions delivering better than expected results. On a normalizing constant currency basis, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions delivered very healthy year-over-year revenue growth at 23% and 26% respectively, while our larger Americas region produced another double digit growth, 9.75% over the same quarter last year. Our key operating and performance metrics continue to reflect the strength of the value proposition we deliver to our customers. We added 3,800 net billable cabinets in the quarter, our highest level of cabinet installs ever. This is effectively selling an entire capacity of two large data centers in one single quarter. MRR per cabinet on an FX neutral basis was up slightly to $2,015 per cabinet or 1.2% quarter-over-quarter improvement, largely due to increased interconnection activity. Over the past three quarters, the business has shown signs of accelerated growth. Given our success over the first half of the year, particularly the strength of the gross and net bookings, we are meaningfully raising our guidance for revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Updated revenue guidance now implies a normalizing constant currency growth rate of over 15% compared to the prior year, eclipsing last year's growth rate of 14%. Also we are very pleased to have completed the first six months of the year operating and reporting as a REIT, including paying our first two quarterly dividends, and announcing our third dividend earlier today. We also received a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS in May, which for all intents and purposes, matches the specifics of our desired REIT structure. The PLR ruled favorably on how we classify our revenues and assets. Basically, interconnection revenues are qualified REIT income and our data centers are qualified REIT-able assets. Now moving to the slides; so as depicted on slide 4, global Q2 revenues were $665.6 million, up 4% quarter-over-quarter and up 16% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our revenue's overperformance was due to many factors, including strong bookings activity, higher than expected custom sales order activity, net positive pricing actions and lower than planned churn. Q2 revenues net of our FX hedges absorbed a $5.2 million negative currency headwind when compared to the average FX rates of last quarter. Although currencies remain volatile throughout this quarter, across all of our operating currencies, there was no meaningful FX impact when compared to our guidance rates, as the EMEA net cash flow hedges continue to offset a good portion of the negative impact attributed to a stronger U.S. dollar. Our global cash gross profit increased 2% over the prior profit, although our cash gross margin decreased margin decreased slightly due to higher seasonal utility rates. Global cash SG&A expenses increased $149.6 million due to increased sales compensation expense in the strong booking activity, and lower than planned capitalized IT costs, given the rollout in all three regions of our Equinix Customer One initiative. Global adjusted EBITDA was $311.3 million, above the top end of our guidance range and up 3% over the prior quarter, and 18% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis; largely due to strong revenue flow-through. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%. Our Q2 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a negative $3.3 million currency impact when compared to the average rates used last quarter, and a $1.4 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates. Global AFFO was $221.4 million or up 26% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our Q2 AFFO includes approximately $1.3 million in commitment fees related to the Telecity bridge loan. Global net income was $59.5 million or diluted earnings per share of $1.03, including the acquisition cost of $9.9 million. Now over the next few quarters, we expect our net income to fluctuate due to acquisition and financing costs related to Telecity acquisition. Also, we will start to hedge out our Pound-Sterling net investment exposure for the acquisition. As a heads-up, when we mark-to-market the hedges, whether realized or unrealized, the fluctuations will flow into the income statement on the other income and expense line, and therefore, may cause our go forward as reported GAAP earnings to fluctuate. Global MRR churn for Q2 was better than expected at 1.8%, our fourth quarter in a low, this low a level. As previously stated, MRR churn is inherently lumpy, based on the timing of customer decisions, and therefore, as we look forward, we expect our quarterly MRR churn for each of the last two quarters of the year, to range between 2% and 2.5%, which includes some of the MRR churn originally expected to occur in Q2. Now turning to slide 5, I'd like to start reviewing the regional results beginning with the Americas. The Americas region had a strong booking this quarter, lower than planned MRR churn and improved pricing metrics. On a normalized and constant currency basis, the Americas revenues was up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 10% year-over-year. Americas adjusted EBITDA was flat over the prior quarter, largely due to higher seasonal utility costs over the summer season and at 11% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Americas interconnection revenues represents 22% of the region's recurring revenues and we added 2,600 cross-connects and 102 exchange ports in the quarter. Americas net cabinets billing increased by 1,100 in the quarter. For new builds, we are proceeding with our Dallas 7 project. This build strengthens our value proposition in the Dallas market, while taking advantage of our interconnection density and our other Dallas IBXs. Now looking at EMEA, please turn to slide 6; EMEA delivered another strong quarter with record bookings. We continue to see strength in our Dutch and U.K. businesses, as cloud service providers continue to deploy across these markets. On a normalized and constant currency basis, revenues were up 7% quarter-over-quarter and 23% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA margin was up 7% over the prior quarter and 31% over the same quarter last year. We had another solid quarter of increased interconnection activity, adding 1,300 net cross-connects. EMEA interconnection revenues now represent 8% of the regions recurring revenues. EMEA MRR per cabinet was up 2% on a constant currency basis to $1,472 per cabinet, and net cabinet's billing increased by 1,500. Over the quarter, we opened additional phases in our key data centers in Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Paris, and intend to proceed with a next phase of our Frankfurt 4 IBX to support the underlying demand in this robust and improving market for us. And now looking at Asia Pacific, please refer to slide 7; Asia-Pacific remains our fastest growing region, with revenues up 7% over the prior quarter and up 26% over the same quarter last year, on a normalized and constant currency basis, driven by strong sales momentum across all our verticals. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 10% over the prior quarter, and 33% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up over 50%, with strong improvement coming from our Japanese business. MRR per cabinet on a constant currency basis, was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, despite a number of large cloud-based deployments installed over the quarter. Net cabinets billings increased by 1,200 over the prior quarter and we added a healthy 2,200 net cross connects. Interconnection revenues remain at 12% of the region's recurring revenues. For builds, we opened a new phase in Hong Kong this quarter and had seven expansions, and we have seven expansions currently underway across six metros, as we continue to scale our business across this region. Now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to slide 8. At the end of the quarter, we added $436 million of unrestricted cash and investments, a large decrease over the prior quarter, principally due to the funds we escrowed for the Telecity acquisition and the increase in capital expenditures. Our net debt leverage ratio increased to 3.4 times of Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA, the result of reduced cash levels, and an increase in capital lease obligations. As we look forward, we expect a pro forma net debt to adjusted EBITDA to temporarily creep above our stated target of three to four times to 4.5 times due to the Telecity acquisition. Although, given the cash flow attributes of our model, we should return to our target range over a reasonably short period of time. Now switching to AFFO and dividends on slide 9; for 2015, we are rating our expected AFFO guidance to now range between $850 million and $860 million, an effective dollar increase of $25 million over prior guidance or a 90% increase year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, the result of strong operating performance. Our AFFO guidance now includes approximately $6.8 million in costs related to the bridge loan. Also today, we announced our Q3 dividend of $1.69 a share, consistent with our prior quarterly dividends. Our AFFO pay out ratio equates to 45%.  As we look beyond 2015, our retransitional year, we continue to believe that both organic and inorganic growth will be the primary ingredient for the steadily growing cash dividend, as well as moving more assets from the taxable REIT structure to the qualified REIT structure. Now looking at capital expenditures, refer to slide 10 please; second quarter capital expenditures are $221.3 million, including recurring CapEx of $27 million. Given our strong and above expected performance year-to-date, we are closely assessing our inventory and build rates across our Tier-1 markets. It is our expectation, that our capital expenditures will now remain at the Q2 levels for the remainder of the year, and therefore we are raising our non-recurring or expansion CapEx for the full year to now range between $685 million to $735 million. Recurring CapEx is expected to remain consistent with our prior expectations at $115 million. As presented on the expansion tracking slide, we currently have 15 announced expansion projects underway across the globe, of which 14 are campus built or incremental phase builds. We are currently building across 11 metros worldwide, focusing on investments where we can deliver a differentiated offer and generate attractive returns. Prioritizing in those markets that support our key ecosystem objectives. And finally turning to slide 11; operating performance of a stabilized 67 global IBX expansion projects have been open for more than one year, deliver steady as reported revenue growth of 4%, a decrease over the prior quarter, primarily due to stronger U.S. dollar. Currently, these projects generate a 32% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested, reflecting the premium value these mature campuses deliver, particularly where ecosystems are especially vibrant. I will turn the call back to Steve now. Steve Smith : Okay, thanks Keith. Let me now shift gears and cover the 2015 outlook on slide 15. For the third quarter of 2015, we expect revenues to range between $681 million and $685 million and normalizing constant currency growth rate of 3% quarter-over-quarter, which includes negligible foreign currency impact when compared to the average FX rate sin Q2 2015. Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68% to 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $150 million to $154 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $313 million and $317 million, which includes a $1 million negative foreign currency impact, when compared to the average FX rates in Q2 2015. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $222 million and $242 million, which includes approximately $32 million of recurring capital expenditures. For the full year of 2015, we are raising revenues to a range between $2.685 billion and $2.695 billion, a 15% year-over-year growth rate on a normalized and constant currency basis, which includes negligible foreign currency impact when compared to prior guidance rates. The revised revenues are a $55 million increase compared to our prior guidance. Total year cash gross margins are expected to approximate 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $595 million to $605 million. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to range between $1.25 billion and $1.26 billion or at 46.7% adjusted EBITDA margin. This guidance includes $2 million of positive foreign currency impact when compared to prior guidance rates, or a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 18%. Excluding this positive currency impact, the revised adjusted EBITDA is a $23 million increase compared to prior guidance. We expect adjusted funds from operations to range between $850 million and $860 million, or a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 19%. We expect 2015 capital expenditures to range between $800 million and $850 million, which includes $150 million of recurring capital expenditures. So in closing, we delivered a strong first half and are delighted to see momentum across all our industry verticals and geographies, as customers continue to select platform Equinix as the key enabler of IT transformation. We are pleased with our team's discipline and execution and the strength of our ecosystems is translating into solid revenue growth, firm pricing and expanding margins, all of which combine to give us the financial firepower to continue to invest in our global service delivery model and develop innovative solutions. Our operating performance reflects the significant role we play in a rapidly evolving digital economy, and we will continue to focus on creating sustainable for our customers and our shareholders. So let me stop here and open it up for questions, so I will turn it back over to you Kate. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question speaker is coming from Mr. David Barden from Bank of America. Sir, you may begin with your question. David Barden : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Good quarter. I wanted to ask, maybe three if I could; just first Keith, I think you talked a little bit about North America, or maybe this was global on pricing, net positive pricing activity, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about, whether that's more geographic or contract specific? Second, I think the commentary, Keith, around the churn, around 2% to 2.5% is a bit higher than we would normally expect, if you could address if there are some specific expectations that you have for that, or is that just kind of a general conservative estimate? And then my last question maybe Steve, strategically I think we understand what Equinix is trying to do, become -- really kind of create these platforms, connect businesses to the cloud and be that glue. I think it's harder to see qualitatively in the business in terms of whether it's working and how it's contributing to revenue growth? If you could kind of put some meat on the bones quantitatively around watching this strategy unfold, it will be super helpful. Thanks. Keith Taylor : Good questions David. First and foremost, as it relates to net positive pricing actions; we as a company, we continue to monitor how we perform as we renew our contracts with our customers. And clearly there are times, there are negative pricing actions, and of course, there is positive pricing actions. Over the last few quarters, the message that we have been delivering, globally, we are seeing net positive pricing actions, which means the price increases are outweighing the [indiscernible] price decreases. So it\u2019s a global phenomenon, you can see it across affecting the price points. The MRR per cabinet yields [ph] across all three regions. Second question to that I will take is on churn; when we looked at the year, certainly, we are very-very pleased with how we performed in Q1 at 2%. We were delighted with what we saw in Q2, 1.8%. But we really were trying to guide for the total year, somewhere between 2% and 2.5% per quarter, and we said the price is likely to the lower end. With our overperformance in Q2, we recognized that some of that is timing based, and therefore we are going to forecast it in Q3. Equally, there is a churn that's going to take place in Europe that we are fully aware of and had planned for, where a customer had taken down a sizable piece of space in one of our important data centers, and it was going to get relocated this year, and this is -- something was planned for from the outset, and so we are going to absorb that churn in our Q3, and therefore Q4 results. And so there is nothing fundamental going wrong with the business and nothing fundamentally causing us concern around the churn area. In fact, it\u2019s the exact opposite. We see great momentum but recognizing that churn is -- it is lumpy and it is sometimes based on how customers decide to notify why the churn, sometimes causes it to get a bit more allocated to one specific quarter or period. But nothing to be concerned about. Steve Smith : And David, on the third component of your question; couple thoughts here, first of all in the quarter, this quarter, a little over 30% of our bookings this quarter came from cloud and IT services and almost 17% of the bookings came from the enterprise vertical. So in terms of creating this cloud environment to attract enterprise, as that is unfolding as we expected, and some of the steps that I spouted out to you, you have heard that we have had good success with both enterprises in the cloud vertical. The other industry verticals continue to still underpin good growth, so we have got solid growth across content digital media, financial services and the networks suppliers, all actually also pursuing cloud with their end customers. So we are seeing the same trends as we think about the cloud, how it's affecting everybody. So we have record net bookings this quarter. You heard me talk about key wins with the Fortune 50, so we are getting used cases and success stories built with big profile companies in several of the industry's segments that make up the enterprise. We are starting to crack into the Fortune 500 as I mentioned. We have got performance hub wins being deployed across multiple industry verticals. So the overall strategy to become the enabler of this transformation to the cloud computing paradigm shift is working. The indirect channel is starting to show up for us. We are seeing these enterprises take advantage of the hybrid cloud at Equinix. Actually our acquisition that Charles and his team oversighted with this company called Nimbo, we are starting to see the professional service, traction take place to help companies bridge and find the hybrid cloud. So there is good progress across lots of fronts here, lots of new logos. Charles, I don't know if there's anything you'd add to that? Charles Meyers : No, I think you hit most of them. It is a little hard to see the impact at the sort of macro level of the publicly reported metrics. But I think as we dig down into the operating metrics that we are tracking on a week-to-week, month-to-month basis, I think we are definitely seeing the momentum in the numbers, that we feel, sort of more intuitively. And I think that includes, as Steve said, enterprise bookings over indexing relative to the revenue proportion, so that is a growing area. Enterprise and cloud combined, actually combining for the majority of our new logo capture, and so we are having success on both the supply side of cloud ecosystem, and now increasingly on the demand side, good traction in the channel with getting additional reach into the enterprise, and again, seeing overall, very solid results in interconnection, including what we track, which is interconnection between subsegments. Meaning for example, enterprise to cloud, cloud to network, etcetera, with really cloud being a primary driver point there. So the underlying metrics are definitely indicating some good solid momentum. David Barden : Got it. All right. Thanks guys. Operator : Next one is coming from Mr. Michael Rollins from Citi Investment Research. Sir, you may begin with your question. Michael Rollins : Thanks. I had one follow-up and one question. The follow-up is just the FX impact sequentially in the quarter, can you break that out between the gross FX impact and the hedge? And then you [indiscernible] more broadly, as you look at the performance in the second quarter and you look at the guidance for the year, how much of the improvement was from non-recurring revenue, which from my understanding, you were looking to decline over the next few quarters, after some strength in that metric in 2014, and how much is from the recurring revenue? Thanks. Keith Taylor : So Mike, as it relates to the non-recurring activity, we saw a slightly elevated NRR activity this quarter, its roughly up $5 million over what we saw in the prior quarter. And so, again recognized when we had our guidance, we knew how we felt we are going to perform, and so it was generally -- most of that was embedded in our forward guidance. But we certainly are more elevated than we originally anticipated at the beginning part of the year. And if you recall when we talked, again two quarters ago off the Q4 earnings call, at that time we were saying, that we were roughly $5 million below on a quarterly basis. And so all that being said a lot of the growth that you're seeing and the raise in the revenue line, it's attributed a long part to the non-recurring activity. So that's up, you know, again $15 million higher than we thought. The rest is coming from the fact that we are booking more. We are booking faster in the quarter. We are getting the price points, and we didn't experience a churn that we anticipated. And that has been the real driver of our success. It's more coming from the MRR, less coming from the NRR. As it relates to the question on FX, as I said in my prepared remarks, there were our net exposure on the revenue line, relative to Q1 activity was a headwind of $5.2 million on the revenue line, $3.3 million on the EBITDA line. When we look at the net hedge impact quarter-over-quarter, it's basically a negative $700,000 on the revenue line, and basically a negative $400,000 on the EBITDA line. Again, that's taking the hedge that we had in place in Q1, or the benefit of the hedge that we had in Q1, and then offsetting it by the benefiting we had in Q2. Michael Rollins : Okay. Thanks very much. Keith Taylor : Yup. Operator : Next one is coming from Mr. Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Sir, you may begin. Jonathan Atkin : Thanks. So on the Telecity transaction and the regulatory scrutiny that's currently taking place at the EC level, I wondered if you can go into a little bit more detail? Although looking at this combination, surely, on a regional level or also at a national level? And is there antitrust review by country level governments, that goes on concurrently, should the review occur to the easy level of you [ph]? And then on a related topic, just M&A, given the situation with Digital Realty and Telx, you're top customers of each of those companies. Just wondered, how to think about potential strategic or even commercial impacts on your business from that combination? Steve Smith : Sure, why don't I start, and then Keith and Charles, why don't you guys kind of chime in. So let's start with the Telecity question Jonathan. As I mentioned in my comments, we are moving forward at the EU level with EU Commission, which we think is going to be a more efficient process, because we are dealing with a single authority. So that's the approach versus going country by country. So it will be a little bit more efficient we believe, and we got the approval to move forward with the antitrust review at that level. So I think that was the nature of your question; and we are well into that process. So we are full speed ahead with those interactions as we speak. That doesn't change any of the timing for this, we are still anticipating a first half 2016 close and all the other commitments we made around value creation sources, etcetera, nothing has changed on any of that. The work that we are able to do now, because of the rules around the U.K. takeover panel, is that there is integration planning going on as I mentioned, Jonathan, and we have actually put retention and incentive programs in place. And as you heard on the results this morning, Telecity is moving forward in a good format and a good fashion. So I think we are very happy with what we see here, and all the planning is on a good path. Do you guys have to add anything to that? Charles Meyers : Well specifically to your question, there is no parallel review at a national level. The countries were provided an opportunity to object an EU review, forewent that objection and have now yielded to essentially the European Commission to do the review. Steve Smith : Does that answer your question Jonathan? Jonathan Atkin : Yes it does. Steve Smith : On the first part. So on the M&A stuff; obviously, we have our eye on the M&A or on the consolidation activity going on in the industry. And as a team, I would tell you, that we are continuing to be very thoughtful about where we focus and how we create shareholder value and how we continue to expand our global leadership position. So we are going to remain, as I mentioned in my comments, very proactive, but highly selective on where we focus our attention. We are obviously well aware of the Telx transaction that was taking place. I won't make really any comments about that, other than to tell you that, our interest remain the same. We are going to try to scale this platform globally. We are going to try to deepen our interconnection and network density, as we look at M&A activity, and we are going to continue to try to capture the cloud and enterprise marketplace that we talk so much about. So we will continue to -- we compete with both those entities around the edges, as you know. We will continue to compete on the basis of our own merits, and the value creation that we deliver to our customers. So I think we feel good about the platform we have in place. I would tell you that our belief internally is that the platform we have around the globe is very difficult to replicate. The degree of difficulty to replicate -- globally at an app scale level, consistent with the service delivery that we deliver around the world, with the services that we have, is extremely high. So we feel confident that we are well positioned to continue to compete, even with this combination. Charles Meyers : Jonathan, I guess I'd add, you mentioned specifically to the fact that we are indeed a significant customer to both of those companies. And we would expect that to continue to be the case; because in fact, that represents the continued momentum of our business. In the case of DLR as a landlord, we have secured very long term contracts to allow us to maintain strategic control of the assets that are critical to our future and to us, executing on our strategy, and in the case of Telx, in order for us to prosecute our interconnection business, in some instances, we are using them to provide some of the services in terms of the interconnection going through certain meeting rooms. And because of the momentum in our business, we are actually contributing to their interconnection because of that momentum. And so, may that continue. We certainly like that. But in terms of the competitive threat of that and what the combination looks like, again I'd go back to Steve's comments, which is -- our customers are really continuing to respond to our value proposition, looking for global access to rich network connectivity which we believe we provide best in industry basis, diverse, secure, high performance, private connectivity to cloud service providers around the world, which we also provide. And then consistent scalable operations that that could respond to their rapidly changing requirements, something we have invested a boatload of money in, and that we have a lot of people around the world, ensuring that they can deal with excellence, day-after-day. So we feel good about our ability to compete effectively with the combination of any set of players in the industry. Jonathan Atkin : Thank you. And then just a quick question on sales, you mentioned channel, and I wondered what portion of bookings this quarter compared to prior quarters came from indirect partners? And then on the direct side, can you give us an update on the sales headcount versus the prior quarter? Charles Meyers : So we haven't really typically broken out the specific percentage of indirect channel bookings. But I will say that it is on the rise. And in particular, our reseller community, with whom we are engaging in sort of sell-with motions. The market is still somewhat immature, I mean that's the realty. The enterprise market are still looking for solutions to their adoption of hybrid cloud, and that means, they typically engage with us and with partners to deliver a more complete solution, and we are seeing really good success with our key resale partners. So that's where the real momentum is in our channel efforts. As it relates to the direct side, about 220 quota-bearing heads worldwide, we will look to probably increase that on the margin where we are seeing success in certain markets, and that is true in all three regions. So in fact, I just recently reviewed with each of our regional Presidents, their plans as it relates to adding sales headcount, in response to market conditions. And all of them, in a quite disciplined fashion are looking to do that, where we believe we have sort of latent demand that we can capture in the market. So that won't be a huge number. But we think that given the momentum we have in the market, we would continue to add. But we are at 220, and I would expect another -- maybe perhaps 20 or 30 heads to come in over the next several quarters, based on continued momentum. Jonathan Atkin : Thank you. Operator : Next question is coming from Mr. Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore ISI. Sir, you may begin with your question. Jonathan Schildkraut : Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question guys. So listen, I guess I have one question about the guidance and then just one question about sort of where the stock is. So on the AFFO side, you guys have done about $440 million, a little north of that through the first half of the year, and the guide for the full year, implies obviously, a deceleration in the back part of the year. Just looking at sort of where your EBITDA guidance is, it shows sort of steady progression as we go through the course of the year. So I'd just like to get a sense as to what's happening from the EBITDA down the AFFO line from a translation perspective, that wouldn't have sort of the same similar growth pattern? And then, I will come back for a second. Thanks. Keith Taylor : Jonathan, I think it pertains to the biggest change. If I give you a bridge of the operational performance -- if I look at AFFO and give you a bridge of the operational performance, we'd say look, we are improving and yes this will continue through the remaining part of the year. But offsetting that are two things, number one, and the biggest thing is really interest expense, and part of that interest expense is attached to basically the $7 million for the commitment fee that we are paying on the bridge fee for the Telecity acquisition. Part of it is, when we actually -- when we put in more capital and capital leases that we are taking from operating to capital, we have some impact there. When we take large projects, liked we had -- we had the big five projects in Q1 that went live, and that was, as you recall, Singapore 3, Melbourne 1, Toronto 2, and New York 6 and London 6. Interest that was otherwise capitalized in those transactions now also moves into, if you will, the operating line and that affects AFFO. But principally speaking, we continue to see continued momentum in our ability to drive up the EBITDA, and generally speaking, AFFO will translate with that or a period of time. But there are some anomalies that are taking place over the latter half of the year, primarily because of our construction activity and the acquisition. Jonathan Schildkraut : Okay, great. So look, since the last time we got on a call, you guys have gotten a PLR, which I think everybody was pretty excited about. And earlier in the year, there was a lot of progress on index inclusion. The RMZ is still out there. I think the last time we spoke, you guys were still looking for your GICS code to get changed. Maybe could you take us up to date as to where that process is and how we might think about new index inclusion through year end, that'd be helpful? Thanks. Steve Smith : Sure Jonathan, this is Steve. I will give you just a quick update. As you know, we were added to the FTSE NAREIT index which happened pretty quickly, I think it was March timeframe. The GICS code did change in June of 2015. We are now in the specialized REIT sector, and they do quarterly reviews, and I think the selection timeframe, Katrina and Paul are working hard on that, but I am not sure when we are clear on when -- which quarterly review will be considered. And then also, the team is staring at the iShares Dow Jones REIT index. We have made initial contact, but have somewhat limited visibility in terms of how that's going to proceed. So those are the three activities we have had going on. They do, do quarterly reviews, and we have been tracking that and we will track that pretty closely. Jonathan Schildkraut : All right. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Next question is coming from Mr. Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Sir your line is open. Simon Flannery : Thank you very much. Steve, you talked about the industry M&A going on and that you would be selective. So perhaps you can just expand on that comments? I think most of your expansions, have been, as you have said, campus builds in existing metros. Obviously Telecity gets you some new markets in Europe. But are you looking -- give us some color? Are you looking to perhaps get into new markets in Asia or other locations? And then, it's nice to see the acceleration up to that 15% level. I think in the past you have talked about a TAM that's sort of growing high single, low double digits. Is your share gain accelerating, or do you think the growth rate of the TAM has also picked up? Thanks. Steve Smith : Sure. Let me start Simon, and then Keith and Charles can chime in here. But on the M&A color, as I mentioned to the previous question earlier here, I think from David; our focus on M&A activity is active. We have an active gain board. We have three heavy filters that we tend to put any regional input through, which is scale to platform. And we enhance our interconnection and network density secondly. And then thirdly, can we do something that will accelerate our capture of cloud and enterprises that come in and connect to the cloud. We put most of the deal flow through those three lenses, and if you go back and look at our 2010 or 2011 acquisitions, we can point to some combination of those three things. We are, I would tell you most of the activity is outside of North America. Latin America, as I have mentioned to you guys in the past, is of interest, to continue to expand the platform beyond Brazil, when and if the opportunities exist. In Asia, we are continuing to look at going deeper into China. We are working very hard in that market, to try to expand beyond our footprint in Shanghai, and that's of high importance to us. India, will remain on the radar scale for us, but India, to find the right partner and the right partner has proved challenging. But across other parts of Asia, there are opportunities. And then in Europe, I think the Telecity activity is going to consumers, as you might imagine. It would put is six-seven new markets and strengthen our footprint in existing markets. So that's kind of where our focus is today. And I think someday you are going to see us show up and probably to start in South Africa, as we head to that part of the world, and there will be opportunities there that might broaden our reach in that part of the world. As far as the TAM is considered, Charles, do you want to talk about the TAM? Charles Meyers : Yeah. I think obviously, we are encouraged and delighted with the acceleration in the business and sort of achieving that 15% growth rate is something we feel very good about. We do think that that reflects a combination of factors, that include us continuing to gain share. But obviously when you think about TAM, its always a matter of how you're defining it. And I think what we would say is that, the TAM for a portion of the market, we believe is particularly relevant to us, where our value proposition is strongest, is indeed accelerating. And we think that's accelerating, due to the fact that enterprises are in fact adopting hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of choice. And so as we look at offers of network -- of our performance sub-solution, cloud exchange, being able to really enable and empower companies to do these hybrid cloud kind of architectures and implement them, inclusive about the professional services required to get them there. We believe that market is indeed the total addressable market there is indeed accelerating, but we also think we are capturing additional shares. So its probably a combination of those things. I would say that, when we said that the macro market was sort of low -- high single low double digits, I think that we are seeing -- I think, above that in terms of targeted markets around this enterprise IT transformation and cloud adoption. But we also I think are getting more than our fair share of that. So I think we continue to overperform, relative to the market and expect that that will continue in the future. Simon Flannery : Correct. Thank you. Operator : Next one is coming from Mr. Colby Synesael from Cowen & Co. Sir, you may begin. Colby Synesael : Great, thank you. Two questions if I may; one is, I was hoping if you could update on your Business Suites strategy, how many markets you are in with that product now, perhaps the percentage of revenue that's being driven off of that? What customer has been? And then the second question is, I guess more housekeeping and tied to the model, can you just tell us what share count we should be using for 2015 AFFO per share, when we are putting that into our model? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Why don't I take the first one and then obviously kick the second one back to Keith. Colby, as you know, Business Suites are something that we responded to an evolving market demand in terms of people looking to implement multi-tiered architectures. And as they --that continues to be a phenomenon that we see. As you know, we have continued to have a very strong discipline around right customer, right application and the right assets. And frankly, it is that discipline that's driving the pricing behavior that Keith talked about earlier, and driving the churn dynamics that we are seeing, which is improvements in both of those areas. But as it relates to business suites, we have seen some success in that. It's really in a small number of markets. We have really implemented our product like that essentially in Ashburn and in New York. And even in those markets, we are evolving it based on our updated understanding of the customer's requirements. And so, what we are finding is, is that we are now implementing a more complete hybrid cloud solution, that often looks like a performance hub implementation, which is a smaller implementation, more network dense, more rich in connectivity to other clouds. But often paired with, a slightly larger implementation that maybe an adjacent site or in a different metro, that allows them to put certain applications there, that allow them to really fully implement hybrid cloud. So we are evolving it a bit. We continue to build out sites that we think can support that sort of multi-tiered architecture. You will see upcoming announcements from us, relative to how our product set is evolving to meet that demand. And we feel very good about what we are doing, to really support the complete need of the enterprise customer. Keith Taylor : Colby on your second question, I am going to refer you to two slides. On slide 14, we give an appropriate bridge of our AFFO and consistent with my comments that I made to Jonathan earlier, you can see how AFFO plays itself out for fiscal year 2015. Technically, FFO is going to run at the same rate, with increased AFFO at effectively the same rate as increased EBITDA for the remaining part of the year. As it relates to share count, I refer you to page 33, which gives you a fully dilutive weighted average share forecast. And we give it to you in all sort of shapes and sizes, so that you can look at it, based on what your needs are from an actual number to a weighted average number to a fully diluted number. So I think that will be a good representation for you to use, and [indiscernible] there is any follow-up questions, happy to take that, or Katrina and Paul will be happy to talk to you about it as well. But page 33 is a pretty detailed analysis of our diluted share position. Colby Synesael : So it looks like then, I should be using the 59 and I guess what, in change for the full year? Keith Taylor : Yeah, 59 if you are going to -- when you look at a fully dilutive basis with the convertible notes. If you want to look at it differently, those notes will convert in 2016, but you want to think a little bit about what might happen with the special distribution, which is theoretically -- probably a Q4 event for us. You are in the 59 million to 60 million shares zip code. Colby Synesael : Okay. Thank you. Keith Taylor : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our last question is coming from Mr. Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Sir, you may begin with your question. Mike McCormack : Hey guys, thanks. Maybe just a quick comment on the Asia-Pac MRR per cabinet. I know Keith, I think you said you had some pretty large cloud deployments. How should we think about that as it goes through the back half of the year? Do you expect more big clouds coming in there, that would continue to weight on that? And then maybe, just a broader question on REIT investors and sort of your recent conversations, their appetite and interest in the company? Keith Taylor : Well I think Mike, just to address the first question, again the Asia-Pac region, we can see by the level of growth that they have experienced, both on a as-reported and on an FX neutral basis, has been quite substantial. And as a result, you have also seen the amount of activity that they are actually selling into, into the IBXes. So any time you have that type of growth with that type of volume going through the system, it takes time if you will, for the interconnection and the other services to catch up. So that's one aspect of it. The second aspect of course, we do -- we have been very-very successful in Singapore with our cloud deployment, and because of that, you tend to -- it comes in size, and when it comes in size, it generally comes at a different price point. And so that also was a little bit dilutive for the overall method, and then of course currency is equally causing some fluctuation. So overall, we are pleased with what we see in Asia-Pacific. We are not surprised by the price points we are at. And going forward, depending on the momentum, I would tell you that we would expect firmness across the board, whether it's Asia or the other regions on average yield per cabinet. And I am sorry, I have lost track of the second question, on the REIT investors? Mike McCormack : Yeah just sort of the upside and the recent feedback you have been getting? Keith Taylor : Overall, look its no surprise to you that we are meeting with a number of investors. Katrina and Paul do a good job of looking out for those type of investors who have taken a broad interest in basically our story. We think it\u2019s a very compelling story, as we have said before. We are going to mix yield, with basically a faster growing company, and that's evidenced by our results posted today and our forecast for the rest of the year. We could think we can deliver a total shareholder return to all our investors, but particularly those reinvestors who like our story in a very meaningful way. So from our perspective, we will continue to focus on them. We are gaining momentum. We certainly have interest in our story, and we spend a lot of energy talking with those investors. Mike McCormack : Great. Thanks guys. Keith Taylor : Great. Thanks Mike. Katrina Rymill : Thank you. That concludes our Q2 call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

In the interest of wrapping this call within an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to just one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We delivered another strong quarter, as the power of our global platform, as well as, the depth and breadth of our digital ecosystems are translating into sustainable growth, including record net bookings, stable yields, and healthy interconnection activity. Our bookings momentum in cloud and enterprise reflects our position, as a key enabler, of IT transformation. Cloud service providers are choosing platform Equinix to scale their infrastructure globally, and enterprises are increasingly turning to us, as a partner in adopting hybrid and multi-cloud, as part of their next-generation IT architectures. As depicted on slide three, revenues were $686.6 million, up 4% quarter-over-quarter, and up 17% over the same quarter last year, on a normalized and constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $321.5 million for the quarter, up 3% over the prior quarter, and up 20% year-over-year, on a normalized and constant currency basis, delivering a 47% margin. AFFO grew 17% year-over-year, on a normalized and constant currency basis to $210.4 million. With 169,000 cross-connects, and 4 terabytes per second of traffic, on our Internet Exchanges, which are growing at 33% year-over-year. Equinix is benefiting from the strong secular trends, and momentum, as businesses are becoming increasingly interconnected. A recent industry survey of over 1,000 CIOs and other IT leaders globally, showed the number of enterprises deploying direct interconnections is poised to more than double, to over 80% by 2017. Enterprises that have already moved to interconnected solutions, reported significant value creation, from enhanced application performance, and cost savings. Clouds continue to be the fastest growing interconnection destination at Equinix, although strong growth was delivered from all ecosystems. We added a record 7,000 cross-connects this quarter and revenue from interconnection grew 21% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, meaningfully outpacing overall revenue growth as we mature our ecosystems and penetrate new markets. Our digital exchanges saw another quarter of record traffic in provision capacity growth, including the addition of a 172 ports on our Internet Exchanges. This includes 24, 100-gig ports doubling the provision capacity added in any previous quarter, and an important reflection of the confidence our customers have in our Internet Exchanges and our role in connecting network traffic. We expect continued traffic growth as this 100-gig capacity is absorbed into peering architectures. Internationally, we are augmenting strong organic growth with our planned acquisitions of Bit-isle and Telecity to build market leadership, increase capacity, enhance cloud and network density and grow customer ecosystems across Europe and Asia. Turning to slide four, as announced in September, we are acquiring Bit-isle, a co-location leader in Japan for approximately $280 million. Japan is one of the world's largest co-location markets and for several years, Equinix has been evaluating how to accelerate our leadership in this market. With this acquisition, Equinix will become the fourth largest data center operator in Japan. Bit-isle's facilities are adjacent to our carrier dense sites in Tokyo and Osaka, giving us customer ready capacity as well as the opportunity to scale platform Equinix in this increasingly constrained but important global market. Bit-isle also complements our cloud and network service provider customer base with a strong Japanese enterprise and systems integrator customer set, including some of Japan's largest companies. With Bit-isle, Equinix also adds strong local expertise to help drive success in Japan and we look forward to completing this transaction in the fourth quarter. Turning to the Telecity acquisition, we're excited about this compelling and unique opportunity to expand our presence in key markets in Europe, delivering significant value to our global interconnection platform. Regarding regulatory status, we are seeking approval from the European Commission and we have had ongoing dialog over the past several weeks to review the transaction. Based on those discussions, we have proceeded with a formal offer to the Commission with proposed commitments, which are now being market tested. We expect to hear a response by November 13 and are of the view that this transaction should be cleared during its phase one review, based on those commitments. Our pre-close work streams are progressing well and will remain on track for a first half 2016 close. In addition to our acquisitions, the Equinix global platform continues to grow organically as customers leverage our broad geographic reach to deploy applications that serve their employees, partners, and customers across the world. Today, 54% of our revenue comes from customers deployed globally across all three regions, and over 83% is from customers deployed across multiple metros, a reflection of our differentiated global reach. We continue to invest in international markets to meet growing global demand and seek critical business ecosystems that will deliver incremental growth and value. We're currently building across 12 metros worldwide, focusing on our investments, where we can deliver a differentiated offer and generate very attractive returns. Globally, we have 13 announced expansion projects underway, of which 12 are campus builds or incremental phased builds, which helps mitigate risk while driving returns. We continue to increase the number of owned data centers, including purchasing the land for our new build in S\u00e3o Paulo. Owned properties now generate 38% of recurring revenue and 39% of NOI. And over 93% of NOI is generated by owned or leased properties or lease expirations extended to 2029 or beyond. Shifting gears, let me address our continued investment in green technology. We believe it is our responsibility to power the digital economy in an environmentally sustainable way, both to serve the needs of our customers and to protect the communities in which we operate. This quarter we signed a power purchase agreement for solar power with SunEdison. This purchase of 105 megawatts ensures the generation of renewable power equaling 100% of the energy for Equinix's California data centers. This agreement will increase our use of green energy sources from 30% to 43% of our data center footprint, and represents significant progress towards our stated long-term goal of using 100% clean or renewable energy. Now, let me cover the quarterly highlights from our industry verticals. Network operators continue to expand their infrastructure as they implement 100-gig platforms and augment their networks to deliver new services for mobile, content delivery, video streaming and cloud-based services. A resurgence of subsea cable projects is also creating opportunity for Equinix, helping service providers accelerate returns by terminating cables directly into our IBXes. Equinix is working with AquaComms who is deploying one of the first trans-Atlantic subsea cables in more than a decade to meet increased bandwidth needs for global businesses. Our New York and London data centers will serve as the carrier neutral, low latency network access points to this cable system. In addition, our West Coast data centers will anchor the new trans-Pacific subsea cable system named FASTER. This new cable route will be one of the longest high-capacity routes in the world, and will be backhauled into four of our data centers in Silicon Valley, Seattle and Los Angeles. In the content and digital media vertical, we continue to see consumer content companies architect their delivery infrastructure via platform Equinix to respond to cost and performance imperatives driven by the demands of today's mobile users. Growth was driven by global expansions from players including Baidu, a Chinese web services company and Cr\u00e9teil, a French company specializing in performance marketing, as well as new wins with three of the largest consumer application providers in music, social networking and accommodations. Advertising and e-commerce sub-segments continue to be our strongest growth performers in this space. Turning to the financial services vertical, we see continued diversification in our financial services business with additional wins from Australian Securities Exchange operations, a global financial market exchange as well as wins with a leading global insurance syndicate and one of the largest banks in the world. We also had lighthouse wins in digital payments and we see encouraging signs of ecosystem formation in this area. Turning to cloud and IT services, we are experiencing continued momentum across the cloud ecosystem, which drove strong bookings this quarter as major cloud and IT players, such as AWS, Cisco, Dimension Data, and EMC continue to expand and our relationship with Rackspace extended to include their participation on the Equinix Cloud Exchange. With over 240 customers provision, we continue to see momentum on our Cloud Exchange, our cloud interconnection solution that allows customers to dynamically create and manage private, secure virtual connections to multiple cloud services over a single port, simplifying cloud migrations and enabling workload mobility from cloud-to-cloud. We're pleased to announce we are also collaborating with Oracle to enable high performance global direct access to Oracle's full suite of cloud services across six markets. This will allow customers to easily create connections to Oracle's cloud-based business applications while reducing the application latency often associated with traditional cloud access. As one of the largest cloud providers, the addition of Oracle Cloud to the Equinix Cloud Exchange strengthens our ability to deliver unrivalled choice to our customers. In October, Equinix worked closely with Microsoft to launch a private Azure ExpressRoute connection to Office 365 through the Equinix Cloud Exchange. Office 365 is one of the most requested applications by enterprises and leveraging ExpressRoute via Cloud Exchange dramatically improves the performance and security of Office 365. We're now offering this solution across all 16 metros where ExpressRoute is available on Cloud Exchange and have seen very strong interest. Turning to the enterprise vertical, the enterprise vertical delivered record bookings, and we are seeing continued traction in penetrating this massive addressable market. Notably as of the third quarter, enterprises became our largest source of new customer adds with traction in transportation, manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare. Over 250 customers have now deployed our Performance Hub solution to optimize network architectures and drive application performance by securely and efficiently connecting to network and cloud services. Turning to slide five, our enterprise go-to-market strategy is based on four use cases for people, clouds, locations, and data that allow us to effectively solve enterprise pain points by making the transition to an interconnection-oriented architecture. Whether it's deploying applications to distributed users or leveraging data intensive analytics, enterprises are facing challenges around security, networking cost and performance that we are helping them solve. For example, a global media and software customer worked with Equinix to solve inefficient and insecure access to multiple cloud providers. By deploying a distributed hub infrastructure inside of Equinix and connecting privately to multiple clouds, this customer benefited from a 25% reduction in latency and a 50% reduction in OpEx per application. Our global reach as well as networking cloud density represent powerful and difficult to replicate advantages in servicing the demand for multi- cloud. But translating these advantages into customer acquisition and market share capture, requires a continued evolution of our product and go-to-market capabilities. We have made significant progress in 2015 with our Performance Hub and Cloud Exchange offers and will continue to expand our portfolio of high impact, channel ready offers to help enterprises satisfy their hybrid cloud aspirations. On the go-to-market front, we continue to drive productivity improvements in our direct selling teams, and are investing in parallel in our channel and partner program to dramatically expand market reach and enable the delivery of more complete solutions to meet key customer requirements. We're pleased with the progress of our channel initiatives and continue to see partner bookings grow as a percentage of our overall sales. So, let me stop here and turn it over to Keith, to go through the results for the quarter. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone on the call. We had another great quarter and the value of our platform as reflected in the health of our key operating metrics continues to rise. We had once again strong gross and net bookings and our MRR churn remains at the lower end of our guidance range. Consistent with the last four quarters, we had positive net pricing actions, and we recorded the highest increase in net cabinets billing in our history, adding 4,700 incremental billing cabinets in Q3, more than double the average quarterly rate in 2014. Our MRR per cabinet on an FX neutral basis remained firm. We're delighted with the interconnection activity in the quarter, and we added significant new cross-connects and exchange ports. Interconnection revenues as a percent of our recurring revenues continue to pick up across each of our regions. So, based on the strength of our gross and net bookings activity, as well as the continued momentum across our business, we are once again raising our guidance expectations despite the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar for each of revenues, EBITDA and AFFO for Q4 and 2015. And as we finish the year on this strong note, this clearly positions us for a solid start to 2016. Our updated revenue guidance now implies a normalized and constant currency growth rate of over 16% compared to the prior year, the highest annual growth we have seen since 2012. Now moving to some comments on the acquisitions. We continue to progress with both our Telecity and Bit-isle transactions. The Bit-isle share tender period closed this past Monday and we are happy to note that 97% of the Bit-isle shares were tendered. We expect to acquire the remaining shares of Bit-isle by the end of the year. The Bit-isle transaction will officially close in early November, and we'll report their results in our consolidated financials from that point forward. Please note, we have not included Bit-isle in our guidance. And accordingly, we'll update you on the financial results on our next earnings call. As stated previously, we expect Bit-isle to create significant value for our shareholders and to be accretive to Equinix's AFFO per share upon close. Also we're continuing our journey as a REIT, and in August, Equinix was added to the MSCI US REIT Index as the largest data center REIT. We remain pleased with the diversification of our shareholder base as many REIT investors joined our traditional technology investor base. Given the changing investor mix, we'll work to clearly message our story to both these investor groups. So now moving to the slides. As depicted on slide six, global Q3 revenues were $686.6 million, up 4% quarter-over-quarter, and up 17% over the same quarter last year on a normalizing constant currency basis. Our revenues over performance was due to strong bookings activity and net positive pricing actions. Q3 revenues net of our FX hedges absorbed a $4 million negative currency headwind when compared to either the average FX rates of last quarter or our prior FX guidance rates. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, our updated 2015 guidance now includes incremental FX headwinds of $13 million on the revenue line and $4 million related to adjusted EBITDA when compared to our prior FX guidance rates. Therefore, our current 2015 revenue guidance now absorbs $138 million currency headwind while EBITDA is negatively impacted by $56 million when compared to the average rates used in 2014. As we look to 2016, we continue to believe the U.S. dollar will remain strong and create some level of headwind when compared to the average rates in 2015 in addition to the averaging down of our current hedge positions. We'll update you on the estimated impact of FX on the next earnings call. Global adjusted EBITDA was $321.5 million, above the top end of our guidance range, and up 3% over the prior quarter and 20% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis, largely due to strong revenue flow through. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%. Our Q3 adjusted EBITDA performance net of our FX hedges reflects a negative $800,000 currency impact when compared to the average FX rates from last quarter and a $500,000 positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates. Global AFFO was $210.4 million. Excluding the $11.6 million FX loss related to net investment hedge for the Telecity acquisition and $4 million of incremental financing cost related to both the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, AFFO on a normalized and constant currency basis increased 2% over the prior quarter. As a reminder, we've hedged the majority of our pound sterling net investment exposure related to the Telecity acquisition. When we mark-to-market these hedges whether realized or unrealized, the fluctuations will flow through net income on the other income and expense line and therefore affect AFFO and other reported metrics until we close the deal. As we look forward, we'll continue to keep you updated on the impact of this hedge position and how it affects our AFFO metric. Global net income was $41.1 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.71, including acquisition cost of $13.4 million and the $11.6 million FX loss in the Telecity acquisition related hedge. And finally moving to churn. Global MRR churn for Q3 was 2%, our fifth quarter in a row at this lower level. For Q4, we expect the quarterly MRR churn to be at the high-end of our range between 2% and 2.5%, which includes some of the MRR churn originally expected to incur in Q3. Now turning to slide seven, I'd like to start reviewing the regional results, beginning with the Americas. The Americas region had a strong bookings quarter, lower than planned MRR churn and favorable pricing. On a normalizing constant currency basis, the Americas revenues were up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 13% year-over-year. Americas adjusted EBITDA was up 2% over the prior quarter and up 12% year-over-year on a normalizing constant currency basis. Americas interconnection revenues represents 22% of the regions recurring revenues and we added 3,500 net cross-connects and 78 exchange ports in the quarter. Americas net cabinets billing increased by 1,500 in the quarter. Also we're proceeding with a new build in S\u00e3o Paulo, the financial capital and the main data center market in Brazil. This will be out third IBX in the S\u00e3o Paulo market and a fifth IBX in the Brazilian market. Equinix purchased a land for S\u00e3o Paulo III, consistent with our desire to own more of our IBXs as we expand the business. We also broke ground on our Ashburn North campus, undeveloped land that we will also \u2013 pardon me \u2013 that we also own next to our current Ashburn campus, which is the largest Internet Exchange points in North America. Equinix currently has 10 IBXs in Ashburn and the surrounding area. This new campus, which we plan to develop over the next few years will effectively double the capacity we have in this market. Now looking at EMEA, please turn to slide eight. EMEA delivered another strong quarter with record bookings with particular strength in the French and Dutch markets. On a normalizing constant currency basis, revenues were up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 22% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA was up 4% over the prior quarter and 26% over the same quarter last year. We had another solid quarter of increased interconnection activity, adding 1,800 net cross-connects. EMEA interconnection revenues represent 9% of the regions recurring revenues. EMEA MRR per cabinet was flat on a constant currency basis and net cabinets billing increased by 1,800. Given the strong performance in our key markets, we plan to move forward with additional expansion phases in both Amsterdam and London. This includes the next phase of London 6, the new build in our Slough campus that only opened earlier this year. And now looking at Asia-Pacific, refer to slide nine please. Asia-Pacific continued its rapid growth as customers continue to deploy into this region. Revenues were up 6% over the prior quarter and 26% over the same quarter last year on a normalizing constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 6% over the prior quarter and 37% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 52% with strong flow-through from the revenue line. MRR per cabinet on a constant currency basis was down slightly quarter-over-quarter, which included a large number of billable cabinets being installed. Net cabinets billing increased by 1,400 over the prior quarter and we added a healthy 1,700 net cross-connects. Interconnection revenues stepped up to 13% of the regions recurring revenues. For builds, we opened a new phase in Hong Kong and Singapore this quarter and currently have five expansion projects underway across four countries. And now, looking at the balance sheet, please refer to slide 10. Unrestricted cash and investment decreased this quarter to $340 million, largely due to our continued investment in CapEx and the payment of our third quarter cash dividend. Our net debt leverage ratio currently is 3.4 times of Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA. As we look forward, we continue to actively review our capital structure and financing needs, largely due to the planned acquisition of Telecity and soon to close Bit-isle transaction. But, as well as we continue to just stay at the level of investment as we spend our platform to support the trajectory of our business. Now, switching to AFFO and dividends on slide 11. For 2015, we're raising our expected AFFO guidance to now range between $866 million and $870 million, an effective dollar increase of $29 million over our prior guidance or a 24% year-over-year increase on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our AFFO guidance, as mentioned previously includes the impact of the Telecity net investment hedge in Q3, but no, our updated AFFO guidance does not make any assumption for Q4 relating to the net investment hedge for Telecity. Also today, we announced our Q4 dividend of $1.64 a share \u2013 sorry, pardon me \u2013 $1.69 a share, consistent with our prior quarterly dividends. Our AFFO payout ratio remains at 45%. Our previously announced 2015 special distribution of $627 million will also be paid in the fourth quarter in a combination of up to 20% in cash and at least 80% in stock. Do note, by the virtue of the special distribution being paid before the Q4 quarterly cash dividend record date, we're effectively increasing our quarterly dividend by 3% as the 1.7 million incremental shares from the distribution will have already been issued to our shareholders. Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to slide 12. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $216 million, including recurring CapEx of $26 million. Given our rapid fill rates and over performance year-to-date, we're closely assessing our inventory and expect to continue to invest to support our platform. We're narrowing our 2015 CapEx guidance to the top end of our prior range of $830 million to $850 million. Turning to slide 13. The operating performance of our stabilized 67 global IBX and expansion projects that have been opened for more than one year delivers steady as reported growth of 6%, an increase over the prior quarter and more closely aligned with our expectations. Utilization of these assets increased to 86%, up 2% over the prior quarter as we filled additional capacity in these stabilized assets with particular high absorption in London, Munich and Silicon Valley markets. At the end of Q3, our stabilized projects generated a 33% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested, reflecting the economic value these stabilized campuses deliver. So with that, let me turn it back to Steve. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thanks, Keith. Let me now cover our 2015 outlook on slides 14 to slide 17. Note that, the following guidance does not include the Bit-isle transaction that is expected to close in Q4. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we expect revenues to range between $701 million and $705 million, and normalized and constant currency growth rate of 3% quarter-over-quarter, which includes $4 million negative foreign currency impact when compared to the average FX rates in Q3 of 2015. Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $153 million to $157 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $328 million and $332 million, which includes a $4 million negative foreign currency impact when compared to the average FX rates in Q3 of 2015. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $242 million and $262 million, which includes approximately $34 million of recurring capital expenditures. For the full year of 2015, we are raising revenues to range between $2.696 billion and $2.7 billion, a 16% year-over-year growth rate on a normalized and constant currency basis, which includes $13 million of negative foreign currency impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. The revised revenues are a $21 million increase compared to our prior guidance. Total year cash gross margins are expected to approximate 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $601 million to $605 million. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to range between $1.267 billion and $1.271 billion or a 47% adjusted EBITDA margin. This guidance includes $4 million of negative foreign currency impact when compared to prior guidance rates or a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 19%. Excluding this currency impact the revised adjusted EBITDA is an $18 million increase compared to prior guidance. We expect adjusted funds from operations to range between $866 million and $870 million or a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 24%. As noted by Keith, this guidance does not include the impact from the Telecity transaction hedging for Q4, although, this will continue to impact our as-reported AFFO results. We expect 2015 capital expenditures to range between $830 million and $850 million, which includes $110 million of recurring capital expenditures. In closing, we are expanding our market leadership and driving disciplined execution of our differentiated strategy. We believe that the strength of our digital ecosystems and the global breadth of our interconnection platform create a powerful fly wheel to fuel our business and drive IT transformation. Our role as an enabler of the hybrid and multi-cloud represents a powerful near-term catalyst for enterprise penetration and we will continue to invest in this significant opportunity. We are working to accelerate our alignment and agility as an organization and look forward to updating the market as we progress with these initiatives. So let me stop here and we'll open it up for questions. So back over to you, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our first question speaker is from Mr. David Barden from Bank of America. Your line is open sir. David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Appreciate it. Good quarter. I guess, first question, I guess, Steve, would be, with respect to some of the comments on the Telecity deal and the November 13 decision that we're expecting from the EU. Obviously, there was a big filing about commitments that you guys have made with respect to closing the transaction and you spoke about some market testing of these commitments. Could you elaborate a little bit on what they are and if they affect the economics of the transaction in any material way? And then I guess, second, Keith, just on the hedge for the European market, obviously, it was a decision that you took at the beginning of this year. It's paid off to be relatively aggressive hedging the EU currency blocks. Are you planning to continue in 2016 a fairly aggressive static hedge or are you going to be a little bit more dynamic in how you think about currencies and where you think the incremental moves are going to go and how aggressive are you planning on being with respect to the hedges in the European market? Thanks. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, David. Thanks. Let me start with the first one, and Keith, we'll hand to you for the second piece. So, David, we're somewhat limited in what we can provide color on around the Telecity situation, but let me tell you what we can share with everybody. So number one, we are moving forward with the EU Commission and targeting a regulatory clearance in Phase 1. We've had, as you would expect, ongoing dialogue with the Commission over the past several weeks and have had very good interaction. Based on those discussions, we have proceeded with a formal offer of proposed commitments as noted in our recent 8-K. So for a variety of reasons, we cannot comment much further on the nature of those commitments, but we remain optimistic about a Phase 1 clearance of this transaction and a first half 2016 close, that is in line with our previous guidance. And we do expect a response from the Commission by November 13 and then we'll update you accordingly after that point. David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I feel like that's already written on a piece of paper in front of you, Steve. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Well, we're somewhat limited, David, as you might expect on sharing any color on the activity until we get to the November 13 timeframe, so they have a 10-day working day period to do the market test, and that's the period we're in now. David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : David, let me just move forward then just on your questions around the hedge. First and foremost, the piece that's affecting the AFFO, which was not in our prior guidance and again, it can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, that relates to us hedging out our net investment exposure for the acquisition of the Telecity asset. And so, as you can appreciate, that will continue to fluctuate until we close. So if you will \u2013 the net \u2013 the loss that we experienced this quarter, the offsetting impact sits inside \u2013 will sit inside purchase accounting when we actually close the transaction. If I was to actually \u2013 if I was actually to use the same exchange rates \u2013 if I use the spot exchange rate today for effectively the transaction, that $11.6 million, sort of loss would turn into a gain, if it was this quarter. So, it gives you a sense of the volatility because it's almost a $1 billion hedge. As it relates to our ongoing monitory hedges and our balance sheet hedges as well as the embedded derivatives that we do, as a company, we're still going to continue to hedge where we can somewhat aggressively. And why we want to do that, we think there will continue to be strength in the U.S. dollar. But as you'll recall, we hedge out now anywhere from six to eight quarters. We feather them in, and of course effectively it's smoothing out the impact of how the currencies are going to move. In this case, we've been clearly a net beneficiary of our hedging through fiscal year. Despite where currencies have gone, we've been a net beneficiary of hedging. And so, we want to continue to use that where appropriate. There's some markets that we will not hedge. As we've said, it's just too darn expensive; Brazil is that one example. And again, the majority of our hedges, anytime you think of our European hedge, it's already going through our results. When you think about \u2013 it's going through our result, pardon me, it's going through \u2013 and we get proper hedge accounting. When we go to Asia, all of that stuff we report basically, we report as for the gains and losses in the P&L below the line. So, we'll try and be really transparent over the next little while on our hedging positions. We're certainly going to be very clear as we move to close our planned transactions, not only because of the influence that new currencies will have or the increase in currencies will have exposed to as it relates to yen, sterling and euro. But most of that will take place as or when we close the transactions for Telecity and Bit-isle. David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Awesome. Thanks, thanks, guys. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Rollins from Citi. Your line is open. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Was wondering if you kind of look back over the course of the year, if I remember correctly, your original constant currency revenue guidance was around 12% for 2015. And you mentioned in this deck that it's around 16% today. I'm wondering if you can give us a bridge to what the sources of outperformance were, regionally \u2013 maybe by vertical? And at the same time, are you seeing some segments underperform where you thought they would be? Thanks. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Let me take one piece of it, Michael, and then I'm going to defer \u2013 I'm going to look at Charles and Steve for some other color. So, I want to make sure that we're clear with everybody on what we did. When we started out the year, as you will recall, we said that we could do greater than and clearly \u2013 so, when you look at our internal plan relative to what we performed, we felt we could do a bit better than the guidance that we delivered because those are greater than \u2013 that all said, as we progressed through the year, there's a number of things that worked very much in our benefit. Number one, we are booking a little bit more in the gross line than we originally anticipated, so that's net positive. Second piece is, churn is not as great as we anticipated, and you've seen that in each of our actuals relative to our quarterly guide, so we get the benefit of churn. Three, our net pricing actions are positive. And again, as I said, we've had steady quarterly flow of net pricing actions, and that's \u2013 that does wonders \u2013 wonders for the revenue line. Four, we've done more, more than we originally anticipated, on the non-recurring line in this quarter, sorry \u2013 pardon me \u2013 Q3, as we guide forward for Q4, we're going to do roughly $40 million on the non-recurring line, so it gives you a sense that that was \u2013 that was a lot higher than we originally anticipated to that \u2013 it's probably to the tune of $30 million odd. And then the fifth thing I'll tell you is, the sales leadership has done a real good job of better managing the booking and billing activity through the quarter. So, as we measure ourselves, and we call them banana charts, those banana charts look more like a straight line from where we're getting, a more \u2013 a more steady flow of revenue throughout the quarter instead of it all being back-ended. And between those \u2013 those five things I've all added, so bottom-line, I'd just tell you, there is not any one thing from, from a financial perspective \u2013 what I'll defer to Steve and Charles, you want to talk about the verticals and the like. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, let me get \u2013 and Charles you may have something else to add, but let me give you a vertical orientation to that, Mike. Whether it's bookings or revenue, let me give you a recurring revenue, kind of picture Q3 of 2015. Our cloud revenue, recurring revenue, is approaching 28% of total revenue in the company. So, you can obviously see there's growth in the cloud and IT services segment. The other big mover has been enterprise. We've gone from high-single-digit of our recurring revenue now to approaching 12% of our revenue in the enterprise vertical. We're still getting good growth in the other core verticals, but the big movers has really been around the core story that we've had last several quarters is the cloud and enterprise activity that we see around our cloud exchange and around the uptick on in those two verticals. Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. Maybe a little more color again. One, I think regionally, we've had strength across all three markets obviously with Europe and Asia in particular growing faster, but really very strong growth in the Americas given the overall size of the business. As Steve said, there are strong bookings across the board also as I think I mentioned in the last call, cloud and enterprise in particular are over-indexing meaningfully in bookings, meaning that comparing our percentage of bookings coming from those segments to the percentage of the installed base, those are really growing faster. But that's not \u2013 that over-indexing isn't caused by weakness in the others, it's really caused by strength in that particular ecosystem taking shape. And then the other thing I guess I'd point to as you can see, interconnection, we just said is a 21% grower on a constant currency basis compared to 15% or 16% overall. And so again, interconnection is also over-indexing significantly, which obviously has a materially positive impact to the business. And if you look at it and you unpack that a bit further and peel the onion back, it's really strong across our ecosystems. So, what I would say is in network, for example, we're actually seeing good strength on a net cross-connect basis, driven in part by really some of the grooming activity that occurred over the last couple of years subsiding and now actually networking \u2013 network providers and carriers really looking to add to their service portfolio in a variety of ways, which is increasing their appetite for interconnection. And now, also cloud is our fastest growing sort of end destination for interconnection, which I think is further evidence that that ecosystem is really starting to take shape. And that the secular trends are just extraordinary. If you look at the momentum in our Internet Exchange in terms of the port volumes and the \u2013 and how those translate into traffic growth, it just continues to say that mobile Big Data, Big Data and analytics, social media, et cetera and how people are really architecting to deliver greater levels of application performance in a hybrid multi-cloud world, really all adding across all the verticals. So I don't think there is any particular segment that has underperformed. I think there are some that are evolving, how people use us in the content and digital media sector has changed. One of the things, and it's been several years now, where some of those larger players moved to these multi-tiered architectures, which has really been a net benefit for us, has opened up capacity that we resold at higher rates and really they are using us more for content delivery, private CDN type implementations, hubbing applications and interaction between the cloud and the content and digital media world particularly in the advertising segment. So, really strong performance across the board. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you very much. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Mr. Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore. Your line is open. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Group LLC : Great. Thank you for taking the questions. I was wondering, Steve, if you could spend a little bit more time talking about what's happening with these enterprises that are coming in to plug into the hybrid and multi-cloud environments. On average, maybe how many different clouds are plugging into, how involved is Nimbo or your other sort of tech professionals in helping these people onboard? And then, I'm wondering if there's any relationship between what we're seeing in terms of the enterprises taking advantage of that ecosystem and some of the net pricing actions on the positive side that you guys have been talking to? And in fact, if there's any additional color in terms of breaking down those net positive pricing actions, that'd be great too. Thank you. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Why don't I start out here and then you guys can add around the edges? So with the enterprises, the primary draw with us right now, Jonathan, as most people on this phone know are with the large IaaS cloud providers, it's AWS, Microsoft, with Azure and the work we're doing with Office 365, Google, IBM, SoftLayer. And then there's a variety of other providers, SaaS and other infrastructure providers. But as you all know, the primary uptick today, as many of those enterprises are connecting to the larger IaaS providers, because that's where \u2013 we're making that really easy for them to do and it's highly secure and it's helping performance of applications, it's helping latency and all the things we've been talking about for years. So, it is the draw. The sales teams are setting a hook, as you've heard us talk about, with our network \u2013 with our Performance Hub offering. We very quickly transitioned into how we can connect them to the cloud exchange to see the cloud providers on the other side and then most of use cases and success stories that we're building are around everything we've described in our prepared remarks. I mean, we have a lots of use cases now, where we're approaching a 110 Fortune 500 companies now, that are in the house. So we're seeing great traction now with enterprises and the stories resonate, and so the two primary offerings that we've built the story around the last several quarters, the Performance Hub, which helps network optimization and application performance, I think obviously connecting to the cloud exchange to see the clouds is the primary driver. Nimbo is still early days, Charles can provide a little color on that. But it is starting to work where companies need to have a plan to find the multi-cloud or figure out how to take advantage of the hybrid cloud, they are coming to us, we're connecting those dots internally, we are helping them build those architecture plans and helping them build their transition plan, so that's to starting to happen. Pull through will start to happen for colo as it matures. And generally the ecosystem as Charles just described is a major draw here. And as we're getting deeper into the enterprises, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're seeing a big uptake in the interconnected requirements for enterprises across multiple industry verticals. Charles? Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. I would add I guess a few things. One, I'd point you to slide five in the deck around those four use cases that we're really starting to see take hold and importantly the bottom of that page which talks about the sort of quantifiable proof points of how enterprise customers in particular are creating value by using platform Equinix to implement a hybrid cloud and multi-cloud kind of strategy. It is definitely a longer and more complex sales cycle. We are clearly prosecuting the market from the top-down, meaning sort of targeting the top of the enterprise pyramid and as I said, probably more sophisticated enterprise buyers. Nimbo is having an impact. The interesting thing is I would say that there is virtually nobody at the top of that enterprise pyramid that we're engaged with, that is not already using or considering to use of either AWS or Azure or Google Cloud as a fundamental part of their hybrid cloud architecture. I mean, our Nimbo team is very well-positioned to help them through how to migrate applications into a hybrid cloud environment. Our solution architects, which we have now \u2013 we expanded significantly over the last couple of years. This quarter was actually the largest \u2013 we track the percentage of deals that they impact in our bookings and this is the largest quarter ever in terms of percentage of deals impacted and directly touched by that group. So definitely having an impact, still early innings I think in the overall evolution, but at least my experience in terms of how enterprise technology markets proceed, I think we're very much seeing this sort of early stage of lighthouse wins, which then begins to translate to the mid-market taking hold, particularly through channel, which also is proceeding well. So continue to be excited about that, but page five is I think a great place to look in terms of what's really attracting these customers. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks. And did you guys talk about the positive pricing actions and where that's coming from? Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think on balance what you're seeing is that we are pretty rigorous about implementing annual price increases into our contracts and because we have I think increased the level of discipline around installations we're taking into the facilities and as we say, right applications \u2013 right customer, right applications, right assets, what we're seeing is the churn is mitigating and also the sort of price pressure upon renewal when you're talking about high-value implementations is substantially sort of mitigated. And so, as a result what we were seeing, which is potentially a \u2013 that flipped on its head, is really now seeing that the price actions and the price increases really giving us a net benefit versus any kind of pressure on renewals, so. And I think that reflects also in the churn line. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Group LLC : All right. Thanks for taking the questions. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jonathan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. So, for Keith, I've got a question regarding slide 13 and the stabilized IBX comparison. I think that's a global slide and I wonder if you can just update us on a regional basis, how the cash-on-cash returns would compare for stabilized IBXs in EMEA versus Asia-Pac versus Americas? And then, kind of the same question for kind of the organic revenue growth that you're seeing across the regions in stabilized assets. And then, the second question is just around the indirect channel and you talked about an increasing portion of the bookings coming from agents and resellers and so forth and I wondered, are you still at the point where you're establishing that network of partners and broadening it or are you focusing more on depth within your existing set of indirect partners? Thank you. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Jonathan. Let me take the second one first and then, I'll kick it back to Keith to hit the first one on slide 13. We are definitely expanding the overall scope of the partner program, but I will say is that what we are doing is starting to focus our efforts more on what we believe the really high impact partners are. There's a set of a particularly sort of capable resellers that bring a very complete solution in the cloud space to customers who are looking to use us, again, as a hybrid cloud, sort of multi-cloud hub and we're having real success in terms of working with those partners to penetrate large enterprise customers. But we are selectively looking to expand that reseller base. Probably not a lot of focus on \u2013 I think we've got a pretty good set of referral and agent type partners that we're working with and those continue to be a solid source of lead generation for us. But our focus really is on the real value-added resellers and on our partnerships, our evolving partnerships with the technology platform players. So, we've got some nice success in the market with both AWS and Microsoft in terms of sell with type of motion with them. And that's something I think we'll continue to put a lot of energy and in fact we're increasing our field force now to really accelerate the investment in that. And we think there's a lot of upside in that, so continuing to grow, but probably more focused on generating more volume from our productive partners at this stage rather than a focus on more partners. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : So, Jonathan, just on your first question as related to where we're seeing the growth across the regions. The 67 stabilized assets, it's broken down and again it's on page \u2013 if you look at page 27, 28 and 29 of the deck that we shared with you. We break down where the assets are. I don't actually have the specifics on a region basis on the revenue growth, but let me just give you some broad color. As I said, when you look at the Americas, it's growing roughly 10%, you've got Europe growing roughly 22% year-over-year and then you've got Asia growing 26% year-over-year. You can see where the stabilized assets are and where we're investing. I think it's something that we'll have to \u2013 as we think about the question, we'll have to probably respond offline to that specific request. But as Charles alluded to, let me just give you some color in the sense that as we commented on, we're filling up our capacity in a very meaningful way. As we said 4,700 cabinets sold this quarter, our utilization levels are moving up. We can see it across our inventory base. We're looking at our expansion activities. So suffice it to say, we're seeing good growth across the organization, across all three regions and so I'm very excited about where we are. But to give you a specific right now, I don't actually have that at hand and so we'll take that as a to do. Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's a probably a little dangerous speculation, but what I would say is the likelihood is because of the strength of the interconnection business in the Americas and the higher average price point of interconnection on a unit basis, I would guess that you're going to see slightly higher stabilized yield \u2013 growth rates in those assets, but again, we'd have to break that down. But we are seeing good momentum also in interconnection in the other two regions. And again, you see continued power uptake in all of those facilities as well, so it's going to be a blend of those things, but I think I would say there is strength across the board. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then just real quick on Bit-isle, what would be a typical integration timeframe for that size of acquisition from both an IT and organizational perspective? Are we talking months or quarters before we see full integration? Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, it'll take a little bit long. This is Steve, Jonathan. It'll take a little bit longer than a typical integration plan in Japan, just due to the culture and the language barriers, et cetera. There's a fairly sizable team that we're picking up, and there's pretty significant language challenges, but we'll convert the financials, the IT pretty quickly, but we're going to take our time with branding decisions and marketing decisions and go-to-market decisions, and the plan is being built now, but it is going to be a little bit longer than a typical integration just because of those complexities. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Mr. Mike McCormack from Jefferies. Your line is open. Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Hey, guys, thanks. Maybe just a quick comment on the combined DLR/Telx, as far as competition goes, any change there? And then I guess secondly on the Asia-Pac margin expansion has been really steady and increasing, your just thoughts on drivers there? And then how high can those margins go in APAC? Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, why don't I start with the DLR/Telx, just a couple of thoughts and then Charles, you probably have a thought or two you could add, but I think our general belief across the company is that the combination will not change the competitive landscape meaningfully, and I think they understand and I think the market understands that the degree of difficulty to \u2013 attempt to \u2013 I think the question is getting at, can they replicate what's been going on here for 17 years? And I believe the degree of difficulty to replicate a global at-scale platform that has the consistency of service delivery and full portfolio of services that we built in 17 years is a pretty high bar to attack and huge investment in some fairly unfamiliar areas to get a global retail business up and running. So, I think it's going to help in their Americas business for sure, but there's a lot between the wholesale and retail when you talk about what happens between the executive suite and the assets on the frontlines that really matters, and I think there's a lot of work to be done there and that's where Equinix spends a lot of time. Services, all the stuff you're hearing about today is really our sweet spot and the core difference I think between a retail and a wholesale model. Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. I mean, just same themes I think, but in the end, competition isn't about what we're saying on investor calls or analyst days or anything else, it's about what happens at the customer and it's about \u2013 and competition is created. If there is a company that can provide a reasonably comparable solution to a customer requirement and in that regard I've maintained and continue to maintain that the competitive overlap between our businesses and that of DLR even in a post Telx world remains very small. So, digital is a good choice and a very credible provider for companies who have very large footprint requirements that are part of a multi-tiered architecture and we've seen that dynamic play out for several years now. And if customer needs good reliable space and power in large chunks at competitive prices then digital is going to be an effective provider, given their cost of capital and their reach. But if they're looking to architecture, IT infrastructure to improve application performance, reduce network costs, enable hybrid multi-cloud, then they typically need a highly distributed environment, and that requires global reach, broad and deep network and cloud density, and a level of retail scale and delivery capability that we've invested hundreds of millions of dollars in over the years and have 4,000-plus employees delivering globally. So, we feel very good about our ability to be effective with the customer in terms of meeting their needs and that's the critical piece. So, bottom line is, we don't see a ton of competitive overlap between the businesses. Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : So as it relates to your question just on the margin for Asia-Pacific. Clearly, we saw a great result this quarter of 52%, part of the metaphor we're seeing albeit, it might be something that will not continue on an extended period of days or time period is that with the weakening of the Singapore dollar, there's a number of contracts that we have in Singapore that are U.S. dollar denominated and so with your cost in one currency and your revenue in another, that bodes very well when it's going the right direction. We do hedge against that, but the bottom line we're getting some tailwind from that. In addition, there was some one-off utility benefits roughly of $1 million in Singapore and Hong Kong that we were able to achieve this quarter. But I think more fundamentally to your question, Mike is that look the Asia-Pacific region is running \u2013 roughly 13% of its revenues are in the form of interconnection. The Americas is roughly 22%. It would not surprise me to see the Asian market continue to move its margins up into the right as it continues to fill its assets. But I don't think you'll get to the same level of the Americas, which is roughly 62% today excluding the corporate overhead cost. And so, we see it moving up towards, I would think the mid-50%s over an extended period of time, just like I would see Europe moving up a little bit to roughly the 50% mark, and then of course the Americas is at the highest level. So as an organization, I think increasing our \u2013 sorry, filling up our capacity, looking to bend our cost curve, and run the organization more efficiently, I think it bodes well for our overall targets of continuing to scale and drive margin into the business. Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will come from Mr. Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks a lot for fitting me in. I think Keith you said that churn would be at the higher end of the 2% to 2.5% range. Can you just provide a little bit more color around that and is that sort of coming through the quarter or is it coming at the end of the quarter as we think about the guidance that you've given and then perhaps just thinking forward into 2016, should we still think about that 2% to 2.5% range, it's sort of been up and down quite a bit, been good for a few quarters, this is going to be the highest in a little while, some color on that would be great? Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Simon,, I'd have to say clearly, as we've said in the past, sometimes churn is lumpy and as much as we anticipated churn activity this quarter, we said on an earlier call, there are some deals that are still coming. They're larger than the average, let's put it that way. And so there's one deal where we said in European markets, where a customer was going to relocate to their own data center. We knew we'd have them in one of our facilities for a couple to three years. That time period has ended, and so we're anticipating that move, albeit, it has been delayed. And so I'd tell you it's going to happen at the backend of the quarter. And so, we'll recognize the churn this period. As we look forward, I'd tell you there's no reason for us to come off. At this point our churn metrics for \u2013 I'm sorry, our guidance for 2016, I think is very reasonable to assume anywhere between 2% and 2.5%. But we'll fully update you on that on the Q4 call once we have the clarity, but there's nothing that's sitting out there that's of a concern. And so I think an average of somewhere between 2% and 2.5% per quarter is very reasonable to assume in your models. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you. Katrina Rymill - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. That concludes our Q3 call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: Okay. Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. 2015 was a transformational year for Equinix. We delivered accelerated growth, expanded our global platform with two strategic acquisitions, completed our first year operating as a REIT, and established ourselves as a foundation for the cloud ecosystem that continues to drive IT transformation. Our strong financial performance reflects our position as the global leader in retail colocation and interconnection, truly serving as the place where opportunity connects for leading networks, clouds, content providers and enterprises. We continue to extend our market-leading network density attracting wireline, wireless and increasingly subsea carriers who are using Platform Equinix to efficiently interconnect and serve their end customers. Our data centers act as a powerful commerce center for the largest service providers to reach their customers and are positioning us to capture the enterprise as they implement next-generation IT architectures. We will further leverage our leadership position through the integration of Telecity and Bit-isle and scale the business to drive even more value for our combined customers. Before I turn to the quarterly results, I'd like to reflect on a few of the meaningful milestones we achieved in 2015, starting with financial performance on slide three. With another year of record bookings activity in 2015, we generated over $2.7 billion of revenue, up 16% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. We delivered over $1.27 billion of adjusted EBITDA or a 47% margin and over 100 basis point improvement over last year while continuing to invest in the business. This drove AFFO growth of 25% on a normalized and constant currency basis, exceeding our prior guidance after adjusting for the Telecity transaction-related FX loss. Second, it was a phenomenal year for our interconnection solutions. Interconnection revenue continues to outpace overall revenue, growing 20% year-over-year on a constant currency organic basis. That's over 171,000 cross-connects, 3,300 ports on our Internet Exchange, and dramatic growth on our Cloud Exchange we are benefiting from the strong secular trends that are driving businesses to become increasingly interconnected. Third, we significantly expanded our global platform, both organically and inorganically. Equinix completed 20 major IBX expansions in 2015, creating the needed capacity to support strong fill rates in high demand markets. Overall, our development activity continues to generate highly attractive returns and healthy yield on our sizeable base of stabilized assets. With the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, we further expanded Platform Equinix, which now spans 145 data centers across 40 metros in 21 countries. Combined, Equinix now operates over 14 million gross square feet of colocation space, enhancing our position as the largest retail data center footprint in the world. Fourth, we continue to establish Equinix as the home of the interconnected cloud, which in turn, is attracting enterprises that are adopting hybrid and multi-cloud as their IT architecture of choice. Key cloud customers including Amazon, Cisco, IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle to mention a few, are all using Equinix to scale their infrastructure globally and are now deployed across an average of 17 markets. And finally, we successfully completed our first year operating as a REIT and returned $394 million back to our shareholders. We were included in the S&P 500, the MSCI RMZ and the FTSE NAREIT indices, a reflection of our position as both a technology leader and as the largest data center REIT. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet raising $2.6 billion in debt and equity in the fourth quarter fortifying our capital structure while providing a strong liquidity position. Now turning to the quarter, we had a great finish to the year delivering record bookings in the fourth quarter with particular strength in the Americas and robust metrics including our highest ever interconnection activity, and very firm yield per cabinet. We continue to take market share, capturing outsized portion of the new infrastructure deployments from both clouds and enterprises. The quality and scale of our wins continues to increase and we are proud that over 140 of the Fortune 500 are Equinix customers. Our geographic reach remains critical to customers with over 55% of our revenue coming from customers deployed globally across all three regions, and over 84% from customers deployed across multiple metros. Our global platform is increasingly defensible, durable and hard to replicate with regards to reaching capacity as well as performance. With the addition of the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, we added 40 data centers and 1,100 people across Europe and Japan. This scale positions us well to build market leadership, increase capacity, enhance cloud and network density and grow customer ecosystems for years to come. With Telecity, we've added seven new metro markets to our portfolio creating a large opportunity for current Equinix customers to expand further north and east across EMEA. Additionally, there are over 500 customers of former Telecity that have business presence in another country where Platform Equinix resides, creating a potential for powerful cross-selling opportunities as we integrate. We are confident both these transactions will drive significant long-term value creation for our customers and our partners. Now let me cover quarterly highlights from our industry verticals, starting with the network vertical. This customer base customer continues to grow as we enhance ecosystems in which networks and mobile providers can participate and grow their businesses. Strong global bandwidth demand is driving a resurgence of subsea cable projects, creating new opportunities for Equinix. These service providers are accelerating returns by terminating cables directly into our IBXs where they can further benefit by gaining access to key business ecosystems. In the content and digital media vertical, content customers are expanding across our global platform to meet the continued explosion of consumer demand for digital content and applications. The advertising sub segment remains the fastest growth driver in this vertical as digital advertising takes share from traditional channels. Customers expanding this quarter include AppNexus which optimizes programmatic digital advertising; AudienceScience, a global advertising technology and services company; and Cr\u00e9teil, a French company specializing in performance marketing. Turning to the financial services vertical, in addition to our strong electronic trading ecosystem, we continue to diversify across sub-segments including insurance, wealth management, and banking which contributed to record bookings for the quarter. New wins include a top 20 private wealth management firm initiating a multi-cloud strategy to speed to market. A Fortune 500 asset management company that is connecting to clouds over our Equinix Cloud Exchange and a partner-led deal with a top 10 insurance firm based in Europe. In cloud and IT services, the cloud ecosystem delivered strong growth this quarter driven by key infrastructure-as-a-service providers such as AWS and Microsoft, as well as momentum with Software-as-a-Service providers who represent the fastest growing sub-segment of this vertical. SaaS customer expansions include ServiceNow, an IT service management provider; and Shape Security, an advanced application defense provider that offer security services for Cloud Exchange clients. We continue to see momentum on our Cloud Exchange and have over 300 enterprises, clouds, IT service providers, and networks interconnecting using this solution. Turning to the enterprise. The enterprise vertical delivered strong bookings as businesses seek to re-architect IT to adapt to rapidly changing business requirements. By leveraging an interconnection-oriented architecture, enterprises can address multiple IT challenges and solve for the cost, scaling and performance needs of today's digital world. For the second quarter, enterprise was the largest source of new customer adds with particular traction in manufacturing and professional services. New wins include Polo Ralph Laurent, a premium clothing and lifestyle brand; Granite Construction, an S&P 500 civil general contractor and construction material producer; and Oriflame Cosmetics, a Swedish cosmetic manufacturer. Over 300 customers have deployed our Performance Hub solution, which is an extremely attractive entry point for enterprise customers who seek to optimize network architectures, and also access the cloud and drive application performance, and we are already enjoying significant upsell and cross-sell traction with these customers. So let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to cover some more specifics for the quarter. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Let me start by saying from so many points of view, Q4 was the best quarter we have experienced to date. The momentum in our organic business combined with Telecity and Bit-isle sets us up nicely for 2016, as well as our initial look-through into 2017. And with my prepared remarks I'll first review our full year 2015 results. Then I'll provide some commentary on key metrics for 2016 which have a number of moving parts. Finally I'll wrap up with some high level comments on the fourth quarter. So, starting with revenues. We reported revenues of over $2.72 billion for 2015, a 16% year-over-year normalized and constant currency growth rate. A clear demonstration of our ability to drive outsized growth as we benefit from the scale of our global platform, as well as enjoy record non-recurring revenue activity. And we believe this momentum will continue into 2016. We expect to deliver normalized and constant currency growth of greater than 13% for our organic business and over $540 million of revenues from Telecity and Bit-isle at current exchange rates. We believe the Telecity business, net of the expected divestitures, will grow revenues between 8% and 9% in 2016, while Bit-isle's revenues will remain essentially flat year-over-year consistent with our expectations while we look to optimize this business over the next 24 months. In 2015, we improved our organic adjusted EBITDA margin by over 100 basis points to 46.7%. And as we continue to scale the business, we expect to deliver another 100 basis points of improvement on the organic business in 2016 as we maintain discipline and focus on our spending initiatives. Another key driver to our continued margin improvement is the healthy price yield derived from a disciplined pricing initiative and strong interconnection activity. For 2016, we expect our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins to be greater than 47.3%, excluding integration costs, or 45.6% on an as-reported basis. Our 2015 pro forma AFFO, which excludes the impact of the Telecity FX losses and the integration cost, was $905 million significantly higher than expected for the year. Looking forward on a normalized and constant currency basis, 2016 AFFO is expected to grow greater than 23% over the prior year. With respect to the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, we're very excited by these acquisitions and the ability to strengthen our market position. That said, I want to highlight a few areas recognizing we'll be incurring some costs that won't be part of the ongoing business, thereby allowing you to better understand the combined business on a go-forward basis. So let me start with FX. We elected to hedge the cash portion of the Telecity purchase price. In effect, we lock-in the dollar value of the sizable deal. This resulted in an FX loss of $61 million in 2015, with $49 million of the loss being recognized in Q4. These losses impacted our AFFO metric for both Q3 and Q4, and for the year. For Q1, as we completed the purchase of the Telecity acquisition, we experience an incremental $50 million loss in the quarter. Again, this loss will impact our Q1 and 2016 AFFO metric. Finally, it's important to note that the offset of the Telecity FX losses is a corresponding reduction to the purchase price of Telecity. For both Telecity and Bit-isle, we've begun the integration process to combine the teams, the organizations, and the systems together. We expect to incur $58 million in integration cost in 2016 as anticipated in our investment models with an approximate $20 million of additional integration costs being spent in 2017. These costs support system to work, of significance, employees cost including severance and retention, and substantial organizational restructuring in support of our REIT and other tax initiatives. We expect incremental revenue, cost and CapEx synergies from the acquisitions from Telecity and Bit-isle as we integrate these businesses. Our current revenue guidance contemplates modest revenue synergy assumptions this year, which we expect to ramp up over time as both Equinix and Telecity customers leverage the expanded footprint, service portfolio, and rich ecosystems of the combined company. As we progress with our integration efforts, we also expect to achieve $30 million in annual cost savings with about 50% of these savings being realized before the end of this year and the rest coming in 2017. For CapEx synergies, the available Bit-isle inventory has positioned us well in the Tokyo market, allowing us to defer significant capital spend to other projects, while the Telecity capacity in our overlapping markets allows us to free up capital to be deployed in other markets both in Europe and across the platform. And as previously announced, we need to divest eight assets from the combined Equinix-Telecity EMEA business with a target divestiture date of mid-2016. In light of the current momentum in the business and the size of the market opportunity in front of us, it is our intention to reinvest the divestiture proceeds back into the business. We currently believe this is the highest and best use of our capital. We believe this allows us to maximize both our short-term and longer-term shareholder value objectives while providing us the strategic and operational flexibility we've historically enjoyed, particularly during the volatile times. And these proceeds along with capital raised in November should allow us to self-fund the business for the foreseeable future despite our increased expansion activities and anticipated growing cash dividend. From an AFFO perspective, the value of these acquisitions and our AFFO generating potential is better than our original assumptions. With a view towards 2017, we expect these acquisitions on a combined basis to be accretive to Equinix's AFFO per share for the 2017 reporting year excluding the integration costs. So turning to the fourth quarter, it was another terrific quarter at Equinix. Our strategy continues to deliver better than expected results across the company. At the global level, we had record gross and net bookings with particular strength in the financial services and enterprise verticals. Our interconnection metrics were again outstanding as we added 7,500 cross connects and 162 exchange for this quarter. Our MRR per cab on FX-neutral basis was very firm and we remain well-positioned across each of our operating regions. As depicted on slide four, global Q4 revenues were $730.5 million; our 52nd consecutive quarter of top-line revenue growth, up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 17% of the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our as-reported revenues include $21.6 million of Bit-isle revenue for November and December, consistent with our expectations and the investment model. Q4 organic revenues net of our FX hedges absorbs an $8 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter, and a $4 million negative currency impact when compared to our FX guidance rates. Currency volatility against the majority of our key operating currencies continue to cause significant FX headwinds. For 2016, the strengthening in U.S. dollar increased a $51 million FX headwind against revenues and a $29 million headwind against adjusted EBITDA for our organic business when compared to the average FX rates used in 2015. For Europe, we've hedged over 85% of our Equinix organic business. Given the growth of the international businesses including Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, we expect our revenue mix to shift such that greater than 50% of our revenues will be generated from outside the U.S. Global adjusted EBITDA was $333.1 million, up 4% over the prior quarter and 20% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our normalized adjusted EBITDA margin was 46.4% and includes $2.8 million in integration costs. Our Q4 organic adjusted EBITDA performance net of our FX hedges reflects a negative $5.4 million currency impact when compared to the average FX rates last quarter, and a $1.2 million negative impact when compared to our guidance rates. Global AFFO was $178 million. Excluding the Telecity foreign currency loss and acquisition related cost, AFFO on a normalized and constant currency basis increased 4% over the prior quarter, above the top end of our guidance range by $13 million largely due to lower than expected cash taxes. And finally moving to churn. Global MRR churn for Q4 was 2.3% consistent with our prior guidance and weighted towards the end of the quarter. For 2016, we expect our quarterly MRR churn to remain in our targeted 2% to 2.5% quarterly range. Now, I'd like to provide some highlights on the regions whose full results were covered in slides five to seven. All three regions delivered better than expected revenues with EMEA and Asia Pacific showing normalizing constant currency growth of 20% and 25% respectively, while the Americas region produced growth of 13% on its much larger base. The Americas region had a great quarter delivering record bookings driven by the financial and enterprise verticals, very firm yield per cabinet, and advanced interconnection quarter of all time. EMEA delivered another strong quarter of bookings with particular strength in our French and German markets, while Asia Pacific continued its rapid growth as customers deploy across the region with gross bookings driven by cloud and IT services, enterprise, and network verticals. Interconnection revenues continue to outpace overall growth of the business with the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific interconnection revenues now at 22%, 10%, and 13% respectively over the recurring revenues. And now, looking to balance sheet, please refer to slide eight. Unrestricted cash and investments increased this quarter to $2.2 billion due to the successful financings in November, while our restricted cash balances totaled $490 million, largely due to the escrow funds related to the Telecity deal. Our year-end net debt leverage ratio was 3.2 times our Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA, although it steps up to greater than 4 times after funding the cash portion of the Telecity transaction. Given the favorable cash flow attributes of the business model, we expect the Equinix calculated leverage ratio to return to the higher end of our targeted 3 times to 4 times adjusted EBITDA over the next 12 months to 18 months. Now, switching to AFFO and dividends on slide nine. For 2016, we expect our as-reported AFFO to be greater than $970 million, a 17% year-over-year increase. On a normalized and constant currency basis, AFFO would be greater than $1.078 billion, or a 23% increase over the prior year. Turning to dividends. Today, we announced our Q1 dividend of $1.75 a share, a 3.6% increase over the prior cash dividend per share. For 2016, our projected total cash dividends to be paid will increase approximately $500 million, a 27% increase over the prior year. Our normalized AFFO payout ratio will approximate 52% in 2016. Our estimated share count for 2016 approximate 70.5 million shares including 6.9 million shares issued to Telecity shareholders, and 1.96 million shares expected to be issued in June 2016 to our convertible debt holders. We continue to believe that both organic and inorganic growth will be the primary ingredient for a steadily growing cash dividend, and we've maintained the flexibility to move additional entities from the taxable restructure to the qualified restructure over time. Now, looking at capital expenditures, please refer to slide 10. For the quarter, our capital expenditures were $281 million including recurring CapEx of $45 million, slightly higher than guidance due to the timing of cash payments to our contractors. We now have 14 announced expansion projects underway. For 2016, we expect 95% of expansion capital to be allocated to campus or existing market builds and 5% for new market development. Given the strong performance in our key markets, we expect to move forward with additional expansion phases in Ashburn, Frankfort, Hong Kong, Silicon Valley, and a new flagship build in the Amsterdam Science Park, an interconnection hub. Also given our high utilization rate of 81% and increasing, as well as strong development returns, we expect 2016 CapEx to range between $900 million and $1 billion, which contemplates several new first-phase IBX build on our core Equinox owned campuses, including Ashburn and Silicon Valley, as well as a number of non-U.S. campuses. And finally, we've provided you a number of slides to bridge the normalized 2015 performance to our 2016 guidance, including slides for revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Please refer to slides 13 to 17. These slides also include the contributions from Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions. Steve? Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: Okay. Thanks, Keith. Let me now cover our 2016 strategy on slide 12. Our strategic priorities remains centered on driving growth by pressing our competitive advantage and investing to capture significant opportunities such as the cloud-enabled enterprise. We will allocate capital towards these high-value opportunities and internal strength in our economic model. In the near term, we will focus our energy on successfully integrating Telecity and Bit-isle and growing our market leadership globally. Organically our efforts will be focused on capturing the enterprise through a series of initiatives to build cloud density, create and deploy innovative product solutions, generate demand in targeted segments, and provide professional services focused on enabling the adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud. We will also continue to ramp our channel program to enhance our reach into the enterprise through agents, resellers, systems integrators and key platform partners. Over the longer term, interconnection will continue to be the essence of our advantage, and Equinix is well-positioned to become the intersection point between the Internet of Things, clouds, networks and the enterprises. We are making meaningful investments to foster new ecosystems to capture this opportunity. And we'll continue to invest in scaling our systems and processes and evolving our capabilities in response to these customer needs. Based on what we see in the market and the steps we are taking at Equinix to capitalize on these opportunities, I continue to be very optimistic about our future. And the last on slide 18, which summarizes our Q1 and full-year 2016 guidance including FX impacts. Let me cover a few thoughts on our 2016 outlook. First, we continue to deliver another solid year of growth. For the full year of 2016, we expect revenues to be greater than $3.55 billion, a 30% growth on an as-reported basis, or a normalized and constant currency growth rate of greater than 13% year-over-year. Second, our organic adjusted EBITDA margin continues to improve as we drive increased efficiency into the business and scale our operating model. For 2016, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be greater than $1.62 billion or 16% year-over-year growth on a normalized and constant currency basis. This includes a 100-basis point adjusted EBITDA margin improvement for the Equinix Organic business. And the growth of our business is driving increased adjusted funds from operations, and ultimately, cash flow and dividends. AFFO normalized for the Telecity transaction related FX loss is expected to be greater than $1.078 billion, a 23% growth year-over-year, demonstrating the health of the business model. And finally given our strong pipeline, firm yields and healthy returns, we continue to invest in our business and expect 2016 capital expenditures to range between $900 million and $1 billion for the year. So in closing, the strength of our business is translating into solid revenue growth, firm yield and healthy margins, all of which combine to give us the financial fire power to continue to invest in our global platform and develop innovative solutions. Our fundamental growth continues to drive significant value creation for our shareholders, a reflection of the important role that we play in a rapidly evolving digital economy. So let me stop here, and I'll turn it over to you, Sam, to open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is from Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you for all the additional detail and taking the questions. I guess, Steve, if I could, I'd love to review a couple of the sort of big ticket items that you guys brought to the conversation last quarter, and see if we can get an update on them. And I guess the three things that really stand out are; last quarter you talked about a second consecutive quarter of positive pricing actions; you talked about an accelerating TAM; and you talked about the beginning of the emergence of cloud-driven enterprise demand. And while you highlighted enterprise amongst the verticals that were strong, I'd certainly love to hear anything explicit as it applies to sort of, again, cloud-driven enterprise demand. So just if you could sort of review us on those three points. Thanks. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: Sure. Why don't I just start with a couple of comments, and Charles and Keith can chime in here. Those are three good questions, Jonathan. The pricing actions continue to be favorable to us as we renew and move forward with existing customers that are extending in multiple markets with us. So we're staying very disciplined with our activities and our actions and our deal reviews with our customers as they continue to grow into the global platform. And so that's showing up every quarter, and I would just tell you that's tied to the discipline of our deal reviews and how we manage that, and Charles can talk about that in a second because he sits on top of those. The accelerating TAM, generally, is because we're prosecuting a dozen-plus other industry verticals that we refer to as the enterprise outside of our core five industry verticals that we've been focused on. And it goes to this hundreds of thousands of customers, prospects, I should say, that we are knocking on their door now via the channel or via the direct sales engine to talk to them about helping them enable them to get to the multi-cloud and get to the Hybrid Cloud environment. So the cloud enterprise, the simple answer, the reason why we're a cloud enabling these data centers, is to replicate the network density that we achieved the first 16 years, 17 years of this company to make it easy for any CIO of an enterprise, to look inside these facilities and see that they can publically, privately move their traffic, certain applications that are mission critical, revenue facing, customer-focused applications that they can get them to the multi-cloud and get them to take advantage of the performance, the costs, and the IT transformation that's taking place. So we're seeing uplift across all three of these things generally because of the uptake in cloud. And cloud is driving most of this. Charles, why don't you add a little bit of color here? Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. Again, all three of these things continue \u2013 we continue positive pricing actions. And as Steve said that's showing up in our yield continuing to be very firm across the board in terms of MRR per cab. The accelerating TAM is really absolutely linked to this enterprise phenomenon, and the building and the scaling of the cloud ecosystem both the cloud density, CSP side of that ecosystem, as well as the enterprise, and I think we've had \u2013 continue to have a number of big lighthouse wins. And what I would tell you is that I think this is probably the eighth consecutive quarter that both cloud and enterprise has over indexed on a bookings basis relatively to their installed base. Meaning, that those who were continuing to see an evolution of the business, not because our mature ecosystems are waning, but rather because we're seeing an acceleration in the cloud ecosystem. And this big addressable is really an artifact of people migrating to the cloud, adopting public cloud, using Equinix as a private access option to the public cloud, and really enabling \u2013 really selecting multi-cloud, Hybrid Cloud as the IT architecture of choice. And I think if you look at our core metrics, the business is really hitting on all cylinders against all three of those factors. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Group LLC : Great. I'll circle back. Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Thanks, Jonathan. Operator : Thank you. And out next question is from Paul Morgan with Canaccord. Your line is now open. Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about the external growth opportunity that you're seeing? Obviously, there's a lot of chatter about the telco data center divestures out there. And how you see your appetite for acquisitions, and whether you would consider different structures such as JVs and the like if the opportunity arises, and kind of how you might see that play out in 2016? Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: Guys, do you want me to start or do you want me... Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. Go ahead. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: Paul, this is Steve. Why don't I take that and let Keith and Charles add to what thoughts they may have here. So, mostly all of you should be aware that publicly there are a couple of big telcos that are interested and trying to divest some assets, and these are both the big telcos that acquired cloud companies three years, four years, five years ago, and it includes those cloud data centers. It's public, they're positioning them, they're talking to several people. We are one of them. And our position is there are certain assets in those portfolios that we would be interested in, obviously, where there's cloud network density and the power and location, but there's many of those assets that wouldn't make any sense for us. So we're in the early stages, exploratory stages talking to these companies. Those are the two that are public. There's other conversations going on. There's plenty of companies that are interested in getting out of the data center business. So it's a very active market on top of the divestiture that Keith mentioned that we're doing in Europe. So there's a lot of activity, mostly pressured and driven by the big infrastructure-as-of-service companies who are going as fast as they are, AWS, Microsoft, Google, et cetera, and they're putting a lot of pressure on companies that decided to get into the infrastructure-as-of-service business, and now they're deciding to get out of it, and their data centers are going with it. The telco is probably aimed \u2013 most of the cash that we collect on these will be aimed at, as you all know, aimed at spectrum and aimed at their mobile initiatives, and so it makes sense why they're looking at these. But as I said, there are specific assets that would make sense to us, but it's very early days in the dialog. Charles, I don't know what else you'd add, you're in the middle of... Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Well, I guess, I think you covered most of it. The only one point you've talked about in there, Paul, that might be worth touching on is whether we would consider JVs or other creative commercial structures. I would say that, I think to the extent that there were structures that would allow us to potentially gain access to the assets that we see as most accretive to our strategy, and on point from a capital allocation standpoint for us, we would entertain those. But I think there are only a very select set of assets that really support our interconnection-rich ecosystem-based strategy, and so we would be focused on those, most likely. And I think that to the extent we could be \u2013 there are other creative ways to get that to happen, we would consider those. But we also have a lot to say grace over right now in terms of getting the integrations done, and so we want to remain very focused on executing the business. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: The only thing I'd add, Paul \u2013 this is Steve, just one last comment is, we'll remain proactive but highly selective in any potential M&A for this type of discussion. And as Charles said, it would have to pass through the filters. It would extend our global platform. It would help enhance our interconnection or our network density. It would help us capture the cloud enterprise discussion that we're having. If it passes those filters, we're going to take a close look at it. Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. I mean, in Telecity's case, obviously, there's some non-core assets that you're planning to divest. But I guess, in this case would it be fair to say that just because of the scale of what you would classify as non-core, that taking on major portfolios where a majority or a big chunk of the assets are, have to be pegged for sale is not kind of what you're looking for? Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Paul, what I'd like to first say is that, unfortunately, the assets that we're selling they're not non-core. They're effectively mandated through our work with the European regulatory authority. Clearly, to us, we would love to keep all of the assets in our portfolio. But that all said, it goes back to what Charles and Steve alluded to. To the extent that we can acquire assets that are accretive to our overall strategy and they create value for our shareholders, those acquisitions or joint ventures, we absolutely will pursue them. But we are very much focused on, as Steve alluded to, driving investment decisions that support our cloud-enabled strategy, extend our global reach, and enhance our interconnection activities. Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research. Your line is now open. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Just wondering if you'd give us a bit more of a look into the integration process for the two acquisitions that you've completed, and what are the major milestones that investors should be watching over. Thanks. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : I think we're going to have, Michael, Charles and I will take this one. Let me first start with Bit-isle because I think that's an important one, then Charles perhaps, you can take the Telecity one. I think what's really important to understand about Bit-isle, as we said in our prepared remarks, revenues are essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. And I want certain investors to realize, certainly from a margin perspective, Bit-isle is dilutive to our margins today. It is very clear to us given the inventory capacity they have in the Tokyo market specifically. This was an asset that we bought for sub-10 multiple to EBITDA. We believe upon filling up our assets, we're going to be able to enjoy the ability to fill up their assets over a period of time, while at the same time assessing, if you will, the strategic landscape of the number of operating units that Bit-isle had. And so as a company, we fully intend over a reasonable period of time, it will not be over an 18-month or 24-month period. But probably over the next three years to four years that we would be able to capture all the value associated with the Bit-isle acquisition, fill up their assets and get their margins up to, basically, where our Asia Pacific business is running today, which is in the 45% to 50% EBITDA margin basis. But we're being very disciplined about this acquisition. Culturally, it's a meaningful acquisition for us, and we're very sensitive to the environment that we're operating in. But we recognize in the investment decision, that over the short-term we weren't going to see any meaningful uplift in the business model and all this will be accretive from day one because we use debt to buy the asset. We're going to be very methodical about how we drive value into that acquisition. Charles, you want to...? Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. In terms of process, Mike, I guess I'd make a couple of comments. I think that these are obviously both somewhat localized assets with Telecity being a strictly European platform and Bit-isle really being contained to Japan. So our local teams, both in EMEA region and in Japan, have primary responsibility for driving the integration efforts. That said, we did take an individual from my team who really has been my right hand for quite a while when I ran the Americas business and into my role as the COO who really understands our business deeply, has a deep network across the company. We've actually exported him to \u2013 and he's living in Amsterdam now with his family and is leading the integration effort for Telecity and sort of providing overall oversight to our integration activities in terms of aligning them, keeping them consistent in approach, identifying and applying best practices, et cetera. So that's kind of how we're going about it. In terms of the metrics, I think, to watch, we're obviously watching them very closely and we will update you as appropriate on these, but I think they are; number one, how are we doing on integrating the sales teams and driving the upsell and the cross-sell activities. And that's one we're probably not going to give a ton of granular insight into publicly, but it's not something that we obviously are watching very, very closely and feel very optimistic about. Secondly, the synergy capture. We talked about what we expect in terms of synergies and we're driving the teams to those expectations to meet or exceed our synergy estimates from an expense synergy standpoint. And then we're aligning our capital planning processes to make sure that we are gaining the CapEx synergies where we can and ensuring that we continue to have the capacity to respond to the fill rates in high demand markets. And then lastly, I think, probably keeping an eye on our progress on the divestiture and again we'll report our progress to you on that as we have it. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from David Barton with Bank of America. Your line is now open. David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess I have to ask kind of banal financial question. I guess, Keith, I think the market expectation was for AFFO number becoming probably $50 million or $60 million north of the $1.078 billion you kind of called out here. I feel like that probably had a lot to do with people not expecting a lot of the assets just being moved into discontinued ops right away. Could you put a AFFO number alongside the $77 million EBITDA number that you pulled out of the guidance for those divested assets so we could kind of look at a pro forma more normalized number? And any other moving parts in that would be great. And then second, again, along the same lines just to make sure so we're all on the same page. In terms of the share count we want to be using now, so we're looking at an AFFO per share. I think that there's a lot of numbers on, I think, slide 38 in terms of the share count. And if you could kind of tell us \u2013 or page 35 \u2013 which one of these is the one we're supposed to be using to look at valuation? Thanks. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Okay certainly, David. I think first and foremost, I think the page 35 clearly depicts the share count activity that you should be expecting both as we sit here at the end of 12/31/2015 and then certainly what you should expect on a go-forward basis, and so the numbers that I shared with you, roughly 6.9 million shares will be issued to the Telecity shareholders and then 1.96 million shares issued to convertible debt holders. That all said, I think there's somewhat of \u2013 there appears to be some clarity over what piece the denominator is, which is the share count. And so a lot of the discussion then really has to go into what's sitting up in the numerator. I think the most important thing as you've said I've alluded to David, the divestiture is certainly, it's a meaningful divestiture. There's eight assets as you can see. As reflected in our bridge, you can see there's roughly $70 million of revenue that's been taken out \u2013 sorry, probably $70 million of EBITDA that has been taken out of the analysis and that's on slide 14 for those who are following along. A lot of that value recognizing, that's coming right out of the AFFO base. There's nothing that that gets dragged along with that recognizing that, of course, there'll be some movement in maybe how we recognize the revenue or the deferred installation, but overall, that's almost a complete drop-through to the AFFO line. And as a result, when we step back and look at how was the business performing relative to our expectations, I think it's really important to note two things. Number one is Equinix proper is driving more margin into the business. Not only did we do it this year, but we're setting ourselves up to do it next year, being 2016. So that 100 basis points of improvement is certainly being realized. You can see that Telecity is coming in with the RemainCo assets, they're going to have a margin profile that's higher than Equinix proper, and then we're also going to continue to work on synergies in the business. So that's going to get continue to add value to the go-forward valuation. And then as I said earlier on, Bit-isle, the one piece we recognized that it is relatively flat over a period of time, but we recognized that as we continue to synergize the business as Charles alluded to, and drive up the occupancy of their assets, that's going to drive more value into the top-line. So I think the culmination of those three assets, the organic with the two acquisitions and knowing that we are growing faster certainly than we anticipated in 2015 and we think we've got a great growth rate coming into 2016 at this stage of the game at greater than 13% organically, we're optimistic that the numerator will drive a lot of value into the per share calculations. All that to say is, we got to get through 2016. 2016 is no different than 2015 when we convert it to a REIT. 2016, there's a lot of noise in the system, not only with the reconversion and all the other work that we still are doing, but also taking the Telecity asset and moving them into the structure. And so the costs to do that are substantial but the benefit that we will realize from the Telecity acquisition that Steve's talked about. There's revenues, there's cost, there's CapEx, but there's also a much more efficient tax structure that we will operate in under our structure, if you will. And all of that benefit you're really going to feel it more in 2017 than you are in 2016. And so you got to look through 2016 to recognize 2017 I think sets itself up well. The currency issues should be gone. The integration cost will really \u2013 we expect them to have really been dialed down and the operating business should be accelerating as we've alluded to. David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Okay. Thanks, Keith. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. A couple of quick ones, I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the churn expectations. You gave it on a company-wide basis and if there's any regional variation to keep in mind. And then on the interconnects, I just wondered if you could discuss, in a little bit more detail, the growth in interconnect and how much of that is coming from Cloud Exchange versus the conventional cross connect? And then Steve, in response to Jonathan's questions you alluded to the indirect channel and then maybe your or Charles can maybe comment on the portion of new bookings that you had ascribed to are indirect which is a relatively recent initiative of yours? Thanks. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: You want to start with churn, Keith? Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : So why don't I take churn and then I'll past it on to Charles and Steve. I think one thing about churn, let me break down between the organic business or Equinix proper. I would tell you our churn levels are at or near their best in a long, long time. That holds true also for 2016. As I mentioned, churn in Q4 was 2.3%. We telegraphed that it would be slightly higher, it was attributed to a single customer in our UK business that we knew that would be relocating to their own specialty-built data center. That said, as we look forward we see churn to be, again, at one of its lowest levels, I think, we've ever experienced as a company organically. As you then go into the two other assets, the Telecity asset and the Bit-isle asset, Telecity is going to be really no different than what you see at the Equinix level. Where you're going to see slightly increased churn is really in Bit-isle. And a lot of reasons for \u2013 when you look at how Bit-isle did in 2014 relative to 2015 and what we're guiding to 2016, there's a number of factors. Number one, they've got non-recurring activities that will not repeat themselves. They have an operating unit that has \u2013 where they build solar plants, and they've sold off some of those assets. That was sitting in their 2014 results. It's not in 2015. Equally so, they've suffered some substantial churn. They have done exactly what we choose not to do, which is effectively fill up a large portion of their inventory with some large customers. And when those customers run into trouble, as you can appreciate, then there's a fairly meaningful churn event. That's what Bit-isle is suffering through not only in 2015, and that's why their value is so low, but also we're still going to feel some of that in 2016. And so from my perspective, churn will be, I think, at a very strong level looking into 2016. Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. And I'll hit the other parts. I'll put a point on the churn and just say that, again, what we continue to see is just the discipline in the business and this commitment to the right customers, right applications, right assets continues to manifest itself, both in terms of the positive price actions, and correspondingly to the moderated churn levels. So I think it's absolutely a reflection of the strategy working as we would expect. The other two topics were interconnection. I would say that interconnection obviously an incredibly strong quarter with 7,500 cross connection aggregate. We track that at a very detailed level vertical, essentially on the from and to by every vertical. And every sell in that matrix is growing. The fastest growing are the cloud-related, sort of the cloud ecosystem on a percentage basis, but the most \u2013 in absolute terms, the biggest contributor continues to be our mature network ecosystem. And the financial services ecosystem continues to contribute significantly, but on a percentage basis, cloud is over-indexing dramatically like 5X probably its installed base, and that's just a reflection of the early days of that and really starting to sort of take shape and scale as enterprises are adapting Hybrid Cloud. I would also say a part of the driver in the network as on cross connect is these 300 customers that have adapted Performance Hub, many of whom are using that for WAN optimization strategies and therefore are driving significant cross connects to network providers. So that's a snapshot on interconnection. And then lastly on channel, what I would tell you is that we, over the last couple of quarters, have seen a number of our lighthouse marquee deals in the enterprise come through partners. And I think that's a reflection of that many of those customers are finding that they need some combination of the infrastructure value delivered by Platform Equinix but desire a managed service element of that implementation and our partners are doing that very effectively. And so, we won some very big deals as we referenced in the script from true partners with our enterprise lighthouse wins. And we are seeing in terms of allocation of the percentage of bookings coming through indirect, continue to grow steadily and we're really focusing on a set of high impact partners that we think will help us continue to drive that through 2016. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks very much. You've talked a lot about the various regions and you really haven't brought up macro at all. We look at the market performance, we look at the headlines, and it really doesn't seem like \u2013 it's pretty tough out there particularly in some of the international markets. So, are you seeing anything from your customers or are the secular trends still very healthy at this point? And perhaps you could just give us a little bit more color on the sale process. I think you had said mid-year, what gives you confidence that it'll all be wrapped up by then. And are you likely to do one transaction or might this be multiple transactions? Thanks. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: Hey, Simon, this is Steve. I'll start out and then we'll triple team it here. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: In terms of the market's macro trends, I think we all saw IDC or Gartner tell us that the IT spend globally was slowing down at the end of last year. I think this goes back to what Charles said. Because we're so focused on the type of application workload with our client base that is not considered discretionary and it's more mission-critical, even in volatile times, as Keith alluded to, we tend to perform better than the market because we are dealing with revenue, customer-facing, globally deployed type application workloads that are critical to run these businesses. So, because of our discipline and executing in that part of the application workload of our customer base, and that part of the \u2013 that's non-back office, non-server farm type workload, we tend to push right through this. And the demand that we see from our customer base today is high, trying to figure out how to take advantage of the cloud computing model. And so our pipeline, if you were able to see into our pipeline, which you guys can't, you would see very good coverage ratios and you would see the strongest pipeline in the history of the company. So the signals for us across all the regions emanate themselves in our pipeline and emanate themselves in our coverage ratios, and all I can tell you at this point is they are strong as they've ever been. And Charles I don't know what you would add to that. Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. I guess just countering the macro IT spending environment, which is \u2013 I mean that environment is being impacted heavily by public cloud adoption and adoption of hybrid cloud, multi-cloud as the architecture of choice. And so if you really look at the portion that we tend to play in and around, if you look at the growth of AWS, look at Microsoft's Azure revenues and their cloud participation, look at what Oracle is doing in terms of retooling their business into the cloud, those are all significant customers of ours. They're all scaling globally with us. And then we are really leveraging that cloud density with that sort of core group, as well as a very long tail of SaaS to really attract the enterprise customer and seeing some momentum there. And it is an environment. Although there's market volatility and pressure, I think, on CIOs to manage spending and reduce expense, et cetera, they're often coming to us as a way to achieve those means. And whether that's reducing network cost, adopting public cloud at an accelerated rate or implementing hybrid cloud and moving it out of their basement and avoiding spending that capital. Those are all things that they can really use us for. So we feel well-positioned even though there's some choppiness in the overall macro environment. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That makes sense. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : So, concluding your final question, Simon, was really about the timing of the asset divestiture in Europe. Clearly, there's an expectation as we worked alongside the EU regulators and Telecity, that we'd sell the assets over a certain period of time. That timeframe would be in or around the midyear 2016. As Steve alluded to, we're very \u2013 well down the process, if you will, at selling the assets. We have a number of interested buyers. And I think you just have to stay tuned, but we're very active and deep in the process right now and we're confident that we will conclude it before or near midyear. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks. Steve, maybe just a follow-up on the undersea piece, sounds like you guys are pretty excited about it. With respect to the sort of types of traffic and the government regulation, are you guys set up better to address that marketplace based upon the geographic locations of your data centers? And then just secondly, maybe one for Keith, you identified some cost savings that are organic. Just trying to get a sense for a little more detail around where you're finding that. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: Sure. Let me take the first piece, Mike. There are a lot of new projects, mostly driven by the requirements to help support all this global cloud deployment that's going on around the world in the growth of international traffic. So there really hasn't been any new Transatlantic capacity been added in the last probably dozen years until one of the announcements that came late last year or middle of last year, Hibernia Express which went live at Equinix. So there's a lot of focus out there, some private investment, partially funded by some of the big global \u2013 the global cloud providers. It's definitely being driven by cloud. We're involved in many more conversations than we ever have in the future \u2013 or in the past, I should say. And the advancements in technology today is allowing these operators to bypass the traditional shore-based lending facilities and go all the way to terminating at a data center like Equinix. So we're capturing that volume now. And there's been four to five public announcements that we've made of ones that we've participated in. There's been a couple that had connected U.S., Japan, New York, London and so there's a whole bunch growing on now. We're probably involved in a dozen more projects today that are at different stages of assessment, development and construction. So it is very active. It is driven by the cloud and by the bandwidth, amount of traffic around the world, and they can terminate these cables today very easily into data centers. And so we're front and center on this topic. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Steve, how's the contract working. Are you directly dealing with undersea folks or is it the end user customers? Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: I think it's the undersea folks. Isn't it, Charles? Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. Typically, the providers or a consortium of folks that are involved. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: For the consortium, yeah. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : And then as it relates to basically the question of cost savings, I think what's most important to note Mike is, we're going in and cutting costs. What we're doing today is we're operating more efficiently. And it's important to recognize over the last three to four years, we've made heavy investments across a number of different functional groups to scale the organization to be global, and one of the biggest investments we've made has been in our IT systems and platforms and the people that really continue to work very hard to make them run as efficiently as possible and then we build our processes and structures around them. That said, we've made those initial investments. We've been investing in sale and sort of in customer-facing initiatives which, I would argue, is driving a lot of the value that we see today. We're also finding ways to reallocate our costs. And part of our efforts today, not only as it related to 2015, but also as we look to 2016 is how do we run more efficiently and take resources that we're spending money in, run them more efficiently so we can put it back into the business differently. And in fact, there's roughly $24 million of costs that we reallocated in our organization to support our investments in 2016. And so we feel very comfortable about that. But quite frankly, it's a work in progress. We have to continue to lever off our systems, our processes and our people and that's something that you'll see in 2016, but you're also going to see us globalize as we bring in Telecity and we bring in Bit-isle over the next \u2013 through 2017, 2018 and 2019. We'll continue to make these investments that I would argue that can drive more value into the business. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. And our last question is from Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. I guess at the risk of Katrina not letting me back on the call again, I'm going to have three questions, but they're all modeling so hopefully you guys can bang out them pretty quickly. The first one is on Telecity. I was curious what tax rate we should be thinking about for 2016? My understanding is that they're still under the UK tax jurisdiction which is different than how you guys treat your European assets. And when is it that we might actually see Telecity shift from its current tax structure to that of the overall Equinix business? The second one is on 2017. You mentioned that you thought that Telecity will be accretive to 2017 after integration cost. You mentioned integration cost I think in 2017 will be $20 million. Will it be accretive even including those integration cost? And then the third question is on Telecity and your FX hedge. I think you mentioned that you've hedged about 80% of your core business in Europe. Do you plan on hedging any of the Telecity revenues at some point this year and perhaps how much would those be? Thanks. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Great questions, Colby. I think first and foremost as it relates to the tax rate, probably a little bit premature for us to tell you what that's going to be, because part of the reason we're making such a substantial investment in integration cost in 2016 is to change the organizational structure to meet not only our REIT requirements but our commissionary requirements. And so suffice it to say, we feel that overall our global tax rate will continue to be in the 10% to 15% on a cash rate basis. We as a company and certainly our European business pre-organically has a lower tax rate than that of our competitors and so we think we can benefit from that. So, stay tuned on that one. Let us come back but there's a lot of work to deal with there. As it relates to Telecity on the FX side, I think it's important to note we have hedged 85% of the organic business. We have yet to take a position on the Telecity business in Europe, primarily because their functional currency is not U.S. dollar. Our functional currency in Europe is U.S. dollar. And so the hedging strategies we would deploy are going to be different today, at least, for Equinix proper versus the Telecity assets. But suffice it to say, we're going to be looking very closely and trying not to destroy value with currency movement. So again, stay tuned on that one and I'm sure I have numbers. The third one was... Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Just 2017 accretion. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Pardon me. The 2017 \u2013 yeah we \u2013 the combined business including integration is going to be accretive in 2017 relative to I'm not doing these transactions, so we're very \u2013 again we want you to look through 2016 to 2017. With those $20 million of costs, we will be accretive in 2017 on, if you want, a combined basis with their assets. The one thing I certainly want to make \u2013 I'll leave you with is you have to recognize, by the time we start to go through the year and integrate these assets, as Charles alluded to, the assets are going to become fungible. And so whether we sell into a Telecity asset or a Bit-isle asset or an Equinix organic asset and how we move our people around, that's what we said. We've got to look at it holistically in 2017, recognize there're going to be a lot of moving parts, there's going to be synergies, there's going to be integration costs. So holistically, I want you to walk away 2017 is an accretive year for us and we're very excited to work through this year, and over the next 10 months to get to where we need to be. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Katrina Rymill - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. That concludes our Q4 call. Thank you for joining us.

Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: Okay. Thank you, Katrina and good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We had a great start to 2016, delivering both revenue and adjusted EBITDA above the top end of our guidance ranges, as demand for interconnected colocation continues to drive strong performance across all three of our regions. As depicted on slide three, revenues were $844.2 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 16% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $380.7 million for the quarter, up 4% over the prior quarter and up 17% year-over-year on an organic and constant-currency basis. This drove AFFO growth of 35% year-over-year on a normalized and constant-currency basis. For the quarter, we delivered strong gross and net bookings with solid production from both our direct and indirect channels, as we scale our go-to-market efforts. Our key operating metrics demonstrate the strength of our ecosystem-centric business modal, with firm MRR per cabinet, low churn and healthy interconnection growth. Our global platform continues to be a critical source of differentiation, making us the partner-of-choice for customers looking to respond effectively to increasingly distributed infrastructure requirement. Our reach is allowing us to gain market share, while tapping into higher-growth markets, with EMEA and Asia-Pacific now contributing greater than 50% of our revenues and our geographic reach stretching across 21 countries and 40 metros. We are pleased with the Telecity acquisition and are excited to add this great set of quality assets and people to Platform Equinix. With less than 90 days under our belt, we are already seeing healthy momentum in cross-platform bookings and are making rapid progress on integration, despite the significant size and complexity of this transaction. Overall, the Telecity assets delivered solid financial performance, consistent with our guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA, while absorbing efforts related to the deal close and the planned divestitures. We see the anticipated revenue synergies materializing and are tracking well to our expected cost and CapEx synergies, all of which is a great validation of the deal rationale. Bit-isle is also progressing well, tracking above our prior guidance with several strategic wins enabled by these new assets. Our integration efforts are on track and our plans to optimize the business remain ahead of schedule. As we integrate these two acquisitions, we expect to achieve a combined $30 million in annual cost savings, with about 50% of these savings realized before the end of this year and the remainder in 2017. With Telecity and Bit-isle we now serve over 8,000 customers and are proud that over 150 of the Fortune 500 are Equinix customers. We have increased our already market-leading network density from 1,100 networks to over 1,400 networks and have added a number of critical new cloud nodes to Platform Equinix. We are extending our value proposition as the home of the interconnected cloud with industry-leading providers such as AWS, Microsoft and Google contributing directly to the increase in our enterprise business by enabling enterprise CIOs to quickly and cost effectively implement multi-cloud architectures. Our cloud and enterprise verticals, which represent 28% and 13% of our revenues respectively, remain our fastest-growing market segments and contributed the highest number of new customer additions for the sixth quarter in a row. Interconnection revenue grew a healthy 19% year-over-year on an organic and constant-currency basis. With over 176,000 cross connects and significant growth on our Internet and our Cloud Exchange, Equinix is benefiting from strong secular trends that are driving businesses to become increasingly interconnected. We run the largest Internet Exchange globally with 5.5 terabits of peak traffic growing 30% year-over-year, as networks and cloud providers continue to upgrade their capacity. Given our high utilization rate of 80% and strong returns on development capital, we continue to expand in core markets, heavily weighted towards existing campuses and Tier 1 market \u2013 metros, which exhibit strong pipelines and attractive supply-demand profiles. We now have 16 announced expansion projects underway. In this quarter, we are moving forward with additional expansions in Silicon Valley, New York and Hong Kong, totaling over $200 million of CapEx. In Silicon Valley, demand remains robust and we are building SV10, a new IBX located directly adjacent to our Great Oaks campus, home to a rich ecosystem of network and cloud hubs and the second largest piering market in the U.S. after our Ashburn campus in Northern Virginia. Notably, for SV10 we purchased the 11 acres of land for this project, expanding our asset ownership in this important market. In New York, we are proceeding with the second phase of New York 5, the flagship asset on our Secaucus campus, which is comprised of four adjacent data centers with over 10,000 cabinets and is a key growth engine for our Americas business. New York 5 saw strong pull-through post the deployment of the Bass (7:25) trading engine and is also seeing solid demand from the broader financial services community as they embrace hybrid cloud. Our first phase of New York 5 project is already 85% full, with strong pricing. Our capital investments continue to deliver very healthy growth, as well as strong returns across our new expansion and stabilized IBXs, as shown on slide four. The operating performance of our 70 stabilized global IBXs delivered steady revenue growth of 7%, an increase over the prior quarter, while generating a 31% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested, reflecting the tremendous economic value of these stabilized campuses. Stabilized assets include projects that have been open for more than one year with all phases built out. As we shift to 2016, a net three IBXs were added to this category and utilization of these assets remains a healthy 86%. Let me now cover quarterly highlights from our industry verticals, and I'll with the networks. This vertical experienced strong bookings driven by multi-side expansions with Tier 1 service providers and new wins with Tier 2 providers and cable operators, who are shifting their portfolios to address demand for IP and digital services. We are seeing a resurgence of subsea cable projects to support global cloud deployments and growth of international data traffic, which are creating new opportunities for Equinix. There are more than 50 global submarine cable projects under consideration over the coming two years, which places Equinix in a great position to win a portion of this next generation of submarine cable investment. In the content and digital media vertical, performance was driven by expansions from both traditional lighthouse content providers and our Ad-IX ecosystem. Advertisers continue to optimize user experience, while architecting for increasing traffic volumes, driven by the explosive growth of mobile advertising. Customer wins included ContentBridge, a supply-chain management digital rights service provider and Grapeshot, an innovative provider of analytics in keyword targeting. The financial services vertical experienced the second highest bookings of all time with strength across insurance, electronic payments, trading and retail banking. We also saw sharp growth in Performance Hub deployments as financial services enterprise continued to re-architect their IT. Customer wins included Dutch bank, ABN AMRO, a three region expansion by Thompson Reuters for electronic trading and EP2, an Australian provider of digital payment solutions leveraging the Equinix Cloud Exchange. The cloud and IT services vertical experienced strong bookings across all regions this quarter, including strategic wins with leading software-as-a-service providers, furthering our cloud density objectives. Cloud services adoption continues with over 370 enterprises, clouds, IT service providers and networks interconnecting on Cloud Exchange in addition to the healthy growth and direct connect activity to cloud providers. Customer wins included Pure Storage, a cloud scale data platform providing hybrid cloud data management for Microsoft Azure and BlueJeans an enterprise video cloud provider enabling direct access via Cloud Exchange. And finally turning to the enterprise, this vertical delivered strong bookings driven by manufacturing, travel and government wins, as enterprises leverage our global platform, both directly and through our growing base of Equinix partners to re-architect their infrastructure. Over 370 customers have deployed our Performance Hub solution, which helps enterprises optimize their network architectures, access the cloud and drive application performance. Customer wins included Nucor, a Fortune 200 steel manufacturer leveraging Equinix to solve for hybrid cloud connectivity and Avant Homes, a residential and commercial property development firm. We are growing our enterprise customer base at an accelerated pace as CIOs adopt an interconnected oriented architecture, as shown on slide five. IOA is a blueprint to help CIOs re-architect their IT delivery to better interconnect people, locations, clouds and data. Leveraging our global data center footprint and multi-cloud interconnection capabilities, interconnection-oriented architectures represent a fundamental shift away from centralized, legacy enterprise IT models to distributed and dynamic models. Direct interconnectivity enables enterprises to react in real time, adapt quickly to change and leverage digital ecosystems to create new value and growth. Enterprises are increasingly looking to Equinix as they embark on this journey moving away from in-house data centers in order to leverage multi-cloud architectures, placed closer to users and their customers. We believe this trend will continue to significantly increase our opportunities within this market segment. So let me stop there and turn it over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Great, thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone. So our first quarter represents a great start to 2016. We continued to deliver top-line growth, expand margins and drive sales across our expanded platform. We had strong bookings in each of our regions including solid cross-region execution. This quarter we were able to benefit from record three region deployments across all of our segments, as customers leverage our geographic reach. Including recent acquisitions, greater than 53% of our revenues come from customers deployed globally across all three regions and over 81% of customers deployed across multiple metros. Our interconnection additions remain very positive, adding another 5,600 net cross connects and almost 180 exchange ports in the quarter. This is the seventh quarter in a row where we've added greater than 5,000 cross connects in a quarter. Interconnection revenues represent 16% of our global recurring revenues. Moving to acquisitions, we've seen early momentum from both the Telecity and Bit-isle businesses, delivering against our guidance expectations, while progressing well towards our expected synergy targets. The integration efforts are well underway. We've selected the senior leadership team for the EMEA business and we're in the advanced stages of aligning our sales and delivery teams. Cross selling across the combined platform is taking root and after we divest of the eight assets held-for-sale, we believe that we'll be able to accelerate our sales efforts as customers decide the optimum location to deploy their infrastructure. In addition we've reduced our expected 2016 integration spend to $55 million. These costs will support our significant systems work and places severance and retention costs, and the substantial organizational restructuring costs related to our REIT and other tax initiatives. As it relates to the eight assets held-for-sale, we remain on track to divest these assets by mid-2016. Now, as it relates to our full-year guidance, the weaning U.S. dollar has provided us significant FX tailwinds and this uptick along with better-than-expected operating performance in the first quarter allows us to increase our revenue guidance with flow-through benefits to both EBITDA and AFFO. Our updated annual revenue guidance continues to include flat, non-recurring revenues compared to the prior year, as well as refining our annual view related to the Telecity business, as we continue to work through the divestiture process and complete our integration efforts and have further visibility into their data. So turning to the first quarter, as depicted on slide six, global Q1 revenues were $844.2 million, up 3% over the prior quarter and 16% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis, our 53rd straight quarter of top-line growth. Our as-reported revenues include $119 million from acquisitions, consistent with our expectations. Q1 revenues net of our FX hedges include a $3.3 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter, and a $1.4 million positive currency benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates, due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. For Europe, we've hedged approximately 80% of our Equinix organic business. Global adjusted EBITDA was $380.7 million, up 4% over the prior quarter and 17% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis, above prior guidance due to revenue flow-through, lower SG&A and innovation costs. Our as-reported EBITDA includes $52 million of contribution from our acquisitions, as well as $13 million in integration costs. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 45.1% or 46.9% on an organic and constant-currency basis. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of FX hedges, reflects a negative $3.8 million currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter, and a $1.3 million negative impact when compared to our FX guidance rates. Global AFFO was $210 million, including $64 million loss related to the Telecity hedge. Excluding the Telecity foreign currency loss and integration cost, AFFO on a normalized basis and constant currency increased 20% over the prior quarter to $287 million, tracking above the top end of our guidance range, largely due business performance and lower-than-expected taxes and interest expense. As we continue to focus on value creation per share, upon the maturity of the remaining portion of our convertible our June 16 convertible debt instrument, we have elected to receive the proceeds from the related cap call in the form of shares, thereby reducing the net dilution from this debt instrument by approximately 400,000 shares. Moving to churn, global MRR churn for Q1 was 2.2% or 2.1% on an organic basis, consistent with our prior guidance. We continue to expect our quarterly MRR churn rate to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% quarterly. And one final note before I discuss the regional performance. Our non-financial metric sheet and supplemental, including our segment IBX reporting, will not include the acquisitions until early next year, as we work to integrate their unit metrics and results into our financial systems. And now I'd like to provide a few highlights on the regions whose full results recovered on slide seven through nine. Our global platform continues to expand with EMEA and Asia-Pacific growing organic and constant-currency growth over the same quarter last year of 17% and 25% respectively, while the Americas region produced steady growth of 13%. We added over 1,500 cabinets down from the prior quarter due to timing of installs and churn, and we expect a more normalized net cabinets billing increase next quarter. MRR per cabinet was firm at 1,970, up $11 on a constant-currency basis. The Americas region had another strong quarter delivering solid bookings from the network and financial verticals, and increasing yield per cabinet and the second best interconnection quarter of all time. EMEA delivered a solid quarter of bookings, with particular strength in the Dutch and German markets, while absorbing higher churn in the UK at the end of last quarter. Asia-Pacific continued its steady growth with Tokyo and Hong Kong as the fastest-growing markets driven by cloud and content verticals. Interconnection revenues continued to outpace overall growth of the business with the Americas, APAC and EMEA interconnection revenues now at 23%, 13% and 8% respectively of recurring revenues. EMEA's interconnection revenues declined as a percent of the region's recurring revenue, as the region absorbed the Telecity results. It is our intention to increase interconnection revenues as a percent of this region's recurring revenues over the medium and longer term. And now looking to balance sheet, please refer to slide 10. Unrestricted cash and investments decreased this quarter to $650 million, largely due to the closing of the Telecity acquisition on January 15. Our net debt leverage ratio stepped up to 4.3 times our Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA, although we expect to return to our range of 3 times to 4 times adjusted EBITDA over the next 12 months to 18 months. Now switching to AFFO and dividends on slide 11; for 2016, we're raising our as-reported AFFO to be greater than $1.015 billion a 22% year-over-year increase. On a normalized basis, AFFO would be greater than $1.134 billion or a 28% constant-currency increase over prior year. Adjusting for the $6 million of interest earned on the convertible debt through the first half of the year, our fully diluted AFFO per share would be $16.13 using a weighted average 70.7 million shares outstanding as presented on page 34 of the earnings deck. Also today, we announced our Q2 dividend of $1.75 a share, consistent with our Q1 quarterly dividend. Our AFFO payout ratio is now expected to be approximately 49% for 2016. Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to slide 12. For the quarter, CapEx was $198 million, including recurring CapEx of $32 million, below our guidance due to timing of cash payments to our contractors. With respect to our new builds, during the quarter we opened Tokyo 5 IBX our 10th IBX in the Tokyo metro taking into consideration Bit-isle's five assets in Tokyo. Tokyo 5 is located near the financial district approximate to our existing network-dense Tokyo 3 IBX. We've tethered these two assets together thereby allowing our Tokyo 5 customers to access the rich set of networks in Tokyo 3. And given our current high utilization rate of 80%, the strong development returns, we continue to invest across many key markets with new IBX builds scheduled to open in the next year, including Amsterdam, S\u00e3o Paulo, Silicon Valley and Sydney, in addition to the expansion phases in Ashburn, Atlanta, Dublin, Frankfurt, Hong Kong and Warsaw. Also we will continue to purchase and develop land including our recently-purchased Silicon Valley land parcels. Over time we expect revenues from our own sites to increase. Owned properties generate 38% of the organic recurring revenues or 34% of our revenues on a combined basis, as the acquisitions have a higher percent of leased sites. Including acquisitions, over 85% of our recurring revenue is generated by either owned properties or properties where our lease expiration extends to 2029 or beyond. And finally, we'll provide you a number of slides that bridge our 2016 guidance from the normalized 2015 performance, including slides for revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Please refer to these slides on slides 13 through 16. I'll turn the call back to Steve. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: Okay. Thanks, Keith. And finally on slide 17, which summarizes our Q2 and our full-year 2016 guidance, which includes our FX impacts, let me now cover our updated 2016 outlook. For the full year of 2016, we are raising our revenue guidance to be greater than $3.595 billion, 32% growth on an as-reported basis on organic and constant-currency growth rate of greater than 13.4% compared to the prior year. This $45 million revenue increase includes a $42 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to the prior guidance rates, and a $3 million increase due to stronger Q1 operating performance. For 2016, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to be greater than $1.65 billion, a 30% increase on an as-reported basis or a greater than 16% year-over-year growth rate on an organic and constant-currency basis. This $30 million adjusted EBITDA increase includes an $18 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to the prior guidance rates, a $9 million increase due to Q1 operating performance, and $3 million in lower-than-expected integration costs. And the growth of our business is driving increased adjusted funds from operations and ultimately cash flow and dividends. We are raising AFFO to be greater than $1.134 billion normalized for the Telecity transaction-related FX loss and integration costs, a 28% constant-currency growth compared to the prior year. This $56 million AFFO increase includes a $14 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to the prior guidance rates, a $29 million reduction in interest and tax costs and better-than-expected operating performance and lower integration costs. And finally, we expect 2016 capital expenditures to continue to range between $900 million and $1 billion for the year. So in closing, Platform Equinix is the critical intersection point between clouds, networks and the enterprise and this opportunity is translating into solid revenue growth, firm yield and healthy returns on our stabilized and expansion IBXs. Our platform continues to scale organically and we are progressing well with our strategic acquisitions, positioning us to extend our market leadership, enhance our cloud and network density, and grow our customer ecosystems. So let me stop here and we'll open it up to questions. Over to you Kerry. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. Our first question is from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore. Your line is now open. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : Great, thanks for taking the questions. So, Steve, I'd love to hear a little bit more about the cloud-driven enterprise demand. I know that you guys gave some good examples during the prepared remarks and you've talked about it in the past, but I'd be interested in hearing about whether you're seeing things different globally? What's going on in the U.S., what's happening in Europe, in the Asia-Pac region? Is everybody sort of heading down the same path at a different time or there are different sort of adoption cycles? Thanks. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: Let me start and then the rest of the team can chime in here. So I'm assuming Jonathan you're referring to the cloud demand from enterprises to access the public, private cloud providers? Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : Absolutely. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: And so, I would characterize it this way, so we have worked very hard as you know, and the people on this phone know, to populate our facilities around the world with access points, network nodes, cash nodes whatever you want to call them to make it very easy for enterprises of all shapes and sizes to find these cloud providers and buy those services as a service. And so that is happening as the thesis has \u2013 continues to prove itself and as the numbers continue to show you enterprises is growing at the highest rate. Now, the marketing teams and sales teams around the world are pursuing different industry verticals in different countries, so we are building use cases and success stories across multiple industry verticals. There's probably a dozen where we have different use cases being built and they vary by region and by country. The demand is pretty standard around the world. It probably parallels the growth rates that we see, we're growing the fastest in Asia, followed by Europe, followed by the Americas. So I would say enterprise \u2013 particularly global enterprises are demanding footprint across all the big markets across all three regions. So, it's pretty steady demand, pretty steady demand and it's underpinning most of our new logo accumulation. Charles, would you add anything? Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Not a lot. The one addition I might make is just again recognizing that 51% of our revenue is from customers who are deployed with us across all three regions. So I think that I would say solid demand across all three regions and because so many of our customers are global in nature and actually deploying architecture and infrastructure across all three regions, I think that mutes any \u2013 to some degrees mutes any variations, but there are some variations country-to-country in terms of cloud adoption. I would say that, for example, Australia tends to be an outlier on the high side of being receptive to cloud and hybrid cloud as an architecture-of-choice, but we're seeing good solid demand across all three regions. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: The only thing I think I'd add Jonathan to that is, if you look at the CapEx that we're moving around the world, it's as we noted in our comments today, it's across the big market. So the demand is still very, very high in London, Amsterdam, D.C., New York, Silicon Valley these big Tier 1 markets, and so that's where a lot of the enterprise demand is also coming in again where the majority of the cloud access points are. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : Great. And I guess as a follow-up, you talked about the three regions and in your prepared remarks, Steve, you gave us a lot of bookings color by industry vertical, historically you've given us that by region. Is it possible to sort of give us that color on a regional basis? Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: Sure. Let me \u2013 we cut it many ways Jonathan, but I'll give you just the Q1 bookings by vertical to start in the quarter on a worldwide basis, roughly 25% of the bookings came in the cloud and IT services vertical this quarter, followed by around 21% came from the networks, around 20% came from the financial services, and then about 17% for both enterprise and content and digital media. That's how the bookings. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : I think he's looking for region. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: So by vertical, yeah, and then on a regional perspective, let's see, do I have that? I think we might have to get that for you, Jonathan. I'm not sure I have that broken out. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : What I would say, though, is it's solid across all three regions. We didn't have a \u2013 this was actually pretty, one of those quarters where pretty uniform performance, solid generally across the regions, so I don't think we're seeing any \u2013 a substantial, disparate performance levels across the regions. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: Keith's given you pretty good color on the key verticals by region in his prepared remarks, where the majority of the bookings came from. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is now open. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. I was wondering if we could touch base a little bit more on sort of the enterprise demand. What we've seen from our end is that a number of these CIO surveys have obviously cited the cloud as a key area of investment, but also we've seen sort of a tempering expectation for investment dollars out of the enterprise. It sounds like you guys are not seeing any sort of tempered spending when it comes to the trajectory of the enterprise based on the plans that you've seen out of those folks and I just wanted to clarify that. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: Yeah, Amir, we're \u2013 we obviously read the same reports and triangulate all that industry data with actual data inside of our bookings. And let me give you a couple of data points just from our perspective. So, yes, we do see some depressed IT spending trends and we've read the same reports that you're referring to, but the cloud spending continues to fuel the data center requirements, which is what we're benefiting from and the robust leasing activity that we're seeing is really driven by the cloud, which is attracting the enterprises that are \u2013 almost all enterprises we talk to today are moving some portion of their applications workload to get access to the hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, et cetera. And so I think most of the industry analysts data points suggested high teens today is enterprises that are taking advantage of cloud offerings and that will move over the coming four years to 50%, 60% of the workloads. Certainly in the conversations that we're having that's a very common conversation. I would tell you that we hear security requirements, we hear cloud requirements, we hear big data requirements and we are hearing the early signs of IOT plans with enterprises trying to figure out how to instrument, monitor and measure all this data that they are creating to try to monetize it. So, there is certainly plenty of trends from the enterprises across these big segments that we're all reading about in these reports. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, and I guess I'd just offer and add that, what we're seeing is that hybrid cloud adoption is accelerating and in fact I think we look at interconnection-oriented architectures as essentially a mechanism by which these enterprise CIOs are allowing them to do more with less, and that's a key priority for them. And if you look at adoption rates, IDC says that 65% of enterprises are going to be committed to hybrid multi-cloud by the end of this year, and so we're seeing a very rapid clip of adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud and a real resonance to the interconnection-oriented architecture, and while they may be \u2013 their overall spend levels may be reducing because they're not spending as much on traditional IT spend categories, I think that the hybrid cloud enablement in that area is actually increasing in total spend at least from what we're seeing with the enterprise customers that we're serving. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's very helpful and then I was wondering if we could touch more on the global footprint. I mean clearly you folks have a lot of customers that are using \u2013 that are working with you on multiple geographies. As you've continued to expand that footprint and as you are starting to see enterprises sort of accelerating the adoption of the cloud, do you feel like you're in a position to get more of that share in that transition as the global footprint is built out? Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Short answer is yes. I think most of the customers that we serve have, particularly as they deliver cloud services, even if they're delivering revenue-generating cloud services or they're delivering cloud services that are intended to deliver certain applications to their employee base or whatever, they're doing so on a global basis increasingly. And as they do that they're looking for an infrastructure partner that can get them to where they need to be and get private, secure, high-performance interconnection to the public cloud services that they're looking for across all three regions. And so, Equinix is really a very positive choice for that, so we're seeing a lot of adoption across the geographies. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: And probably another data point, excuse me Keith, (35:37) but another data point here to supplement Charles' point, our cross-border bookings continue to increase quarter-on-quarter. So that's a signal that we see big demand from customers on \u2013 like a single supplier to deal with across multiple regions. So once you see cross-border bookings growing, that's a really good indicator that the demand is global and they like dealing with a single set of orders, quoting, pricing, billing and that's the advantage we have. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : And let me just conclude it, Amir, with the fact that one of the comments is the opportunity set that we see in front of us, there's a direct correlation to the amount of CapEx that we're putting forth into the market and as yourself and the other listeners on the call today know, we've committed to still spend somewhere between $900 million and $1 billion and that capital is being deployed somewhat consistent with the revenue stream, but roughly 40% of it will go to EMEA, almost 40% will go to the Americas, and around 20% will go to APAC. It's not a perfect alignment with \u2013 based on the revenue streams, but it tells you that we are spending quite nicely across all three regions to represent what we think is going to be the underlying demand for these assets. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: Yeah and one of the big reasons APAC under indexes there, Keith, is because of the capacity we got with the Bit-isle transaction. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Correct. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much for the incremental color. Operator : Thank you. Out next question is from Michael Rollins of Citibank. Your line is now open. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, thanks for taking the questions. First question is on the non-recurring. Can you talk about the outperformance in the non-recurring line, maybe some of the business drivers behind that, and how that is affecting your outlook for revenue for the rest of the year? And the second question is, if you look at your global utilization levels, they're running a little bit elevated relative to the longer historical period. So what does that mean in terms of the availability of growth to the business over the next few quarters? What does that mean for future capital? Should we expect capital to accelerate to give you more capacity, which will naturally push that utilization down or are you maturing as a business and you're just going to run at higher utilization levels than some of your history? Thanks. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Let me start and then I know Charles and Steve will jump in here. First as it relates to non-recurring, we did see a little bit of an uptick this quarter. One of the things that we started the year with, Mike, as you know is we took a very strong view because of the amount of non-recurring business we did in fiscal year 2015 and the number of meaningful deployments we did across our platform, we made a conscious decision because they do come in ebbs and flows to hold that flat for fiscal-year 2016. Now you saw a little bit of a step up in the Q1 results, that's just a reflection of the lumpiness, if you will, of the non-recurring activity. As I then sort of \u2013 take you then to Q2, we are assuming that the non-recurring activity will go down quarter-over-quarter, partly because of what we see in our pipeline, and partly it's what's \u2013 not what's just in the pipeline, what's in our backlog. So we expect that we'll reduce our non-recurring revenues by roughly $5.5 million next quarter or roughly 60 basis points of growth. So that gives you a sense that again, we still look to do a lot of it, again I hold at the same level as 2015 but we'll see it move around quarter-over-quarter. As it relates to utilization levels, yes, no surprise we are running at higher levels. We've had a tremendous amount of success over a number of quarters and when you see that success and also the incremental cabinets billing, that's a clear indication that we're filling up our assets and it suggests that we're going to have to continue to put capital to work. There are certainly some markets that are more constrained than others. Charles was great in alluding to the Tokyo market, whereby through the acquisition of Bit-isle we got a very large asset, which will allow us to delay any meaningful future spend in Japan for some time period. Yes, there are other markets where we talked about on the last earnings call where we're now going to do what we call first phase builds, which come with a much larger capital deployment in that initial phase. Silicon Valley is a perfect example, the one that Steve alluded to and there is S\u00e3o Paulo, as well and Sydney 4 and the like. So we are continuing to make sure we manage ourselves. I want to leave you with a couple of thoughts on how we manage our CapEx. We go through a very detailed exercise. We're looking five years out. We're looking across markets and IBXs to make sure we understand what our fill rates are, what is the empirical data telling us and what does that imply against our future expectations, understanding what competitive landscapes like in each of those markets or specific to that IBX. And so when we do that, we look out five years, we have a pretty good view on what we think we could spend. So then in conclusion to go back \u2013 to address your final question, we're very much aware of what our capital spend is. As you know that can ebb and flow based on our performance, knowing that your lead times are going to be anywhere from 9 months to 18 months depending on whether it's an incremental phase or a new build, that's going to dictate what the capital dollars are, but there is an expectation that we will continue to spend at these levels for a period of time given the demand that we see in the marketplace. I will say one last thing, which I think is important, one of the things that we want to do is continue to see our utilization go up, but we recognize that you are at a point where you don't want to constrain the business. There are certainly some markets where we feel a little bit more constrained today than we otherwise like to feel. And so we need to put the capital to work in those markets. Silicon Valley comes to mind again as a critical market where we're very eager to get up that \u2013 to put up that Silicon Valley 10 asset, because left unchecked, it will put a constraint on our ability to grow, but we feel we're in a great position to deliver the inventory on a fairly (42:10) just-in-time basis. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: Yeah, two more minor adds; actually one pivots off that last point. One is your question, Mike, around growth and what the utilization implies. If you look at our stabilized assets chart, it delivers 7% I think was what this quarter was and what you'll see there is actually we've seen that \u2013 we see that bounce around a little bit this pretty good quarter and on a constant-currency basis have seen even better quarters. And so, you see that the stabilized assets still have meaningful growth potential in them even at quite high utilization rates. And then the second point I'd make is that we are making a very purposeful push to phase our capital as best as possible, and so we're trying to be as innovative as possible in phasing our capital and that is going to have a natural tendency to sort of pressure utilization up a bit, which is a good thing as long as we still have the flexibility to respond and not go dark in the market. And so that's the balance we're striking. And I do think kudos to our engineering and construction teams for really phasing our capital in ways that are allowing us to still be responsive with higher levels of utilization. Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Mike, I think the thing I'd add. If you look at slide 23 in the presentation today on our announced expansions, just to pick out a handful here between what we're doing in London next phase, Amsterdam next phase, D.C. next phase, New York next phase, Silicon Valley next phase, you're a little over $300 million of CapEx that's going into some pretty significant markets to Keith's point. That's going to be done just in time and provide available capacity for the growth rates that you see us delivering here. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is now open. David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Two if I could. Just first, maybe, Steve, on the Telecity acquisition, could you kind of give us a status update on where we are both in kind of the revenue integration opportunity and the cost integration opportunity. And how you feel that is if at all baked into the rest of the year outlook? And then second, I guess, I don't know who this will for. If Charles is online maybe for you, but if there is one kind of fear that people may have it's that, as the public cloud gets more reliable, more secure that it has the potential to accommodate a growing share of all the outsourced applications that are existing and that slowly the public private, hybrid cloud becomes little less private and a little bit more public and it creates a cannibalization risk. Could you kind of talk about how you view that issue and if there is any evidence that it's happening in any way inside the Equinix facilities today? Thanks. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: Yeah, those are two great questions. Thanks, David. Let me start in the public cloud question and then Charles can jump in here on that and maybe give you an update on Telecity. Very good question. I know, the big concern would be is everything going to move to public and is there going to be a need for the type of stuff that hosting and managed services and colo providers are providing? The world that we see unfolding and certainly all the industry analysts and all the customers we talk to certainly support the thesis that the hybrid cloud customers needing access to public Internet capability, which has always been there to Equinix for years and years and years, is not going to go away. We have been working very hard the last four or five years working with all the cloud providers to provide this private connectivity to give the combination of the two, which in our language gives you the hybrid capability to be able to move your traffic around the world is continuing to build and unfold and most of the documentation writings today suggest that public cloud is going to continue to grow from high teens to, like I said earlier, 40%,50% 60% of workload's going to the public cloud and the thing that I think people get confused about, even the big public cloud providers who build their big data centers and build their back office facilities all over the world, still require the Equinixes of the world and the other data center providers of the world for the distributed part of their network because they are not terribly interested in putting capital in 40 different markets and 20 different countries and so they're going to take advantage of the capacity that's out there with the Equinixes of the world to build the hub and spoke, if you will, or build the centralized and decentralized network to run these cloud offerings and because users are all over the world, customers are all over the world, latency is a big factor and that's why you see the continued rollout of public private connectivity and capability. I don't know what you'd add to that Charles Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : The only little incremental color on that I would say is that, I absolutely think that we're seeing and, I think, the results of the strong players in the cloud market both on the sort of ISI as well as SaaS are clearly demonstrating they're going to continue to add capability and functionality that is going to allow them to attract a significant portion of workloads out of the traditional IT sort of consumption model into the cloud model. So, we absolutely see that, we embrace it, and in fact our platform is really facilitating it. And so, I think if I were a commodity provider of colocation, we'd be very worried about that substitution. But that's not really the business we're in. We're in the business of enabling that hybrid cloud connectivity, one, via the CSPs and so the supply side of the cloud ecosystem is very relevant for us. And in fact, our top six customers are all delivering cloud services, using Platform Equinix as some portion of their architecture to do so. And so, it's a big opportunity for us. And then we see a big basket, a very big basket of enterprise workloads that we believe will sort of reside into private infrastructure side of things and really be implemented in this sort of hybrid cloud, multi-cloud setup. And so, for us we think it's a very much a net positive, but I do believe that this trend you're talking about for cloud service provider is becoming increasingly capable is real and will affect I think the broader data center market. And then, let me circle back to Telecity now, and I'll give you sort of a quick update and anybody can add color as they wish. We're less than 90 days into the post combination world, and I'd tell you, as a headline we remain very optimistic and thoroughly convinced to the rationale for that transaction. Deal really cements our leadership in EMEA, 34 new locations and seven new metros, six new countries, material improvement in our network density, which was already marketing leading in EMEA and we add a number of really critical cloud nodes to our platform, of note would be the new Telecity locations in Dublin, which are a great addition for us and is seeing significant demand. And overall, we're really delighted with the quality assets and people that we've added to the team. As we said in our prepared remarks, a lot of progress on the integration. We've announced the senior leadership team well advanced in aligning and cross-training the sales and delivery teams, well advanced in our rebranding plan, taken all the steps we needed to be fully REIT compliant, and as I said, we are already seeing cross platform opportunities both in the form of Telecity customers with an interest in Equinix facilities, a bit more so right now of our Equinix customers really seeing opportunities to purchase capacity in the Telecity sites. And I think we are seeing more in that direction only because we have a larger force selling that on the Equinix side and we're working through the sort of natural distractions of a team going through an integration on the Telecity side. So, but we feel good about the synergies. We actually think we're going to exceed the synergy estimates that we had previously provided. All that's baked into the guidance you see here today. And again, we do think there is over time meaningful revenue synergies as well as the cost synergies, which I said, I think we'll exceed and the CapEx synergies that are allowing us to defer some investment in EMEA. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: The only thing I'd probably add, Charles, is the divestiture process, David, is we are running and have been running a very robust process. It's proceeding as we expected. There have been very high levels of interest throughout the entire process and we still are on target to complete the transaction by mid-year. David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Perfect. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan Chase. Your line is now open. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, following up there. You had mentioned earlier some higher churn in the UK, is that part of what you just mentioned. And then second, it seems like Bit-isle is tracking to the high end, what's happening there? Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: So let me take that, as it relates to the churn that we experienced in Q4, that was what we had telegraphed in the marketplace. If you look at the organic churn in Q1, we're roughly 2.1%, consistent with where we think there's a natural churn level in and around that level in the organic business. Where you're seeing slightly increased churn is attributed to the Bit-isle business. What we talked about on the last earnings call was effectively Bit-isle, part of the reason that we felt comfortable holding the revenues flat relative to \u2013 for 2016 over 2015 was the fact that we did have this increased level of churn. Now having said all of that, coming out of our prior guidance, the Bit-isle team did a little bit better than we originally anticipated. It's more so in their other services and less in their colocation business, so suffice it to say between what they're doing in the colocation business and what they're performing in the managed services business, there is a direct correlation between what they do in managed services and the pull through to colo. So, we're very excited about their performance to-date and we continue to focus on very much optimizing that acquisition and I think over the next few quarters, will be much more discuss as it relates to Bit-isle asset. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Very diplomatic. If I can follow up, there was some slowing in EMEA cross connect growth this quarter, is that seasonality or what should we be thinking about there? Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: The primary reason for the slowing of \u2013 if you're dealing with on a holistic basis, the primary reason really is more to do with the fact that we have taken the Telecity business and we've merged it into the organic Equinix business, and as a result, their ability while they are generating, if you will, spilling out the interconnection relative to what we are getting, it diluted the overall performance. So, it's not to suggest that it's slowing down, we think of this as a great opportunity, but the way Telecity sort of prosecuted that opportunity was it was more embedded in colocation. We're going to over time as I talked about, like breaking out their unit metrics and doing the inventories of all of their cabinets and cross connects and the like, and getting their financials more aligned with Equinix, we'll be in a much better spot in the coming quarters to give you much more clarity on that. It's a little early. As Charles alluded to, we're just 90 days into it. As many of you know, under the UK takeover code, we really couldn't touch the results until after January 15, and with an acquisition of that magnitude and knowing what we had to accomplish, we still have work to do and so we're eager to get into it, dissect it more, which will allow us to give you more visibility in the coming quarters. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. So on Telecity, I wonder if you could provide a little bit more color on driving \u2013 interconnection Europe's in EMEA more generally and maybe Telecity specifically, any adjustments that you sort of need to make to the products, investments you are going to be making to the platform on a broader basis? And then I wondered about the cost synergies. I think you talked about $30 million across both Bit-isle and Telecity. And what's the rough breakdown of that by region? Is it operating costs, energy costs, what is sort of the composition of that? Thanks. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: Let me start with the sort of a few things on the alignment of the product portfolios, et cetera, and then I'll let probably Keith tackle the synergies, any commentary on that. But we are in the process of aligning the product portfolios. Generally, I would say that the company's had a fairly consistent strategy in the marketplace, so probably not a dramatic set of changes in the product portfolio is there, but we are in a process of taking those and aligning the product portfolios. I will say that, as Keith commented on we have \u2013 interconnection is a very central part of how we go to market and how we position with customers. And so it's really \u2013 it's critical that we \u2013 we have a great track record of getting the value, delivering great value to our customers through cross connects and through interconnection. And we also have a great track record of making sure that we get value back in the form of how that's priced. And so needless to say, we'll maintain that strategy and we'll implement it within the Telecity environment as over time because I think our customers are really getting superior value from that. So \u2013 but we're in the process of figuring out what that implies in terms of aligning the product portfolios. We're well advanced in that effort and I think we'll start to see the results of that over the coming quarters. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : And so, Jon, as it relates to basically the synergy costs or benefits, clearly I think it's important to recognize the two acquisitions, we're looking at them quite differently. As it relates to Telecity, Charles alluded to a number of the points. We're certainly going to look to what are the opportunities on the top line on driving incremental revenue that's attached to alignment of our product portfolio and the like. And we're very confident, albeit we've said there is only modest revenue attachment to that this year, but we're very confident that that will continue to be something that will drive value going forward. As it relates to the cost side which \u2013 that's the $30 million we referred to, we talked about $15 million this year, $15 million in 2017. Again, we're optimistic that we're not only going to be able to get that number, but we'll get beyond that number. Again, I'm reticent to give you the exact numbers just yet because given the lack of visibility that we had into the numbers prior to January 2015, we're still doing a lot of work as we said to align the sales and delivery organizations as well as all of the back office. But again, I want you to walk away being confident that we see some incremental benefit. As it relates to the below-the-line activity more specifically around taxes, again, we think of our tax structure as a competitive advantage and no surprise to you as we then deploy that structure across our portfolio that will generate benefits to our shareholders and so we're excited about that as well. Now, the other thing I would say is, recognizing that Telecity, we're in the business of investing in this business and so what we want to make sure is that we continue to invest alongside it. So we're managing the synergies with continuing to drive value into the assets and expand that portfolio consistent with what Equinix's expectations would be. As it relates to Bit-isle, that one, there is less synergies perhaps, but overall a greater opportunity to fill up their \u2013 sorry, less cost synergies, pardon me, but a greater opportunity to enjoy revenue synergies because of the underutilization of their assets and that's where we're really excited about the opportunity coupled with some other ways that we think we can optimize the overall business. Again, we want to be a little bit reserved in our comments right now as we continue to think about our strategy, but overall in the next few quarters you will hear us talk more firmly about what's happening in the Bit-isle integration. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : If I could follow up briefly on the Telecity side, how are you managing the risk of customer confusion or potential disruption as you go through that process given that these are live environments and companies are being ring-fenced off depending on which part of the combined footprint they're in. Any color there as to how customer expectations are being set? Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, I mean I guess I would say it's not \u2013 this is not a new thing for us in terms of acquisitions, whereby a customer may come into Equinix having implementations from an acquisition as well. We have a strong client service management team that's applied to each of the customers to understand what their combined footprint looks like. They continue to get the service levels that they are contracted for and expect from both of those. Obviously, it doesn't come necessarily without any hiccups, but we have client service managers that are applied to those accounts to deal with issues as they arise. And that's \u2013 so that's how we're doing it in terms of customers that are keeping or maintaining a footprint between both facilities. In some cases, a more challenging one might be where we are actually separating out the assets associated with the divestiture and that is a more complicated process in that sort of perhaps against their will to some degree. A customer may be sort of splitting their implementation now between Equinix and between the eventual buyer of the Cheetah (60:42) assets. That is a delicate customer communication. It's one that we would prefer have not to have had to do, but it was unfortunately the European commission didn't cooperate in that regard. And so, it's simply a matter of us being clear and consistent with the communications to the customer and then stepping \u2013 and then standing up the what we refer to as \u2013 standing up to divestiture organization or the divested organization to be fully capable of responding to that. What I would say is, we spent an enormous amount of money to make sure that that divestiture goes out in a way that makes it readily operable on day one to serve those customer needs. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: And Jon, I guess I'll add to Charles that there are fairly clear solicitation rules that we have to govern by once the divestiture is made, but we cannot solicit those customers and they're pretty clearly laid out. So, that's all being implemented through the process. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Morgan of Canaccord. Your line is now open. Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hi; good afternoon. Just on the UK and in particular, is there \u2013 has there been any impacts on the leasing side from the pending vote on the EU referendum? And you mentioned in your guidance that \u2013 in your updated guidance that Telecity might be tracking towards the low end. And I'm just trying to triangulate some of these things and then maybe kind of also in terms of the MRR per cabinet in that market? Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Paul, let me start first. I would say, overall when it comes to the UK, certainly, there is a lot of \u2013 there is some level of uncertainty that's been created with the Brexit. We as a company when we see the performance of the business, I would say there is nothing meaningful that would indicate that we're seeing a slowdown. I think the challenge that when we talked about \u2013 we had a commentary on Telecity more trending towards the lower end of the range, that's really more associated with the fact that we're taking two organizations, we're putting them together. When we gave our initial guidance, we didn't have the data and the visibility we have. Now, we're just refining our numbers because we have much more clarity on what we think we can do as a business, but at the same time aligning our sales force and delivery teams to meet the expectation. I think the other thing, again, Steve and Charles, I think both alluded to the fact that because we have the benefit of being able to import many of these global deals into markets and London being one of our stronger market, we see that as an opportunity and the number of three region deals that are in our pipeline today, perhaps not scientifically, but I would say is probably larger than we've seen in a long time. And so that gives us confidence with London and Amsterdam being some key nodes on those typical global deployments, that continues to be an opportunity for us. So overall, I wouldn't say anything meaningful yet, but we're certainly going to pay attention to it and we are monitoring it. We do get a number of questions from our investors on that subject matter, but it's a bit early to say with any confidence that there's any real impact from this potential Brexit matter. Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Thanks and then you talked about growing the interconnections here outside the U.S. I'm just wondering how close do you think you can get that component of the business to the density that you're seeing in the U.S. and kind of maybe both in terms of Europe and Asia PAC? Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Yes, it's a hard question to answer. There is a variety of different \u2013 obviously Western Europe is clearly a fully deregulated telecom market. And so network density is something that does really benefit customers in a similar way, but they started from a place where interconnection was really sort of, as Keith earlier referenced, sort of packed in and not really clearly delineated as part of the value proposition, and so it's been a bit of a journey for us in terms of being more clear with customers about the distinctive and extraordinary value they're getting from cross connects, and so whether or not you could achieve the same levels that we do now, which are in the north of 20% in the U.S., it's hard to tell. But I do think that we certainly continue to see upside opportunity in both regions to meaningfully improve those, both through quantity and price levers that are available to us, and so I think they'll filter north for sure. Whether or not they can get to those same levels, I don't know, but I think they can go meaningfully higher than where they are today. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: Yeah and the only thing I'd add, Paul, it's a good question, is on a global basis, you can see inside the slides that we run interconnection as a percent of revenues about 16% on a global basis. As Charles just said, it was developed in a different way in Americas and we're roughly 23% interconnection as a percent of revenue in the Americas, 13% in Asia and that's been growing and an 8% in Europe. So to your point and to Charles' point, the largest opportunity to continue to grow the interconnection part of our value proposition exists there and we did it on the back of the acquisition we did when we first went into Europe and we changed that business to enable it and certainly with the mix of three region and multi-region customers that understand the value, as Charles said, of interconnection, it will migrate in that direction, but it will take time. Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : Great, thank you guys. I wanted to talk about your guidance. So, in the first quarter, you just did 16% organic growth and your guidance I believe for the year you raised it from 13% to 13.4%, but obviously that implies then that at some point you can't be below 13.4% to average that number for the full year. It just \u2013 I'm having a hard time understanding what would happen over the next three quarters to see that type of deceleration in the business? I was wondering if you could give us some color on that. And then you talked about it very briefly in your prepared remarks, but cabinet net adds were 1,500, and the last I think three or four quarters have been north of 3,000. You talked about timing, but it was lower, at least versus our numbers in each of the regions. I was wondering if you can us a little bit more specificity when you say timing and what's giving you the confidence that we'll see that rebound? And should we think it's going to get back to that, call it 3,000-plus level is really the second quarter? Thanks. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Great questions, Colby. So let me try and address the question on growth year-over-year versus what we're guiding to. So frankly what we've told you on a constant-currency basis that organic business can grow greater than 13.4%. Now as you recognize Q1 when you look at on a year-over-year basis it's 16% and so we're stepping \u2013 we're effectively stepping that down in the second quarter to midpoint of guidance of roughly 2.6% growth quarter-over-quarter if you're looking at the top end of the range 2.9% quarter-over-quarter growth. 60 basis points of that is coming from the fact that right now we're assuming that non-recurring revenue will be $5.5 million less in Q2 than it was in Q1. So number one, there is an element of what's going on in the non-recurring space. Number two, when we look at that second half of the year, one of the things that we're really \u2013 given the level of activity and other matters that are affecting the combination of the business is between Bit- isle, Telecity and ourselves, we are very much \u2013 we're being very disciplined in what we want the future guidance to be, right now we're leaving as greater than 13.4% and that's really a reflection of there is a lot of activity that's taking place in the company right now, and because of that we want to make sure we continue to have a relatively conservative view on what it means for the back half of the year. Notwithstanding the fact though we are working very hard, as I said, to integrate the businesses and between the integration of the businesses and running the organic business, we're optimistic that we can continue to scale the business or to grow the business on a year-over-year basis greater than that 13.4%, but it's a little bit premature to commit to that today. And I'm sorry I've forgotten the second. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President: Second one was around the billable cab \u2013 billable cab adds. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. As it relates to billable cab adds, there is a couple of things that are certainly affecting that number. First and foremost, it's the size of the deals that we've looked at. The average size of deal that we did this quarter is a lot greater than the averages that we saw in the prior quarters. So, that's number one. We didn't do a lot of, what I would call, larger footprint of deals in the quarter. Number two, as you know, we've rolled out a new basic quote to cash platform and that quote to cash platform is putting a little bit of \u2013 it's new in the system it's different for our customers, it's different for our employees and so as we continue to refine, if you will, our platform, we think that that's going to continue to increase the number of cabinet add. Number three, I would tell you that our pipeline and our backlog is, and more particularly the backlog, is higher than it has been before. And as a result, there is that, that is going to give us confidence that it's going to come into the revenue stream and ultimately to the billing cabinets. And then the fourth thing I would say is, look, this is an area that we've seen before. It generally relates to things that happened near our end of quarter. Churn is a perfect example. Last quarter, as you recall, we referred to a UK-based churn, a relatively large churn that would affect not only our churn MRR metric, but also affects the number of cabinets, because the customer is affectively there for the entire quarter and then it churns out, and so you lose those cabinets. No different this quarter, we had a number of churn activities that happened in the back end of the quarter. And they were cabinet c and as a result, it reduced the overall level of cabinets billing. Bottom line is, we're optimistic that you're going to see that number rebound, we have seen it before, this pattern, and it's something that we'd anticipate changes as we look to the latter part of the year. The one thing that you can get great confidence in is irrespective of what that number is because it's a calculated metric, we are continuing to drive our revenues up and you can see by the guidance that we provided that we would expect to deliver $22 million of incremental revenue Q2 over Q1, which is a strong indication that we have got a number of billing cabinets in the system. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : Great. Thank you for all the color. Katrina Rymill - Vice President-Investor Relations, Equinix, Inc.: Great, thank you. That concludes our Q1 call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Thank you. That's concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Smith - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: Okay. Thanks, Katrina and good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. We had a great first half of 2016, delivering both revenues and adjusted EBITDA above the top end of our guidance range, as our global scale and reach, strength of our digital ecosystems, and service excellence continue to drive profitable growth. As depicted on slide three of our presentation, second quarter revenues were $900.5 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter, and up 15% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $420.3 million for the quarter, up 5% over the prior quarter and up 18% year-over-year on an organic and constant currency basis. This drove AFFO growth of 37% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. We delivered strong growth in net bookings with increasing contribution from our indirect channel. Our key operating metrics continued to be very healthy with firm MRR per cabinet, low churn and strong growth in both billable cabinet and interconnection. We continue to progress against key operational and business objectives in 2016 to grow our market position globally, centering on successful acquisition integration, sustained organic development and scaling our interconnection services. So, let me provide some commentary in each of these in turn. Starting with acquisitions. We are focusing our energy on successfully integrating Telecity and Bit-isle, scaling the business to drive even more value for our customers and enhancing our cloud and network density across EMEA and Asia. We've delivered against key integration goals and milestones, and are pleased with the progress we have made in the first half. The Telecity business delivered solid financial performance, despite normal integration challenges and complexity associated with the divestitures and we are seeing value creation across a broad range of synergy category. Our EMEA sales force has been fully integrated and our cross-selling program is tracking ahead of plan, with particular customer interest in the overlapping markets of London and Amsterdam and our new markets in Stockholm and Manchester. The financial and IT systems work is well underway and we've defined the critical initiatives to operationally integrate our back op. We have completed the first large systems conversion with the Telecity Dutch business, now operating within the Equinix corporate systems and processes and plan to migrate the remaining countries through 2017. In early July, we also completed the sale of eight European assets for $882 million, updated for FX, as required by the European Commission as part of its approval of our purchase of Telecity Group. Completing this last milestone in the acquisition process paves the way for us to fully focus on selling our new combined European platform. We were also pleased with Bit-isle's progress and the market reaction to the acquisition has been positive. The business is performing well, with cross-selling momentum accelerating, including several wins with Japanese multinationals that are leveraging space and connectivity across existing and acquired sites. We are further optimizing this business by divesting two small non-core businesses, which we completed in the first half of 2016. We also expect to divest TerraPower, a collection of solar power assets in the second half of this year. Turning to our organic development activity; we continue to invest and expand globally, allocating 95% of our expansion capital to building out campus or existing market build where a deep knowledge of fill rate, pipeline, and competitive supply leads to higher returns. We now have 19 announced expansion projects underway. In this quarter, we're moving forward with additional expansions in Ashburn, Frankfurt, Paris and Singapore, totaling over $250 million of capital expenditures. We're starting work on DC12, the first data center build in our Ashburn North Campus in Northern Virginia, which is on 44 acres of owned undeveloped land next to our current Ashburn campus. Today, Ashburn is one of our major campuses with over 14,000 cabinets across 10 IBX and it's the largest Internet exchange point in North America. The new Ashburn North Campus, which we plan to develop over the next few years, will expand our asset ownership and effectively double our capacity in this important market. Turning to Frankfurt, we see continued demand in this vibrant market coming from Internet and cloud providers due to data sovereignty compliance, as well as financial services growth. We're building Frankfurt 6, a new IBX located on owned land next to Frankfurt 4 and tethered to our core network hub in this market. These capital investments are delivering very healthy growth and strong returns as shown on slide four. Revenues from our 70 stabilized IBXs grew 8% year-over-year, above our historical trend line, and largely driven by an increase in cross connect and power density. We continue to find ways to optimize our asset base, putting the right customer and application into the right asset, which drives a firm yield per cabinet. These stabilized assets are generating a 32% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested and utilization remains at a stable 86%. In terms of our asset ownership strategy, our goal is to produce over 50% from owned properties over time by developing land such as in Silicon Valley and Ashburn, as well as purchasing additional sites, as it makes economic and strategic sense. Consistent with this strategy, we purchased our Paris 2 and 3 IBXs for $211 million from Digital Realty, which closed this week. Over 70 carriers reside in Paris 2 and 3, the second most densely connected data center campus in France. Ownership will enable us to achieve better operating costs, enhance customer service and further expand this campus over time. The acquisition of Paris 2 and 3 is an example of where we can acquire assets and operate the property more efficiently for our own purpose, thereby allowing us to enjoy a higher return. With this purchase, 35% of our revenues now come from owned assets. Turning to interconnection, the need to build next-generation IT architectures that connect network, cloud, people and data continues to drive customer demand for interconnection. We now have 183,000 cross connects and interconnection revenue grew 21% year-over-year on an organic and constant currency basis. Interconnection revenues represent 16% of our global recurring revenues, and this is the eighth quarter in a row where we added greater than 5,000 cross-connects. We saw particularly strong growth in connections to cloud providers with accelerated additions of participants, port and virtual circuit on our market-leading Cloud Exchange platform and strong sales of cross-connect to facilitate direct connections to pure play cloud. Our Internet exchange continues to scale with 5.6 terabits of peak traffic, growing over 35% year-over-year, as network and cloud providers upgrade their capacity and transition to 100-gig equipment. The transition to cloud continues to unfold as enterprises are re-architecting IT to drive down costs, improve performance and leverage clouds and networks. We continue to see growth in Fortune 500 new customer and expansion wins, as the explosion of data and devices are transforming how large multinationals architect their infrastructure leveraging interconnection as a core design principle. We added seven new Fortune 500 customers in the quarter, such as Ticketmaster, an online ticket vendor, leveraging Equinix to improve digital experience and integrate cloud infrastructure. We now have over 150 of the Fortune 500 customers and over 500 of the Global 2000. Now let me cover quarterly highlights from our industry vertical, starting with the network. This vertical experienced strong bookings, led by strength in Asia as wireline providers including Telstra, SingTel and SoftBank expanded with multi-region deployment. We saw growth with regional Internet service providers, including U.S. Internet Corp., a regional ISP peering to support growing enterprise cloud demand, and GCI, a regional telecom provider adding cloud connectivity capabilities via our Cloud Exchange to augment their network service offering. Additionally, our strength as a global platform allows us to target strategic subsea cable projects to land within our ecosystem hub, and we are seeing pipeline and activity build in this growing segment, including two new wins this quarter. Equinix is the biggest aggregator of digital ecosystems, making us the most logical choice for subsea cable operators to get the immediate benefit tapping into a mature ecosystem of buyers. The financial services vertical experienced continued expansion into our core electronic trading ecosystem, as well as diversification into other sub segments. This quarter we saw additional expansions from investment banks such as Morgan Stanley that are leveraging Equinix for critical data center, network, cloud connectivity. We're also observing the beginning of clustering of electronic payment counterparties across regions, including the addition of Merchant Customer Exchange, a leading merchant payment system that is deployed to peer traffic and connect to multiple clouds. In the content and digital media vertical, advertisers and digital media were the growth drivers for booking. Asia delivered strong bookings this quarter, reflecting digital adoption in the region. Customer wins, included Index Exchange, a premier ad-tech firm leveraging AD-IX and Taboola, a content discovery platform optimizing performance at the edge to better serve the APAC region. The cloud and IT services verticals is the second fastest-growing vertical, driven by cloud hyperscalers continuing to deploy access nodes globally, as well as strategic wins with leading SaaS providers. Our traction in the software-as-a-service space is enhancing the value of our platform to enterprise clients. We're also observing a maturity cycle where many SaaS providers launch in the public cloud then transition to hybrid cloud as they scale and service a wider customer base. We had a great quarter for cloud services adoption with over 460 enterprises, cloud, IT service providers and networks now interconnecting on our Cloud Exchange. Turning to the enterprise, this vertical continues to be the fastest-growing vertical with a record number of Performance Hub deployments this quarter. Wins included a Fortune 100 manufacturer that is re-architecting by building edge nodes at Equinix, and a U.S. federal agency providing delivery services that is deploying multiple Performance Hubs and integrating multiple clouds on our platform. Today, over 470 customers have deployed our Performance Hub solution, which helps enterprises optimize their network architectures, access the cloud and drive application performance. Updated for acquisition, cloud and IT services and enterprise verticals, now represent 29% and 14% of our revenues respectively, and we continue to expect these verticals to lead growth as we progress with enterprise cloud adoption. And finally, we are seeing solid progress in our channel and partner programs, as the percentage of our bookings coming from channel has increased from high-single digits three years ago to over 15% today. Our channel strategy leverages a range of partner types, each playing a critical role in scaling our enterprise sales. Platform partners help us leverage mind share and awareness with high-value target customers committed to hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of choice. Referral partners create leverage in our lead generation engine and resellers magnify our sales effort and combine key value-added services that Equinix offers to deliver complete solutions that more directly address the integrated needs of enterprise customers. By coordinating our sales activity with key partners at the local level, we've been able to meaningfully expand our market reach and have seen our channel program as our most prolific source of new logo for the past several quarters. So let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to cover some of the results for the quarter. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Great, thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone on the call. It's great to be able to update you on our second quarter performance, our 54th quarter of top-line revenue growth. By almost any measure, this was another strong quarter for Equinix. For the first-half 2016, we delivered results better than our expectations and created value for our investors by scaling revenues, while improving margin, resulting in meaningful flow through to adjusted EBITDA and AFFO with an absolute dollar terms as well as on a per share basis. The organic business continues to perform well and our acquisitions are delivering against our expectations. Also, the number of cross-sell successes and the depth of the sales pipeline continues to grow. Overall, we're delighted with the progress of our integration efforts related to both Bit-isle and Telecity. Bit-isle has moved up the margin curve faster than expected, despite our anticipated higher churn levels, and we've optimized the business more quickly than originally planned. As Steve noted, we now expect to sell three non-core Bit-isle business lines prior to the end of the year. This allows us to focus on the higher value co-location and interconnection offerings, along with some managed services in support of the local Tokyo market. With regard to Telecity, now that the divestiture process is complete, the team is highly focused on integrating the former Telecity businesses into Equinix as quickly as possible. In July, we fully integrated the Dutch business, which is now operating within our systems and processes. This will soon be followed by the UK, Irish, and Swedish businesses over the next few quarters. With regards to our key operating metrics as highlighted by Steve, yet worth mentioning again; our MRR per cabinet yield remains firm at just over 2,000 per cabinet, up $18 on a constant currency basis over the prior quarter, with particular strength in the Americas region. Also, we added 3,300 net billable cabinets in the quarter, effectively returning to our normal add level, and the MRR churn was lower than expected. With respect to our interconnection offerings, net cross connect additions remains very positive, adding another 6,100 in the quarter. Also the provision capacity and traffic growth on our Internet exchanges has substantially outpaced our competitors, partially reflected by the meaningful increase in the number of 100-gig ports provisioned on our exchanges. As we measure the health and success of our exchanges, we now will would provision capacity in addition to the total port count to highlight the momentum we're seeing in the interconnection offering. Now, I'd like to add a few comments on foreign currency movements in the quarter. The U.S. dollar weakened during the back half of Q1 through most of Q2 against many of our operating currencies. This resulted in a meaningful FX benefit for the second quarter relative to Q1. However, following the Brexit announcement on June 24, the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against the British pound and the euro. Despite these FX movements, we expect no significant change in either our 2016 revenue or adjusted EBITDA guidance related to FX movement, as many of the other operating currencies that we operate in strengthened against the U.S. dollar in Q2. Now, with we continue to place currency hedges into our business to reduce financial volatility and protect certainty of our cash flow. Most recently, we benefited from the FX hedges put in place to protect the proceeds we expected to receive from the EMEA asset sale, which was denominated in pound sterling and euros. With these hedges in place, our U.S. dollar proceeds totaled $882 million, but would have been $55 million lower without these hedges. Separately, we also hedged approximately 50% of the EMEA revenues and cash flows. As we continue to integrate Telecity into our EMEA business, we'll increase our revenue and net cash flow hedge position. Turning to the second quarter, as depicted on slide five, global Q2 revenues were $900.5 million, the first time we've achieve this milestone level. Revenues were up 3% over the prior quarter and 15% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis. Our global platform continues to expand with Asia Pacific and EMEA showing organic and constant currency growth over the same quarter last year of 21% and 15% respectively, while the Americas region produced steady growth of 12%. Our as-reported revenues include $144.5 million from acquisition, consistent with our expectation. Q2 revenues net of FX hedges included a $15.5 million positive currency benefit when compared to the average FX rate used last quarter, and $2 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance range. Global adjusted EBITDA was $420.3 million, up 5% over the prior quarter and 18% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis, above our expectations due to strong revenue flow through and lower than expected utility and integration costs. Our as-reported adjusted EBITDA includes $64 million of contribution from our acquisition and $10 million of integration costs. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46.7%, a 160 basis point increase over the prior quarter. Our Q2 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a positive $8.7 million currency benefit when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter, and a $1.3 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rate. Global AFFO was $290.5 million, a 38% increase over the prior quarter and increased to 69% of our adjusted EBITDA. Excluding integration costs, AFFO on a normalized and constant currency basis increased 7% over the prior quarter, largely due to the strong business performance and lower than expected interest expense. AFFO per share on a fully-diluted basis was $4.04 for Q2, or if you exclude integration costs, $4.18 on a per share basis. After we posted our original earnings deck today, please note that we've reissued our earnings deck and posted a new deck that will include AFFO per share data. Moving to churn, global MRR churn for Q2 was 1.8% better than our expectation. We expect the MRR churn for the second half of 2016 to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter. And as mentioned at the Analyst Day in June, we continued to expect 2017 MRR churn to average 2% to 2.5% per quarter, which includes the elevated churn in Q1 2017 related to the final phase of LinkedIn's bifurcation strategy. I had said before, MRR churn could be lumpy and the LinkedIn churn is a perfect example of this. Although the LinkedIn churn will create an increase in both our cabinet and MRR dollar churn, we expect our MRR per cabinet yield to increase at the same point in time reflective of LinkedIn's per cabinet yield being significantly below the Americas MRR per cabinet average. Now I'd like to provide a few highlights on the regions whose full results are covered on slide six through eight. The Americas region had another solid revenue quarter with particular strength coming from the Brazilian business. The region's MRR per cabinet yield benefited from continued interconnection growth and lower than planned MRR churn. Also, the region had higher than expected adjusted EBITDA, largely due to lower than expected utility expenses. EMEA delivered another solid quarter of revenues with particular strength in our Dutch market. EMEA continued to execute against its key business initiatives, including the integration of the Telecity business. Asia-Pacific remains our fastest growing region with strong bookings in our Tokyo and Sydney-based markets, driven by network and cloud and IT verticals. Interconnection revenues continued to outpace overall growth of the business with the Americas, APAC, and EMEA interconnection revenues now at 23%, 13%, and 8% respectively of recurring revenue. Now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to slide nine. Unrestricted cash and investments increased over $1 billion after taking into consideration the proceeds related to the EMEA asset sale, as well as funds used to purchase our Paris 2 and 3 assets. Again, as mentioned during the Analyst Day, although our business plan remains fully funded, including the partial drawdown of our revolving line of credit, we do expect to fully consume the cash in our balance sheet as we continue to invest in scaling our organic business with capital expansion initiatives, as well as returning capital to our shareholders through our quarterly cash dividend payout. Finally, we settled the remaining portion of our June 2016 convertible debt instrument and cap call with a net 1.6 million of shares issued. Our pro forma net leverage stepped down to 3.5 times our Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA, largely due to the cash received from the EMEA asset sale, bringing us back into our targeted net leverage range of 3 to 4 times adjusted EBITDA. Now switching to AFFO and dividends on slide 10. For 2016, we are raising our as-reported AFFO to now range between $1.04 billion and $1.05 billion, a 26% year-over-year increase, the result of strong operating performance and lower than planned interest expense. Our normalized and constant currency AFFO is expected to now range between $1.159 billion and \u2013 pardon me, we'll start again \u2013 $1.159 billion and $1.169 billion or a 32% increase over the prior year. Normalizing for integration costs in the Telecity FX translation loss in Q1, our 2016 fully-diluted AFFO per share is expected to increase 11% year-over-year to $16.21 using on a weighted average 71.7 million common shares outstanding, as presented on page 32 of our earnings deck. Also today, we announced our Q3 dividend of $1.75 a share, consistent with our Q2 quarterly dividend. Our AFFO payout ratio was estimated to be 48% for 2016. Now looking at CapEx, please refer to slide 11. For the quarter, CapEx expenditures were $250 million, including a recurring CapEx of $32 million, below our guidance expectations due to timing of cash payments to our contractors. Given our currently high utilization rate of 82% as well as the strong development returns across our new expansion and stabilized IBXs, we continue to invest in many of our key markets with 19 in-progress builds, eight of which are expected to open by the end of this year. As a result, we expect to spend between $950 million and $1 billion of CapEx in 2016. With respect to new builds, we've opened Sydney 4 earlier this month, our 146th data center and our fifth in the Australian market. This large-scale facility will provide 3,000 cabinets of colocation space when fully built out, effectively doubling our existing capacity in Sydney. And finally, we provided you a number of slides that bridge our 2016 guidance from the normalized 2015 performance, including slides for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Please refer to slides 12 through 16. I'll now turn the call back to Steve. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: Okay, Keith. Thanks. And finally on slide 16, which summarizes our updated Q3 and full-year 2016 guidance, including the impact of FX changes. Now, let me cover our updated 2016 outlook. For the full year of 2016, we're raising our revenue guidance to now range between $3.598 billion and $3.608 billion, a 32% as-reported growth organic, and constant currency growth rate of 13.8% compared to the prior year. This $8 million revenue increase includes a positive $2 million FX benefit when compared to prior guidance rates. Net of adjustments for Paris 2 and 3 acquisition and Bit-isle divestitures, revenue's stepping up $3 million, the result of our strong Q2 performance. For 2016, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to now range between $1.658 billion and $1.668 billion, a 31% as-reported increase for organic and constant currency growth rate of 16.8% compared to the prior year. This $13 million adjusted EBITDA increase includes a positive $1 million FX benefit when compared to prior guidance rates. Net of adjustments for the Paris 2 and 3 acquisition and Bit-isle divestures, adjusted EBITDA is stepping up $8 million, the result of our strong Q2 operating performance. And the growth of our business is driving increased adjusted funds from operations, which drives corporate cash flows and ultimately dividend. We're now raising our AFFO to range between $1.04 billion and $1.05 billion, a 32% normalized in constant currency growth rate compared to the prior year. This $30 million AFFO increase has negligible foreign currency benefit when compared to prior guidance. And finally, we are narrowing our 2016 capital expenditures to now range between $950 million and $1 billion for the year. So in closing, we continue to achieve above market growth rates, while reinforcing and extending our differentiated market position. We are capturing the significant shift to the cloud, executing well to capture the enterprise and continuing to invest across the business. The benefits of our interconnection strategy drive a growing and durable business that will continue to increase our revenues, AFFO, cash flow and dividend. So let me stop here and we'll open it up for questions. I'll turn it back over to you Sam. Operator : Thank you. And we will now begin the question and answer session. Our first question comes from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good afternoon. So on slide three, you talked about the 8% growth in stabilized IBXs being at the upper end of the range and I wonder if you could drill down a little bit more as to what you're seeing. You mentioned power entity and cross connects, are there any regions or metros where you're seeing that more than others? Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Hi, Jonathan, I'll take that one. As we think about that number, number one is 8%, as we said year-over-year growth and 9% on a constant currency basis, we're seeing continued growth \u2013 part of the metrics that we provided you today were certainly provision for growth cross-connects, but also just giving you a sense of the momentum on an MRR per cabinet basis. So a lot of that's attributed to, again, power and interconnection revenues. As a result, no matter where you look across our portfolio, in all three cases, our MRR per cabinet has moved up and to the right. That's reflective of the performance across all three regions. And as a result, you're seeing that benefit really holds true in all stabilized assets in each of our markets. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: Yes. And I guess, I might just add that the \u2013 Jon, that we talked a lot about the interconnection-oriented architecture and how that is becoming relevant to how people are architecting their IT. And that's definitely filling up in terms of how people are adding interconnection both in terms of cross-connects as well as greater leverage in our other interconnection-oriented services like Metro Connect, et cetera. So we're adding nice interconnection revenue. And then, of course, we are seeing interconnection \u2013 I'm sorry, power densities increase on average. And we have quite a unique advantage in that we have a very large number of customers across a range of power densities, which allows us to continue to extract underutilized power and use it to our economic advantage. So, we see both of those factors and they continue to drive into very healthy performance on stabilized IBXs. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : On enterprise and performance, I was sort of interested you had some success now for several quarters. And what are you seeing one year in from some of those deployments? In other words, is there a consistent trend that you're seeing where those are kind of stable and a lot of growth is coming from new logos? Or are you seeing these one-year-olds or older deployments expand either the number of locations or the size of their footprint within existing locations? Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Yes, very much both. We are \u2013 we definitely have \u2013 it was our strongest quarter of Performance Hub deployment, and that was both in terms of new logo capture both on the enterprise side, as well as a number of service provider categories who are effectively using Performance Hub to optimize our network architectures. And we are seeing a very strong land-and-expand sort of behavior in the Performance Hubs. So people are \u2013 typically initially come on the with one, two, three Performance Hub locations, prove out the benefits of those in terms of both performance and cost savings, and then they circle behind relatively quickly to add locations after the validated benefits. So, we see both of those and continue to be very excited about that offering in the market and how it's being received. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: I guess, I'd pile on top of that, Jonathan, this is Steve, that \u2013 as I mentioned in the script, we're \u2013 we added seven Fortune 500 customer wins this quarter and a record number of Performance Hubs, which is exactly tied to what Charles was pointing is that it's now turned into our largest contributor of new customer adds. Inside of that, the manufacturing and professional services segments, inside the enterprise verticals are, in this quarter, where we saw a pretty big uptick of win. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : On Europe, just quickly, I wondered if you could share with us some of the feedback that you're maybe seeing from your various partners and customers with regards to Brexit and how that might affect IT spending trends? Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: Yes. The Brexit impact is, at this point, very early. I think everybody's waiting the regulatory changes. And as you guys know, typically in the past, any regulatory changes have benefited Equinix. So, it's too early for us to determine. And we certainly haven't seen it in our bookings or our pipeline yet. There's a lot of uncertainty around the regulations, and I think we're watching the market very closely as everyone else is. We've not made any changes in our guidance reflective of Brexit at all, but we're continuing to see financial services deals close in the quarter, particularly in the UK and EMEA. Generally, the secular trends are unchanged, so we're still seeing the typical trends that we see in this part of the world. I think the regulatory thing has to unfold as I said. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Morgan with Canaccord. Your line is now open. Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. On the \u2013 just focusing on the domestic side in terms of your MRR per cab up $36 sequentially, I mean, you highlighted cloud cross-connects as one thing, but it sounds like it's just \u2013 it's running ahead of your own expectations. And I'm just wondering if you could drill down into kind of maybe some areas where you think the drivers are really occurring. And then kind of following on that, whether looking out at change, are you seeing greater acceptance of that product? And then on top of that kind of subsequent add-on of cross-connects as your customers adopt that? Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: You want me to start, Charles, or... Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Go ahead. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: So a couple of thoughts on that, Paul, I think earlier, to Charles' comments, we're starting to see the advantage of this interconnection-oriented architectural approach we're taking to the market. And as they help solve customer pain points with our \u2013 with \u2013 across the globe, the user experience with people is a big requirement that we're seeing, and interconnection is helping that. Location is a big factor in these requirements we're seeing, driven by bandwidth costs. The cloud, most customers we're dealing with are trying to get access to the multi-cloud. And so we're able to facilitate that. And then there's a lot of data-driven needs and requirements around compliance and customer insight. And so all the typical things that Charles talked about earlier around the Internet-oriented architecture is driving requirement. And we're well positioned to address many of those, and that's underpinning a lot of this interconnection growth. Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Yes. Fundamentally, I'd say that you've heard us talk a lot over the last several years about the discipline of putting the right customer at the right application into the right asset and that fundamentally, good execution and discipline against that strategy is what has driven our yield \u2013 continue to drive our yield up. So, we're really targeting workloads that tend to be interconnection oriented, we're quite disciplined in terms of finding that sweet spot of implementation size that really works well for the business and deliver strong value to the customer. They're typically adding both cross-connects in terms of getting direct connectivity to pure-play public cloud. And then as they expand, their commitment to hybrid cloud and the use of SaaS players, they're really looking at using ECX as a very convenient multi-cloud platform. And so we're seeing a lot of interest and uptake on those, even though it's, I think, relatively early days in the overall transformation. But that continues to show up in our results from a yield perspective. Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thanks. And just as a follow up, you've talked about at your Investor Day and elsewhere about IoT as kind of the next wave of potential growth. I'm just wondering if you have any kind of color on whether you're seeing anything meaningful in terms of IoT-related workloads? And, is that something that's a 2016- 2017 driver? Or, is it really looking beyond that? Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Well, I think it's real now in terms of we're seeing some pretty sizable major IoT players who are deploying their platform inside of Equinix for a variety of reasons, primarily around the effectiveness of them to do aggregation cost effectively and with the right performance inside of our facilities. And so we're definitely seeing those early players come in and use Platform Equinix. So we think there is a real contribution, but obviously, we're very early stages in that. So I think it's going to continue to play out. We have a number of the, sort of emerging ecosystems. We have targeted business development efforts that make a very concerted effort to sit down and talk about who we think the critical magnates are going to be, deploy business development resources to go out and engage with those players, optimize Cloud Exchange to enable integration with those services and really begin to see the clustering and curating of those ecosystems that we've duplicated \u2013 that we've done in the past with others. So, still early days, but very positive signs, and I think it's already contributing but just tip of the iceberg. Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore. Your line is now open. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : Great. Can you guys hear me? Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : You bet. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : All right. Thank you for taking the questions. I guess, Keith, I'd love to get a little help on guidance. There is a lot of moving parts here, and I just wanted to understand a few things and maybe you can tell me how they all fit together. The first thing I'd say is I think last quarter, you sort of set us up that nonrecurring revenues would take a step down, maybe $5 million and $6 million. And I think that didn't really materialize this quarter, and so just trying to understand what happened there? Maybe the intersection of that and sort of the organic growth expectations for the year, they moved up 40 basis points, but still when I looked over the first half of the year, you had 16% in the first quarter and 15% organic growth in the second quarter. And so just trying to figure out how it all fits together? Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Great, Jonathan. So, let me start by taking you through revenue at the highest level. As you know, we revised our guidance up by roughly a net $8 million. 50% of that $8 million really comes from the acquisition of the Paris 2, Paris 3 assets. That will add roughly $4 million of revenue to the second half of the year. For all intents and purposes, the FX and the divestitures that we referred to from Bit-isle, they will offset each other. So we have a little bit of a positive currency benefit, offset by the loss of the divestitures. So that really is leaving roughly 50% of $4 million of value attributed to the performance in our Q2 result. So that all said, that gives you a 13.8% year-over-year growth rate on an organic basis. As we look at the acquisitions, so both Bit-isle and Telecity, they're performing against our expectations. As you've heard us say before, there's a lot of friction as we close out the Telecity transaction and then sold off a number of the assets. We're now looking forward to seeing the focus on that business, and I would expect that at some point, you'll see the momentum pick up in Telecity. As it relates to Bit-isle, as you've heard us refer to, there was a lot of churn that was embedded in the business. And yes, we're experiencing the churn, but the team is continuing to perform well. And so in both cases, when we combine and look at the acquisitions, they are performing to our expectations. The last thing I'd say is one of the things that probably is \u2013 well, let me say two things. One of the things that probably not clearly evident is as we think about our booking expectations, we delivered almost exactly what we expected for the quarter and so very consistent with performance relative to what we have seen in the prior quarters from a gross and net bookings perspective. That all said, there's been a positive increase effectively to our backlog because as we think about the complexity of the global hybrid cloud implementation, they're extending the book-to-bill interval. And to give you a sense of size or order of magnitude, is in there about $4 million of delayed revenue associated with increased backlog attributed to our book to bill interval. So that would be that one \u2013 second last comment. And the last comment I'd make is, as we think about nonrecurring, back to your initial question, nonrecurring, we saw a little bit of an uptick this quarter over and above what we originally anticipated. But we still have the \u2013 our underlying assumption is nonrecurring revenue will revert closer to 5% as we scale through the year. And to the extent there's any change in that, we'll certainly guide to, but that's the assumption that we've made in the Q3, sorry, the updated revenue guidance. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : Okay, great. And as you look through your expectation of improved organic performance, if I could ask, have you seen any changes in the competitive environment as it relates to the core performance product that you guys offer? Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Let me give you a couple of perspectives. I'm sure Steve and Charles will jump in as well. I think overall, when you look at how we're performing, one of the things that you'll notice is the number of net cabinet adds that we had this quarter, so we're back up to 3,300 net cab adds. So again, this is showing continued momentum in the business. As I said, we're still driving, we're driving our bookings engine as we expect and with momentum that we think that will continue to come from the channel. That gives us, it gives us a perhaps a greater opportunity as we look forward. All that said, you can see our utilization levels moving up. And so one of the things I would leave with you is, as we see utilization levels move up, there's really a need for us \u2013 there's eight new projects that are coming online this year, and there's 19 that are in the hopper. It's important for us to continue to build out our expansion initiatives so that we can continue to sell at that same clip with the same set of opportunities. Certainly, there's a number of markets where, all else being equal, we have some constrained inventory issues that we have to address. And hence, we're really focused on making sure that we continue to develop those properties. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : Thanks a lot, Keith. Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Jon, I might just add just a little more color, I think, on the overall competitive environment. No meaningful change in my view, but I would say that as we look across the globe, I think we see pretty favorable supply/demand dynamics across all of our operating regions, which I think continues to mean that the overall market is operating with a pretty high level of discipline. But I also would say that we're seeing the unique strengths of Equinix begin to become increasingly important to the targeted buyers that we're going after. So the global reach, the ability to implement hybrid cloud effectively and gain access to the cloud density that we have and implement multi-cloud effectively, those are things that I think we're seeing in terms of. And if you look at our bookings in the really what we see as the critical growth verticals of cloud and IP and enterprise, really the two sides of the cloud ecosystem. Again, they continue to over-index. I think this is the ninth quarter in a row that that's been the case. And that speaks to I think the competitive dynamic in terms of our ability to win really targeted implementation. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : Thanks, Charles. Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : Great. Thank you. One of the areas where you outperformed in the second quarter was on the EBITDA side in a fairly notable way, and I think you mentioned some benefit that you saw in SG&A. But when I look at your guidance for the third quarter, it's implying roughly an $18 million increase to revenue at the midpoint and about a $2 million increase to EBITDA. So I'm just curious, is there anything in the SG&A in the second quarter that was one-time in nature that we should be mindful of when we're trying to get back to your guidance for the third quarter in our modeling? And then my second question is on Paris. It looks like you're including a $4 million benefit both to revenue and to EBITDA. Obviously, you were once a customer there yourself so that may have some impact, but trying to understand why those are the same numbers. Thanks. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Let me start. Let me take the first question, Colby. As it relates to Q3, as you know, it's typically our seasonally high utilities quarter. And if you go back a dozen years, you're going to see that historically utilities move up in that market, particularly in Silicon Valley and then certainly some of our European markets. As a result, there's $7 million of incremental utilities expensed in Q3 that was not there in Q2. And so although we got the benefit of utilities, I refer to that in our over-performance in Q2, we're still going to see a meaningful step-up of $7 million. So that would take your quarter-over-quarter EBITDA growth up to roughly 3.7%. So that'd be the first comment. As it relates to Paris, one of the benefits that we have as we said is, there's a great opportunity as a company as we acquire assets, we can operate it differently than the landlord. And in this case, there's an opportunity as we think about the revenue we can derive from the incremental customers inside those data centers. In addition to the fact that as we think about the lease treatment probably going to look \u2013 the lease treatment or the acquisition treatment is going to look as if you take all those operating costs away as a business, and then you put it on to your balance sheet, and then you'll have some depreciation. So we get the benefit attributed to revenue, but we also remove the costs associated with how we treated those assets. And then obviously operationally, we think we can leverage off of our existing \u2013 not to suggest we're not going to make some incremental investments. We can leverage off our existing staff, and so we get the benefit of that incremental revenue without having to meaningfully augment our staff. So in both cases, you get a nice top line and you also get a nice bottom line improvement. And then you'll continue to see us make good strategic decisions around those two assets and how to explore an even better return from the costs that we acquired these assets from DLR at. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : Great. Thank you. And just to be clear on Jonathan's last question there. Just I'm getting questions myself on this. The increase, the $8 million increase in revenue, that is coming from MRR. That is not coming from upside to NRR. It sounds like you're keeping your nonrecurring assumptions for 2016 in your guidance the same as they were last quarter. Is that correct? Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : I wouldn't say that. I haven't dissected it to that level. But certainly, we're looking at it holistically and certainly things move around quite a bit, as you know, in our different operating businesses. But bottom line, the team is committing both on an MRR and likely some NRR to augment our revenues by the $8 million. So, I'd have to do more work to give you an exact number. But overall, there's probably a little bit of both, Colby. I don't want you walking away thinking it's just MRR. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, this is Richard for Phil. Just wanted to follow up on the EMEA performance. It had pretty strong performance, but you mentioned earlier now that all the acquisitions and dispositions have been done. Could we see an acceleration in performance \u2013 in that part of the business? Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: Well, the hard stuff, the divesting and the initial integration plan is going to \u2013 the integration is going to go on through 2017, but the primary underpinning of the opportunity to do that is the fact that we've got our sales forces integrated now, and we're completely focused on cross-selling into both sets of assets. And so trying to quantify that is difficult to do at this point, but our complete focus now is globally selling into these assets and getting that sales force in Europe completely focused on selling globally, including the assets in Europe. So that will help us, obviously, with the distraction behind us now, the divestitures and the preliminary integrations. But we still have other countries to integrate from a systems and process standpoint. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : So I'd just add one other comment to Steve's comment. As you can appreciate now that we are through the divestiture process, we're working hard on the integration, and this relates both to Telecity and to Bit-isle. One of the benefits that we're going to have is we get to sell across a combined platform today. And understanding exactly who should be the, if you will, the true beneficiary of that booking and where the costs will go is becoming increasingly cloudy. So when we think about how we're going to perform on a go-forward basis, we're very much trying to look at it holistically. But it's clear that, from our perspective, we've taken away substantial distraction from the business now that we've not only closed the acquisition of our Paris 2, Paris 3 acquisition, but the divestiture of the eight assets to Digital Realty. And so now we can really focus on scaling the business and taking away a lot of the noise in the system. Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And the follow-up on that. It seemed like your cloud and IT services along with your enterprise customers all expanded into more data centers or IBXs. Can you give us a sense on how that conversation goes and where that could go over time? Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Yes. This is Charles. We definitely see that people are \u2013 well, there're two sides to it. There's the supply side, if you will, in terms of CSP. And we typically see CSPs, particularly those who have global aspirations, and that tends to be the bulk of them operating across our regions and they tend to have pretty high total IBX count. And then on the enterprise side, similarly, in order to implement these interconnection-oriented architectures and take advantage of the network density and cloud density we have, they tend to start with a, as I said earlier, with a few locations and then have a land-and-expand sort of appetite or behavior over time. So, we definitely are seeing, I think, an increasing average number of IBXs for a deployment of customers. And we certainly believe that, that will continue. Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Your line is now open. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much and just a follow-up on that last question. What we received from investors is that obviously there's been a large amount of build out with respect to the cloud service providers within your facilities in the back half of the last year and continuing into this year. I was wondering, are you starting to see some of that expansion as you mentioned in terms of either additional applications or other geographic locations with respect to the cloud service providers? Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Yes, you're absolutely right. I think we saw a bit of a land grab going on last year, as sort of the top CSPs really tried to quickly get into what they saw as the critical baseline set of markets for their services. And I think that's slowed down a little bit, but now what we're seeing is behavior in terms of people adding incremental services beginning to scale their revenue lines. Obviously, that's evident in the results of the likes of AWS and Microsoft. And we think that's fueling other CSPs to be \u2013 to have an interest in expanding their platform as well. So, we do see a little bit of that sort of big build-out bubble as maybe taking a bit of a breather, but we're seeing, particularly for us, because of our global footprint, see strong demand from the CSPs and then, again, translating that into momentum on the buy side of the ecosystem with the enterprise. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: The only other thing I think we're hearing, Charles, Amir, this is Steve, is they continue to deploy in the big markets. And we benefit from that because but we're in the big markets. But we're also seeing them going to emerging markets now at a pretty high clip, trying to extend their platform all over the world. And sometimes we're there, and sometimes we aren't. So in the \u2013 obviously, with our footprint, we're experiencing a lot of pipeline with these guys. But they're pushing beyond even the footprint that we have around the world into emerging markets. So at some point, that will pull us into future emerging markets. That kind of demand is what does that, big customer drivers, so we stay tuned and we watch that very closely, too. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's very helpful. And then if I may, a quick follow-up. If I look at the interconnection growth this quarter, I mean certainly saw an acceleration versus the prior quarter. Where do you think sort of trajectory could end up? I mean it sounds like you're getting additional footprint expansion. The enterprise seems to be gaining faster traction here. I mean how should we think about that sort of growth profile going forward? Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: Charles, you want to take that. Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : Yes. I mean, it's hard to anticipate. And it's because it's been so healthy and continues to be so much interest in terms of people utilizing the interconnection service offers that we bring to architecture infrastructure. So we \u2013 I can't really \u2013 I couldn't pinpoint what we think is possible in terms of whether there's a continued acceleration of that, but I would say that it continues to over-index on the interconnection line relative to the other services based on the strength of the ecosystem. And we foresee that continuing. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks so much for the additional color. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Your line is now open. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Two if I could. The first one, which is more of a numbers question. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about how much the hedging benefits on currency are affecting the financials? And how you are looking at the hedging strategy for foreign currencies going forward? And then secondly, if I could just take a step back to the analyst meeting that you held. You put some information out about the pipeline of new build out opportunities that you currently control across your portfolio between new phases and land where you could construct new buildings. And what I'm curious about is if you can give us an update on sizing that opportunity, whether in terms of cabinets or revenue? And also help us think about maybe the CapEx associated with those types of opportunities in the future? Thanks. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : I'll take the hedging question, Mike, and Steve or Charles will jump in on the other one. First, as it relates to hedging, our philosophy is to, as you know, is to provide effectively a soft landing for currencies as they move around, it's really to provide predictability with our results and with more focus on revenues and then also to create some certainty around our cash flows, again, because we're distributing a lot of our capital today back to shareholders. So those are two things that are highly important for us. And so when we think about how we deploy our hedges, number one, there's been increased volatility and so one of the things that we wanted to do is try and feather out these hedges over a longer period of time. And so we are hedging partially into 2018 now. We're focusing on typically the European currencies because of \u2013 without getting overly complex, our business in Europe is run as U.S. dollar functional. And when we hedge against our \u2013 whether revenues are costs for our cash flow hedges, we get the treatment against the lines in which we're hedging. So those are things that we try and do. And clearly, as a result, you're seeing the benefit of us not only in our result, but also on our guidance rate on how we've layered in those hedges over a period of time. So absolutely, we're benefiting from the hedges, but it'll depend on the currencies and the markets that we're talking about. But the philosophy is to continue to hedge, and then there also is our cash \u2013 as I said, there's the cash flow hedges, then the hedges that we put in place when we're moving money around the markets. And in this case, as you know, with the pending sale of the EMEA assets, we wanted to make sure we hedge the cash flow associated with that. And as I said, absent putting that hedge in place, we would have been $55 million shorter have we not put our hedges in place because of what happened with Brexit. And so again, we're being very thoughtful about our overall hedging strategy to create that predictability with our cash flows but also make sure that there's a smooth glide path as currencies rebase in some cases, like the euro or the pound, yet at the same time, you're going to get the volatility pick up because we only hedged 70%, 80% of the exposure. Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: And Mike, I don't know if Charles \u2013 the second question there's no real difference in our prosecution of making decisions on new build. It's driven across all the regions. We have that standing cadence every month, and it's driven by fill rate, pipeline, competitive knowledge in each of those markets, Mike. And we roll those up every month. We look at them around the world. We direct the CapEx based on the highest need and the best return, and we've got a mechanism that does that on a regular basis. So I don't... Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : I don't have in hand \u2013 at the tip of my fingers here in terms of our Analyst Day, but we did provide what we thought the total incremental capacity would be available to us if we built out essentially the phases that we have available to us of existing projects as well as building out on our existing land base. And I don't remember, Keith, what that total was, but I think we sized that in terms of incremental capacity. I thought... Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : That's 90,000 cabinets. Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : How many? Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : 90,000 cabinets. Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer : And so I think that's the \u2013 that's what we have. We'd have to go back and confirm that, but that's the number, I think. And then you can sort of estimate the CapEx for that by giving a rough CapEx build-out cost that we have on a per-cabinet basis, and that will give you an order of magnitude of what that would take. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : And I would just add, the one thing I'd just say, at the Analyst Day on that particular point was if you think about cost to build out that capacity, as Charles referred to, that was embedded in the underlying model that I shared with everybody or the cash flow model and how we would still be fully funded investing in billion dollars plus a year to build out that cabinet capacity to give us the growth that we felt that we would need as we look into 2020 and potentially beyond. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks very much. Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer : Great. Katrina Rymill - Vice President-Investor Relations, Equinix, Inc.: Great. Well, thank you everyone. That concludes our Q2 call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for joining. All parties may disconnect at this time.",

Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We had a great third quarter, delivering record bookings fueled by significant growth in our cloud, financial and enterprise segments. We see a robust pipeline driven by strong global demand from cloud service providers and the broad adoption of hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of choice. Today, Platform Equinix offers access to more than 1,400 networks and 2,700 cloud and IT service providers, making us a critical partner for multinational enterprises thinking to re-architect their infrastructure to reduce costs, enhance their flexibility and optimize performance in an increasingly cloud-first world. As depicted on slide 3, third quarter revenues were $924.7 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 14% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis, above the top end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA was $420 million for the quarter, flat over the prior quarter and up 18% year-over-year on an organic and constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA absorbs an incremental $5 million of cash-neutral U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Telecity and $2.5 million of integration costs accelerated into Q3. Absent these adjustments, our adjusted EBITDA would have been at $427.5 million above the top end of our guidance range. AFFO grew 44% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. We are successfully cultivating and curating our digital ecosystems, which is driving healthy operating metrics across the board including firm MRR per cabinet, low churn and strong interconnection growth. We added 10 Fortune 500 customers this quarter including : Target, a leading retailer; and Aetna, a healthcare and insurance provider, and we now have penetrated nearly one-third of the Fortune 500 and a quarter of the Forbes Global 2000 companies. Our fastest growth continues to come from three region deployments, which now represent 55% of total recurring revenue, highlighting the importance of our global reach. Across all fronts, we are pleased with the volume, quality and diversity of bookings. We continue to capture critical strategic footprints and are leveraging our scaled global service delivery platform to process more deal flow than any other data center company. We are pressing our advantage to capture the next wave of demand, enhancing our go-to-market capabilities to win the cloud-enabled enterprise. Many new use cases are driving data center colocation for the foreseeable future, including the Internet of Things, next-generation security services, submarine cables, digital payments, wireless aggregation, as well as compute storage and networking trends. Our differentiation as a company and the mode around our business continues to expand as we penetrate these new markets and grow our global interconnection platform. I would like to next provide commentary on how our acquisitions, organic development and expanding portfolio of interconnection services are accelerating our market leadership. Starting with interconnection, interconnection revenue grew 19% year-over-year on an organic and constant currency basis. We now have over 188,000 cross connects, and this is the ninth quarter in a row where we added greater than 5,000 cross connects. We saw strong growth of connections to cloud through both direct cross connects and our Cloud Exchange. Our Internet Exchanges also continue to scale with provision capacity ramping up with 100-gig upgrades, which bodes well for continued traffic growth. Also this quarter, we rolled out our Internet Exchange in Helsinki, based on customer demand in this former Telecity site, expanding coverage of our Internet Exchanges to 19 markets worldwide. Another interconnection driver is the submarine cable industry, which is experiencing explosive growth driven primarily by exponential increases in data traffic consumed by the large cloud service providers and innovations in optical equipment, with more cable laid in 2016 than over the past five years combined. As a result, we're seeing significant momentum as their strategic partner in these submarine cable projects, and we have won edge deployments for 12 projects to-date, eight of which are active and four of which are in progress. Winning these deployments builds on our original vision of Equinix being the intersection point, where all the data bits flow, and these wins will drive even more traffic through our sites, flowing through colocation and interconnection services as networking cloud providers join the ecosystem. These multi-decade cable projects will help anchor our sites as the key interconnection points around the world and our wins include AquaComms, which runs from New York to London; Southern Cross Cable Network, which runs from California to Sydney; and FASTER, which runs from the West Coast of the United States to Japan. Our newest win is with Monet, a next-generation cable architecture owned by Google and three telecom providers, connecting the United States to Brazil, where our Miami IBX will service the U.S. cable landing station. The Monet deployment represents an industry first, deploying a submarine cable architecture together with an integrated cable landing station inside Equinix's network and cloud-dense multi-tenant data centers. This new architecture, which eliminates the need for a separate cable landing station, was developed to meet the needs of large cloud providers for speed, efficiency and open system design. Turning to acquisitions, we significantly extended our scale and reach with the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions in Europe and Japan, and are progressing well with integrating these two businesses to deliver more value to our customers. The Telecity business delivered solid financial performance in the quarter and were ahead of plan with our revenue and cost synergy targets, which includes customer cross-selling, while concurrently integrating our product portfolio and our pricing strategy. We are enriching the data center metro connectivity across our combined EMEA footprint, which was recently completed in London and is underway in five other EMEA metros. We're also pleased with the Bit-isle's progress and saw healthy bookings across the entire Japanese business in the third quarter. We see sustained interest in our expanded Japanese portfolio, and tethering the Equinix and Bit-isle assets together has allowed us to position all of the properties as part of a larger campus ecosystem. Turning to our organic development activity, we continued to invest and expand globally with 18 announced expansion projects underway. This quarter, we are moving forward with additional expansions in Dallas, Dublin, Frankfurt, Helsinki and Zurich totaling over $100 million of capital expenditures. We are also progressing with five major new IBX builds in Amsterdam, Ashburn, Frankfurt, S\u00e3o Paulo and Silicon Valley that will give us key capacity to satisfy strong demand and will expand our data center count to over 150 by mid-2017. In terms of our asset ownership strategy, we continue to acquire and develop land, building major new campuses on owned land in Ashburn, Frankfurt and Silicon Valley. This quarter, we also bought six acres of land next to our Chicago-3 IBX, which we'll develop over time to expand our Chicago Elk Grove campus, which has seen increasing demand from cloud and financial customers. These capital investments are delivering very healthy growth and strong returns as shown on slide 4. Revenues from our 70 stabilized IBXs grew 6% year-over-year, largely driven by an increase in cross connects and power density. These stabilized assets are generating 32% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested, and utilization has stepped up to 87%. Looking beyond the numbers, customers increasingly care about greening their supply chains, and we are working hard to reduce our environmental and carbon footprint by improving energy efficiency in sourcing of renewable energy. We are building in our position as the leader in our space and continue to make progress towards our long-term goal of 100% clean and renewable energy. Let me now shift and cover the quarterly highlights from our industry verticals. And I'll start with the networks. This vertical delivered strong bookings, a nice step up in revenues and meaningful new logo adds this quarter. Network service providers, cable operators and satellite providers are growing with Equinix as they shift their portfolios to address the enterprise demand for cloud, mobile and new digital services like the Internet of Things. Growth this quarter was led by strength in EMEA and Asia as wireline providers augment their infrastructure to support cloud connectivity and deploy new optical technology. Customer expansions included Orange Business Services, a global IT and communications provider, deploying a new cloud offering for enterprises, and Hawaiki submarine cable, a Trans-Pacific cable system between Australia and the United States. The financial services vertical achieved record bookings with over-indexing growth from the trading, insurance and digital payment segments as we continue to make progress in expanding our relationships far beyond electronic trading. We've seen minimal impact to-date from Brexit in our financial services segment with continued traction across Europe, including near-record bookings for the financial services segment in the UK. This quarter, we expanded with PayPal, an important customer in the digital payment ecosystem that is interconnecting to business partners to improve performance and latency and helps PayPal maintain seamless transactions through on-demand shopping anywhere in the world. We also expanded with insurance customers including Lloyd's, who is deploying a cloud-based risk modeling platform for the insurance industry as well as a Fortune 100 insurance firm leveraging connectivity to AWS for big data analytics. In the content and digital media vertical, advertisers, CDMs and digital media were the growth drivers for bookings, led by the Asia-Pacific region. Customer wins included Abbott Technology (12:10), a leading editing and distribution platform that is deploying Performance Hub to connect remote end users to its product suite via Azure, as well as expansion in the quarter from ChinaCache, Patayo (12:23), Tencent and Yahoo! as they expand their digital edges. The cloud and IT services vertical had its second best bookings quarter with growth in software-as-a-service and multi-region infrastructure as a service deployments. We continue to enhance our value as the home of the interconnected cloud by increasing cloud density and coverage of software-as-a-service providers and making it easy for enterprises to find and consume a broad range of cloud services. Our Cloud Exchange saw a strong adoption with solid growth in EMEA, good port orders and ramping traffic driven by over 540 enterprises, clouds and networks, using Cloud Exchange to interconnect. We continue to add cloud service providers across our markets, deepening our strategic footprints with anchors such as AWS, Azure, IBM Softlayer, Google and Oracle, and expanding new availability to specialized cloud services and security, unified communications and enterprise application test and development. Turning to enterprise, this vertical also saw its second highest bookings quarter, led by the Americas, and captured a record number of new customers with expanding penetration of the Fortune 500. Wins included a Fortune 250 food manufacturer embracing digital transformation, a top three auto manufacturer optimizing their network topology and connecting to Azure through Cloud Exchange, as well as J.B. Hunt, a Fortune 500 transportation company. Our Performance Hub solution continues to see strong adoption and more than 560 customers are using this solution to re-architect their infrastructure to directly connect their people, locations, clouds and data. And finally, we continue to build and enhance our go-to-market engine through both direct and indirect channels. We are improving our market awareness and lead generation capability through targeted programs and seeing strong results in creating a pipeline of highly qualified opportunities. We are seeing a steady stream of new customer adds, trending between 150 and 200 a quarter, with an increasing share coming from cloud and enterprise. We're also enjoying continued success in channel bookings which account for roughly 15% of total bookings over the past several quarters, with two-thirds of this activity from resellers who are amplifying our market reach and providing our customers with end-to-end solutions. So, let me stop there and turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Thanks, Steve and good afternoon to everyone on the call. As highlighted by Steve, Q3 was another very strong quarter across virtually all of our key operating metrics. We had record bookings with strong performance across each of the regions as well as our verticals, once again, reflecting the favorable position we enjoy across our marketplace. We delivered our 55th straight quarter of top line growth, the results of disciplined execution and we experienced another quarter of healthy margin performance resulting in strong flow through to AFFO from the underlying business. Revenues in AFFO were above our expectations, while adjusted EBITDA was at the low end of our guidance range, primarily due to cash-neutral U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Telecity. Absent these adjustments, our adjusted EBITDA would have been above the top end of our guidance range, consistent with our revenues and our operating performance. Looking at our other operating metrics, our MRR per cabinet yield continues to remain strong at greater than $2,000 per cabinet. We added 2,200 net billable cabinets and gross cross connect additions were a very positive 6,400 in the quarter. Note that all metrics have been normalized for the sale of our London 2 IBX, which was sold in early July as part of our asset divestiture process related to the Telecity acquisition. With respect to our acquisitions, Telecity and Bit-isle had their best bookings quarter of the year and we're making solid progress with our integration efforts. We're already enjoying the benefits of a number of cross-sell successes, while the depth of the sales pipeline continues to grow, and we're on track to achieve our targeted cost synergies by the end of 2017. The financial and IT system work is well underway and we've defined the critical initiatives to operationally integrate the back offices over the next 18 months. Specifically, as it relates to Bit-isle, we've integrated the business faster than originally anticipated, positioning the business to accelerate revenues and increase their operating margin more quickly than planned. We've also been able to sell their non-core assets sooner than expected. In October, we entered into an agreement to sell Terra Power, the third non-core Bit-isle business line, for approximately $78 million at current exchange rates. These proceeds, once fully received, will effectively reduce our net investment in Bit-isle and should make this transaction one of our best performing M&A transactions from a return perspective. And finally, we've now replaced the temporary Bit-isle bridge facility with a permanent debt facility, with an all-in cost of funds approximating 2%. Turning to foreign currency, post-Brexit news we saw the weakening of the U.S. pound and the euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Since that time, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen against most of our operating currencies, largely due to a view that policymakers will increase interest rates in the U.S. by the end of the year. Our current FX hedges have proven to be very effective during this volatile period; and as a result, despite some level of impact, we don't anticipate this to be meaningful to our Q4 operating results, largely due to our pound sterling hedges being placed at $1.54 to the pound. As we look into 2017, we've already hedged over 50% of the EMEA revenues in cash flows, and we expect our hedge position to increase over time as we continue to integrate Telecity entities into the EMEA business. So turning to the third quarter, as depicted on slide 5, global Q3 revenues were at $924.7 million, above the top end of our guidance range, up 3% over the prior quarter and 14% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis, reflecting positive momentum in both MRR and NRR revenue lines. Our global platform continues to expand in Asia-Pacific and EMEA, showing organic and constant currency growth on the same quarter compared to last year of 19% and 15%, respectively, while the Americas region produced steady growth of 11%. Our as-reported revenues include $147.1 million from our acquisitions, consistent with our expectations. Q3 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $1.9 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter and a $1.3 million positive currency benefit when compared to our guidance range. Global adjusted EBITDA was $420 million, flat over the prior quarter and up 18% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis. Our as-reported adjusted EBITDA included $19 million of integration costs. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA margins stepped down to 45.4%, lower than the prior quarter. Relative to our prior guidance, we booked an incremental $5 million of cash-neutral U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Telecity, as we refined our estimates during Q3. These adjustments included conversion of certain leases from capitalized to operating classification, which had minimal net impact to our AFFO metric. Additionally, we accelerated $2.5 million of Telecity integration costs into Q3. Our Q3 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges was essentially flat when compared to the average FX rates last quarter and a $700,000 positive benefit when compared to our guidance range. Global AFFO was $284.2 million, down slightly over the prior quarter. AFFO on a normalized and constant currency basis increased 44% over the prior year. Moving to churn, global Q3 churn was 2%, consistent with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect MRR churn to remain in our targeted range to 2% to 2.5%. Turning to 2017, we continue to expect MRR churn to range average between 2% and 2.5% per quarter, which includes elevated churn of approximately 3% in Q1 related to the final phase of LinkedIn's bifurcation strategy. I'd now like to provide a few highlights on the regions with full results covered on slides 6 through 8. The Americas region had its second highest bookings quarter of all time driven by our cloud and financial services verticals with ongoing strong outbound production and healthy yield. EMEA delivered a record bookings quarter with particular strength in the Dutch and French markets. EMEA continued to execute against its key business initiatives, including the integration of the Telecity business. As a reminder, revenue lost from the London 2 asset sale approximated $3 million for the quarter. Asia-Pacific remained our fastest-growing region with strong bookings in Hong Kong and Tokyo markets driven by cloud and IT and financial verticals. Interconnection revenues continued to outpace overall growth of the business with the Americas, APAC and EMEA interconnection revenues now at 23%, 11% and 7%, respectively, of recurring revenues, updated for the sale of our London 2 IBX. And now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to slide 9. Unrestricted cash and investments increased over $1 billion after taking into consideration the proceeds related to the EMEA asset sale, as well as funds used to purchase our Paris 2 and 3 assets. Our outstanding debt approximates $7 billion, a slight decrease over the prior quarter, primarily due to one of our capital leases converting to an operating lease. Our debt leverage ratio, net of unrestricted cash, was about 3.6 times, our Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA. Also of note during the quarter, S&P raised our corporate credit rating to BB+. We continue to aspire to be an investment grade-rated company, yet we'll continue to balance that aspiration with our objective to invest our capital with the highest and best-use mindset. Now switching to AFFO and dividends on slide 10. For 2016, we're raising our as-reported AFFO to now range between $1.059 billion and $1.065 billion, a 28% year-over-year increase, the results of our strong operating performance and lower-than-expected interest and tax expenses. AFFO on a normalized and constant currency basis is now expected to range between $1.182 billion and $1.188 billion, a 35% increase over the prior year. On a fully diluted share basis using our weighted average 71.7 million common shares outstanding, AFFO per share is expected to be $16.55, a 13% increase over the prior year. Also, today we announced our Q4 dividend of $1.75 a share, consistent with our Q3 quarterly dividend. Our AFFO payout ratio is estimated to be approximately 47% for 2016. Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to slide 11. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $279.5 million, including recurring CapEx of $41.6 million, consistent with our guidance expectations. During the quarter, we opened six new projects across our region at a much-needed capacity, particularly in EMEA, and currently have another 18 projects underway as we continue to see strong development returns across our new expansion and stabilized at IBX projects. And finally, we provided you a number of slides abridge our 2016 guidance from the normalized 2015 performance, including slides for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and the AFFO. Please refer to slides 12 through 15. I'll now turn the call back to Steve. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Keith. And finally, on slide 16, it summarizes our updated Q4 and full-year 2016 guidance, including the impact of FX changes. Now let me cover our updated 2016 outlook. For the full-year of 2016, we're raising our revenue guidance to now range between $3.609 billion and $3.615 billion, a 33% as-reported growth or organic and constant currency growth of 14.1% compared to the prior year. This updated guidance includes a negative $1 million FX impact when compared to prior guidance range. Net of FX revenue is stepping up $10 million, the result of our strong Q3 operating performance. For 2016, we are updating our adjusted EBITDA guidance to now range between $1.65 billion and $1.656 billion and organic and constant currency growth of 17% compared to the prior year. This absorbs an incremental $4 million of accelerated integration costs, $10 million of primarily cash-neutral U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Telecity, and minimal FX impact. We are pleased with the business' adjusted EBITDA performance and expect to continue to drive margin improvement into 2017. And we're raising our AFFO to range between $1.059 billion and $1.065 billion, a 35% normalized and constant currency growth rate compared to the prior year. This $17 million AFFO increase has negligible foreign currency benefit when compared to prior guidance and the result of strong operating performance and lower interest expense. And finally, we expect our 2016 capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion for the year. In closing, we are pleased with our progress this year as we continue to successfully integrate our acquisitions, grow our global platform and scale our interconnection services. Our digital ecosystems continue to thrive globally and the adoption of cloud services by enterprises is accelerating, driving new opportunities at Equinix, enhancing our operating metrics and significantly expanding our addressable market. We are focused on scaling and refining our go-to-market engine, directed at capturing the significant shift to the cloud and delivering continued profitable growth. So, let me stop here and we'll open it up for questions. I'll turn it back over to you, Sean. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our first question is coming from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is open. You may begin. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much, and good afternoon, folks. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Hi, Amir. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I was wondering if we could chat a bit more about sort of the enterprise adoption. You folks clearly continue to make progress, and I was wondering if we could dig in a bit here. What specifically are you seeing with respect to deployments? Is there a prospect for accelerating demand? I mean, you've named some fairly notable logos here. It seems as though this sort of land-and-expand strategy has been working in your favor, so I'd love to hear sort of your thought process around enterprise demand, and then I've got a quick follow-up. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Sure, Amir. This is Charles. I think there's definitely a prospect for accelerating demand at some level. We continue to see adoption from the top of the enterprise pyramid, in terms of people adopting hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of choice, and really hybrid cloud/multi-cloud, I think that's an important distinction. We're seeing them really embrace public cloud as a way to variabilize their cost structure and gain flexibility, but then also implementing hybrid cloud architectures that allow them to implement certain elements of private infrastructure where they see that as necessary and important from a performance and security standpoint. So, we've had great success with our Performance Hub product, which I think people are using for a number of use cases including WAN optimization as well as implementing the multi-cloud. And I think that we're continuing to see them really, really exercise that as the architecture of choice at the top of the pyramid. And I think what that's starting to do is roll down into their broader enterprise market opportunity as well, and we see that showing up in our channel, in particular, because our channel partners are now bringing a series of value-added services to perhaps smaller enterprise customers that are also viewing to adopt. So, yeah, we definitely see continued momentum and I think strong prospects going forward. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah, the other thing I'd add, Charles, is one of the data points I think we picked up in the quarterly reviews was, I think some 60 logos to 70 logos, I think the 65 new logos came from the channel that were enterprise-oriented, so the indirect activity that Charles pointed to is really starting to show up with our partners who are bringing full solutions to the enterprises with Equinix as part of that solution. So, it's pretty exciting, we're starting to see this really ramp as we predicted. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks very much. And then if I may, on the M&A front, it does seem like some of the assets that have been in the market for some time are closer to a successful sale based on, if you listen to what the folks who own those assets have been saying more recently. Any thoughts on \u2013 that you might be able to share on their relative attractiveness, whether there has been a willingness to separate the desirable assets versus the less desirable assets under their ownership? I know you guys have a lot on your plate at the moment with integration, but would love to hear your thoughts there. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. Let me \u2013 this is Steve. Let me start out there and maybe Charles or Keith would have something to add here. But I would tell you that we remain as we have in the past, very proactive and highly selective on any potential M&A here. We typically look at three critical factors when we look at any type of inorganic activity. One, does it scale our platform globally and give us more diversity of customers? Two, does the transaction enhance our interconnection and/or network density? And then three, does it help us capture the cloud enterprise activity that Charles just talked about? So, we're always looking for assets that fit those criteria, and I think you should expect us to continue to be thoughtful about creating shareholder value and extending this leadership platform that we refer to as Platform Equinix. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Steve, Charles. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Amir. Operator : Thank you, sir. The next question on queue is coming from the line of Mr. Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open. You may begin. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks. I wonder if we could start by talking about the progress on Telecity given the commentary on acceleration of integration. Where are you on integrating that into Equinix systems and getting those back to the company level of growth? Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Sure. Well, let me take the first part of your question, Phil. As it relates to the integration into our systems, a week ago, Monday, we actually finally rolled in UK business in \u2013 onto our operating platform, so now we have both the Dutch and the UK business into our eco-platform, which is basically how we continue to scale the business. Next will be Ireland and Sweden, they're already in the REIT structure, and once we get those two onto the operating platform, 70% of the revenues will be covered inside our platform. I think the most important thing to note is, as we acquire, whether it's Telecity or any business, the most important part is getting to the data and understanding what insight we can draw from that data, and so we're working very hard and diligently right now to not only grab the data, get it into our systems, process it, understand it and then execute against it. So that's where we are from an integration perspective. Suffice it to say, when you look at the overall business, as a company we said, look, we'll take revenues up slightly when we look to bid down Telecity on a combined basis. When we look at EBITDA, we're going to take it down roughly $5 million; but as you're aware, there's $10 million of accounting adjustments that are taking place this quarter, which are predominantly non-cash U.S. GAAP adjustments, conform their results into our results. So the business is performing as we anticipate. I think the next step really is, though, to leverage off what we said earlier on, which is continuing to enjoy the benefits of cross-sell and execute against our platform, yet at the same time make sure that we have sufficient inventory in the marketplace to support that. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. The other comment I guess I'd make is relative to \u2013 one of the critical pieces of how we view the integration and traction there is cross selling and how well we're doing in terms of cross selling, upselling, across the platforms. And I think we're actually well ahead of plan in terms of what we're seeing there. We're seeing a lot of energy from both sales teams. We've now fully integrated them into a single unified sales team. Probably seeing a little more traction in terms of the Equinix team selling into the Telecity assets, but that's probably to be expected. And I think we're starting to now get the former Telecity employees really fully up to speed on the broad level platform and seeing a lot of energy on that. And so that's another really critical litmus test I think and one that we've learned from previous acquisitions that it really requires a lot of attention, and I feel good about how that's proceeding as well. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : At what point should we think of those assets back to company-level growth? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Again, there's a couple things. Number one, Telecity assets as you know are more fully utilized than our assets. And so it's really about the combination of the two businesses on continuing to grow and prosper collectively. So, it's hard to say specifically what Telecity as an entity \u2013 when we'll get back to historical growth, because ultimately what we're doing now is selling across our platform. I think what's most important is recognizing that the integration process will be basically fully complete by the end of next year. We fully expect to get all of our cost synergies. We're seeing some opportunities where our revenue synergies are starting to realize, which is good. And again, we've got very little, if you will, dollars allocated to that in fiscal year 2016, but we're seeing many green shoots of opportunity. And then I think just overall it's the scaling of our platform across Europe not only as we take what assets we have today, but we invest in the platform on a go-forward basis with some of these 18 projects that are underway that I think will really make a difference. And you combine that with what Charles said earlier on or what Steve's talked about from the enterprise perspective, we're really excited about certainly seeing more momentum coming out of that specific entity, but it's really more about the collective business that we're looking forward to executing against. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you, sir. The next question on queue is coming from the line of Mr. Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Your line is open. You may begin. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : Great. I just had some quick modeling questions. One, you at your Investor Day stated you expected to do greater than $18 in AFFO per share in 2017. I'm just curious with the uptick in AFFO this quarter if that's still the right way to think about that? Secondly, when you provide your guidance for 2017 next quarter, I assume you'll give organic growth rate like you've been doing, but I just want to make sure that it's correct that Telecity and Bit-isle will be included in that new calculation? Then just last real quick, your European or EMEA business was a little bit lighter than we were anticipating, and I'm just curious relative to your expectations with the moving parts with LD2 and Paris, if there was anything there that's worth calling out that might explain maybe some of the differences we're expecting? Thanks. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Okay. So, let me take them one at a time, Colby. First and foremost, as it relates to an AFFO per share of $18 a share for 2017, we continue to expect to deliver that or better, consistent with what we said at our Analyst Day, despite what transpired this specific quarter. As we think about the planning for 2017 and the guidance that we'll deliver in 2017, no surprise to you as we continue to integrate the platform it really becomes one entity and less about organic versus inorganic. So, we fully anticipate in 2017 that we'll give you complete guidance that includes all three entities on a go-forward basis. And given the fact the cost structures are effectively integrated now or well on their way and we've sold off a number of our non-core assets in the Japanese business, I think it makes best sense to give you one holistic number on a go-forward basis that you will measure us against. And then as it relates to EMEA, absolutely there's a number of things that are going on in the business this quarter. If we're dealing with just top line, other things of course are impacting the business. First and foremost is the LD2 asset sale at $3 million. We get a little bit of a benefit from the Paris acquisition. And then currency, despite my comments that our hedges are working well. You still have the currency impact. Particularly as it relates to Telecity and as you might have recalled in my comments, only 50% \u2013 we only have hedged 50%. And the reason we only hedged 50% is until we can get the European entities from Telecity into our platform and in our structure and commissioner structure, any hedges that we place against the cash flow is below the line and not above the line; and as a result, you've got some deterioration as it relates to currency movements in the marketplace. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Colby, this is Steve. I think it's also critical that all of us on the call remember that, I mean, we're pretty fortunate with all the digesting of the activity that Keith and Charles are talking about in Europe that we had a record bookings quarter. So like the pipeline is strong. The coverage ratios are strong. So, while all this is going on with digesting this acquisition, we had very good performance of bookings this quarter. A record for that region. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : Great. Thank you. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Thanks, Colby. Operator : Thank you, sir. Next question on queue coming from the line of Mr. Michael Rollins of Citi Research. Your line is open. You may begin. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Going back to slide 3, there's a mention of margin expansion for 2017. I was wondering if you can give us a sense of how you're thinking about margin expansion in terms of magnitude? And how you're balancing that with some of the investments that you've talked about in the past to further some of the strategies around the enterprise, cloud and investing in new ecosystem opportunities? Thanks. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: So, why don't I take the first part, Mike, and then I think Charles or Steve will want to jump in. I think first and foremost, one of the things we wanted to do was certainly give you an indication that our aspirations and our intent is to continue to deliver improving margins as we come through this year and we look into 2017. I think that was the purpose of that disclosure on page 3. I think to tell you how much we're going do right now, that's \u2013 you'll have to wait until February for that one, because we're still working through our strategic plans and budgeting exercise for the year. Suffice it to say, we are looking at a number of different investment opportunities and as you've heard me say before, I think others have certainly said the same thing is a lot of times when we look at how we invest in incremental projects or initiatives, it's really about how do we find our highest and best use of our costs? And so sometimes it means that we reallocate certain cost in areas where we think it's a higher and better use of that capital. So, as we look into 2017, the team's working really hard not only to bend our cost curve, but also to squeeze out more opportunity to fund many of the initiatives that we're looking at that Steve spoke about and Charles has alluded to. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Charles, any other response? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah, Mike, again, I think the way we look at it is that our job is clearly, margin expansion absolutely a priority for us. But our bigger priority is really create durable long-term value for the shareholder. And so, where we think that we can make an investment that we think is going to create an enhanced ability for us to tap into what we think is a huge addressable market opportunity in front of us then we're going to make a balanced decision to do that. So as Keith said, we're in the midst of making some of those assessments now as to what that will look like for how we'll guide for the year ahead. We still have work to do. We're very pleased with our progress in terms of the evolution of our sales team to be a more capable solution selling enterprise sales team. We're really happy with how our channel continues to scale, but are continuing to look at investments there that are necessary. We feel like we're going to need to continue to evolve our service portfolio to really be responsive to the enterprise market opportunity. All those things are things that we'll look to make some balanced investments in. So, we definitely think there's built to scale and other reasons, opportunities for us to expand margins going forward and we continue to be committed to that, but we'll balance that really against long-term value creation. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Mike, I'll give you another dimension on how we think about it, but Charles is spot on with how we're thinking about that. We kind of put it into four buckets. We continue to invest where we can extend our market leadership around interconnection in our inorganic activity and getting that digested. Secondly, we're continuing to invest and accelerating, as Charles said, capturing enterprise. So there's a whole bunch of activities there with our channel and our innovation and our business development activities. Third, we're always seeding future ecosystems. So, our marketing organization spends a lot of time in the future areas around the next version of cloud where security's going to go, where FinTech is going to take us, where the Internet of Things is going to take us. And then lastly, Charles drives a lot of activities in the company to simplify ourselves for growth \u2013 systems, people, process, et cetera. So, that's the simplest way to think about where investment areas would go. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. I guess one other follow-up real quick. You mentioned your aspirations around investment-grade credit. You also discussed trying to find the optimal target leverage, I think, for the business. What is that range or where is that optimal level today? And as you're targeting more Fortune 500 businesses, do they care if you're an investment-grade, credit-rated company when they do their supplier analysis? Thanks. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: That's a great question, Mike. Look, we continue to expect that three times to four times net leverage position is appropriate for the business. Right now, there's a fair amount of cash on the balance sheet, as I said at the Analyst Day. And truly, I'll carry on that today that our cash will get consumed in the business, not only as we fund our capital expansion initiatives, but as we continue to pay our dividends and service our other obligations as they come due. That all said, as it relates to customer opportunities, I'm sure there are customers out there that would like to see us in investment-grade. It doesn't come across my desk. I don't think in my entire career, that somebody has not selected us because of our credit rating. But from my perspective, if that's important to somebody, I'm sure we can demonstrate why we are as good as an investment-grade company as anybody else. And so, I'm not particularly worried about it; but again, I think it is important for us to aspire to that and eventually get there, because as interest rates move one way or the other over some period of time, whether that is over a year or over the next five years, we certainly want to enjoy that lower cost of fund relative to some of our peer companies and the like. And so, our goal is to become investment-grade at some point but we're not going to compromise on our desire to grow the business on an organic basis and invest in our capital. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Okay. I would say that on balance, I believe our financial health and our balance sheet tends to work to our advantage in those situations relative to all the other options available to customers very frequently. So, I have not seen it work the opposite direction for us typically. So, we tend to be very favorably aligned in that. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks very much. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you, sir. The next question on queue is coming from the line of Paul Morgan of Canaccord. Your line is open. You may begin. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. Just as I look at the planned expansions for next year, you've got kind of looks like $300 million or so at some of your most densely interconnected assets like Ashburn and San Jose. And just kind of maybe see if you have any comments about what the visible demand is like there and whether the delivery at those particular assets could mean we'll see an acceleration of interconnection growth as those start to deliver just because of the particular assets that we're seeing. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Well, yeah, I mean, I'd start by simply saying that right now, we continue to see a very favorable supply-demand balance in the market. So, in fact, I think that many of the markets that we operate in, I think, would be on balance more towards the supply-constrained side of things. And we see a lot of opportunity out there. We see a very robust pipeline in our core sort of campus markets, which is why we've got builds going on in many of those markets. And as you noted, we clearly have a pretty significant portion of our total interconnection portfolio residing in those markets, and so they tend to flow through with interconnection demand in a very healthy way. So hard to calibrate that precisely, but I think it would be fair to say that we're continuing to invest. I mean, that's the reason why we see such healthy returns in those markets, and that's why we're trying to really allocate a larger percentage of our total CapEx portfolio to those markets. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just as a quick follow-up, maybe I missed it, but did you give exactly kind of what the non-cash adjustments for Telecity were that had the impact on the EBITDA margin? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah, Paul. The majority, they're all sort of predominantly lease-related. There's one, as I mentioned, the larger one that affected the results was a capital lease entered. Our debt went down conforming to an operating lease treatment. And then there's a number of other, what I call acquisition-related adjustments, that's the biggest area. there's a few other what we call conforming areas where we've taken Telecity's operating policies and procedures and conforming it to Equinix's standards, such as bad debt and sales allowance, deferred installation and the like. And so for all those reasons, as we come to the closing out period of the Telecity acquisition and finalizing their results into us, it's important to recognize that these small adjustments that take place during that period. The lion's share of them, of course, as you would expect, is around leases, and lease accounting. And hence, why there's really no meaningful impact to AFFO, it's really just moving cost from one bucket to the other, if you will. And therefore, it doesn't affect AFFO or AFFO neutral. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, sir. Next question on queue is coming from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Your line is open. You may begin. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I just had a question on the undersea cable projects that appear to be accelerating globally. Clearly, you've had good success in terms of winning those bids, but I'd like to hear how you're thinking about those wins in terms of strategic importance versus maybe the direct revenue impact from those cables landing in your facilities. Just trying to figure out if this initiative is mostly about enhancing your magnetism around the cloud and content providers or whether you think there's a more direct kind of immediate growth impact? Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah, sure. This is Steve. Let me start, maybe Charles you can chime in here. First, a little context. I think we've mentioned just a couple times, that we are staring at somewhere near the magnitude of 50 projects around the world of which today we've \u2013 as we told you on the script today, we've had 12 wins, 8 are in operation, 4 are under construction. These are all around the world and these are as we've stated in the past, where the technology has advanced to the point where our data centers are located in so many locations there accessible to these cable landing, that the regeneration points they used to have to do when they hit land they can take them straight inland now to an Equinix facility. So, we're working with the suppliers of the cable. We're partnering with them. We're working with the funders of these big cable projects and we're treating it as, like we would any other pursuit. And we want more of that traffic and it's being, these things used to be funded by the big networks years ago. Now they're being funded by the big cloud providers, because they are getting ready for all the cloud traffic that's going to traverse the world. And as we said today we want, the premise of the company is to get more bits of traffic flowing through these data centers. It will pull colo, it will pull interconnection, it will give us several advantages here. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. And there's ripple effect I think in that there is, we would definitely consider these consistent with our ecosystem strategy which is, identifying critical magnets that will create sort of vibrancy in the ecosystems that we're targeting. And particularly now as these sub-c projects are being sort of executed and funded not only by the traditional telecom community, but now by the hyper-scale cloud players. We believe that getting these strategic wins is important to the continued evolution of these ecosystems. And so while they will have a direct and positive financial impact, we think that the broader ecosystem story is really the key part of it. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just one follow-up on the margins, I'd like to hear, I don't know if you gave us an update, but the prior target for 100 basis points of margin improvement in the kind of core Equinix business, just like to hear how you're tracking against that goal year-to-date? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: It's a great question. I think when we started the year, we were looking at basically, fiscal year 2015 was 46.7%. As we reported last quarter, we thought we could do a full 100 basis point improvement. With these adjustments, which are 30 basis points we're now looking at again on a normalized margin of roughly 47.4%. So, slightly impacted by these adjustments; but again, as you know, we're really focusing on cash on cash delivery in the business. And there's no impact to AFFO at this juncture. But, it is a slight deterioration in the margin. And as we look forward to the fourth quarter, clearly we want to continue to drive margin \u2013 continue margin into the business. If you take out the acquisition-related costs in integration, we're close to 48%. And again, that's a great position to sort of end the year at as we start to think about fiscal year 2017. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, sir. Next question on queue coming from the line of Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. You may begin. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. I've got two quick international questions and then one related to EBITDA. So, on slide 7 for EMEA, I wondered what would the cross connect number be? You list 46,000 and change, but what would that number look like if you were to included Telecity now that you've owned the asset for a time and presumably understand that situation a little better? And then on Asia, I was just interested in China. You've talked about the opportunity there and with plans to maybe enter Beijing. It doesn't appear on your tracking sheet at this point. So, at what point do these sorts of things appear on the tracking sheet that you have contemplated for the future? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: So, Jon, let me take the first one. I think Steve, Charles will take the second one. As it relates to the cross connects, certainly as we \u2013 one of the main things that we have to do when we integrate one company into our platform is get a good handle on the data bit. And understanding exactly what the inventory is, whether it's a cabinet, whether it's a cross connect or power circuit. That's an evolving exercise, as you can appreciate. So, we'll move both the Dutch business and the UK business on the platform, but we're still in the process of making sure that we've clearly understood what basically the unit of measures are. And as a result, it's premature to tell you what the cross connects are. Suffice it to say, though, it would be meaningfully higher than what we're seeing here. Telecity historically had said some \u2013 had given some numbers in the marketplace. We want to step away from those numbers, but knowing that they are \u2013 there's a meaningful step up in cross connects, if we take the inventory that we see today and apply it to our unit count. That all said, I also want you to understand though that Telecity didn't \u2013 they didn't really monetize those assets in a way that would be consistent with Equinix. And hence, I think that's the opportunity that we all see in front of us. Is there an opportunity to over some period of time take the cross connects, add more value to the assets by tethering them together and then being able to monetize that with our customers over some period of time? But rest assured, it's a number that we want to give you. We're just not at a point that we can at this stage. But over the not too distant future, you'll be getting some input on that number. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: And then Jonathan, this is Steve. On the China update \u2013 no new update today on activities with our partner. We're working pretty hard with our partner in Shanghai and looking to expand that to \u2013 up north to Beijing. But I would tell you that that's \u2013 most of that activity is going to be a 2017 discussion. There's a lot of work going on today that's bringing the big Internet companies out of China into Europe and the U.S. and so our team's very busy with export stuff coming out from the Baidus and the Tencents and the Alibabas. But going deeper into China, our first half there is to get more capacity in Shanghai and then find our way into the next big market. And you'll hear more about that as we move into 2017. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. And then maybe for Keith. Do you anticipate any further one-time impacts to EBITDA related to integrations underway over the next couple of quarters? Or is that \u2013 most of this behind you? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Hi. Well, it's a good question, Jonathan. I think as it relates to what we're doing right now, this is bringing us to Q3. Without getting into the dynamics of purchase accounting you really have to complete the majority of, if not all of your acquisition entries by fourth quarters end. So the fourth quarter theoretically would be the time line that we basically would have locked down all the financials and conformed them (57:44) standards. So theoretically, there could be some adjustments in Q4. We are not guiding to them. We don't see any, but I just wanted you to know that, that could take place. Any adjustments post that, unfortunately, will run through the financials in a very discrete way. And certainly, we'd share that with you at a point in time. But as we stand here today, there is no other meaningful planned adjustments to their books or records at this point. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, sir. Next question on queue coming from the line of Mr. Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. You may begin. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks very much. Yeah, Keith, just to follow-up to that question. What about integration costs? You accelerated some of those this quarter, so how should we think about integration costs in Q4 and beyond? And talking about the balance sheet and investments, what's the latest thinking on owning real estate? Do you see any opportunities to increase that proportion of your portfolio over the next year or so? Thanks. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah, Simon. So in our abridged pages, which eventually I'm sure you'll digest them, you'll see that we've earmarked roughly $17 million of integration costs for Q4. That will bring the total year up to $59 million. That is $4 million higher than we originally anticipated for the year; but at this point in time, because we also have costs earmarked for 2017, we think that we're actually not going to increase that in 2017. In fact, as we stand here today, I think we would reduce it by a $4 million all else being equal. And so right now, the overall project is consistent, the overall integration plan, I should say, is consistent from a dollar perspective. As it relates to acquisition of other property, both raw land, if you will, and then also the land underneath the IBXs that we operate today, we're always looking to acquire those property. Charles alluded to a number of acquisitions that we've made as of late, whether it's the Silicon Valley land, the DC land, Chicago. There's Frankfurt. Some of the land lease arrangements will made in Amsterdam and London. We are actively as a company trying to acquire more property where we can to enhance our campus; but at the same time control more of our revenue from an owned perspective. Right now, our revenue at least on an organic basis with the owned assets is 39%. On a consolidated basis, it's roughly 35%. We want to see that number up, and our stated objective \u2013 we'd love to see it around 50%. I don't know if we can get there or when we can get there, but certainly that's our objective is to own more and more of our properties. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Next question on queue coming from the line of Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Your line is open. You may begin. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. I want to discuss the bookings. Can you characterize those relative to what you've seen in last 12 months? So, maybe the types of customers and the rates you're seeing and the length of contract? And how has that changed in the last 12 months versus what it's been in the past? Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Charles, do you want to take that? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Sure. Yeah, again, we had a very healthy quarter. I think that we \u2013 every quarter's a little different in terms of whether or not we see any kind of large footprint activity, and so we did see a bit of that in Q3. We do see a healthy pipeline right now of cloud activity both on the larger footprint size as well as more in the traditional sweet spot. And then, of course, we're seeing continued strength in enterprise demand. So again, we had records in several of our verticals and near records in the others. So really good strength across the verticals. I would say that we're really hitting our stride in terms of being able to generate higher numbers of sort of sweet spot deals and really accelerating the amount of business we can do in each quarter. From a rate perspective, I think we're seeing solid pricing trends across our geographies and really hitting the sweet spot in terms of some of these enterprise-use cases around Performance Hub, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, et cetera, and I think that's a lot of what's driving the bookings momentum at this point. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Katrina Rymill - Equinix, Inc.: Great. Thank you. That concludes our Q3 call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

In the interest of wrapping this call up in an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to just one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Katrina and good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. 2016 was a pivotal year for Equinix. We're capturing a shift to the cloud, expanding our global reach and scale, growing interconnection and delivering increasing shareholder returns. We are operating at the intersection of some of the greatest technology trends in our lifetime. The digital transformation driven by cloud services is shifting compute, storage and networking to the edge, which plays into our core advantages created by dense digital ecosystems and our global scale. Cloud is a major driver of our business and in 2016 we strengthened our momentum in capturing the cloud-enabled enterprise, positioning ourselves for continued success in this critical area. We are the market share leader in the vast majority of our 41 markets and we're scaling significantly faster than our peers. We've invested over $17 billion in capital in our platforms since our founding with over $10 billion in acquisitions, including the Verizon assets, and the degree of difficulty to replicate what we've built is extremely high. Interconnection today is more important than ever. With our Telecity acquisition, we now have over 230,000 cross-connects and the leading position in the Internet exchange market, further demonstrating the strength and power of our interconnection platform. We capped the year off by entering into a definitive agreement to purchase 29 Verizon data centers, increasing capacity in many of our key markets in North America and South America, further enhancing our interconnection density, and accelerating our scale and relationships in the government and energy sectors. Without a doubt, 2016 was a banner year and positions us to continue to deliver on the promise of Platform Equinix as the place where opportunity connects. Our differentiated platform continues to drive our financial performance and we delivered another year of record bookings activity. As shown on slide three, we generated over $3.6 billion of revenue in 2016, up 14% year-over-year on an organic and constant-currency basis. We delivered over $1.65 billion of adjusted EBITDA, continuing to strengthen our margins while investing significantly in the business and expanding our addressable market. This drove AFFO growth of over 35% year-over-year on a normalized and constant-currency basis, exceeding our prior guidance. For the fourth quarter, we had a great finish to the year, delivering our best-ever bookings with particular strength in enterprise, a key point of focus for the business. We added seven Fortune 500 customers this quarter, including a global clothing and accessories retailer and multi-national food manufacturing company and an American oil and gas operator. We've now captured over one-third of the Fortune 500 and a quarter of the Forbes Global 2000 companies and are seeing significant land and expand behavior with these critical lighthouse customers. We saw our highest growth coming from three region deployments as customers leverage our unparalleled geographic reach. This quarter, over 56% of our revenue came from customers deployed globally across all three regions and over 82% from customers deployed across multiple metros. Next, I'd like to provide more detail on our interconnection services and review acquisitions and organic development. Starting with interconnection. Interconnection revenues grew 21% year-over-year on an organic and constant-currency basis, significantly outpacing colocation revenues. The Telecity acquisition brought us a number of interconnection rich sites and we're now including in our count approximately 35,000 cross-connects from Telecity. As the Telecity business converts to our IT systems platform through 2017, we'll continue to refine this count and we expect these sites will continue to contribute additional cross-connect and interconnection revenue growth. We also saw adoption of our cloud exchange with robust growth of ports, virtual circuits and traffic and now have over 625 customers using this platform to facilitate hybrid cloud as the architecture of choice. Our Internet exchanges also saw healthy growth in the quarter, with considerable provision capacity and traffic, fueled by strong underlying demand trends. Turning to acquisitions, in 2016, we significantly extended our scale and reach with the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions in Europe and Japan, and we closed out the year ahead of plan with our synergy targets. We're making great progress with our integration efforts around these assets, and are excited about the go-forward potential for 2017 growth and beyond. We continue to be active on the M&A front, including the recent purchase of an additional data center in Slough, west of London. This facility is in close proximity to Equinix's existing Slough data center campus, and will help meet growing demands for digital infrastructure connectivity in the United Kingdom and Europe, while allowing us to redeploy CapEx to other key markets. The transformative acquisition in 2017 will be our $3.6 billion acquisition of Verizon's U.S. and Latin America data center portfolio, which we expect to close midyear. This is a unique opportunity to expand our Americas presence with network and enterprise-rich assets, and add core strategic hubs, including Miami's NAP of the Americas and the Culpeper campus in Virginia, which has significant traction with government customers. We expect this to be a great acquisition for us, adding scale in new markets, combined with cash flow generation that will be accretive per share on day one, excluding our anticipated transaction and integration costs. With the expected completion of the Verizon asset acquisition and including our recently-owned open data centers, Platform Equinix will stand across now 179 data centers, 44 metros in 22 countries. Turning to our development activity, we continue to invest and expand globally, putting to work over $1.1 billion in CapEx in 2016. We have 19 announced expansion projects underway, as we respond to strong supply demand conditions across all of our operating regions. This quarter, we are moving forward with five additional expansions in Amsterdam, Chicago, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, and Toronto, totaling $175 million of capital expenditures. Through expansion on owned land and selected purchase of assets, we continue to increase our asset ownership, advancing toward our target of over 50% of revenues from owned assets. This quarter, we bought our Rio de Janeiro 2 facility in Brazil, as well as our Amsterdam 7 facility in the Netherlands. With the Verizon asset acquisition, where the majority of the data centers are owned, revenues from owned assets will move up to 40% by midyear. Our capital investments are delivering very healthy growth and strong returns as shown on slide four. Revenues from our 70 stabilized IBXs grew 5% year-over-year, largely driven by increasing cross-connect and power density. These stabilized assets are generating 32% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested and utilization remained at 87%. In the coming quarters, we'll expand this tracked metric to include additional stabilized data centers from Telecity and Bit-isle. Now let me cover quarterly highlights from our industry verticals, starting with the networks. This vertical experienced substantial bookings growth led by the Asia-Pacific region, with expansions across wireline and wireless providers, including BT Global Services, Comcast, CenturyLink, China Unicom, Orange Business Services, and Verizon. We continue to nurture and expand our network ecosystem with a focus on cable operators, satellite and wireless providers, as they invest in their infrastructure to address demand for cloud, mobile and digital services. We also are maintaining significant momentum as a strategic partner with new submarine cable projects, and are winning additional edge deployments. The financial services vertical experienced strong bookings, led by the Americas and our diversified penetration of this vertical beyond electronic trading into banking, wealth management and insurance. The insurance sub segment continues to see strong growth, with three of the top five insurance providers expanding with Equinix this quarter. Growth with these providers is being driven by a shift to cloud-based self-service, risk analytics being distributed to multiple locations, and requirements to manage distributed data due to privacy and regulations. Beyond insurance, key wins included AmeriHome Mortgage, a top-15 U.S. mortgage company, using interconnectivity solutions to provide low latency resiliency, Boeing Employees Credit Union, a financial cooperative, and Eton Park Capital, a global investment firm. In the content and digital media vertical, growth was led by the advertising and CDM segments. We continue to nurture and expand the advertising exchange ecosystem globally, adding premier ad-tech companies such as Index Exchange. We are also capturing traditional media and entertainment players, making the digital transition \u2013 helping them make the digital transition, winning new disruptive entrants that provide over-the-top content and capturing key deployments with large broadcast companies and streaming media solution providers. The cloud and IT services vertical achieved solid bookings buoyed by our performance in Europe. We are building our position as the home of the interconnected cloud by increasing cloud density with the major infrastructure-as-a-service players, such as AWS, Microsoft, IBM SoftLayer, Google Cloud Platform and Oracle, who on average have a presence across 15 markets with Equinix and continue to grow. In addition, software-as-a-service providers are now joining our cloud exchange to provide the performance and security benefits of private interconnection to their customers and this year, Salesforce.com, SAP and ServiceNow are deploying across multiple markets. Security SaaS providers are also offering their services on cloud exchange, including F5 and Incapsula as well as unified communication providers including BlueJeans, RingCentral and others. Turning to the enterprise, this critical growth vertical achieved record bookings, led by Asia-Pacific and three-region deployments. We captured new enterprises that are embracing interconnection-oriented architectures by redesigning infrastructure to directly and securely interconnect their people, locations, clouds and data. Wins included Philips, a global 400 manufacturer connecting to AWS, Azure and SoftLayer in multiple locations, as well as expansions from Walmart, who is further investing in ecommerce by optimizing its network topology connecting to Azure via our cloud exchange. And finally, we continue to enhance our go-to market engine through both direct and indirect channels. We are steadily adding between 150 and 200 new customers a quarter with cloud and enterprise accounting for two-thirds of these adds. We now have over 8,500 customers and expect growth in enterprise wins to significantly expand this number over the coming years. Our channel program now accounts for roughly 15% of total bookings with two-thirds of this activity from resellers. In 2017, we will focus our channel efforts on driving greater partner productivity through program simplification, enhanced partner activation efforts and joint offer creation, targeted largely at the massive market for the cloud-enabled enterprise. So let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Keith? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone. As Steve highlighted, we're very pleased with the overall performance of the business and our momentum sets us up nicely for 2017. We're tracking well against the expectations laid out at the 2016 Analyst Day, seeing healthy revenue growth, improving adjusted EBITDA margins and strong flow through to AFFO. I'll start my prepared remarks with a review of the full-year 2016 and then offer some high-level commentary on 2017. Then I'll toggle to our acquisitions and finish with some fourth quarter highlights. So starting with revenues, we reported revenues of over $3.6 billion for 2016, a greater than 14% year-over-year organic and constant-currency growth rate, as we benefited from our global reach and scale and our healthy interconnected ecosystems. For 2017, we expect to deliver normalizing constant-currency growth of greater than 11%, which now includes the slower growing, yet highly-accretive acquisitions in our run rate. As I stated, we will enter 2017 in a very strong position and we expect to deliver higher levels of bookings and strong incremental revenue in the year compared to 2016, after adjusting for the LinkedIn churn. Switching to foreign currencies. FX remains volatile and the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen against many of our operating currencies, resulting in a net $86 million headwind to our as-reported growth in 2017. Our current FX hedges have proven to be very effective during this volatile period, meaningfully offsetting an otherwise even larger headwind. For 2017, we've already hedged over 55% of our EMEA revenues and cash flows, and we expect our hedge position to increase over the year, as we continue to integrate Telecity entities into our EMEA business. In 2016, we improved our normalized and adjusted EBITDA margin to 47.5%, an 80 basis point improvement over the prior year, making progress towards our long-term 50% adjusted EBITDA margin target. We expect to deliver additional margin improvement in 2017, yet we continue to invest in growth initiatives, while maintaining appropriate discipline to scale the business opportunity in front of us. For 2017, we expect our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins to be 47.6%, excluding integration costs or 46.8% on an as-reported basis, which includes $16 million of higher utilities and property taxes in the EMEA region. For 2016, our normalized AFFO, which excludes the impact of the Telecity FX loss and the integration costs was $1.196 billion, significantly higher than expected for the year. Looking-forward on a normalized and constant-currency basis, 2017 AFFO is expected to grow 13% over the prior year, reflecting strong flow through from adjusted EBITDA to AFFO. On an AFFO per share basis for 2017, we expect to deliver $18.07 per share on a normalized basis, or $17.19 per share on an as-reported basis, which includes the negative carry from our December financing, the FX headwinds, our integration costs, but that does not yet include the benefit expected from the Verizon asset acquisition. We have assumed a weighted average 72.7 million in common shares outstanding on a fully-diluted basis. Looking at 2018, including the full-year benefit from the Verizon asset acquisition, we expect our AFFO per share to continue to show strong momentum. Let me discuss the acquisitions. We expect the Verizon transaction to be a highly compelling acquisition that will expand our market position across the Americas region. From a financial perspective, we expect these assets to generate an estimated $450 million in revenues for the first 12 months post close, driving adjusted EBITDA margins of 60% accretive to our current operating levels. As we move to close and integrate this deal, the increased scale and reach will enable continued margin expansion, while creating significant value for our platform as well as our shareholders. With respect to Telecity and the Bit-isle acquisitions, the integrations have gone very well, thanks in large part to our committed team and leadership. We're on track to achieve our targeted cost synergies by the end of 2017 with the majority of the cost savings already captured in the Q4 run rate. We are more than halfway through the Telecity integration having completed the integration of the Dutch, UK, German and Irish business units, and we expect to complete the remaining countries before the end of the year. As we enter into another busy year on the integration front, we expect to incur approximately $30 million in integration costs in 2017, which includes work to finalize the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, as well as $2 million of Verizon asset integration costs for Q1 only. Now turning to the fourth quarter. Q4 was another strong quarter of operating performance with revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO above our expectations. As depicted on slide five, global Q4 revenues were $942.6 million, up 3% over the prior quarter and 13% over the same quarter last year. On an organic and constant-currency basis, Q4 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $6.6 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used in Q4 \u2013 last quarter and a $2.5 million negative currency impact when compared to our FX guidance rate due to the stronger U.S. dollar. Our global platform continues to expand with Asia-Pacific and EMEA showing organic and constant-currency growth over the same quarter last year of 17% and 14% respectively, while the Americas region produced steady growth of 10%. Our as-reported revenues include $138.4 million from our acquisitions, consistent with our expectations. And note, on a going-forward basis, given the substantial integration of the Telecity and Bit-isle businesses, Q4 is the last quarter we will breakout this detail. Our MRR per cabinet yield continues to remain strong. We added 2,800 net billable cabinets and 5,500 net cross-connect additions in the quarter. And starting for the fourth quarter, our metrics now include MRR per cabinet and cross-connects for both the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions. Telecity adds 38,500 cabinets to the cabinet inventory at a utilization rate of 78%, with a slightly lower MRR per cabinet, while Bit-isle adds 6,300 cabinets at a 52% utilization rate. We will continue to refine these acquisition metrics as we complete our integration efforts. Global adjusted EBITDA was $436.5 million, up 3% over the prior quarter and 16% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis, despite the higher-than-planned commission expenses related to our record bookings this quarter. Adjusted EBITDA includes approximately $15 million of integration costs. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46.3%, a step-up over the prior quarter, largely due to the acquisition-related entries that lowered the EMEA's adjusted EBITDA in Q3. Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA performance net of our FX hedges had a $2.1 million positive benefit compared to the average FX rates used last quarter, and a $3.7 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates. Global AFFO was $294 million, up 3% over the prior quarter, largely the result of improving adjusted EBITDA. AFFO on a normalized and constant-currency basis increased 24% over the prior year. Moving to churn. Q4 global MRR churn was 2.4%, consistent with our targeted churn range. Looking at 2017, we continue to expect MRR churn to average 2% to 2.5% per quarter, which includes the elevated churn of approximately 3% in Q1 related to the final phase of LinkedIn's bifurcation strategy. As expected, LinkedIn churned 1,300 cabinets out of the Americas region at the beginning of the quarter, while retaining their interconnect-rich footprint at Equinix. The team is working hard to backfill the space with line of sight to a number of ecosystem-enhancing deals and we look forward to updating you on our progress. I'd now like to provide highlights on the regions whose full results are covered on slides six through eight. The Americas region had its second highest bookings quarter of all time, driven by our content and financial segments, with ongoing strong outbound production to the other two regions. EMEA delivered a record bookings quarter with particular strength in our German and Dutch markets and strong interconnection growth. On the cost side, we're seeing higher utility costs in the UK, offset in part by our energy hedges. Asia-Pacific had record bookings, remained our fastest growing region with strong momentum in our Singapore and China markets, driven by our network and enterprise verticals. Interconnection revenues continued to outpace our overall growth of the business. The Americas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA interconnection revenues all moved up to 24%, 12% and 8%, respectively of recurring revenues or 16% on a global basis. As I look in the balance sheet, please refer to slide nine. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet raising \u20ac1 billion in the fourth quarter. This debt raise not only partially funded the Verizon asset acquisition, but also allowed us to place a natural euro-based hedge into our capital structure. This euro denominated debt in combination with the $2 billion bridge financing, our unused revolving line of credit and the cash on the balance sheet provide us great flexibility to fund the Verizon deal. It remains our intention to raise both additional debt and equity to finance the Verizon transaction, while appropriately balancing our capital structure to maintain our strategic and operational flexible. Unrestricted cash and investments increased to approximately $1.82 billion, after taking into consideration the euro-based financing funded in early January 2017. Our net debt leverage ratio net of our unrestricted cash was about 3.5 times our Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA. Now switching to AFFO and dividends on slide 10. For 2017, we expect our as-reported FFO to be greater than $1.249 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase. On a normalized basis, AFFO would be greater than $1.313 billion, demonstrating the continued strength of our operating model. Turning to dividends, in 2016 we returned approximately $500 million back to our shareholders. Today, we announced our Q1 dividend of $2 a share, a 14% step-up over the prior quarterly cash dividend per share. For 2017, our projected total cash dividends will increase to approximately $575 million, a 17% increase over the prior year. We continue to believe that growth in our AFFO will be the primary ingredient for steadily growing cash dividend. Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to slide 11. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $386 million, including recurring CapEx of $36 million, above our guidance expectations largely due to timing of payments to our contractors, as well as an acceleration of spend in the EMEA region. During the quarter, we opened three new IBXs; S\u00e3o Paulo III, adding much needed capacity to this important Brazilian market; Dubai II, a smaller build in support of a critical cloud footprint; as well as Abu Dhabi I, our first data center in the new metro, as we expand our presence in the Middle East. And given our strong pipeline, our firm yield, and the healthy returns, we continue to invest in new capacity with expected 2017 capital expenditures to range between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion for the year. And finally, please refer to slides 12 through to 15, as these slides bridge the 2017 guidance from our normalized 2016 performance. So with that, let me turn it back to Steve. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Keith. Let me now cover our 2017 strategy on slide 16. To sustain our success and future proof our position, our strategic priorities are centered on pressing our competitive advantage to drive growth, and at the same time investing to catch the next way wave of market opportunity. We're pressing our positional advantage by capturing the cloud-enabled enterprise and extending our global footprint. Our initiatives will remain focused on building cloud density, creating and deploying innovative product solutions, and enabling the adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud. We'll continue to build out our position as a marketplace, hosting the on and off ramps to clouds and networks. We also continue to expand our market leadership globally through acquisitions. In 2017, we will focus our energy on successfully completing the integrations of Telecity and Bit-isle, and then shift our focus to Verizon mid-year. We will create future value through both organic and inorganic investments, and remain \u2013 and we'll remain disciplined in evaluating the strategic game board with a focus on emerging markets. Over the longer term, we are working to develop the next generation of interconnection and cultivating our existing ecosystems, while continuing to develop new ones by harnessing the technology disruption going on in the market. We are proactively conducting market-sensing activities with our business development resources in areas such as the evolving public cloud architecture, wireless and IoT edge computing, subsea cables, next generation security and storage and electronic payments. With over 6,000 Equinix employees, we continue to scale our organization and people. We are building a high performance culture paired with operational excellence and I continue to be very optimistic about our future. Turning to 2017, we expect another year of solid revenue growth, improving margins and strong flow through to AFFO and our guidance is summarized on slide 17. The growth, scale and the structure of our business are driving increased AFFO and ultimately cash flow and dividends. And we are well positioned for both a great 2017 and 2018 and beyond. So, in closing, we are pleased with our performance and remain confident that we can extend and leverage our market leadership to build large scale digital ecosystems that deliver compelling value to customers and exceptional returns to investors. We look forward to a busy 2017, as we integrate our acquisitions, grow our global platform, enhance our portfolio of services and increase our reach and relevance to the cloud-enabled enterprise. Our market leadership is driving strong financial performance and allowing us to invest in the business to capture emerging market opportunities and enable the innovation and adaptability to future proof this company. So let me stop here and we'll open it up for questions. I'll turn it over to you Kerry. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. So, I was interested in where things stand with respect to the Verizon deal approval and what are the major factors affecting the timing? Secondly, on EMEA for Keith I suppose, I was wondering about the Telecity cross-connect count and are you finished taking inventory or is that reported number likely to grow as a result of finishing the IT integration of more of the Telecity markets? Then, I've got a follow-up. Thanks. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Jonathan, I'll start. This is Steve. I'll start with the Verizon activity. So, we're on a very good pace collecting the information through the final due diligence. As Keith mentioned in his script, we're still aimed at closing mid-year and we still intend to go to the market to raise equity and debt and all the collection of the information we need on the financials is on track. So, we're exactly where we thought we'd be at this point. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: And Jonathan, let me just double back then on the second question. As it relates to the EMEA cross-connects, certainly as I said, we brought four of the larger entities into our systems, our platform, if you will, so there's a number of other entities or legal entities that we will be bringing in over time. I would tell you that this is a base we think that has the potential certainly to go up to the right. But we'll continue to update you as we layer in more entities into our platform. An example of that is France is not yet included and as you start to move across Europe, some of the small emerging markets are not included either. So we'll give you a further update as the quarters proceed. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then \u2013 and I was interested in this new logo capture, you mentioned a lot of interesting successes recently. And are there any trends that you're seeing in the legacy business or perhaps as a result of pulling in Telecity, Bit-isle or prospectively Verizon that would lead you to think the rate of growth in new logos would change at all during the coming year? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yes, Jonathan, this is Charles. I think we continue to see across the board really good strength in cloud and in enterprise, as we said in the script that that was about two-thirds of our new logo captures coming from those two segments. And I think that really represents with the state of the market in terms of hybrid cloud, multi-cloud really being embraced as sort of the architecture of choice. And I think what we're seeing is that certainly with Telecity, we have gotten a pretty significant uptick in customers, we're cross selling those to the broader global platform, and you really continue to see good strength in enterprise across all three operating regions. In fact, as we noted, we had record enterprise bookings. So, we expect that momentum to continue very \u2013 the hybrid cloud trend is very, very, strong and pronounced and we feel good about that. And then \u2013 and cloud is also continuing to be good and (32:57) we see that not only in terms of the revenue growth that's coming from cloud service providers, but also new logo capture in that area, which we're really pleased with. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Jonathan, the only thing I'd add on the new logos, we are seeing \u2013 the channel is definitely a feeder for us for new logo acquisition with that 15% of bookings coming from channel. It's generating new logos for us around the world and we expect that to continue also. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is now open. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the margins and are you seeing just the need to incrementally invest in some of these sales areas or in overhead as you continue to expand the company and is there a portion of this investment that might be one-time to 2017, beyond the integration expenses and the things that you flagged as sort of highly unusual for transactional purposes. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yes. Michael, so the \u2013 as it relates to the margins themselves, certainly there is a number of sort of things that are taking place in fiscal-year 2017. As we alluded to, so there is some modest margin improvement this year, but there is a number of investments we're making, some of it in growth initiatives and that's really about continuing to augment our sales force and that's an area of continued focus for us. Now the second area as I said, there are some anomalistic cost increases related to our European market, that's going to impact us by roughly $16 million this year. The other thing that is certainly worthy of note is, the level of expansion drag in the business has continued to scale. We had more construction projects and openings in late 2016 and into 2017 than we've had before and so that's another area that we'll continue to enjoy the benefits from as we rollout that inventory and start selling against it. And then the last piece is that, as I referred to the LinkedIn churn happened from day one in the quarter effectively and so there is always \u2013 there is a drag associated with that. And until we take that inventory, we said we have great line of sight into some great eco-enhancing opportunities \u2013 ecosystem-enhancing opportunities, but until we backfill that relatively significant churn event, it has a net drag effect in the business, so you could call it one-off or one-time. As we alluded to, it's a $6.8 million impact to the first quarter on a revenue basis alone and so as you can appreciate, because we haven't backfilled that yet, you're having a net impact against the margin profile. So those are the four key areas that I want you to walk away with. I think the most important thing that I would tell you is, as you think about Q1, obviously there is a lot happening in Q1. Number one, what's happening with currency, we've sort of earmarked that in our bridges. The second piece is the LinkedIn churn, as I referred to, again is relatively one-off and I think you'll see churn abate through the latter part of the year, but the other part is that we have costs that are incurred in Q1. There is $18 million of costs as we said that are very seasonal in orientation and when you actually take those costs, you infuse it in Q1 and then you think about what's going to happen for the rest of the year, by and large you're going to see SG&A relatively remain flat through all the remaining quarters and what that will tell you is, as our revenues continue to scale and we think that the net revenue contribution will go up quarter-over-quarter on a net setup basis, the margin profile and the EBITDA impact will be quite substantial as we go through Q2 through Q4. So again, there's some anomalies that are taking place in Q1, but we're very confident that we are in a very good position given our record booking position of Q4 that 2017 is going to be a great year for us and it'll be a nice entering into 2018 once we load in the Verizon acquisition. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Probably, Keith was just commenting on the sales force, Mike. The sales force expansion is probably in the order of magnitude \u2013 it's in the order of magnitude of 10% roughly the quota bearing head increase we're going to do this year, so we'll go from roughly 370 quota bearing heads somewhere into the 415 to 420 head count. So that \u2013 of that \u2013 one of the four things Keith talked about is that order of magnitude for the sales engine. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And just one other question, on slide 26 of the deck, you layout the same store organic performance. In particular, you focused on the stabilized assets as one category, and you show year-over-year collocation growing around 2%, interconnection growing around 15%. I was wondering if you could share just how much of that is price versus volume for those two categories? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: I don't know that I have that in front of us, Mike, but I would tell you that I think it's probably more driven by volume. I think that we continue to see unit adds into our stabilized assets as people continue to find additional interconnection and opportunities that they're going to get a lot of value out of. Pricing has been stable, and I think that we do have price increases that roll through across people's service portfolio both on space, power and interconnection. But I would expect that it is more driven by unit volume. And then we do of course have power is also a part of the increases in power utilization in those facilities, also add to that. So we continue to guide you in the 4% to 7% range, it sort of moves around a little bit based on timing of installs or churn that happened in those, but again, really strong performance, particularly in the interconnection line on the stabilized assets. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks very much. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Jonathan Schildkraut of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. Jonathan Schildkraut - Guggenheim Securities : Great. I'd like to dive maybe a little bit more on what's happening strategically, in light of the record bookings and the record bookings under the enterprise group. I was wondering if you might give us a little bit of color as to what's pulling those enterprises in, particularly as you talk about adding more SaaS to the cloud exchange that is, is it infrastructure, is that still the big drawer, or are you seeing more enterprises come into the data center in pursuit of some of the SAS platforms that you're setting up? And then sort of as a corollary, you mentioned that enterprise is very strong in Asia-Pac, and I'm just wondering if there is anything going on in that region in terms of cloud adoption that might be sort of instructive and helpful in terms of thinking about adoption in other regions of the world? Thanks. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Hey, Jonathan, it's Charles. I'll take first crack at it here and these guys can jump in as desired, but I think that we're really seeing this whole interconnection-oriented architecture and the thinking around that really resonate with the enterprise customer. There is a number of used cases that I think are leading the way, when we talked about in the past is WAN optimization, people simply being able to find a better way to skin the cat in terms of their wide area network in terms of both cost and performance by using our network dens facilities. And then, really the hybrid-cloud, multi-cloud value proposition in terms of that as the architecture of choice, and that may often start as simply a cabinet or two in a number of locations to gain high bandwidth secure access to public cloud, but then over time it tends to evolve to where they place private infrastructure immediately adjacent to that to begin to implement the private area \u2013 the hybrid cloud value proposition. And then, they begin to use cloud exchange to essentially take in new clouds to really take the multi-cloud element as well. So, we definitely see people, the number of clouds on average that they're consuming is increasing, and there is a strong evidence that we see in our bookings that are demonstrating that, and we see our \u2013 the analysts saying that they think that's going to continue to increase based on what they're seeing \u2013 hearing and seeing from CIOs. In terms of the geographic mix, honestly we're seeing pretty good strength of that across all of our geos and cloud adoption does vary a little bit. I would say in Asia, for example, you mentioned we are seeing it strong there. Australia is a bit of an outlier to the upside there. They tend to be a bit more innovative and out-front, and so we're seeing really good success there. Bit-isle has actually allowed us a lot more momentum in the enterprise segment in Japan and more feet on the street to call on them. So, all-in-all really just a strong reinforcement of the strategy around building the cloud-enabled ecosystem, capturing key strategic control points on the supply side and translating them into really strong momentum on the demand side with enterprise. Jonathan Schildkraut - Guggenheim Securities : All right. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Yes. I think that's absolutely right. I'd add one or two things to that, Jonathan, just I think as we've talked about in the past there is \u2013 a lot of companies we're talking to are re-architecting their IT from a centralized set up to a distributed setup and that's drawing them to Equinix because of our global platform, and so as they bring their apps and their data and their clouds and their network connections closer to users, we look very attractive to them. And now, we're even being pulled into more security and data analytics conversations, which again are crossing many, many locations closer to their users. So, I think the combination of what Charles said and some of the broader strategic implications of becoming more and more decentralized is playing into our hands. Jonathan Schildkraut - Guggenheim Securities : Great. Thanks for taking for the question, guys. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Thanks, Jonathan. Operator : Our next question is from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is now open. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks very much. I was wondering if we could unpack some of the moving pieces with respect to your guidance here. I noticed the commentary obviously in the bridge, the law of large numbers in the LinkedIn churn, but clearly when we think about Telecity and Bit-isle as contributors, when do you think they can get back to sort of core Equinix growth levels. And I'm trying to understand sort of the outlook right now as it relates to the bookings commentary that you mentioned in each of those regions and clearly there's strong activity in both of those regions, you now have an expanded footprint in both of those regions. And just trying to understand what kind of impact that's having in your near-term growth? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yes, Amir. Look it's a great question that you're asking. Certainly something we spent some energy thinking about. First and foremost, you have to appreciate that we sell against a platform. And now that you've got Bit-isle and Telecity fully integrated into our business, it's going to highest and best use of our assets. So, we're indifferent to where we actually put the inventory, is this going to be the right customer, right application, right data center, if you will. Having said that though, I think one of things that I think is important, let's use Bit-isle as the example. We said that for all intents and purposes, they'd remain relatively flat for a period of time because they're going through some elevated churn associated with some decisions they made prior to our acquisition. And so we are very comfortable at the low rate of growth that they're going to have knowing over time as we fill up, if you will, the Equinix organic IBXs, we would then sell into their platform. And so from our perspective, we don't have a lot of high, if you will, high expectations for Bit-isle on what they're going to \u2013 how they're going to get to our level of growth. What we know is we're going to again make sure it's highest and best use of our assets in the Japan market. But I'd be remissive if I didn't say though, when I look at whether it's Telecity or Bit-isle, the relative performance of those assets in our platform and our ability to go after not only the cost synergies, the potential for the revenue synergies, the abilities to defer CapEx, the tax line, and just overall the expansion of the platform, it's allowed us \u2013 it's put us in a position to be more accretive than we originally anticipated and a higher AFFO than we \u2013 that we originally thought we'd get to. Now, let me just flip to Telecity. Telecity in and of itself, again is roughly 78% utilized. We have to recognize that again it's a number of assets over many different markets, and so we're going to continue to focus on putting the right sort of customer application into the right data center. And so, to say that we don't worry about whether or not they get up to, if you will, our level of growth, what we're more worried about is highest and best use of the assets to drive as much shareholder value into that acquisition decision. And so that's how I'd like to leave it. Again I recognize, we sell a platform, a platform in and of itself is greater than 11% growth. And as I said, we're going to do more bookings this year than we did in 2016, and absent unfortunately the LinkedIn churn, we'd do more incremental revenue in 2017 and 2016 as well. And so it tells you that the platform is showing more momentum than we've seen ever in our past. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. I'd just add a little bit too in that I think that we are \u2013 one of things we've talked about is that we're ahead of our \u2013 what we saw as our cross-selling synergy targets. Again, that distinction is going to become less clear as we integrate and sell the global platform. But what I would say is that we feel a high level of confidence that our comfort level and knowledge and confidence around the assets in both directions in terms of people that were Equinix sellers now seeing comfortable selling the Telecity assets and vice versa, we're really have an increased level of confidence that that is occurring out there and starting to really figure out what the best location, best asset for particular customer workloads are. And so I think what we're reflecting in terms of our go-forward view is what we think is going to happen, and we think they're going to \u2013 but we're going to continue to gain confidence I think in selling that and continue to see strong overall performance from the platform. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's very helpful. And then if I can ask a follow-up question. Should we think about the strategy with the Verizon assets in a similar manner? I mean the numbers that you have provided, it's accretive in terms of the margin structure of those assets and as you look to utilize or fully utilize those assets, when it comes to a platform, is it sort of a similar thought process when it comes to monetizing that? Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Yes. And probably I think again a couple of things to note. Largely, the Verizon assets are in overlap markets, meaning many \u2013 there is only a couple of markets that are net new markets to us. But the \u2013 and so, I think what they allow for is additional capacity and additional assets that allow us to position in our growth markets where we already have sale force on the ground delivering. And that's a little bit different than Telecity to some degree, but I think a good reason that we would expect we'll get good momentum. And then a couple of specific big adders, which is really gaining strength with NAP of the Americas as a critical interconnection asset and as a gateway to Latin America, and we candidly, based on initial customer response, believe there is some pent-up demand there and people seeing our ability and willingness to continue to invest in that asset in Equinix hands, and we think that's going to serve us very well. And then the government opportunity that it represented in Culpeper, which I think will open up a significant incremental addressable market for us. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks very much for the incremental color. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Morgan of Canaccord. Your line is now open. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to ask a question about any of one percentage dilution from the law of large numbers in your 2017 revenue guidance. And I want to maybe see if you could put that in context with kind of what you talked about at your Investor Day in terms of your growth momentum through 2020. I mean it seems like, if you look at the same store revenue growth driven by interconnections that seems to be keeping pace, your CapEx is up year-over-year. So, a lot of kind of the drivers seem to be scaling. And so, how do I think about kind of that dilution from the large numbers? Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Well, Paul, if you can appreciate, we're dealing with a larger base. And certainly as I said, we're selling more, we're booking more, we have more incremental revenues. As I said, albeit it's identified separately on the bridge for you, the LinkedIn churn happened at the beginning of the quarters, $6.8 million impact to Q1 and $27 million impact to the year. All else being equal, clearly we're going to look to backfill it. I'm sorry, the other part is recognizing that when you think about the business in and of itself, the transition from the acquisitions of Bit-isle and Telecity into the base, obviously that had an impact. I said, this year we did organically \u2013 roughly 14.3% organic growth, when you actually look at Telecity and Bit-isle, you say you got to take that out and you look at, well I'm not going from 14% and really going from 13% to a number. But the law of large numbers also includes that in its base. And so, when you get to the scale that we're getting to and you have slower growing assets that get infused into the base, we'd be remiss if we didn't actually say, look just because of our scale, this is what's happened to the number. But I'd just go back to what's most important. Are we selling more? The answer is yes. Are we booking more? The answer is yes. Are we better positioned than we've ever been? The answer is yes and you couple that with, I think, our position, not only from a revenue perspective, but where we think we can take our costs over a period of time and how we can scale more cash into the business. Bottom line, I'm very comfortable with what we said at the Analyst Day and where we are on that journey, recognizing that \u2013 if you will, recognizing, I said, revenues will be greater over \u2013 on a compounded basis greater than 10% over that period. This year, we're saying it's greater than 11%. So, it is going to be greater than 11% all else being equal based on where we're sitting today. And so, we have confidence that we can continue to scale the business at the targets that we had set for the Analyst Day. And I think that puts us in a very good position by the time we get to 2020, particularly when you're throw on the Verizon acquisition and then you hear about some of the opportunities that Charles referred to where we think we can scale it at maybe a greater clip than what they were doing onto themselves. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. So, from a like \u2013 if you look at your same-store metrics that came up earlier in the call, is there any reason to think kind of where you ended the year, isn't \u2013 I know, you provide guidance to it, but a decent kind of run rate for 2017? Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: What \u2013 I just want to make sure, Paul, you're referring to what specifically? Are you talking about the...? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Stabilized assets? Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: The 5.5% increase, the 5.2% or the gross profit...? Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Yes, the slide 26. For example, 12% with expansions or 5% without it. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: As you know, these numbers are going to change quite dramatically by the time we get to Q1, because the number of assets that are going to stabilize and expansion is going to change a little bit. But if you just go back, you peel it all back. There is no reason to indicate why our stabilized assets can't continue to enjoy growth of, as we said, 4% to 7%. On a currency-adjusted basis, this quarter at 5% looks more like 6%. But that said, we understand that colocation tends to be slower growing, but it's the other services that we sell that augment the value of that 87% utilized inventory base. And so from our perspective, we think we can continue to fill up those stabilized assets. Of course, it will be at a different clip than the expansion assets or the new assets. But overall, when you look at across our portfolio, that platform that we get to sell into is second to none and again, we're always going to focus on putting that right application into the right data center, and if sometimes that means it goes into an expansion data versus \u2013 sorry, expansion data center versus a stabilized data center, then that we'll do that or vice versa. Again, we're very confident about the insight that we have on the business, the insight that we have in our pipeline and what we think we need to do to drive continued success into that portfolio. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Just a quick follow-up on the interconnection. How material is the cloud exchange as a driver and just kind of generally in terms of \u2013 what you're seeing from cloud-to-cloud and enterprise-to-cloud kind of abstracting from the network component? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Well. Yeah, I think it's beginning to become material financially, but it's significantly material strategically, and I think over time, it's going to be a major driver of how people consume and architect around the hybrid-cloud multi-cloud architecture. So, we are seeing \u2013 in fact I've been out in the field quite a bit this quarter, and sitting with both enterprises and cloud service providers, both hyper-scalers and sort of non-hyper-scalers, if you will, who really see cloud exchange as a tremendous opportunity to grab the aggregated demand of enterprises on the other side of that exchange. And so, we're really gratified by seeing what's happening there, the rate of growth of both port count as well as virtual circuits coming on to the platform. And I think, if you look at the scale of that platform already in a relatively short period of time, in terms of ports and traffic growth et cetera, we feel really good about it and it is beginning to become a meaningful contributor, but is a major piece of the strategy. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Well, Paul, this is Steve, also if you recall in the prepared remarks, we talked about interconnection revenues growing 21% year-over-year. We take the combined 10 quarters, 11 quarters in a row of cross connects over 5,000 net, add that to the cloud exchange comments Charles just made, add that to the Internet exchange activity we have, it's a major driver for the type of workloads that we're pulling in to these data centers. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : Great. Thank you. Two questions. One, on the Verizon transaction, I know you keep on saying mid-2017, I assume that means early third quarter, and I guess to that point I know there is a lot of talk about an equity raise I know that you know investors are focusing on that, is it logical to assume that you'd want to time that closer to when that deal's about to close? And then my second question, in your prepared remarks you mentioned the shift to the edge. And I'm just curious if you feel it like you have the right facilities in the right markets to take advantage of that shift or is that really a broadening of the strategy and it might take you to look at other potential acquisitions in the future? Thanks. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Do you want to start, Keith? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yes, Colby, I'll take the first one then I'll pass the other one to Steve and Charles. I think, as it relates to Verizon, again we're seeing midyear, again I don't have better color for you at this point in time of what that means. We're very working very hard to sort out all the conditions that we need to solve for. Suffice it to say, and as Steve alluded to, we're well on our way. There is nothing that causes us any concern. And so, whether you want to do a July 1 close or June 30 (57:22), it really doesn't matter to us from that perspective. I think what's most important for us, particularly in the financing area is getting the \u2013 it's a carve out, and because the carve out requires carve out financial statements, and this is a significant acquisition for us, the most important item or the gating item for us to getting to the financing markets is really getting those audited financial statements. As soon as we get those audited financial statements, we'll consider the market conditions as it relates to the data or equity market, and we will execute. But we're not waiting for the close. We're highly confident we're going to close this transaction. And so, the next step really is focusing on when to finance and how to finance it. We have good idea on the how, it's really just about the when. And that when is highly dependent on these financials, and I would just \u2013 stay tuned to this one. Again, we're \u2013 this is one of our most important areas of focus for the finance organization this year. And we're moving fast to bring this to an end. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: And Colby, let me start on segments. Steve may have something to add here, but I would say that, when we talk about the shift to the edge, we primarily are talking about moving to the enterprise going from what was traditionally a more centralized glasshouse type architecture to something more distributed where they're having to push infrastructure out to essentially interconnect with both their customers, as well as their vendors, employees, et cetera. And for us, a one man's edge is no man's core kind of thing, but for us it's generally \u2013 we're able to meet most of those demands today with our primarily Tier-1 market edge. Having said that, I think that we continue to look at selective expansion of that edge to continue to meet needs. We've talked about, for example, adding markets like in South Africa, a Seoul, et cetera to selectively increase the extent of that edge to meet demand. And I would say that's our near-term focus, and I think we feel very comfortable that we can capture and serve most of the needs of the enterprise in that regard, including by the way IoT aggregation, which we're seeing. Even though that's highly distributed, we're seeing our centers be a very effective sort of location for IoT edge aggregation, even though they're not all the way out towards the devices. Over time, I think we'll continue to revisit that and to the extent architectures and customer needs demand further push out, we'll evaluate that in the context of what that means for our growth and go from there, but I would say right now, we feel reasonably comfortable that our existing Tier-1 edge and some modest expansion to that is getting us a good chunk of the demand that we're after. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: The only thing I'd add, Colby, this is Steve, is that, if you think about our top 10 customers, which we've been very transparent with you guys are the largest networks and the largest cloud providers in the world, average 40-plus IBXs around all three regions in the world, many of their deployments with us are considered edge network nodes, edge nodes, cache nodes and so we're very in tune with the largest cloud providers and the networks, and where the edge of the network is moving around the world, including what Charles has said as it heads in the next wave towards emerging markets, and we continue to stay very close to that. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : Great. Thank you, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. I wonder if we could talk a little bit about the market environment and the overall competitive environment. I think, at your Analyst Day you were saying that you continue to grow \u2013 you expect to grow faster than the market. Do you have any comments about what the market trend is? And perhaps, a little bit more color on what's going on with competition, we've talked a lot about Verizon selling their data center, Sentry is being selling their data centers, we've definitely seen more consolidation here and I guess, winnowing out of some of the telco providers in particular. So what's going on that front, who are you going up against in these major markets and how does that evolve? Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Sure, Simon, this Steve. Why don't I start and then Charles, if you guys can add-in. From a market environment, we still tend to believe with all the triangulation of the market data we get from the industry analysts and other data points that still for our industry network neutral colocation are staring at high single-digit growth rates. And so when we put our operating plans together, we always try to build an operating plan that exceeds \u2013 that grows faster than the market growth rate. So it varies by market, we collapse it all together and our growth rates are always intended to take market share. So our belief is, coming out of the gate with greater than 11%, we'll continue to take share on top of the fact that we're spending more capital than anybody else in our sector. And so we feel like we're going to continue down that journey that we have been for several years. The competition on a global basis is very limited, it gets stronger as you get to the region and then it gets much stronger when you get to a country. And so our competition today varies depending on the requirement, if it's a global requirement, we're normally very, very well positioned. If it's a regional requirement, there is more competitors to step into a region like Asia, Americas or Europe. But if it gets to a country, there's even more competition for a requirement that's just in a single country. That's a high level way to think about it. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: That standpoint but (1:03:06) specifically, Charles. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yes. I'm going to add a couple of things. I think when you talk about share gains, there's always a question of share of what. I think that's a really important question, because we tend to be pretty selective about what portion of the market we are targeting and what deals where we believe we have a unique value proposition, where we're going to win workloads and customers with strong and high customer lifetime values. And I think that right now, we are capturing share particularly in this sort of premium retail segment. I would also say that candidly I think we're seeing increasing level of separation between ourselves and what most would view as our competitive set in part, because I think competitors are sort of going by the way side, the carriers are largely sort of moving away from colocation as a primary offering. And then, secondly, I would say a number of the competitors in what many would consider our direct competitive set are increasingly focused on the pursuit of wholesale footprints, which as you know, we're very selective about our pursuit of those. If there are strategic control points and we feel like we need to have them as part of the ecosystem, we'll go after them. But I actually think our competitive position is improving, because many of the folks that traditionally we brought into seem very focused on winning mega footprint from CSPs, which typically we see as very price competitive and not really particularly central part of the overall ecosystem story. So, we run into the occasional regional player, but I would say more frequently our key focus is on communicating our unique value proposition to the customer rather than winning a head-to-head battle in terms of competitive wins. And so, right now I think the competitive market is shaping up nicely for us. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Many thanks. Operator : Thank you. I'd like to... Katrina Rymill - Equinix, Inc.: Great. Thank you. That concludes our Q4 call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Katrina. Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I'm excited to share our 57th quarter of consecutive revenue growth, as we continue to capture powerful digital ecosystems at global scale. We see strong secular trends driving our business and are adding new customers at an accelerated pace, as enterprises adopt hybrid and multi-cloud as their IT architecture of choice. Cloud migration and data center outsourcing show continued momentum and we outperformed the market with share gains across all three regions. We also made great progress towards our $3.6 billion acquisition of Verizon's U.S. and Latin America's data center portfolio, which we expect to close shortly. We remain highly confident that this transaction will create significant value for both our customers and our shareholders, strengthening our market differentiation, and delivering AFFO per share accretion on day one, excluding transaction and integration costs. Turning to the results for the quarter, we started off the year with healthy bookings, fueled by strong growth in our global network vertical and continued enterprise momentum. As depicted on slide 3, first quarter revenues were $949.5 million, up 11% over the same quarter last year, on a normalized and constant currency basis despite the LinkedIn churn. Adjusted EBITDA was $427.6 million for the quarter, up 10% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis, consistent with our expectations given the Q1 seasonal costs. AFFO growth was 13% year-over-year, on a normalized and constant currency basis, the result of strong operating performance and lower than planned taxes and recurring capital expenditures. We added 11 Fortune 500 customers this quarter, all enterprise and financial services and continue to expand our traction with these critical lighthouse accounts. Our global platform is sustaining a strong growth momentum, with three region revenue deployments continuing to rise. This quarter over 58% of our revenue came from customers deployed across all three regions, up from 56% last quarter. Also over 83% of our revenues are from customers deployed across multiple metros, up from 82% last quarter. Interconnection revenue grew 18% year-over-year, on a normalized and constant currency basis, significantly outpacing collocation revenues. We continue our healthy pace of cross-connect ads and our ecosystems are now underpinned by 237,000 cross-connects and dramatic growth in our market leading Equinix Cloud Exchange. The business ecosystems inside our data centers remain at the heart of our strategic operating model, and are a significant differentiator for Equinix. We run the largest internet exchange platform in the market and have globally deployed greater than 4,000 ports delivering over 6.3 terabits of traffic per second, up 26% year-over-year. We also saw a strong adoption of our Cloud Exchange, which simplifies enterprise connectivity to major cloud services and networks. In the first quarter, AWS, IBM, Microsoft Azure, SAP and ServiceNow all expanded into new metros with Equinix's Cloud Exchange. We now have over 800 Cloud Exchange customers, including 150 that will be migrated from the former Telecity Cloud-IX platform. Turning to acquisitions, our acquisition of Verizon's 29 data centers will strengthen our global market leadership and create new opportunities as we build on these enterprise rich assets. Verizon will add over 600 net new customers, bringing our combined platform to over 9,500 customers and accelerating our ability to help companies extend their IT operations to the digital edge through the interconnection of people, locations, clouds and data. Enterprise and financial services firms represent one half of the revenues related to this acquisition and their customer base will add a number of notable global 2,000 customers to our platform. Pro forma for Verizon, we will now service over 40% of the Fortune 500 and gain access to a set of accounts with significant up-sell opportunities across Platform Equinix. The Verizon assets expand Equinix's total global footprint to 179 IBX data centers across 44 markets, comprising approximately 17 million gross square feet, further expanding our scale and accelerating critical relationships in the government and energy sectors. We also expect to unlock additional capacity to capital expenditure investments in these highly utilized assets with expected expansions in both Culpeper and Miami's not for the Americas as well as Denver, Houston and Sao Paulo. In the 12 overlapping metros, we want to enhance our value proposition by tethering our assets together as an early step in our integration. To support these newly acquired sites and sectors, we expect to bring on over 250 Verizon employees, primarily in operations and are excited to welcome these new colleagues to the Equinix family. In March, we further expanded our relationship with Verizon by announcing a global agreement to resell our colocation interconnection services enabling their enterprises to build hybrid cloud solutions and gain quick access to our multi-cloud environment. This agreement represents one of many exciting developments in our broader business development portfolio with our strategic partners and we look forward to updating you with further details related to these relationships in the coming quarters. Turning to Telecity and Bit-isle, we're pleased to report that the integration programs continue to proceed smoothly, with the majority of the integration effort largely complete. These acquisitions have positioned us well to capture the strong demand we're seeing in both the European and Japanese markets and are selling across the combined platform to capture this growth. Now, let me comment on our development activity. We continue to invest in response to strong demand and are selling incremental billing cabinets at a healthy clip. Our utilization rate is 79% and we have 20 announced expansion projects underway. This quarter, we are moving forward with three additional expansions in London, Paris, and Sydney, totaling $145 million of planned capital expenditures. Over 50% of our development is on owned land, and we expect revenue contribution from these owned assets to grow as we sell in these markets including Amsterdam, Ashburn, Frankfurt, London, and Silicon Valley. We continue to purchase additional land to fuel this trend towards owned assets. This quarter, we purchased 34 acres of land in Ashburn, Virginia, for approximately $35 million. These four parcels of undeveloped land are proximate to our main Ashburn campus, one of the world's most substantial interconnection sites, and will provide us room to build multiple new greenfield data centers that would add approximately 20,000 cabinets in this critical market. Our capital investments are delivering very healthy growth and strong returns as shown on slide 4. Stabilized IBX revenues grew 6% year-over-year on a normalized basis, largely driven by increasing cross-connect and power density. We have updated our analysis of new expansion and stabilized assets to now include Telecity and Bit-isle IBXs. Our stabilized asset count increased from 70 to 99, which includes 26 IBXs from our acquisitions, as well as three net-new IBXs from our annual refresh as more assets move into our stabilized category. These stabilized assets are collectively 82% utilized and generate a 30% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. Now, let me cover the highlights from our industry verticals and I'll start with the networks. This vertical experienced record bookings in the quarter led by the major telcos, who are expanding their capacity and capabilities for digital services such as OTT, cloud, and security as well as refreshing deployments with upgraded optical technologies. Expansions included BT Global Services, who is making major investments across EMEA for their core backbone network, and Colt Technology Services, a global telecom provider building out its new digital platform. We also are maintaining significant momentum as the interconnection partner for new submarine cable projects including winning our 15th project this quarter, which we'll announce details on in the coming months. The financial services vertical saw continued growth as firms broaden the use of Platform Equinix to accelerate IT transformation in their businesses. In addition to ongoing growth in electronic trading, we continue to make progress penetrating new segments including insurance and banking. This quarter Progressive Corporation, a Fortune 100 property and casualty insurance company, leveraged Platform Equinix to improve user experience for its employees, reduce network costs, and improve distributed data management capabilities. We also see other insurance firms such as Lloyds and Aon driving similar value by leveraging Platform Equinix. In the content and digital media vertical, it saw its strongest revenue growth in the publishing and advertising sub segments. We added multiple new logos in the advertising segment including OpenX, which is expanding its compute node across Platform Equinix to support a growing user base, as well as a top 20 video platform filling the majority of its ads through Equinix's advertising exchange. The cloud and IT services vertical achieved solid bookings led by EMEA and strong growth from software-as-a-service providers. We're increasing our density and coverage of both infrastructure-as-a-service and software-as-a-service providers, making it easy for enterprises to find and consume cloud services. Expansions in the quarter included deployments from Oracle, SAP and T-Systems as well as a leading storage hosting provider, expanding its presence on Platform Equinix and joining our cloud exchange. And turning to the enterprise, this vertical remained our fastest growing with recurring revenues surpassing $100 million and a record quarter in terms of new enterprise logo wins. Our enterprise penetration spans many sub segments including manufacturing, travel, healthcare, energy and government, as all of these sectors work to modernize their IT architectures for cloud and digital transformation. In addition to these broadly applicable use cases certain segments have industry-specific needs as well. For example healthcare providers are leveraging Equinix to help manage data for real-time clinical research analytics, while addressing regulatory compliance mandates such as HIPAA. Healthcare customer wins this quarter included Eli Lilly, a global pharmaceutical company. Enterprise new adds jumped up significantly year-over-year with 40% of these customers coming from our indirect channel. Partner contributions continue to be significant and now account for over 16% of our total bookings with two-thirds of this activity from resellers. Additionally, we've seen consistent trend of two-thirds of our new customer adds coming from the cloud and enterprise segments. This presents a strong land and expand opportunity for us over time. So, let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone. As Steve highlighted, Q1 was another very solid quarter and has set us up nicely for 2017. Revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO were all above our expectations, absent the impact of recent financings to fund our pending acquisition. We're on track to deliver higher levels of bookings and strong incremental revenues compared to 2016 and our operating metrics including MRR per cabinet, net cabinets billing, net cross-connect additions showed strong performance in the quarter. We're very excited about the pending Verizon transaction. We firmly believe in the merits of this highly compelling acquisition, both from a customer and a shareholder perspective. This acquisition will extend our market position across the Americas region, enhance our global interconnection platform while providing strong incremental value on a per share basis. Once closed, we'll invest, unlock and expand the capacity in these assets, tether the less network-dense assets to our network-dense campuses, up-sell our products and services to the 600 plus net-new customers, as well as invest in the assets to reduce the level of churn experienced in the business over the past few years. Verizon is currently a substantial customer of and key partner to Equinix. And concurrent with the close of the transaction, we expect to finalize our agreement with Verizon on their affiliated revenues in the acquired sites making Verizon one of our largest customers. Now based on our updated view of the business, although it's still early in the process, we're raising our expected Verizon acquisition revenues guidance to now range between $480 million and $500 million for the first 12 months post close with adjusted EBITDA margins of 60%, which excludes an expected $40 million of integration cost anticipated to integrate the Verizon assets. We'll update the Verizon data center acquisition guidance on our Q2 earnings update, post-close the transaction. By then, we'll have an updated view on the anticipated customer churn, the level of revenue reserves required and the conformance to our reporting methodologies. From a consolidated basis, the increased scale and reach from the combined business should enable us to continue to expand our margins, while creating significant value for our platform. As it relates to both Telecity and Bit-isle integration efforts, we've seen steady progress towards the integration of these businesses. Consistent with our prior comments, we no longer will separate out the Telecity and Bit-isle results and we'll instead report our financials and key metrics on a consolidated basis going forward. Also this quarter, we closed the relatively small $37 million acquisition of IO's UK data center near our Slough campus. And in early April, we completed the ICT-Center purchase in Zurich, a less than $5 million acquisition. These two small acquisitions will add additional capacity in these key markets. For integration cost in 2017, we continue to guide you to approximately a $30 million including the first $2 million of cost related to the Verizon asset acquisition incurred in Q1. The timing of the incremental Verizon integration cost will be updated on our Q2 earnings call. So, let me turn to the first quarter. Q1 was another strong quarter of operating performance as depicted on slide 5, global Q1 revenues were $949.5 million, up 2% over the prior quarter and 11% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis, reflecting the positive momentum in both the MRR and NRR revenue lines. Q1 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $12.3 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter, and a $5 million positive currency benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates due to the weakening U.S. dollar. For 2017, we've now hedged over 60% of our EMEA revenues and cash flows. Our global platform continues to expand with Asia-Pacific and EMEA showing normalized and constant currency growth over the same quarter last year of 15% and 14% respectively, while the Americas region produced steady growth of 6% despite the $6.8 million in revenue churn related to LinkedIn. Our MRR per cabinet yield remained strong, we had a 2,000 net billable cabinets after absorbing 1,300 cabinets of churn related to LinkedIn. Also, we had a 7,100 net cross-connects in the quarter. Global adjusted EBITDA was $427.6 million, up 10% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46% excluding integration cost of 45% on a as-reported basis, a step down over the prior quarter largely due to seasonal costs. Adjusted EBITDA also includes $12.3 million of integration cost this quarter. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, had a $10.8 million negative impact when compared to our average FX rates used last quarter, and a $500,000 negative impact when compared to our FX guidance rates. Global AFFO was $304 million, up 4% over the prior quarter, largely due to lower recurring CapEx and income taxes, while absorbing almost $10 million in a higher interest expense from our pending acquisition financings. AFFO on a normalized and constant-currency basis increased 13% over the prior year. Now moving to MRR churn. Q1 global MRR churn was 2.8% better than our expectations and includes LinkedIn's churn in the Americas region. We're pleased with our team's progress towards refilling the space with a number of ecosystem enhancing deals. For the full-year 2017, we continue to expect MRR churn to average 2% to 2.5% per quarter. I'd now like to provide some highlights on the regions whose full results are covered in slides 6 through 8. The Americas region had a solid bookings quarter with ongoing strong outbound production and the highest level interconnection as a percent of revenues of the three regions. EMEA delivered record bookings in the quarter with particular strength in our UK and Dutch markets, as well as strong bookings from our cloud vertical as many CSPs continue to place edge nodes infrastructure in multiple markets. As part of our interconnection strategy, we've also start to invest in a number of fiber builds to support our core ecosystems across our key campuses in Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Manchester, and Milan. Asia-Pacific outpaced worldwide growth with strong momentum driven by our content and enterprise verticals. Interconnection revenues continued to outpace overall growth of the business. The Americas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA interconnection revenues were 24%, 13% and 8% respectively of recurring revenues or 16% on a global basis. We're now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to slide 9. As you all know, disciplined capital allocation is one of our highest priorities as we selectively expand the business across our regions, while strengthening the global interconnection platform. In March, we raised over a $3.4 billion in debt and equity to complete the financing of our previously announced Verizon asset acquisition and support the continued demand that we see across each of our regions. This mix of debt and equity allowed us to preserve our strategic and operational flexibility and maintain current debt ratings, while providing a highly accretive transaction for our shareholders. Unrestricted cash and investments at month end increased to $4.9 billion. We expect to fund $3.6 billion to close the Verizon transaction this quarter. Our net debt leverage ratio, net of unrestricted cash was slightly above 4.0 times our Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA, pro forma for the Verizon asset acquisition. Given the favorable cash flow attributes of our business model, we expect to return to our targeted leverage ratio of three times to four times net debt to adjusted EBITDA in the short-term. Now switching to AFFO and dividends on slide 10. For 2017, we expect our as reported AFFO to be greater than $1.214 billion, a 13% year-over-year increase despite the incremental $53 million of interest expense related to our high yield offering. On a normalized basis, AFFO would be greater than $1.331 billion, an $18 million increase compared to the prior guidance demonstrating the continued strength of our operating model. On an as-reported AFFO per share basis, we expect to deliver $15.66, which includes $87 million of incremental interest expense related to our term loan B and high yield financings, $30 million of integration costs and an additional 6.1 million shares related to the equity issued in the quarter. The as-reported does not yet include the operating benefit attributed to the Verizon asset acquisition. We've assumed a weighted average 77.5 million common shares outstanding on a fully-diluted basis. On a normalized and constant currency basis, we expect AFFO per share to be $18.33, a share of 1.4% increase over the $18.07 noted in the prior quarter. Turning to dividends, we announced our Q2 dividend of $2 a share, maintaining the same level of cash dividend per share despite larger share base. For 2017, we expect to payout total cash dividends of approximately $612 million, a 24% increase over the prior year. Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to slide 11. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $277 million, including the recurring CapEx of $23 million, slightly below the low end of our guidance expectations. During the quarter, we open new phases in Dublin and New York and continue to progress with the very active pipeline of new capacity, which includes an opening of an additional four new data centers in 2017, being Amsterdam, Ashburn, Virginia, Frankfurt and Silicon Valley. We continue to invest in new capacity and our 2017 capital expenditures are expected to range between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion for the year. And finally, please refer to slides 12 through 16 as these slides bridge our 2017 guidance from our normalize 2016 performance. So, I'll turn the call back to Steve. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Okay. Very good, thank you, Keith. And finally, on slide 16, we summarizes our updated Q2 and full-year 2017 guidance including the impact of FX changes. For the full-year of 2017, we are raising our revenue guidance to be greater than $3.976 billion, a $43 million uplift that is a combination of currency benefit and improved operating performance. Also for 2017, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to be greater than $1.86 billion, an $18 million uplift. So in closing, we're benefiting from our global reach and interconnected ecosystems, which is translating into firm MRR yield for cabinet, healthy interconnection activity, strong bookings and accelerated new customer capture. We live in network density, cloud density and size and quality of customer base all of which we expect to significantly grow over the coming years. We are expanding our product portfolio to drive revenue and continuing to refine our go-to-market engine to execute on our strategy. Our growth and scale are driving increased AFFO and cash flow and dividends. And we will continue to focus on creating sustainable value for our customers and shareholders. So, let me stop here, and I'll turn it back over to you, Cary to open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. So I have a couple. I wondered if you could remind us what you're seeing in terms of book-to-bill trends, what is it and has that changed over the past couple of quarters? And then on CapEx, maintenance CapEx seems to have trended a little bit lower, both in terms of dollars and percentage of revenues and I wondered if this is sort of a new level that we can expect going forward? Thanks. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah, Jonathan. So, a couple of things. I think, when we discuss the book-to-bill interval, we're continuing to see improvements in our book-to-bill. And so there is nothing, I would say, to share with you other than we're seeing slight improvements and we're continuing to work to reduce that interval. As it relates to the recurring CapEx, we were like this quarter at $23 million and certainly relative to the prior quarter. But as you look at our forward guidance, not only for Q2 but for the rest of the year, you'll see that there is a step up. And it's roughly $160 million to $165 million of recurring CapEx for the year, which is 4.1% of our revenues. But again, there is nothing than really timing that's affected our recurring CapEx this quarter. And again, it will go back to, I think, traditional levels in the near-term. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then just real quick on some of the regional color. The Asia-PAC saw a little bit of deceleration in cabinets added. And then I think even in the U.S., excluding \u2013 if you take out the LinkedIn churn, there is also a slight deceleration there as well. Anything going on there, that is worth pointing out? Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: I think when you look at cabinet, as I mean, with 3,300 cabinet as across the portfolio as we said in our prepared remarks, Americas continues to be next quarter production to the other two region. So, when you look at a platform as a whole, 3,300 net cabinets billings when you take out LinkedIn churn is one of our best quarters ever. And so, there is nothing that really is going on in any given region other than to say timing always has an impact on when we book and when we churn. And so I'd just say that, that we're really pleased with the overall performance of our platform. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Jonathan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is now open. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could. First, I was wondering if you cold unpack a little further the strength that you saw in the network vertical during the quarter, and since network is the longest standing vertical that you had. What's driving the particular strength in, how should we read into what your customers are doing in terms of whether it's network topography or what they might be investing for in your facilities? And then secondly, if you can move to the sales side of the business, you mentioned, about the Verizon distribution agreement and I was wondering if you could kind of put that in the context of the sales strategy and what you're doing with the sales organization more broadly to continue to pursue whether it's the Fortune 500 target that you have or the broader expansion of your customer base? Thanks. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Do you want to start on that, Charles, here? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Sure. I'll start on both and you can add any color you want. Mike, relative to the network vertical, I think there is a variety of trends that underlay that. As you know, it is \u2013 as you said, it's one of our most mature ecosystems. It really is our most mature ecosystem and we continue to see real strength there in terms of continued bookings \u2013 incremental bookings from our key network service provider partners. And I think we're driven by a number of factors; one are some of their expanding portfolio of services and their need to upgrade their architectures to do that. Also I think an increasing level of sort of receptivity towards the new age, if you will, of how customers are consuming services and the need to sort of be very present with technologies in the key points of aggregation and I think that has really increased their level of appetite for working with us on a number of things, and that includes \u2013 and then there is also a tech refresh element as they're upgrading their network in a number of dimensions in terms of new technology and moving to 100 gig, et cetera. But a lot of the various telco as well as cable operators are implementing over-the-top services and other digital services such as video-on-demand that are driving a number of those sort of demand drivers for us. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. I think \u2013 go ahead, Keith. Unknown Speaker : Well, just in terms of the Verizon distribution. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: And on Verizon, I mean, I think that it speaks to a couple of things that we talked about in the script. One is the sort of new logo capture that we're seeing and that being driven in significant part, about 40% of the new logos for us being driven by channel partners. And what we're seeing is that partners who are delivering certain elements of service to the customers are also realizing that their customers have a demand for hybrid cloud as the architecture of choice and are really looking to Equinix as a key place to build that out. And so the agreement with Verizon is a great example and just one of several where we're seeing real momentum with the network service providers and carriers that are trying to deliver a more complete solution to their customers. And because many of those carriers have really now stepped away from actually continuing to invest CapEx in their colo assets and have divested them, a number of them are saying, hey, we're going to have to lean on partners to do that and Equinix is really the key partner of choice. So, I think it dovetails with the strategy in a number of ways in terms of how we see partners playing into the overall strategy. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. I don't have anything to add. I think that's well said. Does that answer your question, Michael? We might have lost you. Operator : Should we proceed to the next question, speaker? Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah, go to the next question. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Paul Morgan of Canaccord. Your line is now open. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. Just a couple questions. First, you mentioned the enterprise as being your fastest growing vertical and listed a number of the sectors, kind of within there : manufacturing, healthcare, energy. And I was just wondering if you have any color \u2013 whether you'd point to any of these subsectors as being kind of at an inflection point where demand is really ramping? And then maybe how much kind of the interconnection density varies across those different industries and whether there's kind of real upside from cross-connects there? And then, the second question just on the Verizon revenue guidance from, I think it was from $450 million to $480 million to $500 million, maybe if you could give a little bit more color there. Is that just due to kind of the lease base from Verizon or are there other drivers? And maybe anything else you've seen in terms of your diligence, you've had three more months in terms \u2013 or a couple more months at least in terms of just kind of looking at maybe some of the regional centers, for example, within the Verizon portfolio? Thanks. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Sure, Paul, this is Steve. Why don't I start out and Keith and Charles can supplement here. But on the enterprise question we \u2013 there is a lot of horizontal use cases that we're experiencing across all these industry verticals : manufacturing, healthcare, retail, et cetera. Many of these companies are in the early stages of moving portions of their enterprise workload to hybrid multi-cloud architecture. So they're looking for help to do that, that's a use case across several of the industry verticals. Many of them are optimizing the network as you heard Charles just talk about. Many of them are big distributed global companies and so distributed data management is a typical use case. Unified communications is showing up in some of our use cases and in many cases as they look at their data center portfolio and look at consolidation, that ends up being a requirement that shows up for us. But we're seeing many, many use cases now really start to show up that are not only those horizontal ones I just described but also vertically. And they range from real time analytics for product lifecycle for manufacturers, clinical research for healthcare, digital commerce for retail providers. So we're seeing all kinds of use cases now that are starting to show up vertically. And so our teams are studying those to determine where to go in deeper. And it's exactly what we predicted was going to start happening. But they're founded on the horizontal use cases, I think. I don't know, Charles, what you would add there? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. No, I would just double-click a little bit on your question relative to interconnection density and upside that might exist from that. Basically, as Steve said, we see \u2013 we often see an initial deployment motivated by some sort of horizontal requirement. And Steve mentioned several of those, could be network optimization, could be a basic sort of hybrid cloud or cloud connectivity, number of other things. But then we see typically that being proven out on a smaller scale and then expanded significantly in terms of geographic expansion and then use case expansion vertically on top of those implementations over time. And so, what I would tell you is I think there is cross-connect upside to those customers. They \u2013 but then there is also port upside because cloud exchange is going to be a key method for interconnection for them in our centers. And so \u2013 but I think the key point is really that as you look at the sort of relatively modest size of those deployments, but with broad geographic distribution and strong interconnection, I think what we're seeing is the opportunity for those to be accretive to our yield per cabinet story over time, number one. And number two, to be really sticky in terms of being resistant to churn over time. And so, we think those are two things that really drive two key levers in our business and that's yield per cabinet and churn. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: So, Paul, let me just respond then to your question on the Verizon revenue update. As we said, our current thinking right now is revenues would range between \u2013 now range between $480 million and $500 million which also includes the affiliated revenues related to the Verizon transaction. I think it's important to note though, in at least our prepared remarks, is that also contemplates what we've assumed is what churn might look like with their customers, what our reserve positions have to be vis-\u00e0-vis that revenues. And also includes our methodologies and how we report revenues. So overall, feel good about where we are today. As we said, we're going to update that once we close the transaction and on the Q2 call, we'll give you even more clarity on where revenues will be, but this at least gets you to think a little bit about where revenues could go. I think it's really important, though, to note a couple of things here. Number one, we are extremely bullish on what we think we can do with the assets. The things that we talked about first and foremost is using our capital to expand in the critical markets where there has not been capacity before, and so taking our platform and selling into that opportunity with expansion dollars is going to be really important. You coupled that with the fact that we have got very network dense assets and we can then tether those assets to the less network dense assets of the Verizon portfolio, which would typically be the non-Terremark assets. And then you got new products and services, you've got the investment we want to make in our operating performance and how that would affect churn. Overall, that's what gives us the comfort with what a positioning is but it's really the translation of that revenue due to the value on a cash flow basis per share. And I think if you take the $480 million to $500 million and you multiply by the 60% margin, that's going to give you roughly $294 million of EBITDA. As you can see on \u2013 for those that aren't paying attention at least, on slide 15, we've given you a number on an AFFO per share basis, both on a normalized and as reported basis. Right now that as reported AFFO per share number is $15.66, and you take that $294 million of EBITDA, and given the fact that we're about $87 million of cash interest in there and we have got the diluted effect of our equity financing but $494 million is going to turn into almost $3.80 of incremental AFFO per share and that sort of pre-tax. But it gives you a sense between that and the integration cost is a meaningfully accretive transaction to us and \u2013 so we encourage you to go do the math, but also give you a sense of the bullishness that we exhibit inside the organization for the completion of this transaction. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. I pile on a little bit, Keith, and just say that, when they does settle, I think, we felt a really sense of optimism about quality of the assets we're getting, the quality of the team that we're getting even though, it's relatively small, but I think, a strong team that brings some additional expertise in quality into the Equinix family. Also, I think the customer response to the pending acquisition has been extraordinarily positive. I think they're very excited about the prospects of us continued in investing and deliver value through those assets to them and I think that gives us an increased level of confidence about our ability to manage and mitigate turnover time. And then also as the number sort of fleshed out about what the overlap look like, a net new 600 customers of very high quality and with significant up-sell potential across global platform. And so, I think for a variety of reasons, we continue to be really optimistic about where we landed there and are excited about path ahead. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Very helpful. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is now open. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks very much. Keith, if I could follow up on some of the commentary you just made about the Verizon assets, it seems though, we've run through that math, as you mentioned, significant accretion from that perspective. How do we think about the incremental opportunities on the assets, if we were to frame them or layer them on top of that, sort of financial framework? And what I'm trying to assess here is, as you mentioned improving the utilization and expanding the use of the assets, but also I'm thinking about it relative to your multi-year growth outlook that you had provided last year. We saw sort of where the growth trajectory of the business has been and I am just trying to figure out sort of the math in terms of the benefits to AFFO, but also how to think about it within that context of being able to drive greater than 10% growth over a multi-year period? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Look, I think you're asking a very appropriate question, part of the reason that we wanted a further discussion on this until Q2 is, we still have to capture all the information to get to as billing, billing these customers in our billing systems, which will again open over the very near-term. That all said, I think it's important to note, whether you look at Telecity or Bit-isle or for that matter, you look at the Verizon assets that we're acquiring. If you look at the 8-K that we filed, for the March financing it gives you a sense of the performance of the business. It doesn't tell the whole story, I think that's why it's very important that you understand what we intend to do with the business on a go-forward basis. And therefore, you've got a relatively slow growing business that we're introducing into a faster growing business. Obviously, initially it's going to be dilutive. Now that said, as you have to understand, we're going to take that portfolio and we layer into our platform. And we're going to make sure we put the customers into the highs and best use \u2013 we'll take a highs and best use view on where to put and place those customers. And so overall, we really want to talk about the platform recognizing that you've got slower growing businesses. That all said, I think the key walkway from a shareholder perspective, your focus, your sole focus is really what are we going to do on a value per share basis. And I can tell you that the view that we have with integrating these assets, putting them into our platform and then drilling them up with our mindset, I think the value that we'll be able to drive on a per share basis is something that will be attractive to our investors. And again, it's not going to happen to anyone as you can appreciate, because we have to make these investments, but you're going to see relatively fast out of the gate we'll be making decisions that would be indicative of where we're going to take this business. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Keith, thanks. Amir, said another way, I think in the near-term, you're going to see a blending of the growth rates as we integrated into the Americas business. And as Keith said, on a longer term basis, once we start investing in these assets in Culpeper and Noda (43:54) and Denver, Houston and Sao Paulo and we tether those assets as Charles and Keith talked about back into our core network hubs and we start cross-selling into them and we'd layer in our customer service on top of those customers. You're going to see churn stabilize, you're going to see growth start to take off, you're going to see the global selling engine driving a whole of these assets and selling into them from a much greater velocity than they've ever been sold into before. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's very helpful. Thank you very much for the incremental color. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Yep. Operator : Our next question is from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Just one quick housekeeping question. The 7,100 cross-connects, were those all organic or are there any more adjustments to Telecity or Bit-isle that ultimately showed up in the first quarter metrics? And then I appreciate that you aren't giving more specifics on exactly when the Verizon deal closes and I don't believe you've given integration costs, but can you give us any color on the magnitude of what the integration cost could be for the second quarter specific to Verizon? And then just lastly, you guys talked about last quarter ramping up the sales force. I was just curious if you can give us an update on where you're at on that? Thank you. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: You want me to start or do you want to start? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: I'll take the \u2013 I'll take the Verizon and you take the sales force, Steve. I think it's important to note, when we talk about shortly, you could also say imminent, so the deal will close imminently. And so, we are eager to get that behind us. As it relates to the cross-connects, that is an organic number. There is no adjustments. So it's organic to \u2013 with Telecity and Bit-isle and right, Kat? Katrina Rymill - Equinix, Inc.: Yes. It's all into the 7,100. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: And then, as it relates to the integration cost, what we said last quarter was, when we disclosed the Verizon transaction there will be roughly $40 million of integration cost. We incurred $2 million of integration cost in Q1. So there is $38 million more to go. If I break down that $40 million, I would expect again, it's going to depend on exactly when this transaction closes. But if it's imminent, we would expect roughly $30 million to $35 million of integration cost to be realized this fiscal year in 2017, and then $5 million the following year. Again, those are preliminary numbers. We'll update you as we close the deal, and update our guidance on Q2 but that's our current thinking. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Well, 2017 total integration... Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Will be $30 million to $35 million. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: All-in with Bit-isle at $60 million... Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: It will be $60 million to $65 million. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: So, $60 million to $65 million. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Is that helpful, Colby? Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: That's awesome. And then, just the sales force would be great. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: And what, Colby, was the question on sales force? Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Just curious what the update is in terms of the sales hiring that you guys had talked about doing for the year? Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: The journey is off to a good start beginning of the year, mostly in the Americas. We're still \u2013 in Europe, we are still leveraging the integration of the Telecity and the Equinix core team and then in Asia, mostly focused on channel hiring. So I think the total head count now for quota bearing ballpark coming out of the gate here in the beginning of the year is somewhere in the order magnitude of \u2013 I think we exited the year about 360 to 365 and we are up to about 386 million, 387 today of quota bearing heads. So we're still adding as we go through the year. That's obviously spread across the globe and we're adding some support behind that. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: And, Colby, just to comment that we part of \u2013 I think we've seen an accelerated rate of new logo capture, I think we're seeing strong awareness in the market around the value propositions that we've talked about in some of these horizontal, as well as vertical value props. But we're starting to see the channel uptake and drive that as well, which has given us some confidence to do these additions and feel like we're going to get strong returns from them. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. And if you guys are hiring in EVP Strategy, let me know, I am in the market. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Sure. Noted. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Unknown Speaker : Hi, this is Richard (48:27) for Phil. One quick clarification. In terms of cross-connects and in the Americas it was up $3,400, but revenue was only up $1 million quarter-to-quarter. Is there \u2013 is that just timing or is something else going on there? And then normally the top 10 customer list doesn't change very much, but (48:45) it seems to have shifted and more cloud and IT and then a customer that only has four locations, but disappearing in the top 10. Just kind of wanted to get a sense of what we should \u2013 how should we look at the new list? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. So first and foremost, when you think about the cross-connect ads relative to the revenue, of course, a lot of that is just timing and it's the timing of when things get realized versus not realized, so nothing out of the ordinary there. As it relates to our top 10 customer list, the thing that certainly worthy of note here is, I just want to confirm with Kat, so this is fully included Telecity and Bit-isle, right? Katrina Rymill - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. So this is the updated makeshift here, so now includes Telecity and Bit-isle on the top 10. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: And so you see a dramatic shift and five out of the top six customers are cloud and IT-based companies. And the largest of course being an enterprise-oriented company. So, it's more about the integration of the Telecity and Bit-isle results into our key metrics. Unknown Speaker : Okay, great. Thank you. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Great. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Robert Gutman of Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hi, thanks for taking the question. In the quarter you saw nice sequential increase in revenues year up and continues strong cabinet ads. During the quarter, you also announced some cloud infrastructure \u2013 you made some cloud infrastructure deployment announcements. Would you say the demand is driven \u2013 is still reflecting really demand from SaaS providers or are you also seeing enterprise demand to connect into the SaaS platforms? Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. I think, we are seeing across all, Robert, across all sectors. It's \u2013 the infrastructure players are continuing to what we call another wave of deployments. They have been at it for six years or seven years now. And so we are seeing a second wave of deployments into deeper out around the world. We are seeing the SaaS providers which are many more than the infrastructure-as-a-service providers are starting to show up at higher rates and then you are starting to see on the other side of that ecosystem, the enterprises connecting to both the SaaS and the infrastructure and platform providers. So it's coming out from all angles and the part that we're trying to learn as fast as we can on is what we \u2013 Charles and I described earlier on the enterprise, vertical use cases. We're starting to really understand the adoption rate of these enterprise industry sub verticals and understand those use cases. So we can go after them where there is like opportunities. So we're seeing demand. I would tell you from every core industry vertical that we've been in for 18 years and we're seeing a pickup with the advent of the cloud enterprise ecosystem that we've been talking about for several quarters. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. And just off of that, I think that we're seeing continued strength in momentum in the European business as a confluence of sort of two things, which is the timing of sort of cloud adoption and some acceleration of that in the European theater, and then combining with what I think we expected when we announced Telecity acquisition, which is a very strong competitive position in that market and a superior value proposition that's allowing us to capture sort of more than our fair share of demand in that market. So I think it's really a confluence of those two things coming together. Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Your line is now open. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, good afternoon \u2013 good evening, thank you. You've been highlighting the growing percentage of bookings coming from your channel partners over the last several quarters, and I think you said 16% this quarter. I'm just curious if there has been any material change in customer acquisition cost within the channel that I guess could drive longer-term improvement in gross margins as the channel continues to grow as a percentage of bookings? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. Not really is the answer. I think that, on balance, probably channel bookings are slightly more expensive, but in the grand scheme, it's a pretty marginal lift relative to the overall margin profile of the business. We are \u2013 one of the things is, at any point \u2013 any time you, I think, are building new channel sort of muscle, it's very important to ensure that you have a level of alignment between the direct and indirect sort of selling motions. And so, we are comping with that in mind. And so that does add a little bit of cost, but again, on balance, it's \u2013 we think that we're getting a level of additional reach and new logo capture, which if you look at it from a customer lifetime value and an NPV creation standpoint and you balance that against the very nominal incremental commission cost, we think it's great business. And so, we're very excited about the progress of the channel, I'm feeling very good about the momentum there and I am feeling very good about the partners' ability to increasingly position the value of Equinix as part of their overall solution. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: I think this quarter, too, guys \u2013 I think it was about a third of our new logos came out of... Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: About 40%... Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Almost 40% came out of the channel. So, to Charles's point, we're really starting to embed our proposition with the channel partners to be able to talk for a full enterprise solution which includes using the Equinix IBX footprint around the world, so it's really starting to take hold. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, if memory serves, it seems like it's been a while since you called out any significant wins or kind of highlighted the growth from your traditional content customers. And I'm thinking specifically with respect to streaming and OTT platforms. I'm just wondering if you've seen any pressure from kind of more targeted edge data center providers in some of those Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets that may be kind of taking some incremental bookings activity away from customers in that vertical? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Not really. I would tell you that I think we continue to have a lot of the sort of CDM type players as very significant customers that continue to grow with us. And I think that that includes carriers who are increasingly in that business in delivering OTT type services. So I think we see strength there. I think there is a limited market particularly around the delivery of consumer media and digital media that is out there and the cable operators are active in that market, but it hasn't really impacted our business from a share perspective. And we continue to see them seeing Equinix as a primary point, because of our network density to deliver those types of services from. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. From a number standpoint in this quarter, actually that vertical represents about 14% of the recurring revenue and the bookings are generally in that same zip code, 13%, 14%. So we don't really \u2013 to Charles's point, we are not seeing a change. Most of that is because we're still over-indexing in enterprise and cloud and so the growth rate of bookings or recurring revenue is still the highest in cloud enterprise and network. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks very much. I think, Keith, in the back you talk about the escalators and 2% to 3%, 5% escalators in some of the contracts. Maybe you can just update us on what the book of business or your overall revenue stream looks like in terms of how much is escalators, what's the average escalator and maybe what the term of contracts is at the moment? And then, on the seasonal costs, you obviously flagged that as being a factor sequentially, I think particularly sales and marketing was up a lot. How much \u2013 maybe you can just drill down into that a little bit more, how much of that is kind of one-time or will flow through into Q2, any sort of itemization there would be great? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Okay. So let me just take them in order, Simon. I don't think there has been any meaningful change in what we think about from an escalation perspective, 2% to 5% is typical in our contracts. And as you can appreciate, every contract is negotiated separately with the customer and so it depends on their starting point versus their end point. But I think for all intents and purposes, you can assume a 2% to 5% rate of escalation. Our net pricing actions have been very positive over basically the last two years. So I feel good about the position we've been in from a pricing perspective relative to price decreases. The average contract life is still two years to three years, but certainly as we continue to invest more across our platform with customers who are putting their critical infrastructure across multiple markets with us, you're seeing an extension of term and that can range from five years to seven years and in some cases 10 years. And so very large base, it's not moving the averages much, but certainly there's an indication that there is a number of longer-term contracts that are coming into our portfolio. As it relates to... Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Sorry, just on that point, the stabilized growth of 6%, so is that fair to say then maybe half of that is coming from escalators? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: It varies. I mean a lot of (58:30) stabilized growth going down to 82% from 87% as you realize. So, it's going to change the mix of our discussion a little bit more because we've added all these new assets into the stabilized portfolio, but let me say to the extent some of the oldest data centers are getting a lot of it from volume. We sell more cross-connects. We sell more cross-connects and more power circuit, but of course then there is pricing actions as well. As it relates to, if you will, the newer of the stabilized assets, it's volume and price driven. No surprise to you, because you've got the portfolio that was not as highly utilized as the prior subset of assets. But 2% to 5%, look, I would feel more comfortable if you said 2% to 3% is where you're \u2013 where you can get it from a net pricing action, and the rest is coming through volume. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. I doubt it's half of that 6% though because you do have again, in pricing although we have seen and continue to see net favorable pricing actions, you do have again older contracts, depending on where they were priced, may come out and sort of provide some sort of a sawtooth effect on pricing as they see escalators throughout the term and then maybe a rebaselining, which we will often do if we exchange that for longer term. So, I doubt it's half that but it does contribute and there is a fair amount of interconnection in power that I think make up the balance of the stabilized growth. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, okay. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: And then, Simon, just to answer your last question because I think it's an important question. Certainly, like Q1 if you \u2013 you can go back over many, many years, Q1 tends to be much higher, sort of higher cost environment than it is in Q4. A lot of it is to do with sellers and benefits, it's the fight to reset that we experience in the U.S. When you look at our SG&A base for Q1, our cash SG&A was $218 million for Q1. We guided you to \u2013 for the rest of the year to a midpoint of $820 million, which shows you that our average over the next three quarters again Q2, where we're guiding to about $210 million that our average is roughly $200 million. So, when you think about our costing environment we're going to affect the whole SG&A flat to down for the rest of the year. And it tells you that, you have this anomalistic charges that goes through your first quarter, but we also get benefit of what happens in the fourth quarter where our FICA goes down and there is some other seasonal cost that sort of come out of the equation. So, overall, I think we've got a \u2013 what looks like an improving margin business through the rest \u2013 the next four \u2013 next three quarters of the year, you've got incremental revenues that \u2013 greater than that, what you saw in Q1, putting currency aside from \u2013 put currency aside, revenues you'd see a nice uptick in revenues for the next three quarters. And then, you would see our margins continue to improve through the rest of the year. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks, guys. Keith, we might not have a lot to talk about in the next conference call on Verizon, but the AFFO accretion you are talking about, should that hit relatively quickly. It sounds like and/or maybe just a rough timing on that? And then, on the \u2013 can you talk about maybe how their prices compare to yours on a per cabinet or square footage basis at this point? And then, maybe, Steve, can you talk about who your largest channel partners are to get a sense of that and is this 40% of new logos kind of a good way to think about the business going forward? Thanks. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Tim, I'll take the first one and then we'll do jump off for the next two. Maybe Steve or Charles will take them. The \u2013 as it relates to the AFFO, I'm trying to give you a perspective on again what we are guiding you to, that $480 million to $500 million is post close for the next 12 months. We are assuming that revenues are going to be somewhat ratable over that period of time. So, relatively flat over that same period of time. That all said, therefore, you get to enjoy, if you will, the benefits of accretion right out of the gate. But you have to take out cost \u2013 the integration cost and the acquisition cost. I am assuming we're going to take those out of the equation. Similar to what we've done in the last few earnings call is we'll separate it for you when we do our analysis and our bridges. But that would tell you then for all intents and purposes you get that benefit of accretion real quick, pretty darn quickly out of the gate post \u2013 exclusive those two items. And what we've really said is day one is an accretive transaction. I think when you start to do the math and you think about $294 million of EBITDA what that translates to from an accretive perspective, when you look at the $15.66 versus the $18.33, you'll come out of the gate by the way and go, wow, that's a highly accretive transaction, again recognizing that we're \u2013 our intention is to continue to do better than we guide. And so we're going to work hard to drive as much value to the shareholder as possible and make it an even more attractive transaction for us as we look down the road. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: And just to be clear on the integration cost, does that include any CapEx that's required to get it up to your standards or would that be in addition to that? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: We're only giving you $40 million of operating expense related to \u2013 for the integration cost. There will absolutely be some costs that we will invest not only in expansion as I alluded to and I think, it was Steve and Charles that both said that we're going to invest in whether it's NAP of the Americas, whether it's Culpeper, Denver, another core markets that have been in our views underinvested in from an expansion perspective. There is certainly \u2013 there is some CapEx that we're going to put into the business to make sure that we operate it to our specifications our operating procedures. And so we'll recall single points of failure areas where we need to invest in end of life. We'll do that. Again, that's something we're going to guide you to on the Q2 call because we'll have much better visibility at that point in time. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: And, Tim, on the channel most real quickly, we have three motions that we channel partner with. We have some flat \u2013 the first one is platform partners and these are the big hyper scalar cloud partners and there is a dozen that we have relationships within that vector. There is probably three or four that we focus on, it's the Oracles, the AWSs, the Microsofts. And then we have a reseller sell-through relationship with many, many 300, 400 partners here. But probably a dozen again, that we're very tight with which is companies like Datapipe, Accenture, Infosys, Unisys, BT, Dimension Data, companies like that. And then the third category is referrals, it's a very small part of the channel and it's a lead engine and they hand off lease to us, if we qualify and if we close them, they get a referral fee. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. And I would just add an additional \u2013 some of the best momentum we see is with what I would consider to be sort of integrated business service providers that maybe core telcos that are expanding their service offerings over time. Obviously, we are excited about the Verizon reseller agreement and our expanding relationship with them. But their global peers are companies with whom we do significant business and have great relationships. And so \u2013 and we expect that to continue. AT&T has been an excellent and exceptional channel partner for us. We continue to increase our investment in that relationship. And then the European and Asian peers that that are in those businesses including the likes of BT and T-Systems, et cetera, really who are delivering complete solutions to customers and really being able to effectively integrate Equinix as part of the story as they implement hybrid cloud, multi-cloud solution. So seeing real momentum there. SIs are a little slower to move, but I think have the potential to be just a massive opportunities for us over time. And then as Steve said, some of these more new age cloud integrators that are right at the forefront of helping people migrate to hybrid and multi-cloud, the likes of Datapipe, et cetera, those are \u2013 we certainly tend to see continued success there. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank a lot, guys. Katrina Rymill - Equinix, Inc.: Great, thank you. That concludes our Q1 call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Thank you, Katrina. And good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. We finished the first half of 2017, with solid momentum and our success with customers is reflected in our financial performance, and ecosystem growth. We continue to grow our market share, expand our global footprint, and win new accounts on both sides of our rapidly expanding cloud ecosystem. Customers are seeing the benefit of highly interconnected IT deployments to optimize for cost, agility and performance, and the robust demand for cloud and telecom services, is driving and sustaining the next wave of campus expansions. We also closed our acquisition of Verizon's Americas data center portfolio, strengthening our global market leadership and giving us additional capacity to meet customer demand. We are seeing strong performance out of the gate for these assets, as our sales force works to expand our business with the existing customer relationships and are already booking new sales into the Verizon sites. We delivered healthy bookings in the second quarter, fueled by strong growth in our network and enterprise verticals, and in the European region. As depicted on slide 3, second quarter revenues eclipsed a $1 billion for the first time, to $1.066 billion up 11% over the same quarter last year, on a normalized and constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $509 million for the quarter, up 10% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. AFFO growth was 17% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, the result of strong operating performance. With the Verizon acquisition, we now service 42% of the Fortune 500 and 30% of the Global 2000 and are expanding our traction with these critical lighthouse accounts. Three region deployments continue to rise. This quarter, over 58% of our revenue came from customers deployed across all three regions, and 84% came from customers deployed across multiple metros, up from 83% last quarter. Interconnection revenue grew 17% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, significantly outpacing colocation revenues and reflecting the movement towards Interconnected Oriented Architectures (sic) [Interconnection Oriented Architectures] and the rapid adoption of hybrid cloud and multi-cloud as the preferred IT deployment model. We saw a healthy pace of cross-connect adds with over 242,000 cross-connects now deployed excluding the Verizon assets. Traction with Equinix Cloud Exchange and Internet Exchange also continues as we build our platform Equinix as the most comprehensive platform to access a variety of networks in a rapidly expanding universe of cloud providers. In the second quarter, AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Salesforce all expanded into new metros on cloud exchange and we added key new providers including Alibaba and Tencent. We now service approximately 900 Cloud Exchange customers. Enterprises of all types increasingly regard private, secure, distributed interconnection as a core design principle of IT and are leveraging our entire product portfolio. We look forward to making some new announcements in the second half regarding our expansion of our interconnection capabilities both in terms of enhanced reach and compelling feature functionality for our customers. Turning now to acquisitions. Our acquisition of Verizon's 29 data centers dramatically boost our efforts to grow in scale in the Americas, enhancing our interconnection capabilities with core strategic hubs in 15 metros. We plan to integrate and substantially invest in these assets, which will help us reduce their historical churn. In overlap markets, we are in the process of building fiber connections between new Verizon assets and existing campuses as an early step in the integration, and we'll introduce our products and services at these locations over time. Verizon adds more than 600 net new customers to our global platform and we allocated those accounts to the existing sales teams to begin building these relationships. We're already seeing early success in cross-selling our platform with significant positive feedback from these customers as we look to drive growth in this portfolio. The Verizon deal also fueled expansion in three new cities : Bogot\u00e1, Culpeper, and Houston. The new market of Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, extends our presence in this growing market, which is now has the most undersea cable landings in Latin America. Our entry into Houston positions us to build on our success in the energy ecosystem, a market with deep global requirements and a demonstrated appetite for hybrid cloud solutions. And the acquisition of the Culpeper facilities in Virginia gives us meaningful future expansion capability and enables us to accelerate our business in the federal government sector, which doubles with the Verizon acquisition. Both the Culpeper and Miami's NAP of the Americas campus advances our name recognition, federal team size, and ability to access existing federal contracts. As government agencies modernize and migrate to the cloud, Equinix offers compliance, scale, and security advantages that we believe will drive continued success in this massive market. Now, let me comment on our development activity. We recently opened three new IBXs, expanding Equinix's total global footprint to 182 data centers across 44 markets. These new facilities add owned capacity in some of our most important and interconnection-rich campuses and expand our footprint to support the growing demand for cloud services and interconnection. In Germany, we opened Frankfurt 6 a new IBX located on owned land next to Frankfurt 4 and tethered to our Frankfurt 5 hub, one of the most carrier dense locations in Europe. This supports our scaling in one of Europe's leading financial centers and help for banking, commerce, and manufacturing. We also opened Silicon Valley 10 adding owned capacity to our network dense San Jose campus, which serves one of the largest concentrations of high-tech companies and peering hubs in the world. SV10 is next to our SV1 and SV5 facilities, which form the core interconnection hub in South San Jose. It's the first build on 11 acres of land, purchased by Equinix in 2016 with room for an additional 2,700 cabinet data center. And we opened Amsterdam 4 adjacent to our existing AM3 facility in the Amsterdam Science Park. AM4 builds out one of the most cloud dense locations in Europe, helping us meet the growing demand for interconnection and colocation in the Netherlands as a key launch pad for serving the continent. It also leverages the latest green technology, meeting our rigid standards for energy efficiency and helping customers reduce their carbon footprint. Revenues from owned assets jumped to 42%, up from 35% last quarter, which includes the predominantly owned Verizon portfolio. And we continue to purchase additional land and buildings. During the quarter, we acquired our Amsterdam 5 facility for $30 million, a former Telecity lease site. We also entered into an agreement to purchase our Zurich 5 facility in 2019, which includes adjacent land for future expansion. In S\u00e3o Paulo, we closed on the acquisition of a four-acre land parcel adjacent to our recently opened SP3 facility, which could support 2,400 cabinets of future expansion, in this critical global market. Now let me cover quarterly highlights from our industry verticals, and I'll start with the networks. This vertical experienced another record bookings quarter, led by international deployments, with substantial growth coming from telecom operators, wireless service providers, and subsea cable operators, as firms expand capacity and capabilities for digital services. We're seeing the global network providers undergo a major refresh of their IP infrastructure to support new capacity levels and applications across their footprints. Bookings growth includes a wide variety of global carriers, performing multi-metro expansions, including British Telecom who extended coverage of their cloud edge nodes into multiple metros as well as a leading network operator providing air-to-ground broadband services. We also had our best bookings quarter-to-date as the interconnection partner for new submarine cable projects and we see a strong pipeline for the second half. We announced our 15th subsea cable win with Eastern Light, a fiber optic cable route connecting Sweden and Finland. The Eastern Light cable combines the landing station and interconnection hub into a single solution at Equinix's Helsinki and Stockholm data centers, eliminating the need for a traditional beach cable landing station. The financial services vertical saw multi-region growth across trading, banking and financial service provider segments. Financial services firms are broadening the use of Platform Equinix, well beyond electronic trading to accelerate IT transformation across their business. Customer wins across insurance, retail banking and FinTech included a leading French health insurance company, doing real-time risk pricing, and a top 10 retail bank connecting to multiple clouds to support digital banking. The financial services vertical also continues to innovate and grow the customers such as COBOL who is providing secure post-trade processing solutions with Equinix's Performance Hub in global locations. The content and digital media verticals saw its highest bookings in two years led by e-commerce and content deployment as digital transformation is also reshaping this vertical. Content and digital media companies are broadening their use cases, leveraging Platform Equinix for both service provider and enterprise use case. Expansions including a Fortune 500 global entertainment provider deploying a next-generation gaming service, a top 10 streaming video service providing OTT delivery to support live TV services as well as Tencent who is expanding across Platform Equinix to support multi-cloud consumption. The cloud and IT services vertical saw continued momentum in bookings led by software and IT services. Our strategy is to become the home of the interconnected cloud, by increasing density and coverage of software-as-a-service providers and making it easy for enterprises to find and consume cloud services. We have over 2,800 cloud and IT service provider customers which now include over 1,000 software and software-as-a-service providers. Expansions in the quarter feature use cases for Security-as-a-Service, risk intelligence and managed services supporting multi-cloud. Customers leveraging these and other hybrid multi-cloud solutions include the top systems integrator Deloitte and the managed services provider, T-Systems. And turning to enterprise, this vertical remained our fastest growing with a record number of new logos and Fortune 500 wins. We're seeing double-digit growth in many of our sub segments including manufacturing, travel, healthcare, and government across a variety of use cases. For example, manufacturers are leveraging Equinix to transform network topology and localize traffic to improve performance, reduce cost and enable digital supply chains. We're currently working with a large number of global automobile manufacturers as they deploy infrastructure to support connected car initiatives. We see this trend developing into an ecosystem of information and content suppliers as new autonomous driving platforms are developed and deployed. This quarter, manufacturing customer wins included a Fortune 500 manufacturer deploying autonomous vehicle and IoT capabilities at the edge and Weyerhaeuser, a Fortune 350 manufacturer transforming their supply chain management to digital. We also saw a win in the healthcare segment with Shire, a leading pharmaceutical company connecting multiple clouds to use distributed analytics and hybrid data storage. Our channel efforts continue to bear fruit in our pursuit of enterprise business. Partner contributions to bookings grew for the 13th sequential quarter and now account for 17% with two-thirds of this activity from resellers. Our focused efforts on partner activation and joint offer development are driving more and more productivity. Partners are expanding our distribution and embedding Equinix into larger enterprise solution bundles. Reseller integrated solutions like Performance Hub are delivering more volume and more predictable deal flow. Enterprise new adds jumped up significantly year-over-year with 44% of these customers coming from our indirect channel. We are achieving our bookings targets with a growing base of smaller partner deals, building a more predictable and repeatable engine for enterprise pursuit. So in summary, I am pleased with our business performance this quarter and we continue to leverage the substantial benefits of our global reach and interconnected ecosystems. We remain highly confident that the Verizon transaction will create significant value for both our customers and our shareholders and create new opportunities as we build on these enterprise-rich assets. Going forward, we remain focused on our top three priorities : pressing our advantage, catching the next wave, and scaling our organization, all of which will enable Equinix to continue to capture the shift to the cloud and accelerate new customer wins. As part of our alignment around these priorities, Charles Meyers has taken a new role as President of Strategy, Services, and Innovation, leveraging his deep experience and knowledge of our business to lead the strategic business teams driving the company's next phase of growth. I look forward to continuing to work closely with Charles and the rest of the team to sharpen our focus on meeting the evolving and dynamic customer requirements that we face in the marketplace today. So, now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter and forward-looking guidance. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Good afternoon to everyone. As Steve highlighted, we had another solid quarter of bookings production across our entire platform. Also we had great new customer wins with the enterprise vertical being our best performing segment. Our key operating metrics continue to reflect the health of the business including firm MRR per cabinet across each of our operating regions, a very healthy increase in our net cabinets billing, and a record number of new logos added to our platform. Also, we're very excited about the closing of the Verizon asset acquisition, further strengthening our differentiated market position. The addition of the Verizon data center assets to our portfolio is and will continue to be accretive to our operating margins including adjusted EBITDA. And as previously discussed, it's accretive to our AFFO per share metric on day one excluding acquisition and integration costs. The productivity of the Americas sales force exceeded expectation this quarter with higher than planned bookings into the Verizon assets. Given this out of the gate performance, we're raising our Verizon acquisition revenues to now range between $490 million and $510 million for the first 12 months post close, continuing to take into consideration our prudent views on the need for estimated sales reserves and assumptions on forward-looking MRR churn. Adjusted EBITDA margins were expected to approximate 60% or greater, excluding the initial acquisition and integration costs. We also announced our first investment into the Verizon assets with the development of capacity in the NAP of the Americas or NOTA in Miami, a key interconnection hub servicing customer deployment directed at Latin America. NOTA, for those who are not aware, is a very large and highly utilized IBX of 5,500 cabinets including this initial expansion. But more importantly, there is sufficient incremental speed to add an additional 3,000 cabinets of capacity in future phases. This represents a perfect example of how we believe we can unlock incremental value from the Verizon assets. Also we want to fully leverage our expanded offering by connecting the Verizon assets on our platform, while up selling the 600 plus net new customers on our products and services across our global footprint, all this while also working hard to reduce the level of MRR churn previously experienced in the Verizon assets. Later this year, we plan to move forward with other expansions including Culpeper, our largest government-focused market, Denver, Houston, S\u00e3o Paulo, and our larger incremental expansion in NOTA. Finally, I'd like to note that Verizon is now one of our largest customers and it's helped to further diversify our revenues across customer, region and industry with this acquisition. We've also seen good progress with Verizon as a global reseller enabling us to leverage their substantial reach into the Global 2000 enterprises to build hybrid cloud solutions and gain quick access to our multi-cloud environment. For integration costs, we're updating our guidance to $52 million for 2017, which includes $22 million of cost related to Verizon asset acquisition and $30 million related to Telecity and Bit-isle. For Verizon, we're also pursuing an accelerated timeline to fully integrate these assets within a year. And the integration activities are well underway and on schedule. As it relates to both Telecity and Bit-isle integration efforts, we expect to complete these integrations later this year and continue to be very pleased with the benefits realized over the expanded platform into the European and Japanese markets. Now turning to the second quarter. Q2 was another strong quarter of operating performance. As depicted on slide 4, global Q2 revenues were $1.066 billion, up 3% over the prior quarter and 11% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis; our 58th straight quarter of revenue growth. This includes $87 million of revenues attributed to the Verizon assets for the last two months of this quarter. Q2 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $5.9 million positive currency benefit when compared to the Q1 average FX rates, and a $1.3 million positive currency benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. As it relates to the full year 2017 revenue guidance, we're raising our revenues to now range between $4.317 billion and $4.327 billion, a $19 million uplift including $8 million related to improved operating performance and then remainder attributed to favorable FX rates. This guidance implies our largest ever organic quarter-over-quarter constant currency step-up over the next two quarters, a reflection of our continued momentum in the business. Our global platform continues to expand with Asia-Pacific and EMEA showing normalized and constant currency growth over the same quarter last year of 15% and 12% respectively, while the Americas region produced steady growth of 8%. Our MRR per cabinet yield remained strong across all three regions. We added 2,900 net billable cabinets and 5,100 net cross-connects in the quarter. Global Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $509 million, up 10% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 49% excluding integration cost or 48% on an as-reported basis, a step-up over the prior quarter largely due to Verizon and higher seasonal cost last quarter. Adjusted EBITDA includes $15 million of combined integration cost consistent with our expectations. As it relates to full year adjusted EBITDA guidance, we're raising our adjusted EBITDA to now range between $2.038 billion and $2.048 billion, a $17 million increase, including $14 million related to improved operating performance and the remainder attributable to favorable FX rates. Our Q2 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, had a $3.1 million positive benefit when compared to the Q1 average FX rates, and an $800,000 negative impact when compared to our guidance rates. Global Q2 AFFO was $360 million, up 4% over the prior quarter and 17% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Now looking at MRR churn. Q2 global MRR churn, excluding Verizon was 2.4% in line with our expectations. Including Verizon, we continue to expect MRR churns average 2% to 2.5% per quarter for the rest of the year. Now, let me provide a few highlights on the regions for the quarter, whose full results are covered in slides 5 through 7. The Americas region had a solid bookings quarter with ongoing strong outbound production to the other two regions, as well as solid momentum into the Verizon assets. EMEA delivered record bookings with particular strength in our UK and German markets as well as strong cloud bookings as cloud service providers continue to add edge nodes across many of our metros. EMEA utilization remains the highest in the three regions with half of the company's current expansions going into European markets in response to this demand. Asia-Pacific revenues outpaced worldwide growth with strong momentum driven by the cloud and content verticals. Interconnection revenue growth continued to outpace overall growth of the business. The Americas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA interconnection revenues were 23%, 13% and 8% respectively of recurring revenues or 16% on a global basis. Now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to slide 8. Unrestricted cash and investments decreased to $1.1 billion, largely due to the $3.6 billion funding for the Verizon transaction in the quarter. Our net debt leverage ratio, net of unrestricted cash was 4.1 times our Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA. With the full benefit of Verizon and a favorable cash flow attributes of our business model, we except to return to our targeted leverage ratio of 3 times to 4 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA in the short-term. Also today, we announced a planned $750 million at the market ATM Program as part of our broader balance sheet capital strategy. This program will put another efficient and highly discretionary tool into our capital raising arsenal and should help the company progress its efforts towards investment grade rating. A goal that we believe will be highly valuable to both our debt and our equity investors. At this time, we currently don't have any plans to sell shares under our approved program largely due to our current cash balances yet. We felt it was important to initiate this program to create maximum flexibility with our capital sources given the momentum in our business and the speed at which the market is evolving. Also, we intend to pursue repricing of our term loan B debt over the coming weeks. Now, switching to AFFO and dividends on slide 9 and 10. For 2017, we expect our as-reported AFFO to be between $1.382 billion and $1.392 billion, a 29% year-over-year increase. The expected 2017 net FFO contribution from the Verizon asset acquisition is $84 million, which includes incremental Verizon adjusted EBITDA, plus interest expense, recurring CapEx and integration cost. On a normalized and constant currency basis, AFFO was expected to grow greater than 13% year-over-year demonstrating the continued strength of our operating model. On an as-reported AFFO per share basis, we now expect to deliver $17.92, which includes $52 million of integration cost. We've assumed a weighted average 77.4 million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. Excluding integration cost, AFFO per share is expected to be $18.59, a 1.4% increase over the prior guidance, continuing to highlight the day one accretive impact of the Verizon transaction. And turning to dividends, today, we announced our Q3 dividend of $2 a share. For 2017, we expect to pay out total cash dividends of approximately $612 million, a 24% increase over the prior year and a payout ratio of approximately 44%. Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to slide 11. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $349 million including recurring CapEx of $38 million, in line with our expectations. We opened eight new buildings or phases adding capacity in core markets including Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Paris, San Jose, and Singapore. We have 18 expansion projects underway as we continue to expand our global platform. For 2017, capital expenditures are now expected to range between $1.25 billion and $1.3 billion, which includes an incremental $100 million attributed to the Verizon assets. Our capital investments are delivering healthy growth and strong returns as shown in slide 12. Revenues from our 99 stabilized IBXs grew 6% year-over-year, largely driven by increase in cross-connects and power density. These stabilized assets are generating a 30% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested and the utilization rate increased to 83%. And finally, please refer to slides 13 through 17 for our guidance bridges and the updated Q3 and full year 2017 guidance. In closing, we had a solid performance in the first half of the year. We continue to strengthen our role as the interconnection market leader adding new cloud and network density thereby creating an even richer ecosystem for our customers and our partners. Our growth and scale are driving increased adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, hence cash flow, and we will continue to focus on creating sustainable shareholder value from our platform. So, I'm going to stop here and we're going to open it up for questions. Ash? Operator : Thank you, speakers. We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today's conference. And our first question comes from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, this is Richard for Phil. I wanted to get a little more color on the Verizon data center sales. Are you selling or are the sales being made to existing space or the space is being developed? And then can you give us a sense, you said you're expanding Culpeper and another NOTA expansion later on, is that going to impact 2017 CapEx or is that more spending in 2018? Thank you. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Hey, Richard. It's Charles. So yeah, no, the existing sales are into existing capacity because none of the new capacity expansions have actually been completed yet. So those are into existing capacity that was there at the time of the transaction closing, but to existing \u2013 but \u2013 and that's probably a combination of net new customers as well as existing customers into those facilities. But what really gives us a lot of encouragement is the fact that the sales team so quickly sort of came to grips with the assets and it showed the ability to sell into those so quickly. So that's very encouraging. As to the other expansions that we mentioned in the script whether that be Denver, Houston, S\u00e3o Paulo et cetera, any of that that happens in 2017 would be very, very small. Those are typically going to be further out and we will give you more updates as those come into focus. Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Kvaal from Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet : Yes. Thank you very much for taking the questions. I think partially as a result of my newness with the story, I have a question on your debt levels. I mean, would you gentlemen mind helping us understand when you might start thinking about what your next suite of acquisitions might be that would be helpful? Then as a clarification around that, I would love to know what kind of dilution to the share count you would be willing to tolerate with the ATM Program? Thank you. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Well, so we're going to tag team this, so Steve will respond a little bit about the M&A and then I'll double back with the ATM Program then I'll comment on the debt. So Steve, do you want to take the first part on the M&A? Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Sure. I'm happy to, Keith. Jeffrey, the M&A since you're new to the story, you may not realize that over the 18-plus years, we've actually done about 18 acquisitions in our history, most recently of course of Verizon, which you heard some color on today. But our main driver for acquisition activity, it usually follows a couple of big things. It's extending our networking cloud platform, that's a top priority for us and second, we're reaching new markets. And normally big sophisticated customers who will provide us opportunity, for example, big cloud providers to look at emerging markets. Our strategy historically has been focused on extending this thing we refer to as Platform Equinix. And there is three dimensions that normally are filters that we look at very closely, entering new markets as I just said, enhancing our interconnections is a second filter that we look very closely at. So, if we can deepen our interconnection like we did with the Verizon NOTA asset that Keith just talked about, that's a big factor for an acquisition filter for us. And then thirdly, if we can deepen and widen the cloud ecosystem that you heard so much about in the script, that's a big factor. New markets probably would include deeper into Southeast Asia, South Korea has been and will continue to be attractive for us. India is a big market we're not in today, we are continuing to study that market. And we're starting to see the big cloud providers going to South Africa and deeper into Latin America, so those are all of interest. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: So Jeff, let me touch on the second part of your question, which was really about the ATM, and how we choose to fund our acquisitions. From our perspective it's about driving shareholder value as the highest and best use of our capital. And so when we think about that, we're comfortably using debt, but equally at times we've used \u2013 we've used equity particularly in the Verizon case. We bought assets, but yet did a very highly accretive transaction. So having said all that, we'd like to find balance in our capital structure, something we think is incredibly important, particularly now as we drive more and more towards an investment-grade rated company. We think it can create immense incremental value to our shareholders if we can get to investment grade, because we have $9 billion in sort of gross debt if you will today. And so, we're going to continue to find that balance, because we think it's important. But having said that, when we think about the ATM Program, it's just another tool that the majority of RMZ \u2013 sort of REIT companies on the RMZ, it's a tool that they deploy. Yet as I said in my prepared remarks, there is no intention to draw on it over the short-term. But it's a tool that we wanted to get out there because the market is shifting very, very rapidly and we want to be in a position that we have that flexibility. Having said that, the ATM Program if we drew down all $750 million under sort of today's stock price, it'd be roughly 2% dilution. But I say that knowing that we have a $1.1 billion of cash in our balance sheet and we have an untapped revolving line of credit. And so, again we'll focus our capital strategies on, as Charles alluded to, continue to invest across our platform, certainly invest in some of the Verizon assets and the expansions there, buy some of our assets and buy incremental land and we'll look at M&A. And all of that, when we look at it all together, we're going to continue to sort of maintain that balance in the capital structure and so give ourselves the great flexibility that we're always so highly sought after. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet : Thank you, gentlemen and I look forward to following up. Operator : The next question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Charles, I know the announcement of your new role is only a couple of weeks old, but driving the company's next phase of growth, can you just elaborate a little bit on how you're thinking about that and what should we be looking for as you execute on that? Thanks. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. I mean I think as we've talked about in a couple of the comments here, there's probably never been a more dynamic time in our company and in our industry and we're seeing this digital transformation take hold and delivering exceptional benefits to customers and they're really at a rapid pace committing to hybrid-cloud and multi-cloud as their preferred IT deployment model, and we're seeing that in terms of the momentum in our core business. But at the same time, there is a bunch of emerging technologies and commercial trends and customer expectations, and technologies like IoT, like SDN, and NFV, AI, virtual and augmented reality, blockchain et cetera and those things are really \u2013 as we're looking at them and talking to our customers on a regular basis, those things are really poised to shift the power structure in a number of industries. And I think that along the way, they're probably going to call into question survival of certain key incumbents and they're going to give rise to really a flood of new entrants looking to capture a piece of that gold rush. And what we're seeing that LANs (36:47) changing the needs and expectations of what customers want from Equinix. And so we need to be prepared to respond to that and not only respond to it, but anticipate those changing needs and have them show up not only in our product roadmap, but in the fabric of our business model and the way we serve our customers. So, we decided to make a shift here, where we would align our resources to better simultaneously execute on the core business opportunity in front of us, as well as respond to the evolution of the business that we think is going on in a very dynamic world. So, still early days, I just had the team, sort of the new team together in all hands for the first time today. We're going to continue to look at sort of what I would refer to as theme-based innovation looking at some of those technology trends that are impacting our business and looking at how they integrate into our service portfolio. We're ahead of the game on some of these things. I mean, we've talked about things like SDN, where we were a very early adopter of that. Our ECX platform is based on that. And so, we're continuing to incorporate those things into our product portfolio and now with our fully integrated product team sort of living inside of this new SSI organization, we think we can move with higher velocity and better responsiveness to our customers. So, I am excited about it and we'll continue to update you as we make further progress on that, but I think it's something that we thought was important as the market continues to evolve. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays. Your line is now open. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. Two if I may. Keith, in thinking about sort of the EBITDA expansion capabilities particularly given as you integrate Verizon, how should we think about sort of the potential trajectory to get to that longer term target of 50%? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Amir, I mean, as you know exclusive of integration costs, this quarter, we're at 49%, so we're somewhat in sniffing distance of the 50% target. Having said that, as you and all the listeners on the phone are aware, the Verizon transaction set of assets will deliver 60%-plus EBITDA margins for us. So as we continue to scale it, it's going to be a highly accretive model. But also consistent with what Charles and Steve had talked about, we're also looking for ways to continue to provide a greater opportunity and efficiency in our existing model or the organic business, so between the combination of what we are doing and scaling off of that and having then augmenting off of the Verizon acquisition, I think you're going to see us get to that level of EBITDA probably sooner than you expected without giving you a timeframe. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Well, in thinking about that then, Keith, I mean is there a new sort of level that we can expect going forward given a lot of the elements that you had just mentioned as sort of a longer-term target? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: It's probably a little early to give you a new level of \u2013 a new target. But suffice to say we alluded to just one asset, which is NAP of the Americas and said we could add 3,000 incremental cabinets to that site alone. We've just even used simple math and said $2,000 a cabinet over 3,000 cabinets that's $72 million of incremental revenue just on that one asset driving a tremendous amount of margin to the bottom line. That's just one of our investment decision not to mention as Charles alluded to, Culpeper and other markets that we're certainly interested in that Verizon had a presence. So from our perspective, we're just going to continue to execute, we're going to continue to invest across our platform. In our prepared remarks, we talked a lot about the European theater in addition to not only the Verizon assets to give you a sense of the scale and magnitude of our business and how much we're expanding across our portfolio and it ties in nicely to what Charles is going to focus on making sure that we have our portfolio in a position to present to the customers as demand continues to scale across our global platform. It's not really just about the Americas. So I'm excited about what we can do. I think we can use a lot of the incremental cash flow not only to continue to deliver margin, but we can also put it back into the business to enhance our scale. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. And Keith, I'd just like to add that I think that in the context of my new role, in answer there to Simon, we continue to see the emergence of a set of opportunities and our role continues. As we've said, we're going to make what we think is a prudent decision as to if there is EBITDA expansion that comes from increased scale and productivity of the business, then our role is to assess how much of that we'd like to drop through and where we can use it to create long-term shareholder value. And we think there are a ton of opportunities in the market to expand our addressable market, and capture the \u2013 some of \u2013 for example, a very large incremental addressable market opportunity in the enterprise but that's going to require some evolution of our capabilities and some investments along the way and we've been making those investments, things like expanding our solution architect portfolio or team, globally things like expanding our development capability so we can make ECX as the leading cloud connectivity platform and looking at some of these incremental technology areas that we think represent transformational opportunities. Again, that's our view is we got to continue to look at those and make balanced call there and I think that's why we probably wouldn't want to anchor you on any particular future target. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks very much for the incremental color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Morgan from Canaccord. Your line is now open. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. Keith, you just mentioned when you're talking about the ATM that the market is shifting very rapidly and that was kind of one of the considerations when you were putting that in place. And is there any sort of kind of color you can provide like what types of shifts are leading you to kind of go down this route? I mean, you're talking about different types of acquisition opportunities or ramp up some of your expansions or just different types of investments? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah, Paul, it's really a combination of everything that Charles has just alluded to in his prior comments. The market is evolving and as we think about our opportunities, there is the aspect that is there incremental M&A. As you can appreciate in the marketplace, there is a tremendous amount of activity taking place. And so, we will always want to be poised to look at those, those transactions that make sense for us that create incremental shareholder value. And so, we absolutely like the deals that, sort of the Telecitys, the Verizons and many of the others, those were highly accretive deals. We want to continue to look at those opportunities where we can expand our platform and create incremental value for the shareholder. But we also want to buy more of our assets, we want to buy more land, we want to develop and probably we got more expansion in the hopper than we historically have. And so when you look at not only what we're doing today, but what we think we need to do tomorrow, we want to have that flexibility and it really is about going to market with knowing that we have debt capacity, we've got untapped cash, we've got untapped revolver. We still have debt capacity on our balance sheet. We have now this ATM program. It creates this tremendous flexibility as an organization and we can move with great speed and win on these opportunities that we're striving to gain. And so from our perspective, it's a tool and it's just a tool like anybody else. The other part though that we spend a lot of energy talking about is the fact that I think over the last two large deals coming to market with a very balanced view on debt versus equity and finding that balance bodes well, I think for ultimately improving our credit rating. And when you look at what the incremental \u2013 given our debt loads that we have today and what we think we can reduce our overall debt costs by as our debt matures is a substantial benefit to our shareholders. And so we didn't lose sight of that as well. We see that as an opportunity while we see the ATM as an opportunity to help us on that path. Again, we're going to be working real hard post this call to continue to \u2013 in front of our rating agencies and make sure they know what we're doing, so that we can get hopefully a leg up towards a positive rating at some point in the not too distant future. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Let me add \u2013 Charles, let me add here, I'm sorry I'm remote guys, but I think to Keith's points and Charles' comments earlier guys, Paul and team, we shouldn't underestimate just the concept of catching the next wave. And as Charles \u2013 I mean, this decision to move our Chief Operating Officer to lead creating more options for our future is at the heart of your question you're asking here, Paul, where is the market shifting. And so driving the next generation of interconnection, the next wave of cloud architectures shifting, this concept of edge computing is moving. All these things getting connected to the internet are going to cause more opportunity for Equinix. Everything is getting redefined by software, storage, security, networking. So all of these activities, Charles is going to have teams of people focused on these \u2013 already has people. We're going to combine them into one organization now to make sure that we're just looking further out and faster to create opportunity for our customers. The number one thing our customers are asking us for us to help them with this digital transformation that's taking place around the world at the top of the list. And so, that's at the heart of the market shift. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Gutman from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hi, thanks for taking the question. So I was hoping you could tell us a little bit more about the balance of cloud versus enterprise demand in the U.S. versus the other regions of the world, similarities and differences, and specifically if there are differences in terms of how the demand is coming and through which channel? And secondly, you talked a little bit about the submarine cable landings and I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about how, when those cable landing win could impact traffic in a specific facility? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Sure. So Rob, this is Charles. Let me take a crack of that and then Steve or Keith can add on to it as they wish. I would say that as we've seen for the last couple of years, cloud and enterprise have been the two segments that have over-indexed most consistently relative to their install base. So they are growing in terms of share of our overall business. Cloud is fuelled in part by build out from the cloud service providers from the hyperscalers on down, we are seeing a lot of success with the really large cloud players in terms of building out both their network nodes as well as they direct access nodes inside of Equinix facilities. We continue to lead in terms of overall share of those positions with the cloud players. EMEA, in particular, has seen particularly some strength over the last year and a half or so as sort of the wave of expansion has happened across EMEA in cloud. And so that's probably been the \u2013 cloud has really led the pace there in EMEA. But also a good strong performance as the cloud providers move from maybe their initial entry points in Asia, which would be typically either Singapore, Hong Kong or Tokyo into perhaps secondary markets like Sydney or Melbourne or Osaka, et cetera. So we're seeing strength in both of those markets, a little less \u2013 the cloud demand in the U.S. is probably that we had sought initial thrust a few years ago as the cloud built out in the U.S., we're probably seeing more while we still see success with, the larger players are seeing a longer tail of cloud service providers, SaaS providers sort of build out with us. And then I would say from an enterprise perspective, the U.S. is probably leading there. In terms of more, earlier adoption. There are a couple other markets around the world where we see really strong enterprise adoption of multi-cloud. Australia jumps to mind and so it varies across the businesses and the regions. But we are definitely seeing strength in this really an uptick of hybrid cloud, multi-cloud as the preferred IT deployment model. In terms of channel, definitely seeing an increased prominence of our indirect channel and partner channel as a way to capture those customers. They have a lot of those existing relationships. We've seen real strength in that in Asia and EMEA is sort of catching up there and seeing good performance. And we, of course, have a pretty well developed channel in the U.S. already. So, that's a little bit of color on sort of cloud and enterprise opportunity across the regions. As for the submarine cables, yeah, I don't know that I can quantify it precisely for you. But absolutely one of the key drivers of those, bringing those summary cables in is the fact that they have a ton of traffic that's going to come in that needs to be efficiently distributed from those points. And so, as an aggregation point, traffic tends to fuel our business. And so the ability to get these really big traffic aggregator points into our facilities and then drop them off into the 1,500 carriers that are used as well as the cloud providers, which are actually an increasingly prominent player in the submarine market is something we think is important and will absolutely drive continued ecosystem development in the markets where those are landing. Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Thank you. So, I guess kind of following up with Steve and perhaps Charles as you kind of think about helping customers navigate the digital transformation roadmap and your own product roadmap, to what extent might it makes sense to increase your ability to offer wholesale or larger footprint retail, that's my first question. And then secondly, a little bit more specific on Verizon. You talked about some ways to optimize the return of the 3,000 additional cabinets in Miami and in the Culpeper expansion. I'm interested in whether that Culpeper demand that you see is coming potentially from new customers at that site or existing customers are looking to expand. And then, as you look at the rest of that Verizon portfolio, is there any significant opportunity in the case of below market contracts or larger contracts where you could look to optimize your returns? Thanks. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Okay. Why don't I take the first crack and Steve jump in here anywhere you want. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Sure. You bet. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Absolutely, the wholesale I wouldn't even call it wholesale. What I would tell you is that, we have a set of customers that have larger footprint requirements. So, I guess, they do fit more into the traditional wholesale umbrella but they really are \u2013 they have a requirements that really go beyond that. They're looking for something that is very responsive to their needs, to scale their cloud services, and to reach the customers and the markets they want with flexibility and with predictability. And so we have definitely seen a larger pipeline of those types of customers that are saying, hey, we would like you to entertain working with us on those types of opportunities. And as you know we've been extremely selective about that in the past and have been very protective of the return profile of our assets. And so we have tended not to play. We certainly look at some that are strategic and have had good success and good win rates on those. But as we're seeing them, what the cloud providers need to change as the footprints even if their direct connect nodes, et cetera are evolving and their overall architectures evolve, we feel an increased need to work more aggressively with them. So it is something that we are actively looking at within the context of the new SSI organization, it's to say, hey, are there a very select set of customers and requirements on the sort of hyperscale side that we view as strategic that we would like to increase our appetite for and then what are the ways that we can do that both from a design and engineering and deployment methodology, as well as how we would finance those transactions. So, that is something that we're going to be looking at. We don't have a lot more to report than that right now other than that is something that we think is important and we'll update you guys as we get further along in that process. Relative to Culpeper and other things, I think it's probably a mix of both new customers as well as existing that we think they could sop up the additional capacity when we build that out. And definitely, we think there's a lot of new customers just because we bring our whole incremental customer base to the table now, who may be able to benefit from that capacity, and not necessarily just in Culpeper but, of course, in all of the other incremental Verizon markets where we would have capacity. And then the last question relative to pricing, yeah, I don't think there was a substantive gap at the pricing level, be either at interconnection or in the broader space in power pricing that would indicate some meaningful opportunity for normalization there. But we'll continue to look at whether those deals are priced in line with what we think is appropriate for the market and we'd make those adjustments, but we haven't seen a meaningful gap. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then if you could give us a little bit of a preview on the new cross connect product that I think you alluded to in the script, perhaps just a bit more detail? Thanks. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: I'm not sure, I think we made reference to the fact that we were going to be introducing \u2013 we would be announcing sort of additional benefits in terms of reach and future function on ECX. And so that's something that we're looking at in terms of how you would expand the reach, your ability to access ECX definitions, if you will, more easily across the Equinix's footprint. So, that's what we're referring to and you'll hear more about that in a more formal launch coming up in the coming weeks. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Hey, Jonathan. This is Steve, all right. And let me add one or two more things to Charles' point that I think are important. Verizon, in particular the Federal business, which I think most people in the call realize we're still in the process of clearing all the Federal Classified business, which is currently managed through TSA by Verizon. Once we get our clearances completed and all the appropriate innovation then we'll move forward with that. We are going to invest in a deeper bigger federal team. So, Karl Strohmeyer, who leads our Americas businesses is full speed ahead with that today. We pick up obviously this Verizon Federal business which will basically double our business. And so, it will give us a substantial footprint into the government segment that we haven't had in the past and we're pretty excited about that. We're moving as fast as we can with the clearances and the positioning for that. And then, just one other piece, on the wholesale question that you had which is not a phrase that we use a lot around Equinix, but Charles is going to have accountability for really watching that next wave of cloud with his new team, and as he stated, we will start to play in a different way as we move to the next several quarters and years, as the next wave of cloud unfolds and we look at where these aggregation points and the edge goes, et cetera, et cetera. So, you'll probably see Equinix taking a more active role in positioning ourselves for extending the interconnection footprint to where these aggregation points matter, and how they evolve with and how the edge moves, and how these hyperscalers deploy this next wave of computing. So, I would tell you to stay tuned. We're going to be very active. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Colby Synesael from Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. I guess. I have two boring questions on guidance based on all the other questions that have been asked here. So the first one is on the Verizon portfolio. If I take the second quarter $87 million and make that a full quarter it's about $130 million and if I assume that you do $130 million in both the third and fourth quarter that would have implied that you'd be about $347 million for 2017. Yet you're guiding to $330 million to $340 million. So I'm wondering why you're assuming the Verizon business slows in the third and fourth quarter, particularly after you mentioned comments that the bookings have been strong out of the gate? And then, on AFFO, if I again look at your guidance, it implies you're assuming you'll be about $360 million, $361 million if I assume it's flat in both the third and fourth quarter, which is in line with what you did in the second quarter. So, again, I'm wondering why that's not expected to grow or even potentially go down in the third quarter before coming back up in the fourth quarter. Thanks. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Great, Colby. So let me take the first one. As I said in my prepared remarks, we've taken a very prudent view as it relates to the Verizon assets having only wholly-owned or build to customers for the first two months since the transaction close. We've taken a prudent view to make sure that we continue to have appropriate sales reserves, even more so, continue to make an assumption and there's an underlying assumption that we will continue to see churn in the Verizon business, notwithstanding the fact that we had some nice momentum in our bookings in the second quarter. And so one it's just about being prudent. Again, we don't have the history, the customers are receiving invoices from Equinix for the very first time broken out in our format, and we taken a point of view, this is a range and we're going to guide you to that. And what I would just say is, as it relates to \u2013 look, if we don't need the reserves then we're going to be moving towards the top end of the range. To the extent we need the reserves then we're going to keep you inside the range. But it just gives us great comfort that we've got a prudent view on what we think the numbers could be. Again, our focus is going to be to not let that happen but, as you know, again, we don't have the history with the Verizon customers. As it relates to AFFO, again, it's timing of expenses. Not only it relates to the organic business but more specifically the Verizon business. And if you recall, when we bought the asset, it was an asset purchase and for all intents and purposes we had some transition services agreement with Verizon. But there is an underlying assumption that we make a heavy investment in the cost model through Q3 and Q4, and that's having an impact on the AFFO and hence EBITDA. Again, there's an assumption, we're going to hire a lot more heads and we're going to do a lot more R&M. Two things that were not particularly prevalent inside the Verizon, the Verizon asset portfolio prior to our acquisition, so those are the reasons. So, again, stay tuned to the third quarter. We're excited about what we're doing. And again, if we can get our hands around it, I'm optimistic that it's just a prudent reserve that's in place. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from Mike McCormack from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks. Steve, maybe just elaborate a bit on \u2013 you keep mentioning sort of the next wave and what might be down the road. The various things that you're seeing there, whether or not there might be and we talked about SDN, but potentially like an IoT type opportunity or maybe something in the wireless side with the 5G rollout. Is there anything that you guys can benefit from with those things? Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Well, as Charles said, all those areas we are customer and market sensing, have been for a couple, well, few years now. And we're going to collect those organizations under this new organization with Charles. And, yes, all those things you mentioned are happening. And so we've lived with six years or seven years of a wave, we call it kind of the first wave in cloud and we think there's another wave coming. Obviously, the big hyperscalers and the cloud providers have learned from their first wave of deployments. And so, how that architecture is going to look the next wave, is going to be different. They're going to start doing in their emerging countries. They've learned from their first several years of deployment on how to install their availability zones and their network nodes, and their access points, and their private connections. And so, there is a shift in the architecture and the edge of their deployment is shifting. And so, we're watching all that. We're working very closely with all of them, as you guys know. And yes, we want to position to move quickly as they continue to deploy and we think it's still very, very early. And I think the other side of that will be these IoT edge control points, if you will, they're going to start to form. All these things are going to be connected to the cloud and are going to require storage, networking and server infrastructure all over the world to drive connected cars, connected tractors, sensors, cameras, all these things that are going to get connected to the cloud and to the internet. So, all of those things Charles has all the teams that are watching all that and we're market and customers sensing those as fast as we can to make sure that we can provide products and services for the next generation of all that stuff and at the heart of that is interconnection and ecosystems. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks, Steve. Katrina Rymill - Equinix, Inc.: That concludes our Q2 call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : That concludes today's conference.

Smith]: Okay. Thank you, Katrina. And good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. I'm very pleased to share our strong results for the quarter. Our business is performing well as we capture the shift to the cloud and continue to win by providing unparalleled global reach, strong interconnection capabilities, and high service quality. Robust demand on Tier-1 markets is driving higher utilization levels and we are investing in support of this momentum with additional builds and continued land purchases, particularly in our top tier markets. This is complemented by targeted inorganic activity to expand our footprint and extend our scale into more key markets. Strong execution of our strategy is translating to rapid growth in our customer base and our go-to-market teams added record new wins across every vertical with notable outperformance from enterprise and financial services customers. As customers embrace hybrid and multicloud as the IT architecture of choice, our interconnection strength is resonating, and Equinix continues to outpace market growth and gain share. Our healthy bookings in the third quarter were fueled by strong growth in our network and enterprise verticals, in particular strength in both the European and Asia-Pacific regions. As depicted on slide 3 of our presentation, third quarter revenues were $1.152 billion, up 10% from the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $550 million for the quarter, up 10% over the same quarter last year, and AFFO growth was 16% year-over-year. These growth rates are in a normalized and constant currency basis, and demonstrate our strong operating performance. Interconnection revenues grew 17% year-over-year, continuing to outpace colocation revenues and reflecting the success of our interconnection and ecosystem centric strategy. We saw a healthy pace of cross-connect ads with over 248,000 cross-connects now deployed. Our Internet Exchange platform, the largest in the world, continues to see healthy growth with traffic volumes up 17% year-over-year, as customers begin to scale capacity in 100 gig port increments. We also saw traction with the Equinix Cloud Exchange, now serving over 950 customers and delivering strong EMEA growth this quarter. Our product strategy is leveraging our unique position in the market as a global interconnection platform for enterprises and service providers of all kinds. We are currently pursuing opportunities to strengthen our interconnection leadership, including expanding the geographic reach of our services, as well as adding new features that provide customers additional flexibility, choice and commerce enablement support. These new offerings are in beta and some will be coming out to market formally before the end of this year. Our geographic reach is unmatched and continues to grow with our global footprint now extending to 190 data centers across 48 markets, comprising over 19 million gross square feet of capacity. Our top-10 customers are deployed on average in 60 IBX facilities and represent the largest cloud, networks and enterprises in the world. This metric is increasing and speaks to both our investment in systems and processes to ensure a globally consistent customer experience, as well as the needs of our customers for a distributed digital edge. This quarter, over 59% of our revenue came from customers deployed across all three regions, up from 58% last quarter, while 84% came from customers deployed across multiple metros. We remain committed to pressing our advantage globally through targeted acquisitions. And early in the fourth quarter, we closed two new transactions in EMEA. We purchased Itconic, a leading connectivity and cloud infrastructure solutions provider in Spain and Portugal for approximately $253 million. This purchase adds five data centers, and extends our footprint into two new European countries. It adds more than 400 customers including many marquee enterprise brands, and more than 100 network and mobile providers. The deal also gives us access to key locations where subsea cables land and connect through Iberia, positioning us to support the growth in direct traffic between Europe, Africa and Latin America and further extends our leadership position in the subsea market. We also expanded in Turkey, purchasing our second IBX in Istanbul for $93 million. This owned data center further strengthens the Equinix's position in Istanbul, a strategic gateway between Europe and Asia with critical economic and geopolitical importance. It provides Equinix with key capacity in a campus environment, and a growth path which enables us to address continued demand for colocation and interconnection services in Turkey. The Verizon data center acquisition completed in May continues to gain momentum. These assets have dramatically boosted our scale in the Americas, delivering strong performance out of the gate across all metrics. We are addressing pent-up demand by unlocking capacity in key facilities, and have approved new expansions in both Miami's NAP of the Americas and in Denver and expect to move forward shortly with additional capacity expansions in the coming year. We have made progress to stem the previous level of churn, and are enjoying significant success cross-selling into the Verizon assets from Equinix customers. Our federal business is also progressing nicely, and we are growing the team to support this opportunity as we scale in this sector. Integration of the Verizon assets is moving quickly and we expect to have the majority of this work done by year-end. Early this quarter, we cut over from Verizon systems to the Equinix operating systems for all 29 data centers, marking a significant milestone for the integration program. We recognize with pride the incredible planning and execution work that all teams have completed to reach this point. As it relates to both the Telecity and Bit-isle integrations, we have now completed the vast majority of these efforts and have recognized substantial benefits from the expanded platform in our European and Japanese markets. Now, let me make a few comments on our organic development activity. We recently opened two new IBX's in Ashburn and Hong Kong adding capacity in some of our most important and interconnection rich campuses. We have 22 expansion projects underway across our platform, half of which are in EMEA, currently our most utilized region. We also purchased our D\u00fcsseldorf DU1 asset for $16 million and are progressing well with additional land purchases in EMEA and the United States. Revenues from owned assets now represent 43% up from 42% last quarter highlighting continued progress in this metric. Our capital investments are delivering healthy growth and strong returns as shown on slide 4. Revenues from our 99 stabilized IBX's grew 5% year-over-year largely driven by increasing cross-connects and power density. These stabilized assets are generating 30% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested and utilization moved up to 84%. Now let me shift gears and cover the highlights from our industry verticals. We are pleased with our progress across our industry verticals as we see seed and curate high value ecosystems. As digital business transformation permeates across all industries, we added a record number of new wins across every vertical this quarter through our channel and direct sales teams. We also added 10 new Fortune 500 wins across enterprise and financial, including a multinational pharmaceutical company, deploying performance hubs for real-time analytics and data management and a global retailer integrating business platforms to enable in-store insights. Now starting with the networks. Our network vertical achieved its third consecutive record bookings quarter. Growth in this vertical is being driven by cable and satellite TV operators as they upgrade their infrastructures to support increased traffic volumes and compute requirements driven by video-on-demand, streaming and other digital services. In addition, many of our global carrier customers are extending coverage in multiple metros and adding Cloud Exchange to their portfolio of services. Expansions this quarter included Charter Communications, China Telecom, Telstra and Verizon. We also see momentum within the subsea space, Seaborn Networks and Aqua Comms two leading subsea cable operators in Latin America and EMEA are interconnecting their submarine cable systems within Equinix's Secaucus campus. This solution will now create the most direct route between Brazil, New York, and London, three of the most vibrant financial exchange markets in the world. In financial services, we continue to diversify capturing growth not only in capital markets but also in insurance and commercial banking sub-segments. This vertical is experiencing strong digital transformation. Firms continue to shift to cloud-based self-service and to distribute customer and risk analytic platforms across multiple locations. In addition, privacy and compliance regulations are driving increased requirements to manage distributed data. Customer wins and expansions included American Family Insurance one of the largest property and casualty insurance groups and Invesco, a Fortune 500 investment management firm expanding to support mobile applications. In content and digital media vertical, we saw solid bookings led by the Asia Pacific region and healthy growth in gaming, e-commerce and publishing. Globally, we continue to see expansion of the advertising ecosystem, enabling of the digital content in the cloud and acceleration of the transformation of content to the edge. Additionally, Chinese content led hyperscalers are increasingly utilizing Platform Equinix to support their growing user requirements, placing content closer to the edge to reduce latency and optimize the user experience. Expansions this quarter included Alibaba, Baidu, Blade, Netflix, Priceline and Tencent. The cloud and IT services vertical saw a continued strength this quarter, particularly with software-as-a-service providers, expanding at Equinix including, Oracle, SAP and Salesforce.com, all of whom can be reached with virtual private interconnections over the Equinix Cloud Exchange. Cloud service providers are re-architecting their networks, further expanding their customer aggregation points with additional access nodes and bringing more core services to the edge. We have the leading share of cloud edge deployments by a wide margin and our global platform is designed to meet the increasing need that many enterprises have for hybrid cloud architectures. And finally, turning to the enterprise vertical, we saw strong growth in the majority of our sub-segments, led by EMEA, as customers begin to expand from single site, single cloud connections to multi-site, multi-cloud deployments. Enterprise use of cloud connectivity continues to evolve, addressing numerous use cases including performance improvement, cost reduction, security enhancement and digital enablement. New wins and expansions included Walmart which continues to invest in digital commerce, utilizing cloud deployments and Westrock, a Fortune 500 global packaging solutions provider. Our focused channel efforts are paying off with 19% of bookings originating from the channel this quarter. Partners are starting to build their value added services around our core offerings including Cloud Exchange and Performance Hub. We are working together with these resellers to productize our joint offering to bring to our customers the benefits of the Equinix infrastructure enhanced by our partner services. Examples of joint offerings include Datapipe delivering reliable voice-over-IP to Ontario Systems as well as NetApp and Datalink working with Equinix to serve a Medical Association customer with a multicloud disaster recovery solution. We believe the continued development of our channel is a critical lever to providing us reach and scale to drive sustained revenue growth and increase our market share. So, let me stop here for a minute and turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone. I'd like to start by highlighting that we had another very solid quarter of bookings across our entire platform. As planned, we had our highest gross bookings production this quarter with particular records in both the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions, as well as our network vertical. And our net bookings were consistent with our expectations. Our key operating metrics remained strong including firm MRR per cabinet. Also, we had a nice step up in net cabinets billing and net cross-connect additions. We continue to extend our platform reach and depth with strategic acquisitions, and our recently completed Itconic transaction marks our 20th acquisition to-date. The strategic rationale for the Verizon asset acquisition continues to play out strengthening our global market leadership and giving us additional capacity to meet customer demand. These assets continued to be accretive to our operating margins including adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, and we're working hard to reduce the level of MRR churn previously experienced in this business. As we progress with the integration and asset level reviews, we continue to take a prudent view on our needs for sales reserves and estimates for forward-looking churn. The Americas sales force is delivering a combined strong performance with higher than planned bookings into the Verizon assets. Overall, we've raised our key guidance results to reflect the strength of our platform including raising revenue specifically attributed to the Verizon assets. For integration costs we're updating our guidance to $54 million for 2017, which includes $22 million of costs related to the Verizon asset acquisition, $30 million related to Telecity and Bit-isle and $2 million for our Itconic and Istanbul 2 expansions. Now turning to the third quarter. Q3 was another strong quarter of operating performance. As depicted on slide 5, Global Q3 revenues were $1.152 billion, up 3% over the prior quarter and 10% over the same quarter last year. This includes $137 million of revenues attributed to the Verizon assets. Do note that all growth rates in this section are normalized in constant currency. Q3 revenues ahead of our FX hedges included a $10 million positive currency benefit when compared to the Q2 average FX rates and an $8 million positive currency benefit when compared to our FX guidance rate due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. Our Global platform continues to expand with Asia-Pacific and EMEA showing growth over the same quarter last year of 13% and 12% respectively, while the Americas region produced a steady growth of 8%. We added a healthy 4,500 net billing cabinets. A meaningful step up from last quarter and we added 5,700 net cross-connects in the quarter, a continuation of our strength across our interconnection service offerings. Global Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $550 million, up 10% over the same quarter last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 49% excluding integration costs, or 48% on an as-reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA includes $14 million of combined integration cost, lower than our expectations. Our Q3 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, had a $5 million positive benefit when compared to the Q2 average FX rates, and a $4 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates. Global Q3 AFFO was $391 million, up 16% over the same quarter of last year, and absorbs the modestly higher recurring capital expenditure number. Q3 global MRR churn was 2.3% including Verizon. We expect our fourth quarter MRR churns to continue to be in the 2% to 2.5% range. And now, I'd like to provide a few highlights on the regions for the quarter, which the results are covered in slides 6 through 8. The Americas region saw solid revenue and adjusted EBITDA from both the organic business and the Verizon assets, an outcome attributed to having a diverse set of 87 assets across the Americas platform. And our fill rate and core interconnection metrics all improved quarter-over-quarter. Our team has also weathered two major hurricanes in Houston and Miami with no customer outages or any significant damage due to the team's dedication and strong planning. EMEA delivered its third quarter of record bookings lead by our cloud vertical, as service providers expand across additional markets. Sustained growth is driving the next wave of campus expansions in our major EMEA markets, as well as many of the former Telecity metros for 2018. Asia-Pacific delivered record bookings with strong performance in Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore. We also saw exports driving deals to other regions, particularly from the Chinese and Korean firms as their brands expand globally. The Americas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA interconnection revenues were 22%, 14% and 9% respectively of recurring revenues, or 16% on a global basis. Now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to slide 9. We continue to optimize our capital structure and take advantage of the currently low interest rate environment. This quarter we re-priced $1.8 billion of term loan B debt at lower rates exceeding our expectations. In September, we raised \u20ac1 billion at very attractive interest rates to both refinance our 2020 high-yield notes and to fund our continued investment in support of the demand that we see across our regions. Selectively, these two financing transactions provided incremental $700 million of capital without increasing our annual interest rate expense. Our average rate of borrow across our key debt instruments is now 4.2% and we continue to believe a push investment grade is important to further drive down our borrowing costs and therefore increase our cash flows and accordingly AFFO and AFFO per share. Unrestricted cash and investments increased to $1.6 billion, largely due to the incremental capital raised. Our net debt leverage ratio, net of unrestricted cash was 3.9 times or Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA has step down into our target leverage range. Turning to slide 10 \u2013 pardon me. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $320 million including recurring CapEx of $45 million in line with our expectations. Currently, we have 22 new construction projects underway adding capacity in 16 markets around the world. The level of build is in response to strong supply and demand conditions across our operating markets, the depth of our pipeline and the level of inventory consumed over the past few quarters. We've recently opened nine new buildings or phases adding capacity in core markets including Amsterdam, Dallas, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, London, and Toronto. And finally, please refer to slides 11 through 16 for our summary of 2017 guidance and our bridges. For the full-year 2017, we're raising our revenue guidance by $37 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance by $10 million, an uplift that's a combination of improved operating performance, FX benefits and EMEA acquisitions. This guidance implies organic revenues will have a growth rate of 11% year-over-year and healthy adjusted EBITDA margin of 47%. The momentum of our business continues to drive AFFO and the AFFO per share. We're raising our 2017 AFFO guidance by $28 million. On a normalized and constant currency basis, AFFO is expected to grow 14% year-over-year. On an as reported AFFO per share basis, we're raising expectations to deliver $18.26 per share. We have an assumed weighted average of 77.5 million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis, including integration costs, AFFO per share is expected to be $18.97 a 2% increase over our prior guidance. Turning to dividends. For 2017, we expect to pay out total cash dividends of $612 million, a 24% increase over the prior year and an AFFO payout ratio of approximately 43%. Consistent with the prior quarter, the Q4 cash dividend is expected to be $2 per share and will be paid out on December 13. And finally, we expect our 2017 capital expenditures to now range between $1.3 billion and $1.32 billion, So, I'll turn the call back to Steve. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Keith. So in closing, we continue to deliver solid performance this year. Our strategy is working and we are executing at a high rate as we expand the depth, scale and reach of Platform Equinix and see continued momentum in existing and emerging ecosystems. The metrics that reflect our unique value continue to increase, including our multi-region customer deployments, traction with Fortune 500 customers and interconnection penetration. We are accelerating the growth of our ecosystems by bringing more network and cloud service providers to Platform Equinix, expanding the growth of our indirect channel and enhancing our product set to position our company to deliver even greater value to our customers going forward. So let me stop here, and we'll open it up for questions. I'll turn it over to you, Christine. Operator : Thank you. At this time we'll begin the Q&A session. And our first question is from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Just looking at some of the logos that you're highlighting, typically the names out of China, how meaningful a change is that in these names, you're seeing a big shift there, and then sort of a follow up on with Asia. Talk to us a little about the traction from the Bit-isle transaction. How is that tracking relative to the expectations with that acquisition? Thanks. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Okay, Frank. This is Steve. Why don't I start and then Keith and Charles can add here. So the logos that we refer to out of China, we're spending a dedicated amount of time with the large hyperscalers in China that are now expanding on a global basis. And so we have been over the last several quarters starting to win footprint with companies like Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba et cetera that are expanding their footprint, access nodes, network nodes, more compute around the world to enable their commerce enablement around the world. So we've been on that journey for quite some time and this quarter was another great quarter of wins with those three, for example, but there's others. We have very small teams in Korea and also in Beijing, where we don't have assets today that are working with companies in those markets, South Korea that are exporting deals out around the world. So we had some pretty good wins this quarter also at South Korean companies and companies from Beijing, that are deploying infrastructure around the world. So the cross-border activity is working very, very well for us. Anything else on the logos from China, guys? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Well, I would add one more on the China, I think, which is \u2013 and it's not unique to China, but it is that this is a typical pattern for us, which is when we often work with players, in their home market, often they don't have an immediate need for us. They may either own data center assets or they may have other partners that they're using. But, we go in with that global value proposition and as they expand our business globally, they need somebody to help them do that. And we've been very successful in winning these customers, not only in their content digital media businesses, but in their cloud aspirations, and that's been a major impact. And now, what happens and this happens a lot is we win that business, gain credibility with them and then often come back to the home market and are able to win business due to our extended relationship. And so, that's definitely something we're seeing. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: And Frank, let me just finish off with the question on Bit-isle. Clearly, as Steve alluded to we've almost fully integrated the Bit-isle asset and no surprise given our messaging we've been very pleased with the combination of that asset into our Japanese business. We've been able to sell off a number of the subsidiaries and assets that they own, that were not core to our go forward plan. So when you look across if you will the Japanese platform, we've been extremely pleased with how we performed and in fact, what we've seen is an actual uptick in Japanese activity across that broader platform, so we will continue to invest in the market and all I can say right now is we're very pleased with that transaction and we're happy we closed it. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Next question is from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan, your line is now open. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks. It looks like the Verizon acquisition is going even better than expected. Can you dig more into what's driving that upside? It sounds like churn mitigation in particular is helping? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah, Phil, there is a number of things that are certainly going well with the transaction. One of the things we said in the last earnings call, we continue to keep some level of conservatism or prudence in our guidance on a go-forward basis, is that we're seeing less churn and we've had to use less sales reserves than historically planned, so that's certainly a positive. But, I think the flip side is that we're selling, we're actually seeing gross activity where we're selling more into the business than we originally planned. We're selling across that platform, as you know there is 600 net new customers. We're building out infrastructure where we can. We've recently announced an additional build in Miami's NAP of the Americas, the Denver asset as we're creating a lot of opportunity for ourselves. At the same time, we're putting a lot of focus on these assets, so when you take up sales force like we have, combine it with the Verizon assets and our assets, you have an opportunity to do better. And so, when we started out offering guidance, it's just fair to say that we're conservative, we took a view that we wanted to understand the business better. For the very first time, those customers are getting invoices from Equinix on an un-bundled basis relative to what they experienced with Verizon. And so, we're delighted with where we ended the quarter, $137 million of revenues that annualizes out to just under $550 million. But, we're taking a view for Q4 that we're still going to be in that ZIP code of $130 million to $140 million of revenue for the fourth quarter and that's why we're holding our position because of our concerted view, our prudent view on incremental churn potential and/or the need for higher sales reserves. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : It seems like your gross.... Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. I might add two things. One, asset acquisitions like this \u2013 we're finding is a really ideal scenario in that, you don't have to do a sales force integration, move accounts around, figure out who's on first base, et cetera. Instead, you take the assets in, you say this is available capacity, we enable our sales team to come up to speed on that quickly, and begin selling into it aggressively. And we definitely saw that. In fact, I think we probably were a bit surprised at how effective the sales force was in immediately positioning these assets to their customers. And obviously, there's some tremendously high-quality assets in that portfolio. And then you combine that with the fact that now these customers who had their services with the provider who they were questioning their long-term commitment to that business are now in a position of saying this is a customer who's absolutely committed to this, it's central to what they do, it's the only thing they do, they're the market leader, and they have an increased level of confidence to go ahead and spend behind that. And those two things in combination I think have really fueled the acquisition's performance. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thank you for the question. So, so far you've announced multiple data center facilities that have direct subsea cable landing point connections. Could you give us a better idea on the economics of these facilities? So, for instance, can you charge customers higher rates at these locations versus the rest of the IBXs? Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Well, this is Steve. Let me just kind of give you a baseline of there's \u2013 we've mentioned this in previous calls that there is some 40 to 50 subsea cable projects that have been going on for several quarters. We've announced several wins to date. Our intent around these is to help land these cables that today the technology is so advanced they can bring them further inland to where our data centers are located. We look very attractive because we have so many data centers located around the world. And once they turn these cables on, some of it will be dedicated, some of it would be undedicated, and the notion is that we can charge \u2013 we can obviously monetize space, power, and interconnection as they move that traffic around the world. So it's a very good win for us to land these things initially, but then when they finally turn these cables on, we're going to be able to interconnect that information and all that social media traffic and mobile traffic that all these hyperscalers are predicting are going to traverse the earth over the next decade. So a lot of the business is to come. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. It's a classic ecosystem play for us, right, which is we typically aren't going to generate the superior returns on the magnets themselves. It's on the ecosystem around that and a lot of these facilities are either in and of themselves or directly tethered to broader network, because this traffic comes in and, by the way, intercontinental traffic continues to explode because of the global nature of the economy. And so now once that data reaches the shores of where it's headed, it needs to be distributed cost effectively and efficiently, and that's really where we shine. And so I think that what we're able to do is monetize around those things and continue to attract people as a strategic point of aggregation. Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it, got it. And then on Equinix Cloud Exchange, I was hoping you could give us an idea on how big this service as a percent of revenues currently is? Is it accelerating as a percent of total revenues currently? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yes. It's definitely accelerating. We have not broken it out, and I think we'll continue to evaluate whether that's appropriate to do. But it is definitely growing faster. If you look at interconnection overall 17%, which is clearly over-indexing, and Cloud Exchange is beginning to become a material contributor to the overall performance of the interconnection business. So, yeah, we're very pleased with that. It is a central hook in terms of being in the bag of our sales teams. When they go and say, 'Hey, are you implementing hybrid and multi-cloud as the architecture of choice? Let us talk to you about how Cloud Exchange can fit into that picture.' And so we're seeing really good momentum, both in terms of ports sold and particularly importantly, virtual circuits on those ports and traffic on the virtual circuits. So we monitor all of those things and all of those metrics continue to trend very nicely for us. Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. All right. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. You line is now open. Vincent Chao - RUBICON Technology Partners LLC : Yeah. Hey, guys. Just wanted to go back to the Verizon question for a second. It sounds like things are going quite well there. Guidance does imply a bit of a downturn in the fourth quarter, and I know there is some conservatism baked in, but just curious if there is anything specifically that's known that would cause that decline quarter-over-quarter? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah, Vincent, I think very similar to what we did last quarter. As you know, we were running at a little bit higher level than what we guided to and no different this quarter. We're only two quarters into billing the customers. We're in the process of collecting those invoices. As I said on the prior question, the customers are receiving for the very first time unbundled invoices from Equinix. And as a result, as we work with the customers to make sure that we pay, we're agreeing all the terms and conditions and, if you will, the detailed line items, this is just us taking a prudent view as we look forward. And if I can then sort of analogize it to this acquisition to an acquisition we did in 2010 with Switch & Data, it took us almost 2.5 years to fully inventory all the assets. And so this is a process that we will be working with our local teams, to make sure we inventory them, yet at the same time as we invoice the customers, we want to make sure there's an appropriate reserve in-place for future potential churn but also sales reserves for things that are uncollectible. And again, this is us just being prudent with our guidance recognizing we are running a little bit faster than we've guided for Q4. Vincent Chao - RUBICON Technology Partners LLC : Okay. Thanks for that. And then just maybe another question. Last quarter we spent some time talking about another wave or second wave of hyperscalers or hyperscale demand. It sounds like you did pretty well with that category this quarter. Could you potentially elaborate a little bit on how you are looking to change, how you approach that second wave, and try to capture it going forward? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah, Vincent. This is Charles. So we see continued sustained demand from hyperscalers. I mean, we're having great success in selling them on various elements of their architecture. Our particular focus has always been on their network nodes and their private interconnection nodes, which we think are a central piece of building the cloud ecosystem and creating magnetism and fueling the ecosystem strategy that we have been so successful with. We also, though, are seeing continued large footprint demand particularly from the hyperscalers. And as you know, we've been pretty selective about that business in the past, but we're hearing those hyperscalers, say 'Look, we really would like you to step up and provide some of those elements of our architecture in key locations for us as in our partner of choice, as an infrastructure partner of choice for us.' And we believe that stepping up and being more aggressive in that with a very select set of customers is the appropriate move for us. Their architectures are evolving in ways that we want to make sure that we're anticipating and staying in front of. We really feel like we need to maintain centrality in the cloud ecosystem, and these players, the ones that as you might imagine, are the ones we're focused on, are shaping that ecosystem quite aggressively. And so, what we're going to do is we're going to say, 'Look, we will work with you. We'll allocate some of our capital towards large footprint demand with those customers. We will optimize design construction, and deployment of those facilities to meet their needs. And then we'll be creative about how we finance that in terms of probably some combination over time of both on balance sheet and off balance sheet financing, which gives us the leverage that we need to serve those needs. So that's what we're up to. We're continuing to staff a team to help us do that effectively. The response from those customers has been extremely positive. And so we'll keep you updated as we continue to progress with that. Vincent Chao - RUBICON Technology Partners LLC : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is now open. Michael I. Rollins - Citi Research : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was curious if you could expand a bit more on what you were describing in terms of the interconnection products that you're looking to beta. And if you could talk a bit about the enterprise experience in your facilities of using the cloud and what you're seeing in terms of the evolving interconnection density from that? Thanks. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yes, Mike, I'll comment on that one and I think probably all of us having spent a lot of time with customers can comment on some of the enterprise applications that we're seeing really fuel the demand and particularly strengthen our new logo capture, which as you saw, we set records across all of our verticals in that regard. But starting with your question relative to the interconnection product portfolio, as you might imagine, we bring some very unique strengths to the table in terms of geographic coverage as well as cloud density. And what we've been hearing from our customers is, 'Look, we want to take full advantage of that. And so that's really what we've gone to work on and sharpened our pencil about saying, 'How do we provide ubiquity of access to the cloud destinations that our customers need from a geographic standpoint and from a cloud destination standpoint? And how do we make that as easy to use and consume as possible?' And so I'll kind of just leave it there and tell you, those are the areas of focus that we have in terms of extending the portfolio, and I would ask you to sort of keep your eyes out for more formal announcements that will be coming towards the end of this quarter. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: And, Mike, on your second question, I'll give you just a sense of some of the use cases that we're starting to see come in from the industry verticals. In the enterprise, we're seeing use cases that are around migrating to the hybrid cloud as you would expect as much as much positioning as we do with that. We've got retailers that are really pushing hard into digital commerce and creating the stores of the future. We have pharmaceutical companies that are deploying our performance hubs and looking for real-time analytics and data management capability. In the financial industry, it's across the board. We've got connecting to multiple cloud cases, we've got investment firms that are doing that. They're deploying our performance hubs to extend their reach across multiple regions. In the cloud industry we're seeing all kinds of use cases from the cloud providers from security to storage to compute to governments that are actually using us around the world for all kinds of things, from healthcare applications to back to the security to DDoS and WAF capabilities, and they're finding that inside of our data centers with our partners and with us partnering with the providers of those services. Network probably is \u2013 we had a very good quarter as we mentioned in finance and network, with the networks they're upgrading their backbones and they're moving to SDN and NFV, and so we're starting to see deployments towards a 100-gig and the networks are really starting to extend reach around the world with us for next-generation deployment of services, all oriented towards their capability to work with their cloud providers closer. So we're seeing all kinds of use cases. We're studying them hard, and we're really starting to dig into the top verticals that are really \u2013 that find the Equinix value proposition, a great place to drive cost out, and get higher performance. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Steve, one more I might mention is that honestly it has been a little surprising to me the strength of it has been manufacturing. We've seen incredible demand from manufacturing companies who are looking to do a variety of things ranging from supply chain management activities to data management to industrial Internet type use cases. And so that's a pretty exciting area for us. And then one more comment, which would be I would say that we're seeing a higher propensity \u2013 a better success with what I would consider horizontal use cases. And so the good news about that is we're able to educate our sales teams on those use cases with a little bit of a vertical wrapper around it, but go send them out with something they understand well and that seems to be getting resonance across a wide variety of verticals. And so we definitely have both our sales teams and our solution architect teams who have some good vertical expertise, but horizontal use cases seem to be the wave right now. Michael I. Rollins - Citi Research : Thanks very much. Operator : And our next question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks very much. You talked a bit about channel partners becoming more important getting up to about 19%. Where do you think that could go over time and what are the economics for you driving business through their channel versus directly. And then maybe just one, we talked a lot about the Chinese Internet providers. What's your thoughts about expanding in China? You've obviously continued to work in Shanghai, but in two other markets there. Thanks. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: I'll start with the channel. Charles, maybe you could chime in. So the channel has progressed nicely. We'll probably set a goal next year that will drive us into the 20%s, Simon. I don't think we know the upper limit of what percentage our channel can deliver. It's 19% now. We've had 14 quarters of sequential growth with our channel. So bookings grew 42% year-on-year and 10% quarter-on-quarter through the channel. We've really shifted the focus to resellers. We actually had about 143 new logos come from our resellers this quarter, and we're creeping up towards 430-odd new logos year-to-date through the resellers and through the channel partners. So it's working very well, and I would tell you that our expectations are to \u2013 it's 19% today. It's going to move into the 20%, the low 20%.We haven't set a goal out there publicly on where we want this to go, but it's increasing every quarter. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And are the economics similar from direct business? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah, they are. I mean when you really look at it, you may have a particular right now where we're probably doing a bit more of sell-with activity than pure sell through. They might be a little higher in that you may be paying an end user rep to engage and co-sell with a channel partner. But when you really look at customer lifetime value and the cost of sale therefore in the context of a fairly long contract with strong margins, the incremental cost of sale is fairly small. So I would say on balance, they're similar economics. I would say that since enterprise is really over-indexing in growth and we really have a business that is \u2013 service providers continue to be very strong for us across a range of cloud service providers, networks, others. But on the enterprise side, I would say I think they could eventually be \u2013 the majority of our bookings could come through the channel on the enterprise side as offerings mature in the market and they're able to pull them through more effectively. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: And then, Simon, in China, China, we have six assets today that are in the Shanghai region in a joint venture partner that we've announced that we're working on to work with us closely to accommodate the licensing requirements we need to go deeper into the market. Our aspirations are to move up to the Beijing market over time. We have a very good joint venture partner that we're finalizing the terms. We've announced that company. It's a company called Datang and they are very well connected into the government circles and are providing us all the partnership benefits that you would expect to work with local companies. Most of the traffic we're still seeing coming into PRC is inbound enterprise multinationals that need a safe pair of hands in China when they're setting up operations and majority of our business still is multinational traffic coming in. That will change over time as we get deeper into the partnership with Datang and we start to take on some local companies. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And is Beijing something that could happen in 2018? Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Yes, it could very well happen in '18.We're working hard on- our partner has access to land and to buildings and all the required things you need to move into a market like that. So it could very well happen in 2018. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Colby Synesael of Cowen & Co. You line is now open. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Two questions, if I may. One, the Americas cross connect number was relatively low for the second quarter in a row, at least when we look back over the several quarters before that. Just trying to get if there's something structural or something that's changed there to get a sense of how we should be thinking about that going forward. And then secondly, as it relates to the two announced deals Zenium and Itconic, how many other opportunities really around the world do you see like that right now and how aggressive do you guys want to be right now in starting to roll some of those out? It seems like right now might be a good opportunity to kind of just push on that a little bit? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Colby, maybe I'll comment on the Americas cross connects and let Keith and Steve add to that and address the M&A question. But overall, I would say that we continue to be very pleased with sort of the interconnection performance. Obviously 17% year-over-year growth on interconnection is really demonstrating strong performance in this area and speaks to I think the depth of our value proposition in that. Having said that, the cross connect counts probably three things that I would comment on : one, we are seeing some implementation of a 100 gig from our most sophisticated players who are implementing optics and would be able to aggregate traffic and groom their cross connect population and that does create some churn on the cross connect, but it increases the overall sort of traffic and throughput on the platform, which we think is a good thing over time. And so we are seeing some of that. We're also seeing the backend of I think some of the industry consolidation, which has been rampant in networks over the last several years . It takes them time to sort of integrate their core nodes and sort of groom traffic. And so we're seeing some of that. But what we really keep our eye on is gross, right, because you are going to see some churn on for some of these other reasons, but gross has been \u2013 continue to be very strong which to us says, look, the end demand for private connectivity continues to be strong. And so that's what we're seeing there. And then finally, I would say those numbers don't reflect ports on the cloud exchange and VCs on those ports, and those are an increasingly popular way for people to gain the interconnection value that they need. So, those things all probably play into some degree. But on balance 5,700 is a number we're pretty pleased with. And again and when you really look at the revenue growth and how our customers react to our interconnection value proposition, we couldn't be happier. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: And on the M&A front, Colby, I would tell you that still the top priority for this team is reaching new markets and extending our networking and cloud platform to extend it into Equinix is the top priorities. The markets are the same. We're looking in Southeast Asia, we're looking in South Korea, India, South Africa deeper into Latin America. That's where the regional teams have activity going, corporate development activity. I would tell you there's no shortage of opportunities. We're going to qualify and be very targeted, but if it moves the needle for us on new market or moves the needle for us on network and cloud density, it'll be of interest and we'll probably have a look. I don't know Keith if you'd add anything there. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Perfect. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Lukas Hartwich of Green Street Advisors. Your line is now open. Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. What percentage of undersea cable landings are in your own facilities and how do you think about the owned versus lease question when trying to land those deals? Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Owned versus leasing, you want to start on that, Keith? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. I think the first and foremost, let me take it to the highest level. Our view is always having fully economic control of the asset or any other asset that we'd like to wholly own. But there are certainly some of these markets where we will not have the opportunity to own the asset yet, having those subsea cables extending to that leased asset is just as valuable to us as it is into our owned assets. And I think that's most important. And I don't actually have the breakdown between the owned and leased, breakdown between the subsea cables that have already landed. But suffice it to say that is an area that we will continue to focus on to the extent that we can have more owned assets which is an objective of the company, that will bode well for what you're looking for. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: And on the wins to-date on the question, Lukas, we actually have around 28 metros that would be cable landing enabled meaning that our IBXs were close enough to the coast to be able to support a cable landing station deployment. We've announced publicly that we've won 15 today, there's eight in operation and seven are under construction, meaning they're deploying and getting ready to setup. So per the earlier question, many of these cables have not yet even been turned on yet. These are all funded by the biggest hyperscalers in the world with their desire to have more capacity for all this traffic that's going to traverse the Earth over the coming decade. So, the turn up of these things will continue to happen. There's another 20 to 30 more projects that we are aware of that are ongoing and we're pursuing with business development teams. So, this is a high priority for us. Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors LLC : Great. And then, just to follow-up, with leverage at the higher end of your target range. How do you weigh either growing organically to bring that down or tapping the ATM? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Well, again, we have really strong capital structure today. We're at the high end of our range, we're previously above that high end of the range. Just through sheer scale, the cash flow attributes of our business are very, very strong. And just by growth, it will continue to bring that leverage ratio down. Having said that, we want to make sure we define what our best and best source of capital is to fund our future growth. We'll continue to use leverage where appropriate. We have $1.6 billion of cash in the balance sheet, we have an untapped line of credit. We do have an approved ATM that we previously announced. But right now, our use is really going to be the cash on the balance sheet and making sure that we can continue to scale the business in the most efficient way to drive the maximum value to our shareholders. And just recognizing that, I like the position we are in, because as we continue to scale, we're creating more theoretical debt capacity for ourselves. And yet at the same time it's increasing the cash flow in the business that allows us to reinvest given the low payout ratio of 43%. Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Jonathan Atkin of RBC. Line is now open. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. So I was interested if you can talk a little bit about your pipeline, over the next 18, 24 months for land purchases under sites where you currently lease. And then, just kind of bigger picture, as we think about the margin trajectory, obviously, when you do M&A, it can interrupt the margin expansion, what is keeping you from at some point readily surpassing the 50% threshold and heading towards say mid 50% margins or higher? Thanks. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Let me take the first one and I'm looking at Steve and Charles maybe for the second one or I'm happy to jump in, but look, no surprise to you Jonathan. We are actively acquiring buildings and contiguous land in and around those buildings. If it make senses that we will continue to do that, we'll do as much of it as we can. We are highly focused on what we call the top-tier markets. Think of that as sort of the 10, 15, you can probably even go up to 20 markets around the world where we want to make sure that we control our future destiny. We've also had a committed objective to get to more than 50% of our revenues coming from assets that are owned. So not only acquiring the land for our future growth but acquiring the land underneath the buildings in which we operate today is an objective of ours. And so over some period of time, you'll see that that number will continue to move up. But the most important thing I want you to walk away is that we are actively looking to acquire land in our core markets adjacent to or at least proximate to our existing facilities. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. I'll tackle the second one. I mean I think Amir actually asked the same question last time if memory serves, but I do think that there is natural margin expansion available to us in the business as we continue to scale. And so I think, we see some of that. As you said M&A has the occasional sort of blip in terms of interrupting that expansion trajectory. But the one thing I would say is, and we've been consistent I think in this, which is we view our own (5n6:43) as maximizing sustainable intrinsic value creation for the business. And we think there's a lot of opportunity out there right now, and we're investing behind that opportunity. If you look for example at what we did in terms of kind of the adjustment in our organization to continue to tackle new growth areas for the business, and what my new SSI team is trying to go after, those are areas where we'll continue to invest behind to ensure that our service portfolio is responding to customer needs, and positioning us not only for near-term performance, but for long-term sustainable growth. And so that's why we've been reluctant to put any different marker out there. I think we're continuing to progress towards margin expansion, and we'll make a balanced assessment of when we believe we should drop that through the bottom-line versus when we believe we're going to get a really significant return on that investment by putting it into future growth. So I think we're continuing on that march, but hesitant to sort of change how we view the long-term markers. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then finally on interconnect, on your website there's a product sheet that talks about your traditional Internet exchange product, and there's a number of blue dots across the globe that says coming soon around \u2013 basically putting in I would suspect kind of your peering exchange in those metros. And is that potentially going to be material driver of acceleration in your interconnect business or is that just sort of an amenity that is less important than say bilateral cross connects? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah, I mean I would say that we try to think about the overall interconnection offering and make sure that it's being responsive to the broad needs of our customers. I don't know that any geographic expansion, we would do particularly on the IX is going to be \"needle mover.\" But I do think that what it does is positions us to effectively serve the full range of a customer requirement and what we have and it is quite unique is a combination of both geographic reach and product portfolio depth and interconnection which is really unmatched. And so you said look, a large complex global multinational, one, they need the geographic coverage, but two, they want to take it from the buffet, IX direct connectivity in the form of Layer 1 cross-connects, ECX at Layer 2, Layer 3 and nobody else can provide that full portfolio. So, again, I'd urge you to sort of stay tuned to how we're evolving the interconnection portfolio and you'll hear more about that through the course of the year. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is now open. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks guys. You saw a nice uptick in the cabinet adds in the quarter really across all markets. Now I know you don't guide to it and it's a fairly lumpy number, but given all the development and footprint expansion, is this sort of a good level that we could expect sort of going forward? And then if you could maybe point out one or two drivers, I mean on the call here you've mentioned probably a dozen that's driving the business, but if there's one or two that you could point out, maybe they're different in sort of each region, but is it accelerating pace of outsourcing or demand from the hyperscalers, anything you could point to that sort of drove that uptick particularly this quarter would be great? Thanks. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: For the cabinet adds. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah, I think first and foremost 4,500 net cabinet adds clearly is, one, if not our highest, I think it's out highest bookings quarter ever vis-\u00e0-vis the net cabinets billing. I'd tell you that as you aptly pointed out, it does ebb and flow. One of the comments we made in our prepared remarks was the pipeline is extremely strong. And so, no surprise to you as we plan to have continued record bookings, because we're scaling the business. We'd expect that number to continue to be significant. The other part I said is, we believe that we're going to continue to consume a lot of those cabinets. Hence the number of projects that we are building around the world as we said, we've got 22 active projects across 16 markets, and recognizing some of the comments made by Charles around hyperscaler and the opportunity that's in front of us. I think you're going to see that number continue to be relatively higher than what we've experienced before. But I want to reserve the right that it is inherently chunky. And so, we're going to see sometimes it will move upwards and other times it will step back just based on the timing of the deployments. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: And John, I would point back to what Charles talked about earlier on these horizontal use cases. So, it would be a combination of everything underneath an umbrella, most companies today are moving their businesses to a digital enablement model. So they're moving some applications to the hybrid multicloud architecture, they're optimizing their networks, they're transforming them. They're moving more data to distribute it around the world where the people and customers are, so they need more analytics out of the edge. They're moving their communications capabilities all over the world, their data centers are consolidating, so many enterprises are getting out of the data center business, moving some applications to the public cloud, moving some to the colo and keeping some on-premise. The concept that the edge computing model is underpinning a lot of these requirements we're seeing, so it's a combination of those things that we see across multiple industries. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: And, as you might have noticed, large CSPs, as you might have noticed this earnings season, are growing their business very well and they are significant customers of ours and we continue to benefit from that growth. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our last question is from Robert Gutman of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. So, when you mentioned large footprint deployments for hyperscalers earlier, I was just curious what scale of deployment you mean in terms of megawatts or what size of deployments or range are you talking about there? And secondly, are you able to provide a churn number that would exclude the sort of a core churn number that would exclude churn in the acquired assets? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: I'll take the first one. And then maybe, Keith, you can comment on the second one there. So large footprint, it is little bit of a terminology challenge which is \u2013 we probably still are doing \u2013 several years ago, we'd probably consider anything over 250 kilowatts sort of large footprint. That started to probably elevate in terms of what sort of average deployment sizes are for certain things, but when I'm talking about the hyperscale initiative in particular, we're talking more about sort of multi-megawatt, probably 3 megawatt to 5 megawatt or more in a single implementation, not a single phase, but in one implementation that comes over a relatively short period of time, and so when we're talking about hyperscale that's kind of the scale of what we're thinking of. We will talk about doing large footprint within the context of our retail business that might be 300 kilowatts, 500 kilowatts, maybe even up to 1 megawatt, but we usually accommodate that within our retail footprint and within the underwriting that we've done for those assets already. So those are distinct things in our view in terms of large footprint which we're accommodating within our current assets. And then hyperscale which again I would say 2 megawatts to 3 megawatts to 5 megawatts or more over a relatively short period of time. Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.: Robert, on the churn question the easy answer this quarter is (1:04:45) somewhat consistent with what we reported on an overall basis. So on the acquisitions are relative \u2013 or the inorganic versus the organic is roughly the same. Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. Katrina Rymill - Equinix, Inc.: Great. Thank you. That concludes our Q3 call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. It's good to be joining all of you as we share our strong results for both the quarter and the full year. As I believe everyone is aware, I have assumed the role of CEO for an interim period. I'm fortunate to have held both the roles of CEO and Executive Chairman over my 17 years here at Equinix. And I've had the privilege of working alongside our leadership team, playing an active role in their efforts, our strategy and every major decision the company has made in this time frame. As we look forward, it's our opportunity to accelerate digital transformation and our position as the underlying platform and stewards of our customers' digital infrastructure that has me so excited about our future. I'm thankful that I can play a meaningful role in assuring our momentum continues as we outpace our industry. Turning to our performance. We just delivered our 60th consecutive quarter of revenue growth, a longer track record than any current S&P 500 company, and we're well on our way to deliver over $5 billion of revenues in 2018. We are investing more than ever before in our organic business, growing our strategy, services and innovation team to support new products and services, adding more quota-bearing sales heads as our business grows and supporting a broader initiative around customer experience. We continue to grow our global platform, adding 19,000 cabinets across 23 projects in 2017 and have a very active construction pipeline going forward. With more than 9,800 customers, we now serve 46% of the Fortune 500 and 1/3 of the Forbes Global 2000, with more to come as we continue to attract and add customers, transforming their digital businesses. Interconnection and ecosystems remain the core of our offerings, and with the Verizon assets, we now have over 277,000 cross-connects and record traffic volumes across our industry-leading exchanges. We have the most complete interconnection portfolio in the industry, and interconnection revenues continue to outpace colocation, growing 14% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our differentiated platform continues to drive our financial performance, and we delivered another year of record bookings activity. As shown on Slide 3, we generated $4.4 billion of revenue in 2017, up $756 million over the prior year, a 21% increase or up 11% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. We delivered over $2 billion of adjusted EBITDA, continuing to achieve healthy margins while investing significantly in the business and expanding our addressable market. This translated into AFFO growth of 14% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, further demonstrating our strong operating performance. Next, I'd like to provide more detail on the growth of Platform Equinix. Our unmatched global reach continues to be strengthened by our acquisitions, and we remain committed to pressing our advantage globally. In 2017, we completed 5 acquisitions, including the addition of 29 data centers from Verizon. And today, we announced our acquisition of the Infomart Dallas, one of the most connected assets in the U.S., for $800 million. The Infomart, a marquee interconnection hub for the Americas region, will enhance our global platform and secure our ability to further expand in the Dallas market, one of the largest enterprise and colocation markets in the Americas. The Infomart is home to 4 of our Dallas IBXs and will increase our percentage of revenues from owned assets to over 45% when it closes. We also signed an agreement in December to acquire Metronode, an Australian data center provider, for $791 million, which is expected to close in the first half of 2018. Australia is one of the fastest-growing cloud markets in the world, and this transaction provides us with an impressive national footprint, adding 10 more data centers in 6 metros. It strengthens our existing presence in Sydney and Melbourne and brings us to 4 new metros in Perth, Canberra, Adelaide and Brisbane. This acquisition also provides the opportunity to build additional capacity on these majority-owned assets. With the expected close of this acquisition, our platform will expand to 200 IBXs, 52 markets and 24 countries, providing customers with even more ways to securely deploy, connect and scale their digital infrastructure with Platform Equinix. We also saw great progress with the Verizon assets, which had dramatically boosted our scale and interconnection density in the Americas and outperformed expectations for the year. We are seeing healthy bookings in the Verizon assets from Equinix customers and continue to make progress to stem the previous level of churn. This year, we're expanding these highly utilized assets in select metros, investing over $160 million across Culpeper, Denver, Houston, Miami and S\u00e3o Paulo. We now -- have now completed the majority of the Verizon integration efforts and expect to fully conclude this by midyear. Shifting to our interconnection portfolio. In December, we announced an important investment in the evolution of our global platform. We are connecting our IBXs physically and virtually around the world through the Equinix Cloud Exchange Fabric, enabling customers to discover and dynamically connect to any other customer across any Equinix location. With over 1,000 participants on the ECX Fabric, we will continue to invest in this platform as it evolves beyond pure cloud connectivity to a multipurpose interconnection exchange. We are also investing to ensure that our interconnection services are consistent, accessible and available on demand across our entire footprint. As part of this commitment, we've announced the expansion of our Internet exchange services to 9 new markets, which will bring our total IX platform count to 31. Now I'll make a few comments on our organic development activity. As we look across the business, we see a significant uptick in capital expenditures in response to strong underlying demand. With our high level of inventory utilization and a strong sales funnel, we have a very active pipeline for 2018 with 30 expansion projects currently underway across our platform, half of which are in EMEA, our most utilized region. And greater than 75% of this expansion CapEx is allocated to mature metros that generate over $100 million in revenue, where we leverage established ecosystems densities and our large installed base, allowing us to deliver market-leading financial returns. As previously announced, we're also building an organization that we refer to as HIT or the Hyperscale Infrastructure Team that will focus on developing facilities that are tuned to hyperscale requirements. Today, the majority of private interconnection nodes for the major cloud players are located in Equinix facilities, and we continue to invest heavily in future development and API integration. Our integration efforts with the major cloud players have provided us with deep insight into the evolving architecture of the cloud. In response to their request for Equinix to be a more full range infrastructure provider, we have committed to accelerate our efforts to serve the large footprint needs of a targeted set of hyperscale customers. We will remain selective in pursuit of these opportunities but believe that participating in this space is important in maintaining and extending our leadership position in the overall cloud ecosystem. We are leveraging the combination of existing capacity, including a significant Q4 win with a major cloud provider in London, and dedicated hyperscale builds to target a handful of key markets in 2018. Paris 8 represents our first dedicated build for this initiative, and we have a healthy pipeline of other hyperscale opportunities. The HIT team will focus on reducing our cost to build, shortening time to market and executing longer-term customer contracts that will enable superior blended returns. Now let me cover highlights from the verticals, starting with networks. Our network vertical achieved its fifth consecutive record bookings quarter, experiencing growth across all regions as major wireless and telecom providers expand their capacity and capabilities for digital and as our diverse group of network partners continue to ramp as a critical channel for Equinix to the enterprise market. Expansions this quarter included AT&T, which launched its SDN offering to rapidly provision and scale dynamic networks across Platform Equinix, and China Telecom expanding its footprint and jointly selling to Chinese multinationals. Equinix is also seeing continued momentum in the strategically important subsea cable space, a market where our position will be meaningfully strengthened by our Itconic and Metronode acquisitions. In financial services, we saw the highest bookings in 4 quarters with the continued diversification of our customer base beyond electronic trading and including insurance and banking as these critical enterprise segments embrace digital transformation. Customer wins and expansions included a top 50 U.S. bank leveraging Platform Equinix to securely access financial ecosystems as well as a Fortune 500 insurance provider transforming network topology while securely connecting to multiple cloud providers. The content and digital media vertical experienced continued bookings growth, led by the Asia Pacific region, and an uptick in gaming, e-commerce and publishing subsegments. Expansions this quarter included a Fortune 500 media conglomerate deploying multiple performance hubs to support employee applications as well as Adela Group leveraging our advertising ecosystem to capture new revenue. Our cloud and IT vertical achieved another record bookings quarter, led by the EMEA region and software and IT services subsegments. Cloud providers are re-architecting their networks, further segmenting traffic with additional access nodes and bringing more core services to the edge. This momentum in our existing base of cloud providers was augmented with key new customer wins, including Agile Defense, Clarity IT Solutions, Coach House Partners and ThousandEyes. Turning to the enterprise vertical. We saw strong bookings momentum across the transportation, retail and government subsegments and another record quarter of new customer adds. Overall, the enterprise vertical is growing at twice the rate of any other vertical as digital transformation is forcing firms to change how they interconnect users and clouds across multiple locations. New customer wins included a major North American energy company, optimizing network topology to enable digital and IoT and a global industrial manufacturing company adopting multi-cloud to scale its business. And across our verticals, our channel program continues to drive a consistent and steady stream of bookings and new customers, with 19% of bookings originating from the channel this quarter, up from 15% last year. The channel is now driving over 40% of new logos, and these customers continue to exhibit strong land-and-expand dynamics. We're very pleased with these efforts and view continued development of our channel as a critical weapon in capturing the enterprise market. So now I'll turn it over to Keith to cover the results. Keith Taylor : Great. Thanks, PVC. Good afternoon to everyone. We had a great finish to the year delivering on our best-ever bookings quarter with particular strength in our cloud and network verticals. Also as PVC mentioned, we had record bookings in both our EMEA and APAC regions, highlighting the value of our global platform. With 2017 now behind us, I also want to take this opportunity to highlight that we continue to track against our 2016 Analyst Day financial objectives to deliver healthy organic compounded revenue growth with strong flow-through to AFFO and AFFO per share. Additionally, our M&A activities, including the Verizon asset acquisition, have been accretive to our core financial metric being AFFO per share. At the same time, we've built strength into our balance sheet, raising both debt and equity to maximize the long-term value for our shareholders. We're putting more capital to work than ever before, building capacity across our markets while enhancing our products and services. This will drive future profitable growth while accentuating the key points of differentiation between our business and that of our peers. I'll now review the full year 2017 results and offer some high-level commentary on 2018. Then I'll toggle to the fourth quarter highlights. Note that our 2018 guidance does not yet include the results of either Metronode or the Infomart acquisition, both of which are expected to close by mid-2018. Also, do note that we've adopted the new revenue standard, ASC 606, the impact of which is highlighted on Slide 12. And just one final note. All growth rates in this section are normalized and constant currency. So starting with revenues. We recorded revenues just under $4.4 billion for 2017, an 11% year-over-year growth rate, reflecting strong demand and an expanding market opportunity. In 2018, we'll deliver meaningful step-ups in bookings and revenues, fueling a 10% growth rate, excluding Verizon, and allowing us to surpass the $5 billion mark in annual revenue, an exciting milestone for the company. Our revenue guidance and corresponding growth rate absorbs a $54 million negative impact from our FX hedging program and the dilutive impact of the slower-growing but highly accretive Verizon assets. It's important to note that the Verizon sites are highly utilized, and as highlighted on our expansion tracking schedule, will receive much-needed incremental capacity, predominantly in the second half of the year. The revenue attached to the incremental capacity will be partially offset by the anticipated Verizon churn in 2018, resulting in low single-digit revenue growth on the Verizon assets in 2018. In 2017, we improved our adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding integration costs, to 48.2%, a 70 basis point improvement over the prior year as we continued to make progress towards our long-term 50% adjusted EBITDA margin target. In 2018, we're leveraging our business scale to maintain these healthy margins while absorbing the impact of the new acquisitions and investing in key growth initiatives, including strategy, services and innovation, quota-bearing sales reps and customer experience initiatives. For 2018, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margins to remain at 48.2%, excluding integration costs, or 47.6% on an as-reported basis. We expect to incur $35 million of integration cost for 2018 related to the Verizon, Itconic and Istanbul 2 acquisitions. 2017 AFFO was over $1.4 billion, higher than expected for the year. Looking forward, 2018 AFFO is expected to grow 7% over the prior year, including the incremental debt service cost in support of our future growth. AFFO for 2018 includes a step-up in the income taxes to a more normalized level as we incur some discrete tax losses in 2017 related to our foreign debt refinancing activities. After adjusting for the income tax fluctuations, we expect continued strong flow-through from adjusted EBITDA to AFFO, commensurate with the expectations set at the 2016 Analyst Day. 2017 AFFO per share was $19.23, which we expect to increase in 2018 to greater than $20.82 per share, excluding integration costs. We've assumed a weighted average 80.2 million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis, including our 2017 ATM equity program. We continue to expect AFFO per share to show strong momentum, particularly as we benefit from the investments made in 2018, which we anticipate will bear fruit in 2019 and after. AFFO per share is and will continue to be a key metric that we use to drive and value our business. 2017 cash dividends totaled $612 million. As we continue to both scale our business while growing our shareholder dividend distributions, we expect total cash dividends to increase to $725 million in 2018, an 18% increase over the prior year. Now turning to the fourth quarter. Q4 was another strong quarter of operating performance, reflecting the positive momentum we're seeing in the business. EMEA took the lead as our fastest-growing region at 15% year-over-year growth, followed by Asia Pacific and Americas at 13% and 8%, respectively. And we saw healthy net cabinet billing, rising interconnection density as well as increased provision port capacity. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q4 revenues were $1.2 billion, up 4% over the prior quarter and 11% over the same quarter last year, partially due to the higher-than-planned nonrecurring revenues. Nonrecurring revenues can be lumpy depending on timing of certain customer deployments and therefore difficult to forecast. We're projecting ARR revenues to return to a more normal 5% of revenues going forward. The Verizon assets contributed $135 million of revenues, a modest step-down to the forecasted churn but still above our expectations. Q4 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $5 million negative currency impact when compared to the Q3 average FX rates, a $3 million negative currency impact compared to our FX guidance rates due to the stronger U.S. dollar. Global Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $565 million, up 10% over the same quarter last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.1%, excluding integration costs, or 47% on an as-reported basis. Fourth quarter also includes the impact from the Itconic acquisition, our lower-margin business, due to the high level of managed services. Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, had a $4 million negative impact when compared to the Q3 average FX rates and a $1 million negative impact when compared to the FX guidance rates. Global Q4 AFFO was $382 million, up 9% over the same quarter last year and absorbs higher recurring capital expenditures in Q4, consistent with the prior year's activity. Q4 global MRR churn was 2.2%, and we expect 2018 MRR churn to continue to average between 2% and 2.5% per quarter. Now I'd like to provide a few highlights on the regions, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. The Americas region saw solid revenue and adjusted EBITDA from both the organic business and the Verizon assets. Also, you'll note that we added the Verizon metrics to our operating metrics this quarter, which includes approximately 26,000 cabinets at an 87% utilization rate, 24,000 cross-connects and firm MRR per cabinet. EMEA delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of record bookings, led by the U.K. and benefiting from its 22-market reach. Asia Pacific delivered record bookings with strong performance in Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore. And we saw strong exports driving deals to other regions, particularly from China and Korean firms expanding their footprints globally. The Americas, Asia Pacific and EMEA interconnection revenues were 22%, 14% and 9% of recurring revenues. From a total company perspective, interconnection revenues stepped up to 17% of total recurring revenues. Now looking at our balance sheet. Please refer to Slide 8. We continue to optimize our capital structure, taking advantage of the low interest rate environment. In Q4, we completed a number of debt refinancing initiatives that effectively reduced our debt service costs, extended our debt maturities and continue to set us on the course to become an investment-grade rated company. In December, we raised EUR 1 billion at very attractive interest rates to refinance existing term debt while upsizing our revolver capacity. Our average rate of borrow across our key debt instruments now sits at approximately 4.1%. Unrestricted cash and investments was $1.45 billion. Our net debt leverage ratio, net of the unrestricted cash, remained at 3.9x Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA. Turning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $433 million, including a recurring CapEx of $63 million, above expectations in part due to timing of payments and high level of project activity. Our 2018 capital plan reflects strong underlying demand conditions across many of our operating markets, increased utilization rates across our assets and a step-up in the scale of the business, including investments in new products and services. Currently, we have 30 new construction projects underway, 2/3 of which are on owned properties, adding capacity in 20 markets around the world. Our capital investments are delivering healthy growth and strong returns, as shown on Slide 10. Revenues from our 99 stabilized IBXs grew 5% year-over-year, largely driven by increasing cross-connects and power density. These stabilized assets are generating a 29% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested, down slightly compared to prior quarter due to land and building acquisitions relating to our stabilized assets in the quarter. The stabilized assets remain at a utilization rate of 84%. We're proactively increasing our IBX ownership, too. We recently purchased our Helsinki 6, Milan 3 and Lisbon 1 data centers as well as land in Sofia and Warsaw to continue to invest heavily in other owned -- I'm sorry, pardon me, and we continue to invest heavily in other owned properties in Ashburn, Chicago and Silicon Valley. Revenue from owned assets is 42% in the fourth quarter, down slightly compared to prior quarter due to the inclusion of primary lease sites from the Itconic deal. Upon closing of both the Infomart and the Metronode acquisitions, we expect revenues from owned sites to increase significantly to 45% or greater. So with that said, let me turn it back to PVC. Peter Van Camp : Thanks, Keith. Now I'd like to summarize our strategy, so please refer to Slide 18. This year, we plan to invest behind our market momentum and build wisely on our global leadership position. We will continue to press our advantage and deliver value for customers that will be very hard for others to replicate. We will invest further in our work to catch the next wave, responding to key market trends that will fuel digital transformation and shape our future as a company. And as we grow, we'll scale the company foundation for the next decade. Our strategy is well aligned with our evolving industry and fueled by strong secular forces. We are responding to this exceptional opportunity by rolling out new initiatives around hyperscale infrastructure, delivering innovative new services, connecting our IBXs around the globe and pursuing targeted acquisitions that build interconnection density and enhance asset ownership. Integrating these acquisitions into Equinix has been demanding at times, but we have honed our integration capability and view it as a significant competitive advantage and essential to our larger efforts to build out a consistent global platform. We will continue our strategic and ongoing support of the enterprise and cloud, and we will be spending more time targeting and investing in ecosystems that will create the most value for Equinix and our customers. We believe interconnection will become even more important for our customers in the years to come, so we're working to ensure that this value proposition is as strong as ever. And as we grow, we must put even more emphasis on how we develop and scale our people, processes and systems to fuel not only our current position but the future state as well. So in closing, we've achieved a number of significant milestones around interconnection, innovation and acquisitions in 2017, and we see solid fundamentals coming into 2018. As we approach our 20th anniversary and reflect on what we've built, we remain true to our core principles of delivering a global platform for our customers' infrastructure. We have a clear vision of our strategy and opportunities ahead and are looking forward to another successful year. So let me stop there, and we'll open it for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Colby Synesael : Two questions if I may. First one, it looks like 2018 is shaping up to be a greater investment year than perhaps what The Street was expecting. Can you just talk more about what the opportunity -- or how that's going to position you as we exit 2018? We're seeing obviously some depression in the margins, but is this meant to help sustain growth perhaps greater than 10% as we go into those outer years? Any sense on when we can get back to that 50% EBITDA margin? Just trying to get a better understanding what the payoff is, if you will, of the investments that you're making so that we can kind of look a little bit beyond 2018. And then secondly, just from a modeling perspective, I appreciate that you'll give us more information later on. But can you give us just a little bit of color on what the EBITDA margin is for Infomart and for Metronode just for -- so we could start to think about that? Keith Taylor : Why don't I start, take the first part of the question, Colby? As it relates to the investment, when we talk about sort of -- there's 2 components to it. There's the capital investment that we're making, which gives you a sense that as we talked about, we have 30 projects underway. Once we close the 2 transactions, we're going to be in 52 markets. So no surprise, we're seeing our utilization levels go up, and therefore, we're making investments. And a number of those investments will be what I would call first phase sites, and that's from a capital perspective. The other thing, I think, that's important to note is that we are going to invest around the HIT program that PVC alluded to. Again, a portion of that CapEx certainly will be dedicated to that. When you think about the OpEx side of the equation, again, recognizing we're going to grow -- we've said that absent Verizon, the organic business is going to grow greater than 10%. And so that is a greater than. So I want to leave you with that thought. But the second part is we're going to deliver -- when you think about the core business, we're going to deliver a flat margin at 48.2% when you adjust for integration costs. And embedded in that 48.2% is basically the implication of Itconic, which will erode our margins by 30 basis points. And so again, to your question, that's a roughly 35% margin business. But the other part of which I don't think is fully appreciated, we're going to invest in customer-focused, growth-orientated -- oriented investments, and so it's going to be the SSI initiatives, so Strategy, Services and Innovation around Charles and his teams. It's going to be around customer experience and the initiatives that we need to develop there. And it is putting more quota-bearing heads into the business. All of that is roughly 70 basis points. So between the Itconic and this decision to invest in the future, we're basically muting, if you will, the margin profile by roughly 1 full point. And so we're well on our way to getting towards that objective of 50% EBITDA margins. But occasionally, as you know, we have to pause to make investments because we're looking much further down the road to drive even further or greater shareholder value. And so that's where we are with that investment. The last thing I will say just on this is as you look at Q1, Q1 always tends to be a quarter that because of seasonal costs, and you can see that we have roughly $20 million of seasonal cost in Q1, particularly in the SG&A area, SG&A, for all intents and purposes, will remain flat from Q1 through the rest of the year, very similar to what we experienced last year. The other part is when you had Q4 of '17 and you come to Q1 of '18, we're making the assumption that nonrecurring revenues will step down to a more standard level. But as you look forward from Q1 and then into Q2, 3 and 4, we expect revenues to step up each quarter as we exit the year. So puts us, again, on a growth trajectory that we like. The greater than 10% objective is certainly within our sight, particularly around the organic part of the business. And then we expect to exit the year with a high-margin business than we started the year. So we talked a little bit about... Peter Van Camp : Itconic. Keith Taylor : Yes. The Itconic deal, again, that margin is, as I said, roughly 35%. When you then get into the discussion around both Metronode in Australia and then the Infomart in Dallas, right now, the margin profile is going to be relatively consistent when it comes to the Infomart deal. We're going to update that as we get -- as we move to the close. As it relates to the Metronode, as PVC alluded to, it's over -- it's in 6 markets. It's slightly -- it will be slightly dilutive at the outset, but we would expect that, that business would get ultimately to the Asia Pacific level of margin. Operator : The next question comes from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Timothy Horan : Can you give a little bit more color on the pricing environment out there and possibly what you're seeing from the hyperscale guys? Obviously, there was a lot of growth from them, but how do they kind of compare to your base? And what are you kind of hearing from them? Charles Meyers : Tim, it's Charles. Yes, I mean, I think I would characterize the overall pricing environment as disciplined, and we're seeing firm pricing. And of course, our focus, as you guys know, is more on yield. And so -- but I would say even spot pricing in the -- particularly in the retail space is firm. Supply and demand seem to be imbalanced globally across all of our markets, and we don't really see significant instability relative to spot pricing. So I think we're able to win the targeted deals and then add yield to those deals over time with interconnection and power, and that's really what fuels the business. Specifically as it relates to hyperscale, undoubtedly, that's a more competitive market. It is a somewhat less differentiated market and therefore substantially more price-competitive. And that's why I think we've said that we are going to be selective about our participation in that market.  But we do believe that working with those key hyperscale partners, continuing to enhance our relationship with them, deepening the linkages between our platforms and making sure that we are being responsive to their needs and having that as part of our portfolio is important. But it is -- it's clearly a more competitive market. But then we're also going to be looking to build dedicated facilities that are, as we said in the script, tuned to those requirements, meaning substantially lower cost to build. And therefore, I think we can deliver reasonable returns on those. And then on a blended basis, given that hyperscale is not going to be a big portion of our total revenue, continue to deliver very attractive blended returns. Timothy Horan : And Charles, just quick a follow-up on the interconnection between the data centers. How do you kind of manage the channel conflict with the long-haul providers? Net neutrality has been such a key component of your strategy for such a long period. What are they kind of saying to you at this point? Charles Meyers : Yes, that continues to be the case. I think the depth of interconnection or depth of network density that exists in our facilities and the value that provides to not only our enterprise customers but to the service providers themselves as they seek to serve those enterprise customers is extremely important to us. Candidly, what we've seen is they've been -- there's been a clear understanding of why our customers might look to take advantage of the connectivity between our data centers in order to meet those needs. And the focus of the NSPs is really to provide that broader network connectivity value proposition to the enterprise customers. And in fact, what we're finding is the NSPs themselves are finding opportunities to leverage the fabric and engaging with us on how their SDN strategies, for example, can be furthered by deploying inside of Platform Equinix and leveraging the fabric on their own. So I would say to date, the response has been very, very positive, and that ranges across the really large partners and incumbents through the longer tail of service providers. And so today, it's been a very positive response and we continue to see very much a win-win in the market. Operator : The next question comes from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Jonathan Atkin : So on Infomart, I was interested, just as a point of clarification, the land adjacent to it, that comes as part of the transaction? Or was that a separate asset that you already had or bought separately? Peter Van Camp : Yes, Jonathan, the land did come as a part of the acquisition. So we've already been very thoughtful about just making sure all the compliance is in place so we can build. And so that will certainly help the returns over time in what we see as a really good market. Jonathan Atkin : So on that topic, the other -- the Infomart, the company had other assets that you could have bought. And given that you're selling hyperscale and given kind of the customer profile in San Jose and Portland and Ashburn, I just wondered why you -- if you would have considered buying the entire company rather than just Dallas. Peter Van Camp : Well, we did. Obviously, we would have taken a look at the total asset. But frankly, the most strategic part and interesting piece of it all was the Infomart in Dallas, and so we didn't push as hard for the remaining assets. And there was nothing unique or different from a strategic level value in those other assets whereas now that we have Infomart Dallas, really when you think about it, the interconnection and network routes to everything to the southern half of the Americas kind of flow to Equinix. And so the Infomart Dallas became the real interesting objective as we looked at this business. Jonathan Atkin : So as you develop the HIT product, there'll be more, I guess, expansion put. And I wondered, is there kind of a limit on the number of metros in which you would consider offering wholesale at this point? Charles Meyers : No, I don't think we have any bright lines in that regard, Jonathan, although I would say that I think what we do is we look at the individual dynamics of a metro in terms of interconnection, in terms of competitive intensity, in terms of enterprise concentration and therefore the opportunity for us to serve and cultivate the cloud ecosystem in that market. And those all play into our level of appetite, I think, to play in hyperscale in each market. And so I think there are a significant number of markets around the world in which we would see that as an attractive opportunity. And I also would say that I don't see it as out of the question for us to potentially use hyperscale as an entry strategy into other markets if the conditions were right and we could derisk an investment by having that -- by having significant anchor tenants in that, courtesy of the hyperscale initiative. So no magic number. I think there is a pretty significant number of our markets around the world. We commented that we have a large number where we're already generating $100 million-plus in revenue. I would say that's a clear list that would be appropriate for us to consider and then again, using it as a market entry strategy, not at all out of the question. Jonathan Atkin : That latter part is quite interesting. And then finally, on Itconic, I wonder, are there any kind of early learning space on the managed services business that you acquired there and kind of the cloud on-ramp aspect of it? Keith Taylor : For the first quarter, we did a little bit better in Q4 than we originally anticipated. We're still in the process of integrating the asset. That asset will get integrated through the 2018 time frame. No surprise to you, we have a number of assets around the world, including part of the Itconic business that is managed services-oriented. And we're putting more energy behind that global focus. But it's still a little bit early for us to make any broader comment. It is still -- as you recognized, it was only 17 million between Itconic and the Istanbul 2 acquisition for the quarter. So we still have a lot of work to do. But we're excited about the broadening of the platform and to that part of the Continental Europe. And so stay tuned on this one. Charles Meyers : Yes, I'd also offer, Jonathan, very interesting company in that they were quite focused on helping their customers in the sort of journey to the hybrid cloud as the architecture of choice. So they were well positioned, had good relationships with the hyperscalers themselves, have some interesting value propositions in services in their portfolio, which we're taking a hard look at. And I think we're already going to integrate our Equinix Professional Services, who is actively serving customers in that regard with what they were doing there in their market. And so that work is underway. And then from a managed services perspective, as you know, we've had a number of assets that have come in over the years that have managed services business. And we sort of sorted through what the right way to handle those services are. But they're somewhat dilutive to the margin profile but often an important part of the local market dynamics. So we'll continue to evaluate those in the same way we've done with prior acquisitions. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research. Michael Rollins : I was wondering, Keith, if you could talk a bit about the nonrecurring revenue in terms of what drove the strength in 4Q and more about your expectations for why that's going to fall in 2018. I think in prior guides that you've given, you also thought at times, it would slow down, and it's been a line item that I think it's fair to say has outperformed some of your prior expectations. So maybe what's going into it next year? And what are the activities that might drive a change in that expectation? Keith Taylor : Sure. It's a great question, Michael. First and foremost, recognizing nonrecurring revenue in its very nature tends to be lumpy and does not recur. And although we are stepping up year-over-year, we're just not expecting the same level of growth. Having said that, there's nothing to prevent us from having that. There's always one-off or discrete items that happen on the nonrecurring line, and we saw a lot of that take place in the fourth quarter. As you saw, we're well above -- on an FX-neutral basis, well above the top end of our guidance range, and part of that was absolutely due to nonrecurring activity. So we're just taking a much more prudent view on what to assume on a go-forward basis. But again, there's nothing to prevent us from realizing the same outcome. We just don't want to make that assumption from the get go, particularly as you -- as we came off a very, very strong quarter of nonrecurring revenue being 6.5% of our total revenues in the fourth quarter. So from a guidance perspective, we've said the business will grow at greater than 10%. It is being marginally diluted by the amount of nonrecurring revenue and also the Verizon assets needing to -- at 87% utilization, the need for incremental capacity and the fact that we're still working through the conversion of those customers onto Equinix contracts. We're taking a prudent view that we're going to have a greater than that number for you. And that's why we're just stepping back and making sure that we put ourselves in a position to deliver against our expectations for 2018. And if we can do better, then you're going to see that come through the results, particularly on the nonrecurring line. Michael Rollins : And is there a way to think about -- as you look at the investments in sales and distribution for 2018, what do you expect to get out of your direct organization in terms of improvement in sales productivity versus the opportunities on the indirect side? Peter Van Camp : Well, certainly, the investment is about continuing to reach the enterprise. And as we've talked about before on prior calls, Mike, there has been a little longer sales cycle to that. But ultimately, we're going to add 60 heads to 427, I think, strong go-to-market force. So a sizable uptick in that. But we just feel now is the time, particularly behind the investments we're making this year, to continue to drive the direct organic sales activity. Now that said, we saw great growth in the channel, getting to the 19% this year over last year at 15%. So you'll continue to see the channel absorb a bigger piece of it. But ultimately, I think the direct sales force is still the critical channel. And as we go out generating demand and helping all these enterprise customers find their path to the cloud, that investment is going to be an important thing to continue our growth. Operator : The next question comes from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Yong Choe : This is Richard for Phil. I figure I'll take another shot at it. Given that the expansion plans are for late second half '18 and the level of it, it seems like, to Colby's point, that things could start accelerating at the end of the year and into next year. And then the Verizon assets, you said, were kind of single-digit growth. It seems like you would expect those to go to an Equinix level, 10-plus percent. Are we looking at this the wrong way? Or is it just level of conservatism? Keith Taylor : Richard, I mean, let me just validate the comment you made. Clearly, when you look at the results and what we're guiding to in Q1 and what I've talked about from an SG&A investment perspective for Q2 and beyond, the natural output of that would be an accelerating revenue line and the moderating spend line partly because of the seasonal costs in Q1. So the conclusion that you would see acceleration coming at the back end of the year does make sense. But it's also coupled with the fact that we're building 30 projects. We have 30 projects underway, many of them -- we've denoted this on our expansion tracking sheet, 5 of those projects are Verizon asset projects and very important markets. They're 87% utilized. I'd hate for you to walk away thinking that the Verizon assets can get to the same level of growth as the overall Equinix business because number one, they're highly utilized assets; number two, you have to recognize that we're going to be very disciplined about how we fill up that capacity over a period of time. But the overall business -- again, we're selling a global platform here. The overall business, we believe we can accelerate that top line growth, particularly as we absorb the impact of the Verizon churn, as we build out capacity. And if you take a more aggressive view on the investments we're making around strategy, services and innovation, customer experience and quota-bearing heads, all of that bodes well to an accelerating departure from '18 into '19. Yong Choe : And then a quick question on the Paris 8 dedicated hyperscale build. Can you give us a little more color on that? And is the future phase capacity reserved already for that customer? Or can that be given to other customers? Charles Meyers : No, we have -- so the Paris 8 facility is the first dedicated hyperscale build, different design obviously in terms of allowing a lower sort of cost point into that facility. It is not -- we have a very deep sort of pipeline of opportunity, both in terms of customers that are already in our existing Paris facilities. But that is -- that capacity is there and available for customers. But we do have a deep pipeline of opportunities to sell into there. Operator : The next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. John Hodulik : A follow-up to Richard's question. Is there a target in terms of cost per megawatt for dedicated hyperscale facilities like Paris 8? And maybe if you could give us a sense, I mean, how many of these type of facilities would you expect to have, I mean, sort of rough numbers, I mean, over the next 5 years? I mean, should we be thinking of sort of one in every major market where you operate? And then I guess more philosophically, is this hyperscale business an attractive business on its own given the pricing you're currently seeing in that end of the market? Or is it sort of -- does it stand on its own? Or is it just expected to drive value and drive further growth on the colo side? Charles Meyers : A lot there. Let me try to get all of them. Relative to price point or cost point, I think we probably are looking at 7,000 a kilowatt or south of that and continue to sort of chip away at that in terms of making sure that we can deliver all the functionality requirements to continue to be differentiated in that market yet continue to deliver attractive returns on those facilities in their own right. As to the number, we're not going to -- we're not forecasting any specific number there. What we have said is that we've kind of sort of allocated several hundred million of the CapEx guide that you see in the -- in our guidance towards this. Not all of that might be spent in '18, but then again, we also may use some of our existing capacity toward hyperscale-type requirements. So it's a little bit of a tough one to fully tease apart. But we're not -- we haven't specifically guided on that. I think it's going to be -- what we said is we're going to go in. We're going to do these initial builds on balance sheet because we can do them most expeditiously and learn from them. And then we'll reevaluate the level of support we will want to provide to that business going forward. And I think going forward, it would probably be highly likely that we would be augmenting on-balance sheet with some sort of off-balance sheet activity, whether in the form of project financing, capital recycling, JVs, any number of other possible alternatives there. But again, we'll have to guide you guys to that in terms of timing and extent of that as we go. So I think those were the key items there in terms of what your ask was. Keith Taylor : And sorry, I just want to add one thing to what Charles said. I think it's important to understand that when you think about the guide that we have for this year, we've made virtually no assumption on HIT revenue for 2018. And so that's another opportunity for us to continue to show upward momentum on the revenue line. But again, there's not much in the way of assumptions in the 2018 plan. Charles Meyers : John, there was one other one that I want to make sure I hit, and that was your question of is this is an attractive business in its own right. And I want to be clear. The answer is it kind of -- it depends. Is there a capital pool available out there that is willing to apply its capital to sort of mid-teens returns with this risk profile and finds that interesting and acceptable? Yes. And -- but relative to Equinix and to our opportunity here, we have what we think is a significant and expanding depth of market opportunity where we're going to -- we can provide substantial returns that are substantially superior to that. And so doing this is more a means to an end. I made that clear on the last call, that this isn't about a belief that somehow we're tapping out our retail interconnection-oriented ecosystem-driven market and therefore need to go grab for a piece of the hyperscale pie. This is instead about saying we believe strongly in the cloud ecosystem as a fundamental long-term growth driver for the premium retail interconnection-driven opportunity and therefore are going to put these projects in place where we think those are accretive to that strategy. And so we'll figure out what the right level is to accomplish that strategic objective, but that is very clearly our goal. That doesn't mean other people aren't going to enter the market and fight over the big hyperscale opportunity that we think is out there. And I'm sure we'll run into it along the way, but we believe we've got a differentiated value proposition due to the breadth of our portfolio, the depth of our interconnection assets, our relationship with the hyperscalers, the integration between our cloud exchange and those cloud platforms and the resources, frankly, that are necessary to support that strategy, which others simply can't do. Operator : The next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Ahmed Badri : So a little bit more of a follow-up regarding the dedicated hyperscale. So what is the, I want to say, estimated number of deals specific to hyperscale deals do you think you'll be doing each of these years? Is this going to be a 10 a year? Are you looking to only do 1 or 2 here and there? Is it going to be specifically targeted to Europe or Asia? Maybe can you just give us a little more color on the strategy for specifically dedicated hyperscale? Charles Meyers : Yes. As I said, we haven't really sized it. I think that we do anticipate that it would be a global business. We think there's sort of meaningful opportunity, particularly in Europe right now, and Europe has been a very robust market. We are taking advantage of the leader position -- leadership position we've commanded post-Telecity to really accelerate our growth in the European market. So we do see probably the greatest opportunity in that market near term. Behind that, I would say Asia, we think, there absolutely is an opportunity to serve hyperscale requirements in that market as that continues to deliver very strong growth opportunity for the hyperscalers and then Americas behind that. But there is still opportunity here where we think we have strong interconnection value propositions, and the metro strategies really support the hyperscale investment. We'll actively look at that both in North America as well as in South America. So again, we aren't giving any specific numbers. As I said, I think there's probably a dozen or more markets that represent very real and appropriate markets for us to consider investing in. And probably, we would tend to build hyperscale facilities at a size that are going to support a handful of deals into those -- into each of those facilities through a couple of phases. And so that's probably about all the color we'd probably be comfortable with at this point other than to say we've allocated a few hundred million to that on balance sheet to get to a point where we can come back and give you more clarity. I'd expect we're going to be able to do that probably at Analyst Day and start to give you a little better frame on that. Ahmed Badri : Got it. And then the second question is regarding Europe. Looking through 2018 and the current general market observations that you've been seeing, is the market strengthening or softening? And maybe can you give us more color on pricing supply and demand dynamics? Maybe you could just comment on both aspects of that so we can get a better idea what's going on there. Peter Van Camp : Well, I'll just say first, Europe had a great finish to the year, actually a great growth year. And we continue to see solid momentum there. Obviously, as we said, a lot of the capital next year will be going into Europe because they have been getting to a higher and higher rate of utilization. The Telecity transaction actually gave us a lot of good headroom to grow. And through that momentum in Europe, we've largely been filling that up, which is why so much capital will be sent there this year. Operator : And the last question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Vincent Chao : Just a quick question going back to the investments that have been made this year. You've obviously taken down quite a few acquisitions in the recent past. Just curious, maybe tying in with Steve's departure as well, I mean, should we expect that pace to continue? Or should we be in more of a digestion mode from an acquisition perspective? Peter Van Camp : No, I think as we talked about the strategy, we're going to continue to press our advantage. But I know we've done a lot of acquisitions, but we've been very selective about their strategic value and what they've meant to us. Clearly, broadening our footprint in EMEA was a meaningful one, and also Metronode in Australia giving us such a strong position in that market. Those made a lot of sense. And we'll continue to see those and look at them going forward. As you just think about '18 and even with Steve's departure, as you mentioned it, the operating plan, the strategy and everything we're pursuing this year has been set and in place. So ultimately, I think it's a business as usual year with the leadership team being very focused in carrying out the plan that's in place. So I wouldn't look for dramatic changes in our thinking or how we're approaching our opportunity. Vincent Chao : Okay. And then just maybe going back to the Infomart. I mean, it sounds like maybe high 40s EBITDA margin if I interpreted your comment there correctly, Keith. It's a very high multiple going in. Obviously, there's a lot of expansion capacity on top of that. I'm just curious, how are you thinking about the additional cost to build out that 40 megawatts? And how are you thinking about sort of the returns here given the sort of high going-in valuation? Keith Taylor : I think first and foremost, as we said, 12 months from closing, we'll make it an AFFO-accretive transaction. The real value for us is what Steve and Charles -- pardon me, PVC, there's a Freudian, what PVC and Charles alluded to was the fact that we're going to invest right in our strategy. And the Dallas market is a very strong market both for enterprise and then just globally from a colocation perspective. And so being able to build contiguous to that space is going to be very important to us. And we believe we can drive immense intrinsic value to the business and to the shareholders by building out that capacity. We recognize that it is a high-value deal, but our belief is, number one, that we're going to get the returns and we're going to develop a strategy that will drive value to the bottom line over the not-too-distant future. Charles Meyers : Yes, Vince, I might just add. I think you have to sort of telescope out a little bit and put a broader lens on the Infomart Dallas transaction in that you combine a set of things, which is now our NOTA asset, combined with the Infomart asset, combined with our leadership position in Brazil, combined with the depth of the enterprise market in Dallas and now add in our appetite to add hyperscale to the mix in terms of some of that potential capacity, and you have to sort of stir all of that together and say what does that mean in terms of creating long-term ecosystem value and continuing to position to be the partner of choice in building out hybrid cloud, multi-cloud to the enterprise market in the U.S. and in the South America. And I think when you add all those things together and you take the current strength of our overall position, I think we feel very good about the transaction, our ability to digest it, integrate it and move it forward and create value. Vincent Chao : Got it. And since I'm the last questioner here, maybe could you just give an update on the transition post Steve's departure, where you're at with the search, any comment on sort of how morale is and things like that at the organization? Peter Van Camp : Sure. Well, I'll start and I'll look at Keith and Charles and Katrina, but we actually just had, two weeks ago, our annual global kickoff. So the whole go-to-market engine was together to really get educated as well as motivated for 2018. So this was a great launch to the year, and I think all the heads are turning in the right direction. So it was a very, I think, strong experience for the team as well as the leadership team because we were all there as a part of it. That said, I think the first thing to understand is that, and this would be my -- this is going to be my focus as well, the near term is all about executing on our plan for 2018. As I said earlier, with the strategy, the operating plan in place, again, it's a business as usual opportunity. Some of that is enabled by the fact that certainly I've had a good working relationship with the team for some time. So this is blending well so far.  We do have now a subcommittee in the board that's been appointed. I'll chair that and so the board's objectives here, well, one obviously being the best choice for selecting a CEO. But also note that the board's interests are aligned with keeping this operating plan going, and they'll be very focused on ensuring we have a smooth transition to continue to support that as the year unfolds. And so maybe it's kind of a unique luxury, but we do have the opportunity to be as diligent as we need to, thoughtful and thorough as we really solve for this over the quarters to come. So I think we're in a very good position to manage the process but not yet ready to make any further comments on timing. And we're all busy at work. Katrina Rymill : Great. Thank you. That concludes our Q4 call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. It's good to be joining all of you as we share our strong results for the start of 2018. As we come up on our 20th anniversary, we are excited to post our 61st quarter of consecutive revenue growth as we continue to cultivate powerful digital ecosystems on a global scale. With our recent acquisitions, we are now the market leader in 16 out of the 24 countries in which we operate, reflecting the size, scale and reach that we've built around the world. We serve 47% of the Fortune 500 and our penetration continues to tick up as new customers evolve their digital infrastructures, presenting an expanded opportunity set for us to target. Turning to the results of the quarter, our differentiated platform continues to drive financial performance. As depicted on slide 3, first quarter revenues were $1.216 billion, up 10% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $580 million for the quarter, up 11% over the same quarter last year, while AFFO growth was 13% year-over-year. These growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our metrics across MRR per cabinet, cross-connect additions, new customer acquisition and stabilized asset growth were all healthy. And our channel program had another strong quarter with 19% of our bookings originating from the channel and an outsized contribution to our strong new logo performance. Interconnection revenues continue to outpace colocation, growing 16% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, reinforcing the foundational importance of interconnection in today's hybrid and multi-cloud architectures. For the full year, we see solid fundamentals as global infrastructure demand continues and we have a strong pipeline. Platform Equinix continues to scale as we have effectively doubled the size of our business over the last three years through both M&A and strong organic growth. We recently closed our 21st and 22nd acquisitions with the Infomart and Metronode, both of which saw good momentum during our closing period. Our footprint now extends across 200 IBXs and 52 markets, providing our customers a global platform to securely deploy and directly connect their digital infrastructures around the world. Infomart Dallas is one of the most interconnected hubs in North America and home to four of our eight Dallas IBXs. By adding this landmark facility, we're strengthening our interconnection density, while also creating new opportunities to grow our business in the banking, technology, energy and health care sectors, in one of the largest colocation markets in the U.S. In addition, this sizable building currently houses more than 50 other tenants, which we will manage as a landlord. And in the future, the adjacent land on the property will be developed to provide over 40 megawatts of additional capacity for both retail and hyperscale. Our Metronode acquisition establishes Equinix as the market leader in Australia, expanding our footprint from five to 15 data centers to accelerate interconnection and digital edge deployments nationwide. This acquisition gives us a stronger presence in our existing metros and a wider footprint with four new metros in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra and Perth. Metronode site in Perth will become the landing station for the new Vocus cable between Australia and Singapore, and positions Equinix as a leading hub for intercontinental connectivity and builds on our existing subsea traction in Sydney. Meanwhile, our Verizon integration efforts are progressing well and we continue to be very pleased with the strategic benefits and the financial value from this transaction. However, I should note this quarter we absorbed higher pre-close customer terminations than we identified within the acquired installed base. We expect to fully conclude our integration efforts by the end of the year and we continue to see solid demand from both new and existing customers. So on balance, we expect flat revenue from Verizon this year as we work through the anticipated churn, while we see continued solid gross bookings into the Verizon sites and have a healthy pipeline for our planned expansions in Culpeper, Denver, Houston, Miami and Sao Paulo. Longer term, we expect the growth rate for the Verizon portfolio to be in line with our other stabilized assets. Now, a few comments on our organic development activity. We are investing capital to build out the platform in response to strong underlying demand. In the first quarter, we completed builds in our Chicago, Osaka and Paris data centers. With our high level of inventory utilization and a growing sales funnel, we have a very active pipeline with 30 expansion projects currently underway across the platform. Half of these projects are in EMEA, our most utilized and fastest growing region, and greater than 75% of this expansion CapEx is allocated to mature metros that each generate over $100 million in revenue where established campuses and ecosystem density create strong and predictable fill rates. We continue to see progress building our Hyperscale Infrastructure Team, also known as HIT, that will focus on developing facilities tuned to hyperscale requirements as we discussed last quarter. We're in the early stages and Paris 8, which opens at the end of this year, represents our first dedicated build for this initiative. We are also progressing well with financing structures that will allow us to pursue this important market with limited balance sheet exposure. We expect to add a handful of strategic builds across key markets over the next year and we have a healthy pipeline of attractive hyperscale opportunities. Shifting to interconnection, we have the most complete interconnection portfolio in the industry and our goal is to be the connection route to everything customers require. We now have over 283,000 cross-connects with healthy net adds this quarter despite some continued headwinds for migration to 100-gig. We also saw strong peak traffic volumes across our leading industry exchanges. Our Internet Exchange Provisioned Capacity stepped up over the last quarter on strong 100-gig port adds and expansion in new EMEA markets. And our Equinix Cloud Exchange Fabric continued to emerge as the foundational tool for customers implementing multi-cloud architectures. ECX saw record traffic levels and broadened its adoption now to over 1,100 customers. And now we're in the process of connecting our IBXs physically and virtually around the world through the Equinix Cloud Exchange Fabric. We saw a good uptake with over 85 customers taking advantage of this expanded deployment capability. We are continuing to evolve our global platform with the addition of new products and services, facilitating companies in their shift to digital and multi-cloud. We announced Equinix SmartKey this quarter, a new security key management service for multi-cloud and the first of several enabling services we plan to introduce in the coming quarters. We are focused on delivering new customer-inspired product and services that provide increasing value to our customers and connect them across a globally consistent data center and interconnection platform. Now, let me cover some highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical had its second best bookings quarter fueled by continued infrastructure build out by both global and regional telecom providers to support the digital business needs of end customers and strong reseller momentum with our top NSP partners. The expansion this quarter included : Orange, which extended its footprint to support a commercial cloud offering; CenturyLink upgrading core infrastructure and leveraging Equinix dense ecosystems to support digital services; and Verizon expanding its footprint to support SD-WAN and content delivery. Equinix is also seeing continued momentum with the important subsea cable space where our position is meaningfully strengthened by our Metronode acquisition. In financial services, we achieved significant bookings growth led by insurance and capital markets with strength in EMEA. Customer expansions included a European stock exchange adopting multi-cloud and expanding its footprint to re-architect IT as well as a top three global asset management firm increasing its footprint to improve business continuity and support multi-cloud. The content and digital media vertical experienced solid bookings led by the Asia Pacific region and by the e-commerce, gaming and CDN sub-segments. Our cloud and IT vertical produced solid bookings led by SaaS providers as customers diversify towards a multi-cloud architecture. New customer adds included : Dropbox deploying infrastructure across 17 metros to expand its cloud storage platform; StackPath extending its footprint to provide security services at the edge; and DigitalOcean growing to support its international developer community with a scalable compute platform. Turning to the enterprise vertical, our fastest growing vertical delivered diversified growth across health care, legal and travel with strong new logo adds. New wins in the Fortune 500 included a global beauty company deploying distributed data management for global workforce and regulatory compliance, and a large health insurance provider using Platform Equinix for cloud connectivity and data management. We also saw expansions from a top three rental car company implementing hybrid cloud to accelerate global IT transformation and Intercontinental Hotels Group leveraging Platform Equinix to connect to ecosystem partners in key metros. So, let me stop there and turn the call over to Keith to cover the results. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Thanks, PVC, and good afternoon to everyone. I'd like to start by highlighting that we had yet another solid start to a year. We had strong bookings with particular strength in both our EMEA and APAC regions, in part due to the level of imports received from the Americas region, a reflection of our global selling capabilities and the benefit of a global platform. Our Q1 metrics included strong interconnection performance, increased provisioned port capacity, and firm MRR per cabinet, both by region and on a consolidated basis. And we continued to accentuate the key points of differentiation between our business and our peers, including investing in new products and services, scaling our sales force as our business grows, and supporting a broader initiative around customer experience. Our investment decisions allow us to continue to separate ourselves from our competitors, as we pursue this differentiated business opportunity that we see in front of us. For 2018, we're guiding to revenue growth of 9% including the Verizon assets. This guidance includes a meaningful step up in bookings and revenue on a much larger base, while driving more cash flow to the business as reflected in both our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. In April, we closed the Metronode and Infomart Dallas transactions. The Metronode acquisition makes Equinix the market leader in Australia with a national footprint and a customer base that includes strong government traction. Metronode continued to experience strong momentum through the close of the transaction. And our guidance now assumes an annualized revenue run rate of approximately $50 million with adjusted EBITDA margins of greater than 50%. The ten IBX assets in the Metronode portfolio, nine of which are owned, provide incremental land for future expansions. The current Metronode footprint is highly utilized at greater than 90% and we will move quickly to build out additional capacity, which we expect to be available in 2019. Once this additional inventory builds out, we expect Metronode assets to show a healthy revenue growth. We're also very excited about the Infomart Dallas asset purchase, one of the most connected buildings in North America. Our primary emphasis will be on maximizing our existing $100 million business inside the Infomart, while also assessing other opportunities to drive increased shareholder value including expanded development of the building and the adjacent land. Also, we'll continue to support the current tenant base, which generates annualized revenues of $35 million with accretive adjusted EBITDA margins to our current business, and we will enjoy approximately $14 million of cash rent savings related to the deal as we effectively become our own landlord. The benefit of which will be a reduction in our interest expense and a decrease in our capital lease liability as our Infomart leases were treated as capital versus operating leases. For integration costs, we're updating our guidance to now approximate $50 million for 2018 including $15 million of cost related to the Infomart and Metronode acquisitions. Now, looking at the first quarter, Q1 was another strong quarter of operating performance. As depicted on slide 4, Global Q1 revenues was $1.216 billion, up 10% over the same quarter last year. As expected, NRR revenues decreased by $12 million compared to Q4, bringing our NRR revenues to 5% of total revenues, consistent with our historical levels. EMEA and APAC were the fastest growing regions at 12% year-over-year growth each, followed by the Americas at 7%. The Verizon assets contributed $135 million of revenues, flat quarter-over-quarter as we identified and absorbed the higher pre-close customer terminations and credits as PVC outlined. As we exit 2018, we expect the Verizon asset revenues to grow nicely with the integration behind us and the investments being made in the core Verizon markets. Q1 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $7 million positive currency benefit when compared to the Q4 average FX rates and a $6 million positive currency benefit when compared to our FX guidance range due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. Global Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $580 million, up 11% over the same quarter last year, and higher than expectations due to improving gross profit, largely due to lower than planned utility expense and timing of integration costs. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.1% excluding integration costs. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, had a $1 million positive benefit when compared to both the Q4 average FX rates and our FX guidance rates. Global Q1 AFFO was $415 million, up 13% over the same quarter last year, largely due to strong adjusted EBITDA performance and lower than planned recurring capital expenditures. AFFO per share was $5.21; the first time we eclipsed the $5 per share threshold in a quarter, and a meaningful 26% uplift over the same quarter last year. Q1 global MRR churn was 2.4%, and we expect 2018 MRR churn to continue to average between 2% and 2.5% per quarter for the rest of the year. Now turning to the regional highlights whose full results are covered on slides 5 through 7. We continue to benefit from the power of our global selling engine with over 58% of our revenues coming from customers deployed globally across all three regions and 84% across multiple metros. The Americas region had solid revenue and adjusted EBITDA results in the first quarter, while absorbing the expected decrease in non-recurring revenues or NRR. As we discussed previously, NRR can be lumpy and vary from quarter-to-quarter particularly related to custom installation work, provided to customers for their deployments. Cabinets billing were positive, but lighter than the four-quarter average due to timing of customer installations. Turning to EMEA, we saw record bookings this quarter led by the strength in our German and Dutch markets with continued growth in our interconnection revenues. Our new EMEA Internet exchange deployments experienced solid early traction including our Dublin, Frankfurt and London markets. And Asia-Pacific delivered its second best bookings quarter with particular strength in our Australian and Singaporean markets. We continue to enjoy strong momentum across the platform from leading Chinese service providers with significant expansion activity coming from Alibaba and Tencent. Interconnection revenues had a strong quarter, up 4% over last quarter, adding over 5,000 cross-connects as we continue our steady pace of growth. The Americas and Asia-Pacific interconnection revenues were 22% and 14% respectively, while EMEA stepped up 10% of recurring revenues. From a total company perspective, interconnection revenues were 17% of total recurring revenues. And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to slide 8. We continue to optimize our capital structure and take advantage of the low interest rate environment. In Q1, we completed a \u20ac750 million high yield offering at a very attractive interest rate, adding appropriate liquidity on the balance sheet to fund our various initiatives. Our net debt leverage ratio pro forma for our two recent acquisitions increased to 4.5 times our Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA. We expect our net debt leverage ratio to revert to our target range of three to four times over the next few quarters. Turning to slide 9, for the quarter, capital expenditures were $350 million, including recurring CapEx of $35 million. Currently, we have 30 new construction projects underway, two-thirds of which are on owned properties, adding capacity in 20 markets around the world. Our 2018 capital plan is significant, a recognition that there is attractive demand across our now 52-market portfolio. And this step up in investment is required to support the scale of our business. We also recently purchased our Stockholm 2 data center and purchased land parcels for future expansions in Frankfurt, Helsinki, and Tokyo. Revenue from owned assets stepped up to over 45% with the close of the Infomart and Metronode acquisitions. Our capital investments are delivering healthy growth and strong returns as shown on slide 10. Stabilized IBX revenues grew 6% year-over-year on a same store basis, largely driven by increasing interconnection revenues and increased power density. Also, consistent with prior years, during Q1, we completed our annual refresh of new expansion and stabilized asset categorizations. Our stabilized asset count increased by net 10 IBXs. These stabilized assets are collectively 84% utilized and generate a 29% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And finally, please refer to slides 11 through 16 for our summary of 2018 guidance and bridges. For the full year 2018, we're raising our revenue guidance by $92 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance by $45 million, excluding integration costs, primarily due to favorable FX rates and the acquisitions. This guidance implies a revenue growth rate including Verizon assets of 9% year-over-year and a healthy adjusted EBITDA margin of 48%, excluding integration costs. The momentum of our business continues to drive AFFO and AFFO per share. We're maintaining our 2018 AFFO per share guidance of $20.82 per share, excluding integration costs, absorbing the impact of $50 million of incremental debt service costs and the impact of the two recent acquisitions for the first 12 months of their operations. We've assumed a weighted-average 80 million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. AFFO is expected to grow 12% year-over-year on a reported basis. We expect 2018 non-recurring capital expenditures to now range between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion, which takes into consideration the Infomart Dallas and Metronode transactions. And finally turning to dividends, for 2018, we expect to pay out total cash dividends of $725 million, an 18% increase over the prior year and reflects an AFFO payout ratio of approximately 45%. Consistent with the prior quarter, the Q2 cash dividend is $2.28 per share. So with that, let me stop here and turn it back to PVC. Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Thanks, Keith. In closing, we continue to deliver solid results growing at a healthy pace, investing in future capabilities and showing strong performance as we increase our interconnection penetration, traction with a Global 2000 customer and a firm MRR per cabinet. The demands of digital transformation continue to be a major force in the market and we are seeing a meaningful transition as both service provider and enterprise customers adopt hybrid and multi-cloud as the IT architecture of choice. We are uniquely positioned to help customers navigate this transition and are boosting our competitive edge through investment in go to market efforts, and the evolution of the reach, scale and capabilities of our highly differentiated global platform. We have targeted and are pursuing this expanding opportunity set and are scaling our global platform to meet the demand fueled by a strong sales pipeline to drive our regions for the remainder of the year. So, let me stop here and Charlotte, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Frank Louthan from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thank you. So walk us through a little bit through the expansion opportunities in Europe. I mean at the beginning of the year, you updated some CapEx, a lot of which was due to that, maybe give us an idea there. And then give us an idea of what sort of expansion capabilities are left in Culpeper and Miami specifically as you look at trying to grow those Verizon assets a little more. Thanks. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Sure, Frank. Let me start and the others perhaps can jump in. First and foremost, as you can see, we still have 30 projects that are currently underway. The European theater is our fastest growing region and so from our perspective, recognizing the majority of the investment's going to go into what we call the flat markets, so Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam and Paris. It's a reflection of basically the momentum that we're seeing in. And so as we exit sort of Q1, I think you're going to really see the majority of that benefit coming through sort of the middle of the year, through the back end of the year as we continue to install our customers. And I'm sorry I've now forgotten the second part of your question. Katrina Rymill - Equinix, Inc.: It's Culpeper and Miami. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Oh, that's right. And as it relates to Culpeper and Miami, Miami for all intents and purposes, is are relatively untapped opportunity for \u2013 it was an untapped opportunity that we wanted to realize. There's roughly 3,000 available cabinets coming out of it now for the Americas and we've started the first major build. We did a small build to create a little bit more capacity, but we're really looking forward to that incremental build and one of the things that was really interesting is we talk about the core markets related to the Verizon assets. The majority of those assets are greater than 90% or near 90% utilized and as a result, we need that capacity to continue to scale. Now we made some minor refinements to the utilization rates of the Verizon assets. It's roughly 82% from the 87% we talked about in the last quarter. That all said though when you look at the markets that we really want to develop and we're putting capital to work at those top five markets that PVC alluded to and so we're eager to get to the Miami market and create more capacity, also in the Culpeper market because the pipeline is healthy and supportive of that expansion opportunity. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And is there a major expansion in Miami within the same building or is it just near... Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Actually, it's the same building and what's interesting is only the first part of \u2013 there is a multitude of opportunities for us there. As I said, it's roughly a \u2013 think of it as a potential incremental 3,000 plus cabinets in the NAP of the Americas. So, it's in our expansion tracking sheet. Frank, you also noticed that we had a small build as I said through the last quarter of 2017, but we really are looking forward to the build out, it's roughly \u2013 (29:04) was just showing me here, roughly 1,100 cabinets will be available in Q3. And part of the reason that we talked about the Verizon assets again, we're going through if you will, the \u2013 we refer to it as pre-close customer terminations and some churn and we're making some very prudent assumptions in the go-forward basis and what we should expect. But one of the things that we want you to walk away is the recognition that the majority of our growth is going to come from these core markets. And that inventory is not going to be available until the second half of the year, hence why we've decided to say let's hold the Verizon assets flat through the remainder of the year pending that and also recognizing that we'll continue to make some assumptions on churn through the remaining part of the year. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. Just a final note, Frank, on Miami as you may recall, it is a very dense interconnection hub that also is the destination for all the routes down to South America. So it largely had no room to expand, so a great opportunity into the Verizon acquisition was to create that room because this will be certainly a site that will have a strong fill rate against it once we have the capacity in place. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Phil? Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sorry. As I look at the pace of CapEx, I expect we'll be building through the year. One, is that fair? And two, does that lead to next year being a fairly heavy investment year as well? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Well, as you can see, I mean, the \u2013 what's interesting on the expansion tracking sheet that we shared with you Phil is that the majority of \u2013 the vast majority of the build will take \u2013 will have assets opening up through the second half of the year. And again just sort of eyeballing it's roughly 22,000 to 23,000 cabinets. But we do anticipate that some of that will also spill into 2019. Again, there will be facts and circumstances specific as you know we're now servicing a 52 market portfolio. We're going to look at our fill rates. We spend a lot of energy breaking that down, looking at not only the pipeline, the empirical fill rates, but also the competitive dynamics in the market. And we'll update you on our thinking for 2019 in the \u2013 probably in the not too distant future. I'm not sure we'll be able to do it by Analyst Day, but certainly as we get to back end of the year you'll get a good sense of what we're thinking about for 2019. Suffice it to say though with the momentum that we see in the pipeline opportunity, you would expect \u2013 you should expect us to continue to invest meaningfully on the CapEx line. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sure. And is it more challenging to build in Europe? It just seems like the capacity is coming on a little later on that side than in the U.S. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: I wouldn't say, it's any more difficult. Again it's market specific as you can probably appreciate. It depends on the regulatory environment, the compliance requirements, the ability to get available contractors. Some markets, like a Tokyo market, could be a bit more difficult than other markets. But Europe in and of itself has not historically been a tough market and because we're building a lot adjacent to our existing facilities contiguous to our assets or in close proximity, it makes it a lot easier for us to build out in that market. And then as you can see, the majority of the assets again in the expansion tracking sheet that are going to be built are the London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and Paris market. And we've had some pretty strong experience over the not too distant future building out in those markets. Where it takes you a little bit longer is if it's a first phase build because you're building it from the ground up and that of course takes a lot of work as you are developing the land and you're building the core and shelf, but from that point forward it becomes relatively cookie cutter-ish. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, Keith. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Atkin from RBC. Your line is now open. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good afternoon. I wondered, Keith, if you could provide further details around the financings structures that you kind of mentioned in the script around hyperscale, and are they kind of \u2013 are they unique to certain regions or countries or might it be kind of global in nature? Thanks. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah, Jonathan, we want to spend a lot of energy in this, between Charles and we probably will take this on in a much more healthy way at the Analyst Day, but suffice to say we are thinking \u2013 we're probably thinking more specific to our market or region. We don't have a global view. I think, it's tough recognizing that we might have different investors investing in different theaters with us and as a result the structures can be a little bit different. What's really important here is we want to take this opportunity, we're going to be very strategic about it, and we're going to try and push as much of that off balance sheet as possible and enjoy the benefits of the investment, yet partnering up with others to use capital and put leverage on it, so it makes sense for the business and it doesn't allows us to continue to focus on our retail business. That give us some time on the Analyst Day, and we'll probably have that a little bit more fleshed out for you. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Right. To a degree it sounds like your choice of location, your next locations could be influenced by financial considerations then? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Well, I think, it's more about \u2013 sorry, Charles and I were just deciding who is going to take this one. Let me just say the first part is, look there's plenty of financing opportunities out there for us. So, our constraint is not going to be about our financing. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, I agree. I think we're going to go to the market opportunity based on what the customer demand is, and which investments and projects we think are accretive to our leadership position in the cloud enabled enterprise ecosystem. And so and we are building a very robust funnel of those opportunities. We've got a very positive response from the customer set. Jim now is \u2013 Jim Smith is now on board as a full-time employee, we're really energized about that he's bringing an exceptional experience and skillset to the table. So we're building funnel quickly and we're not going to let, I think, the financing get in the way of what we're going to \u2013 what we're going to \u2013 how we're going to respond to the market opportunity. So \u2013 but I would say as Keith said, it's likely that it's going to be a number of underlying structures and those may have slightly different characteristics based on the profile of both our existing and future assets in those markets. And ideally what we want to get to is a situation where we have a highly responsive agile capability to respond to these hyperscale requirements. The ones that we think are strategic, but do that without a lot of balance sheet exposure. And I think, we're tracking well against that objective, and like Keith said you'll hear more about that as we get to Analyst Day. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then just quickly on integration on Infomart Dallas. Is there any kind of implication for the Americas cross-connect trends that we might see now that you own the entire building? And then on Verizon, I appreciate you're giving utilization number there, 82%, are you marketing the vacated space, is there demand for it and might there be a different customer profile for that absorption versus your traditional product? Thanks. Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Well, certainly there will be growth as we start to expand in interconnection in Dallas. And so we'll see a lot of value to our density there and bringing that to more customers as they come onboard, but we are the interconnection hub in the Infomart already. So you'll see continued growth out of us and as we expand more customers will come through it but it's not a differently acquired set of interconnection services that we've gotten there. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: And Jonathan I think I'd just add on to what PVC says, what's really important here is there's really a separation between what we're doing with the Metronode acquisition, which is \u2013 which really has to be wholly integrated versus the Dallas \u2013 or the Infomart Dallas which is more of an asset purchase, right. And integrations are a lot easier for us in that asset relative to a 10-building operating business in Australia. And in both cases, we're holding on top of our integration efforts. We're excited about where we sit and I think we'll give you a little bit of the details around what we think we can accomplish this year. But as we continue to invest around these assets, I think that's going to give us an opportunity for continued growth in that portfolio and that asset. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: And what was the second part of your question, again, Jonathan? Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. Yeah. The vacant Verizon space and to what extent that's being marketed? Are you seeing interest, any sort of different profile that \u2013 of customer that might go into that vacated space versus legacy Equinix IBX? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, we position it, as we've always made clear we sell as a platform, right. So we want to quickly integrate assets into the portfolio and then position those across the customer base globally and ensure that all the sales teams are selling those. So individual assets appeal to different use cases, that's not a distinction of Verizon. That's true of our assets as well. And so, I think we are \u2013 we're marketing those very effectively, the team is up to speed on how to position those. We are seeing good gross demand and bookings into those facilities. And in fact what I would highlight is, is that the flat guide for Verizon revenue through the remainder of the year is an artifact of the, of sort of what are \u2013 what we're finding in terms of churn related to some of the pre-close sort of cancellations that were there as we sorted through that, and just a prudent assessment on our part of kind of what we ought to imply about growth. And so \u2013 but not a reflection of, I think, a lack of demand there because we are seeing solid bookings into those facilities. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Just wondering, if there was any update on the board's search for a permanent CEO. And also on the U.S. MRR per cabinet, and the interconnect volumes, I think, you referenced the moved to 100-gig. Can you just talk a little bit more about the puts and takes driving that versus some of the strength you've seen in other regions? Thank you. Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. First on the new CEO appointment, there's really no update there. Just as a team we're continuing to pursue our 2018 opportunity. And so nothing new to add, I think you're going to just assume, I'll continue in the seat for a few quarters here. And besides that on interconnection, it has been interesting. We saw a solid interconnection uptick this quarter, in revenue seeing it 16% year-over-year. And of course that was in the face of a 100-gig. 100-gig showing up more in the United States than anywhere else, because certainly the dense interconnect or Internet interconnection that we have here is a reason for it doing as well as it is, and we're seeing good growth in ports of a 100-gig, but still nice to see interconnection as a whole growing as strongly as it is in the face of that. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. Just a little incremental color there, Simon, we \u2013 there's actually a relatively small number of players, who have the sort of traffic profile that warrants the sort of the investment in 100-gig optics. And so what we're seeing is those where, there is a strong economic justification to make that investment. They're sort of leading the way on surprisingly and many of those are well, well through their migration. So I think we still got a little bit to go in terms of seeing some of that headwind but what we do and I'm sure this will not be surprising to you but we look very closely at the gross adds, as well as kind of what the term profile is. And what we want to make sure is that we're seeing sustained gross demand and that is in fact the case. And so in fact, I would argue that we're seeing a more robust and more diverse use case portfolio for interconnection broadly, both at the physical layer in terms of cross-connects and at the virtual layer now with ECX. And so, I think really all-in-all a very good story there relative to the interconnection portfolio and how it's performing. We did a quartiles analysis which sort of showed what our concentration of interconnection was and how it was changing over time and a lot of goodness in that analysis as we looked at really key \u2013 sort of new robust long-term use cases we think driving this new demand profile, including private cloud connectivity. And a much longer tail of enterprise customers now finding utility in private interconnection even at the physical layer and they often start at a virtual with ECX and then as they aggregate traffic or have a different performance requirement, then they move to the cross-connect. And there's just nobody that can \u2013 and then having the Internet, the IX as well, there's just nobody that can sort of respond to that full profile the way we can. So very excited about how the interconnection business is performing overall. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Colby Synesael from Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC: Great. Thank you. Two if I may. First off, on Americas cabinet adds, they're negative in the quarter, and I'm just trying to get a better sense how much of that came from the Verizon assets and what's going on there. And I think you may have mentioned some delayed installs. Just trying to get a better understanding of the various components that drove that number. And then secondly as it relates to the HIT business, in the past quarter you had mentioned some notable wins. I'm just curious if there's any other big wins that occurred in the first quarter and if so if you could break out by geography, however detailed you want. Thank you. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: So, Colby, just on the Americas cabinet adds, so you'll see in our tracking sheets or non-financial where it's actually 400 net adds in the quarter. Where we had made some comment is we made a slight adjustment to the opening balance of the Verizon assets. And so that might be skewing your calculation and so we took that number down and went from 87% utilization down to the 82% I referred to. But when you look at the core business non-Verizon, it was really 400 net adds in the quarter. And then the other question was... Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah, well, and just let me finish on that one. That's, again, as we've said, that is really a timing artifact. We had a really strong quarter last quarter on cabinet adds. We've had sort of some of this lumpiness in that profile and generally chalk that up to timing. You have to really look at I think on cabinet adds over a sort of multi-quarter period and sort of draw a trend line into that. So no alarm from our perspective as to the health of the cabinet adds, so that's that one. The second one was with regard to HIT. We did have a win, some wins that we had talked about. We are actively engaged in deal discussions for both projects that are hyperscale oriented into some existing facilities, but now really starting to ramp up, where we're talking about deals that are going to go into dedicated HIT facilities. And so as we said, there's probably just a couple of projects that we're doing now, Paris 8 being there and then some other European centric projects that we're looking at that will start to roll out in the near future. And again, we're in active discussions with anchor customers to start to take up some of that demand. So no new net wins to report, but I think I would characterize it as exceptionally healthy funnel and great progress in terms of winning the kinds of deals that we want to win. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC: And just to clarify on the Americas cabinets, so is it fair to say then that the Verizon portfolio, those cabinets remain I guess flat based on the new accounting. And is the 400 that you added, that was basically I guess we'll call traditional Equinix? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yes. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Okay. Yes, organic business. Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Yes. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: That's right. Yeah. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay, great. Thank you. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays. Your line is now open. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much and good afternoon folks. Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I wanted to touch base on sort of the M&A landscape. We hear commentary from other players in the market. There seems to suggest that some of the private company valuations are a bit high at the moment and may temper some of the M&A activity levels. What are your thoughts on sort of potential for additional inorganic growth from your perspective? Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Well, I think that's a very fair point and certainly private equity's interest in our recent Infomart acquisition was evident in the end price as well as probably Metronode as well. So some of that is out there. I won't speak to the rest of the M&A activity in the industry, but I think where we'll be focused for a period of time here, will be more towards new markets that might be interesting, that just complement the reach of the platform or are valuable for customers and that strategic benefit. So ultimately there may be some of that influence in play, but a place we've wanted to be and haven't quite found the right answer, but will always have an eye on it is something like India, and maybe South Korea as another market that could be interesting to us. But again these are more extending the platform versus something that is more transformational like a Telecity we did a couple years ago, Verizon this past year. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's very helpful. And then a follow-up question perhaps for Keith. If we think about sort of the leverage ratio and where your longer term targets of 3 to 4 times are, I mean, if we adjust for the senior notes, seems like you're above that target ratio right now. How should we think about sort of your progress to continue to bring you within that target range? And should you pursue additional M&A, how should we think about further financing? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. Amir, that's a great question. So maybe adding on to what PVC said, you know again, a lot of what we're looking at today as a company as we think next M&A is going to be a new market opportunity or a tuck-in acquisition. As you can appreciate with two transactions that we just closed in April, we'll go out in different forms and different levels of integration, eight different integrations that are ongoing now. And so as a company we're going to continue to focus on integrating the assets and bringing efficiency. As it relates to our capital structure, we're pro forma to the \u2013 pro forma the two transactions that closed in April were 4.5 times levered, our Q1 adjusted EBITDA. Clearly with the continued growth of the business that number is going to decrease, as we continue to scale the business. We've always taken a very prudent view on maximizing shareholder value, using both debt and equity, where appropriate. As a company, we want to maintain our goal of appropriate leverage, but not too much leverage, making sure that we have \u2013 or making sure that at some point in time, we'll get to our aspiration of becoming an investment-grade rated company. Albeit today, I'm not sure, I'm not sure with the 4.5 times leverage here that that's within the next 12 months, but we still have a stated objective to become investment grade. Again we'll be using our capital structure as effectively, as we can, and in some cases as Charles alluded to earlier on, we'll partner with others off balance sheet to continue to grow other elements of the opportunity set without using our balance sheet. So bottom line, I think, it's a reasonable expectation over the not too distant future that you should see us get more towards our stated target of 4 times leverage, that's at the top end of the range. As we continue to scale the business over the next three to five years. I think, it's reasonable to assume that leverage will be very, very much within our target ranges. And with our aspiration of getting to investment grade, I think we'll put ourselves in a good position with a very balanced view on capital. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks very much for giving the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Just going back to the Verizon performance and some of the reductions in the guidance for that, I was just curious, I mean, you kept your overall churn guidance basically flat on a quarterly basis. I mean, should we interpret that as the rest of the business is doing a bit better than previously expected, absent some of the terminations at Verizon? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Well, Vin, part of the Verizon assets in and of themselves, it's slightly elevated churn. As you recall, I might recall when we first acquired the Verizon assets we started out with $450 million guide and then we added in the affiliated revenues. By the time we exited last year of 2017 we were roughly a $540 million revenue business. As part of that we always said that there is an element of churn that we know that we're going to experience and we had sales reserves that we had put in place. What you're experiencing now is the churn that we were guiding to a while back that we just had not yet experienced. And as a result that roughly \u2013 that low single-digit growth that we were expecting in fiscal year 2018 we're going to now hold it flat. Again we think that's very prudent, but as Charles and PVC alluded to we have a very strong bookings pipeline \u2013 sorry, pipeline with the Verizon assets. We've seen strong gross bookings. We feel we've got a handle on what we're looking at as it relates to Verizon, as a result with our churn being at 2.4% this quarter and holding our average flat. Again, recognizing it's within the scope of what we already had anticipated this year, so I would say that, if you're saying that this is going up a little bit then it's suffice to say then the organic business is going down a little bit. But overall there's no meaningful change in the churn that we were modeling for the year. And so I feel comfortable we'll put ourselves in a good position to not only again hold the revenue flat, there's roughly $15 million, $20 million adjustment to our guidance for Verizon this year. And I think as we exit the year you're going to see us not only because we fully integrated, I think, the assets, but because of the investments in the core markets you're going to see solid growth coming out of 2018 on top of those Verizon assets. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then just another question more on the construction side. We've already heard from many REITs that construction costs are going up sort of on the order of maybe 5% or 6% from an inflationary perspective. When I look at the pipeline that you have outlined and the spending that you have planned for the year, I guess how much of that is fixed in terms of deals, covered by some sort of contract or is there a risk of that going higher because of just overall inflation? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: As a company we have a pretty good \u2013 we have a very large and deep pipeline of construction activity. We have great relationships with our vendors, our providers. From our perspective, we think we get an \u2013 we have an opportunity, that's probably broader than most given the investments that we're making. That all said, there's inflationary pressures, and it's going to be market and material specific. As a company we're building contingencies when we give guidance to take into consideration, pricing fluctuations. But overall we're working real hard to drive down our average cost to build, and some of that comes from different construction techniques, part of it different design specific. And also ways to run the IBXs more efficiently after they've been built. So overall I'd just say it'll be facts and circumstances specific and again, we've got a \u2013 I think, we have a handle on it, and you shouldn't feel that there'd be any meaningful change to our guidance because of what is perceived to be cost increases. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Gutman from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Two questions, actually. One, given the timing of the cabinet deliveries in Europe, and the scale as well, and weighted to the second half, should we be assuming an acceleration in recurring revenue growth on a year-over-year basis, because it's been stable for the past several quarters at about 12%. I just want to know if you expected or should we expect it to accelerate? And after that, I just have one more. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: I think, when it comes to the European, we'll call the recurring revenue stream, certainly you're going to see an opportunity as to fill up that capacity. And as a result, by filling up the capacity in a more timely fashion, you should see some level of acceleration, there's some periodic blips that we experienced this quarter, where we \u2013 the revenues in EMEA was only growing just over 12% year-over-year. I think, there's an opportunity to see that number go up certainly as you get to the back end of the year. Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks. And the second question regards the 6% growth in stabilized assets. It's been coming from cross-connect and power density. I don't know the proportions of each. But really on the power density side, is there \u2013 in stabilized assets is there a flexibility to continue to add power density? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Absolutely, I mean, no different than adding an incremental cross-connect, as customers put more infrastructure into a given cabinet or a cage environment, they'll draw increased power, and so it's managing the relationship of the physical space with the power capacity. And so in both cases, we have been and historically have worked very hard to optimize our assets. And so you will get more power draw from those stabilized assets as you will get more interconnection. Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. And occasionally we even take on specific projects in assets, particularly assets with a slightly longer vintage to say, hey, can we \u2013 as we make upgrades, can we improve the power density of the facility and therefore accommodate more power in certain cases. So those are certainly levers available to us in the business. Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from Michael Rollins from Citi Research. Your line is now open. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could. First, I was wondering if you can maybe give us a little bit of a preview in terms of how the company is thinking about the longer term revenue growth opportunity when you take into account the number of acquisitions that you've done since the last update. And secondly, if you look at the growth rate guidance at about 9% including Verizon for 2018 on an organic basis. Can you give us a sense of how much stronger some of the regions are versus the others, and maybe just give us a sense of where each region is shaking out within the totality of the guidance? Thanks. Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Sure. I'll just react to the first part. Obviously with some of the bigger acquisitions we've done like a Verizon and different growth rates that does add to the size of the overall business. And so when you think about go forward growth, it definitely has an impact. Certainly, we feel very good about our thinking this year, how we relate to even market growth rates and continuing to outpace growth rates for retail colocation, Mike, so continued on a positive track in that direction. Well, that will give you a better sense of growth as we get to Analyst Day and we'll outline a CAGR for the coming year, so I think it will be helpful to you on that regard. And then what was the second half? Keith, did you get it? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Regional color across the... Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah, growth for regional color. Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. Well obviously, as we've said EMEA has been performing very well and contributing at a higher growth rate. Asia on a smaller number continues to hit bookings and doing very, very well, contributing to our overall growth rate as well and solid in Americas. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: I don't know, Charles, do you want to add any color to that or...? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. I think, yeah, little bit of the normal dynamics, you're seeing which is Americas is a larger and more mature market. The other markets are tending to follow in terms of some of the activities in terms of penetration and other factors that are both \u2013 driving both demand and potential substitution effects, et cetera. So, there's \u2013 I think, we are \u2013 we continue to see exceptional health in EMEA, our competitive position there is outstanding. Our pipeline of projects is strong. Our sales pipeline is strong. So continued strong results in the EMEA market. APAC has good underlying secular forces driving those markets and again Americas a little bit starting to see, a little bit of dip in growth rates. We still think we're growing ahead of the market in Americas. But what we're seeing from our \u2013 what we think are the most credible estimates of market growth in the Americas is more in the 5.5% range and we're growing the business meaningfully above that and we're doing that with a return profile and a yield profile that is head and shoulders above the rest. And so there's pockets of headwinds, probably across all markets in certain cases, but we're staying very disciplined about what deals we're pursuing, continuing to focus on use cases where we bring distinctive value, and therefore can preserve returns and pricing over time, but that's a little color on across the regions. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And if I could just one other follow-up, with all the development that you've laid out in your development schedule, is the goal to increase organic growth in 2019 over 2018? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: (1:01:47). Thank you for the question, but we really like to spend more energy thinking about that and we'll be updating you on the June 20 Analyst Day on our thinking both as well as the organic business and certainly the inorganic business, and there's a recognition that over the last few years, we've been buying assets that have been slower growing than the overall organic business. And so we want to give you color on what that means and how does it look on a go forward basis as we take you out five years from 2018 through 2022. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Okay. Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Thanks, everyone. Katrina Rymill - Equinix, Inc.: Great. That concludes our Q1 call. Thank you for joining us. Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. It's good to be joining all of you as we share our strong results for the first half of 2018. This was a quarter of many new highs with continued momentum in our key metrics as our go to market engine and interconnection strategy continue to drive results. We delivered record bookings in all three regions driven by robust growth across our verticals with particular momentum in our cross regional activity. We now serve 48% of the Fortune 500 and 33% of Global 2000 companies, both up 1% quarter-over-quarter and we're demonstrating a highly attractive land and expand dynamics with these lighthouse customers. Channel sales stepped up to over 20% of bookings and accounted for half of our new logos in the quarter driven by solid performance across the regions and across our partner types, and the power of the global platform continues with over 50% of our revenue coming from customers deployed across all three regions and 85% from customers deployed across multiple metros, both metrics up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Turning to the results of the quarter, and as depicted on slide 3, second quarter revenues were $1.262 billion as reported, up 9% over the same quarter last year and above the top-end of our guidance range on an FX neutral basis. Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO were both up over 6% over the same quarter last year which includes our planned investments in Verizon to support long-term growth. These growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. Interconnection revenues continued to outpace colocation, growing 13% year-over-year and now include Verizon. Our metrics across interconnection counts, billable cabinets and MRR per cabinet all demonstrate continued execution of the strategy and reflect the strong health of the business. Our global platform continues to scale and we're extending our leadership within each region through a combination of targeted M&A and strong organic growth. I'll provide highlights on three of our latest acquisitions, Infomart, Metronode and Verizon, each of which significantly enhances our strategic position and all of which are progressing well from an integration perspective. Starting with Infomart, Dallas; this strategic purchase allowed us to gain full control of a critical set of assets in our IBX portfolio and cement our market leadership position with this important interconnection hub. The Infomart deal is creating new opportunities to grow our business in Dallas which is one of the largest colocation markets in the Americas. We're starting plans to build out incremental capacity in line with our acquisition plan in support of both retail and hyperscale demand, and we're moving forward with the final phase of our Dallas 6 build. We continue to refine our long-term master plan for the Infomart location and see a stable run rate from over 50 other tenants in this sizable building. Moving to our Metronode transaction, this acquisition significantly enhanced our national reach in Australia and bolted us into the market leadership position in one of the most innovative IT markets in the world where hybrid and multi-cloud has rapidly emerged as a clear architecture of choice. This acquisition is tracking well against our expectations with growing pipeline of multi-national opportunities. We also recently announced our Perth expansion where IBX will house the landing station for the upcoming Vocus subsea cable between Australia and Singapore. And finally our Verizon integration efforts are progressing well. Our pipeline and bookings into these assets remain strong, but we are constrained giving the very high utilization rates in key facilities. Consistent with our prior comments, we continue to expect flat quarterly revenue from Verizon over the year, but we're adding an incremental capacity in the back half which positions us well for 2019. Also we continue to work through the churn previously discussed and we have a healthy pipeline for our planned expansions and as we progress through next year we expect the Verizon portfolio to grow in line with our other stabilized assets. We also completed the integration of Terremark Federal Group into our Government Solutions business expanding our federal industry expertise and adding key capabilities for federal agencies and system integrators. This integration added 33 personnel to the Equinix team bringing a deep understanding of the federal sector and enabling us to act as trusted advisers for IT transformation initiatives in this key sector. Our diverse portfolio of assets including former Verizon government campuses in Miami and Culpeper allows us to direct workloads to the optimal environment based on security, cost and performance. We view government as a sizable expansion of our addressable market and are increasing our engagement from a business development customer and sales perspective to execute on a significant opportunity. Now let me make a few comments on organic development activity. We continue to invest capital, adding capacity in response to strong underlying demand. In the second quarter, we completed builds in our Amsterdam, Denver, and London data centers. Our platform is 82% utilized, and we have a very active pipeline with 32 expansion projects currently underway. This quarter, we also announced our entry into Oman. We have partnered with Omantel, a global communications company. And in 2019 we'll open the first carrier neutral data center in Oman's capital, Muscat, which will create a regional interconnection hub with low latencies between key global business markets. On the hyperscale front, we continue to progress in building out our hyperscale infrastructure team, designing and building initial capacity and working on our financing structures, which we expect to have in place by early next year. Our initial approach is to leverage capacity in select hybrid facilities such as London 9 and 10 to capture early wins and maintain momentum in the overall cloud ecosystem. In parallel, our first dedicated facility, Paris 8, is scheduled for delivery in Q1. And we're using our deep existing relationships with the targeted hyperscalers to cultivate a meaningful demand pipeline. Shifting to interconnection. Interconnection is foundational to our strategy and continues to grow significantly faster than the rest of our business with each new connection translating into additional customer value and a deeper, more durable relationship with Equinix. We now have over 288,000 cross-connects with healthy net adds despite selective churn headwinds associated with migration to 100-gig. Cross-connect adds remain strong and virtual connections are growing rapidly as digital transformations fuel ECX Fabric growth. ECX Fabric now has over 1,200 customers. And we expanded availability to Australia and Japan this quarter with the remainder of APAC targeted for Q3 and full inter-regional connectivity by year-end. Adoption of ECX Fabric inter-metro functionality is ahead of expectations as customers connect to counterparties in different metro locations, and between their own deployments across Platform Equinix. Our Internet Exchange platform also continues to grow in both ports and traffic volumes. And we have been expanding our IX presence to make our entire interconnection portfolio available across our global footprint. This quarter, we launched new internet exchanges in Denver, Houston, Lisbon and Madrid and now operate in 32 markets globally. Now I'll cover some highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical delivered strong bookings led by APAC, growth in the wireless sub-segment and strong sell-through business with our top NSP partners as we and as end customers expand capabilities for digital business. New wins and expansions included Pivotel Satellite, a leading Australian mobile satellite solution provider extending network coverage, and China Mobile, also extending its network to support a growing user base. Our fastest growing vertical, enterprise, experienced record bookings led by manufacturing, health care and government sub-segments. New wins included Lithia Motors, a Fortune 500 auto retailer optimizing their network topology and localizing traffic to improve performance and reduce costs; a Fortune 100 retail warehouse club connecting to multiple clouds; and a global beverage distributor implementing cloud connectivity. Our financial services vertical achieved record bookings led by insurance and banking, reflecting solid execution of our strategy to tap new ecosystem opportunities beyond electronic trading. New wins included a top 20 global asset manager re-architecting its network and leveraging our dense ecosystems and a public government sponsored enterprise in the mortgage market, transforming network topology to improve performance. Our cloud and IT vertical produced strong new logo growth and solid bookings, as service providers embrace Equinix as a key partner in delivering the reach, performance and scalability they need in their global infrastructure. We see the cloud first IT service marketplace diversifying. And we enjoyed new wins with ForeScout Technologies, Links Technologies (12:35), CorpCloud and Secure Agility. Our content and digital media vertical experienced strong bookings led by gaming and publishing sub-segments. The expansions included Tencent, deploying edge nodes to support their coverage and scale, as well as a global commerce leader deploying their own CDN infrastructure in Australia to improve performance and end user experience. But now, let me turn the call over to Keith, to cover the results for the quarter. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Thanks, PVC, and good afternoon to everyone. We had a great second quarter of delivering strong results across each of our core operating metrics. Consistent with our expectations and implied in our financial guidance both our gross and net bookings were all-time records and our booking pipeline continues to be robust. Our AFFO per share metric trended above our expectations despite the recent M&A and financing activities, both which put the company in a better strategic and financial position. And as you know, no currencies fluctuated meaningfully throughout the quarter, while our hedges worked effectively to offset a significant portion of the volatility to our reported results. Given our booking strength, our stable churn, we anticipate substantial quarter-over-quarter recurring revenue step-ups in the second half of the year and therefore anticipate a strong exit into 2019. Turning to the acquisitions in April, we closed both the Metronode and Infomart Dallas transactions. We're already off to a good start and are working on expansion initiatives related to both these acquisitions consistent with our internal plans. Our guidance now assumes an annualized revenue run rate of approximately $60 million from Metronode and $35 million from the current Infomart tenant base. Revenues from the Verizon assets having closed the transaction over a year ago and now part of our reporter results and have delivered against our internal plans, while creating substantial value for our platform as well as being a highly accretive deal to our equity holders. We're seeing strong gross bookings related to the Verizon assets and the poured (14:43) pipeline remains active, while we expect the MRR churn to abate by the end of the year. We continue to plan for flat quarter-over-quarter revenue growth from these assets over the remainder of the year. As expected we continue to invest in the IBXs to bring their operations to Equinix standards including scaling the operations team, increasing our investment in business support and incurring higher repairs and maintenance expenses to support higher operating protocols. As we exit 2018 with the Verizon asset integration largely behind us, we expect the revenues to grow as we invest in the core Verizon markets including the soon to be opened NAP of the Americas expansion in Miami. For integration cost, our guidance is essentially flat at $49 million for 2018. So now turning to the second quarter. As depicted on slide 4, Q2 was another strong quarter of operating performance and our 62nd quarter of sequential top line revenue growth. Global Q2 revenues were $1.262 billion, up 9% over the same quarter last year. Sorry, yeah sorry, over the same quarter last year, and above the top end of our guidance range on an FX neutral basis. APAC and EMEA were the fastest growing regions at 14% and 12% respectively on a year-over-year basis followed by the Americas at 6%. The Verizon assets contributed $133 million of revenues, essentially flat quarter-over-quarter as anticipated. Q2 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $9 million negative currency impact when compared to the Q1 average FX rates and a $10 million negative currency impact when compared to our FX guidance rates due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Global Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $604 million, up 6% over the same quarter last year and better than expectations due to lower integration costs and timing of our operating spend. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.7% excluding the integration costs. Our Q2 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges had a $1 million negative impact when compared to the Q1 average FX rates and a $3 million negative impact when compared to our FX guidance rates. Global Q2 AFFO was $428 million, up 6% over the same quarter last year largely due to strong operating performance and lower than planned recurring capital expenditures. AFFO per share was $5.37, a 17% uplift over the same quarter last year. Q2 global MR churn was 2.4%. For the year, we continue to expect 2018 MRR quarterly churn to average between 2% and 2.5%. Billable cabinet additions were very strong this quarter in part due to hyperscaler activity in our London-based hybrid assets, increasing by 5,900 a record for the business. Our MRR per cabinet metric remained firm although down slightly on an FX neutral basis due to the level of billable cabinet additions, strong sales activity into the smaller and lower priced assets effectively our mix, and the timing of large footprint deals. Turning to regional highlights, whose full results are covered on slides 5 through 7. The Americas region had a great quarter across the board delivering solid revenue and adjusted EBITDA results. Record bookings in the region were led by the cloud and financial services verticals. EMEA also saw record bookings in the quarter, led by the strength in our German and Dutch markets, where we saw a sizable pickup in billable cabinets as large hyperscalers deployed across a number of our core markets, including more significant deployments in our London and Frankfurt campuses. And Asia Pacific continue to drive strong bookings, including strength in our Singapore and Japan markets, as well as increased outbound bookings to the two other regions largely due to ongoing success with the Chinese and Korean multinationals, leveraging our global platform. Interconnection activities saw continued momentum, adding over 5,000 cross-connects and provisioning significant port capacity in the second quarter. In the quarter, interconnection revenues absorbed FX headwinds and some one-time adjustments related to the install base review from our acquisitions, compressing our normal quarterly dollar step up. The Americas and Asia Pacific interconnection revenues were 22% and 13% respectively, while EMEA was 9% of recurring revenues. From a total company perspective, interconnection revenues were 17% of total recurring revenues. And now looking at the capital structure, please refer to slide 8. Our balance sheet continues to position us for success as we grow and scale the business globally. Our balance sheet eclipsed the $20 billion mark for the first time this quarter. Our unrestricted cash balance is approximately $1 billion. In July, we refinanced out of our yen denominated debt in the Japan market increasing our financial flexibility as well as extending and improving terms. Our net debt leverage ratio increased to 4.3 times our Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA with the close of the two recent acquisitions, slightly better than the pro forma target discussed at the Analyst Day on June 20. Also in the quarter we saw strong improvement in our working capital position as reflected in our operating cash flows. Turning to slide 9, for the quarter capital expenditures were $520 million including a recurring CapEx of $42 million. Consistent with our comments at Analyst Day, we're investing across many of our markets to support the scale of the business. We currently have 32 construction projects underway, two-thirds of which are on own property adding capacity in 23 markets around the world. The majority of our investment is going into highly utilized margin rich metros that each generate over $100 million of revenues. Revenues from owned assets stepped up to 47% with the close of the Infomart and Metronode acquisitions. We also purchased land parcels for future expansions in Dublin, Munich, and Sydney. Our capital investments are delivering healthy growth and strong returns as shown on slide 10. This quarter we added the Verizon assets to our same-store analysis. We now have 128 stabilized assets that grew revenues 4% year-over-year on a same-store basis, largely driven by increasing colocation and interconnection revenues including increased power density. These stabilized assets are collectively 84% utilized and generate a 30% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And finally please refer to slides 11 through 16 for our summary of 2018 guidance and bridges. For the full year 2018 excluding the impact of FX we are increasing our revenue guidance by $10 million, and our adjusted EBITDA guidance by $5 million, largely due to favorability from our recent acquisitions. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar net of our FX hedges decreased full-year revenues guidance by $55 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance by $21 million. Absent the FX hedges, revenues would have decreased by $97 million. This guidance implies a 9% year-over-year revenue growth rate and a healthy EBITDA margin of 48% excluding integration costs. And the momentum of our business is continuing to drive both AFFO and AFFO per share growth enabling us to offset the impact attributed to negative FX movements, the recent acquisitions and the higher debt service costs related to our incremental financings. We are maintaining our 2018 as reported AFFO per share guidance of $20.19 per share at midpoint or excluding integration costs $20.82 per share. Over the remainder of the year, we expect quarterly fluctuations in the core components of AFFO generally due to the level of recurring capital spending patterns and discrete tax events related to our acquisitions. We've assumed a weighted average 80 million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. AFFO is expected to grow 12% year-over-year on an as reported basis. We expect our 2018 non-recurring capital expenditures to range between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. And finally, with respect to our cash dividends, for the third quarter the dividend will be $2.28 per share. For 2018, we expect to payout total cash dividends of $725 million, reflecting an AFFO payout ratio of approximately 45%. So with that, I'll turn the call back to PVC. Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Thanks, Keith. So in closing, we delivered a great quarter as the go to market engine drove record bookings and a strong pace of cabinet adds. Our global platform and ecosystems remain at the heart of the strategy as evidenced by strong cross-regional sales and healthy interconnection growth this quarter. We are looking forward to the second half as we focus on our strategic initiatives, deliver value from our acquisitions and work to convert a healthy pipeline for the remainder of the year. So let me stop here, and Mary, let's open it up for questions. Mary, are you there? Operator : Yes, sir. Are you ready to take questions? Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Yes. We're ready for questions. Operator : I'm so sorry for that, sir. Okay. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. We have our first question from Frank Louthan from Raymond James. Frank, your line is now open. You may begin. Alex Sklar - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: [Technical Difficulty] (25:11-25:18) stay on the HIT team and what you \u2013 anything you've booked to-date there, and then also on the APAC outbound sales that you said increase the other two regions. Can you just give a little bit more color on the types of customers that you are getting in multiple regions, I know, you mentioned China Mobile, anything else on the hyperscale side? Thank you. Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Frank, we missed the very first part of your question. Alex Sklar - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Well, I was saying, it's Alex on, and then also that \u2013 I was \u2013 question about the HIT team. I know you gave a little bit of an update at the analyst day but any color on bookings to date for that group? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Sure. So, this is Charles. Alex, we did close some key wins that we would \u2013 that are \u2013 were with the hyperscaleers and that we would consider HIT type opportunities. We did close those however in more hybrid facilities, particularly in London 9, 10, and as mentioned in the script in Frankfurt. So we continue to see strong momentum in the pipeline including closed deals already booking and you really see that in the really extremely strong cabinet additions particularly in Europe this past quarter. So very pleased with that. We continue to build out the team. Jim's been successful in bringing in some really key additional members to the team. And so they're off and running, again we're building pipeline. We're advancing the financial structure discussions well. We continue to get a lot of interest from financial partners who are eager to have exposure to this sector and do so with Equinix. We're sorting through a lot of the complexities and details of what those JV structures would look like, but all-in-all continuing to see strong progress. Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: And just to \u2013 I think what you were talking about in the other part of your question is more cross-regional bookings, and certainly as we looked at the really strong bookings quarter, we had highs in the amount that was exported between one region and another. U.S. had a very strong export quarter, but also Asia did. And I think you were touching a little bit on it, but China Mobile, Tencent, Baidu, all of those larger service providers have continued to grow with this and spread not just to the U.S., but also to Europe. Alex Sklar - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it. Thanks. Charles, one quick follow-up on the London 9 and 10, did that change at all the return profiles, given they were kind of in your existing facilities versus the purpose built ones? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: No, generally I would say that the \u2013 those implementations were consistent with the underwriting of those facilities. Remember that, I believe it's London 10 is an acquired facility, and that was really targeted. That's prior IO facility and that was targeted really with some of these kinds of footprints in mind. So no, we feel like the underwriting is consistent \u2013 or the returns are going to be consistent with the underwriting that we had there. So again I do think that those hybrid facilities have a slightly different profile given the mix of business, but in fact those are consistent with the underwriting that we undertook. Alex Sklar - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great, thank you. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you, Frank (sic) [Alex] (28:38). We have our next question from Colby from Cowen and Company. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Two if I may. First off... Operator : Your line is now open. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Can you hear me? Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. Go ahead, Colby. Katrina Rymill - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. Go ahead, Colby. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Two questions if I may. First question, you guys noted record bookings and at least on the more traditional business, the book-to-bill cycles typically been maybe three or six months. So I'm wondering why we aren't seeing the core businesses guidance going up for 2018, unless I guess a lot of the hyperscale may have driven that. So a little bit of color there. And then secondly on the non-recurring portion of revenues, seems like there's some pretty strong outperformance there in the second quarter, particularly in EMEA and even more so in Asia. I think you might have touched on it in your prepared remarks, but can you just explain what drove that and what we should be expecting in the back half of the year? Thank you. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. Colby, as it relates to revenues for the second half of the year. We did increase our guidance slightly as you know and that was primarily related to the acquisitions and more specifically to Metronode. As it relates to the record bookings, one of the things I would note, it was record bookings both on a gross basis and a net basis. And so part of it \u2013 part of what we anticipated as I said in my prepared remarks is that we had planned for this. And so in anticipation of what we needed to do to deliver a strong year, which was 9% growth normalized and on a constant currency basis, we had to have a very strong back of the year. As you recall, Q1 was a relatively soft quarter-over-quarter for us for a number of reasons, some of it which was non-recurring. So as we look into Q3 and Q4, ultimately what you're going to see is the largest step-ups we will ever have had in our recurring revenue lines. And that's why we made that comment in the prepared remarks, but also position ourselves for what we thought would be a good exit of 2018 into 2019. So again feel comfortable with the guidance we'd already made. We already anticipated the large step-ups. And that is offset in part by some of the churn that we've anticipated in the business, more specifically the Verizon assets, which is again continues to be flat for the rest of the year. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Keith, you had mentioned I think earlier that we should see sequential growth improve throughout 2018. I think you did 2% in the second quarter, which was up versus the first quarter. Is that still the expectation based on what you just said? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I anticipated it. Like anything else, there is a little bit of chunkiness to what we're doing. Charles alluded to some of the large hyperscale deals. There are these what we refer to as HIT oriented transactions that we booked into the London and Frankfurt campuses. But there's a number of other transactions or bookings that we've done with these large hyperscalers that are below what we refer to as our threshold target, which is less than a megawatt of activity. And so there's a number of circumstances where the complexity of the transaction is such that the time that we recognize the booking to the time that we recognize the revenue is slightly different. And so there's a combination of things that are taking place. But I go back to the fact that it's going to be a little bit wait and see, but we believe that we'll have the best recurring quarters we've ever had in our history in Q3 and Q4. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: And then on non-recurring? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Non-recurring, again I think strong non-recurring for Q3. And we've made an assumption for Q4 that it would step down slightly. But overall, again non-recurring revenue is a component of our overall revenue. As we said we're still targeting roughly 5%. And that's what we're going to continue to assume at this point. So again expect a little bit of a step down in Q4, and that's embedded in our guidance. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: So 3Q looks a lot more like 2Q? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yes, it does. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next questions will be coming from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. You may proceed. Philip A. Cusick - JP Morgan : Hi, thanks very much. You noted record bookings. How should we think about the timing of when those lead to an acceleration in revenue with sort of the high end of that 8% to 10%? And has there been any change in the timing of book-to-bill as your business has expanded globally? Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Well, as we noted, certainly this bookings is resulting in an MRR step-up that we haven't seen before. So that's certainly a direct result of that. So you're seeing an acceleration in MRR as you look at the back half of the year unfold. The other question was? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Well, on book-to-bill. Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: I would say that I think book to bill depends a little bit on deal type and mix. So sometimes you get a more \u2013 slightly more protracted book-to-bill on the larger opportunities because they take a bit of time to sort of ramp in and scale. And there's some complexity to implementing sort of deals of that size. So it all depends, I think that's all baked into the guidance in terms of how we see the back half playing out. And as we said I think we're looking at record quarters from an MRR step up standpoint in terms of the history of the company in the last \u2013 in the back half of the year. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: And Phil the one thing I just want to add to what PVC and Charles have said. If you actually look at the implied growth relative to the guidance we delivered, again you recognize we're \u2013 obviously we're offering guidance, but we target mid to \u2013 between mid and high end of the range. And so when you start to look at the guidance relative to what that implies on an annualized basis, you will see effectively a step up in growth rate. And so when you annualize that growth rate again if you look at again to revenues in Q3, Q4, if we took the high end and you'd be above the 10% range on an annualized basis. If you go to midpoint \u2013 if you go to midpoint you're going to be more towards the low end of that range. And so we feel very good about the guidance that we're delivering and the ability to step up. And I just go back to the fact that these record bookings are implied \u2013 were implied in our prior guidance, you're going to see them we believe come through in Q3 and Q4 and a recurring revenue line. And then a little bit of the \u2013 a little bit of volatility as always is the non-recurring activity particularly around the larger footprint of deals that we book. And so we anticipate that we'll be strong in Q3, and we're going to take a little bit of a step down in Q4, and that \u2013 that's how I think you should see the revenues play out, and it's consistent with the message of having strong record bookings this quarter on both the gross and net basis. Philip A. Cusick - JP Morgan : That helps. Thanks very much, guys. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question from Jonathan Atkin of RBC. Your line is now open. You may proceed. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you, Mary. So I've got a question about cross-connect trends by region, strong growth in the Americas and then a little bit of a step down in Asia-Pac and EMEA and I wondered what drove that? Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. What I would say is that overall we were very happy with the momentum on the cross-connect side of things. We track pretty closely; you guys are just \u2013 you're looking at sort of the net numbers here. One of the things that we obviously watch pretty closely is both the gross and the net, and I think that the general trajectory is good for the business. As I said any individual quarter we've always said that they can be a little bit up and down really depending on things like 100-gig migration, et cetera that are occurring. We are seeing some headwind from that and so I would say on a net basis this sort of level of 5,000 plus in aggregate is pretty good. And we're \u2013 it just depends on kind of \u2013 what kind of migration activity or other things we're seeing. We did see again at the \u2013 on the revenue line in interconnection a little bit more of some effects of us working through the reconciliation of our install base of cross-connects post the Telecity transaction and some credits associated with sorting through that install base and what's there. So I think that affected the revenue line a little bit and perhaps the count as well. But overall, the gross additions across the regions tend \u2013 continue to be strong. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. So, as the migration is maybe mostly complete in Americas, but still in the middle of the process in the other region that might explain the net comparison? Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Well that's \u2013 that would be, I do \u2013 I would say that 100 gig migrations are probably and more advanced in the U.S. We probably work through more of those. So they are phasing, globally these things tend to do. But the other thing is that, again the reconciliation of sort of acquisition portfolio cross-connect sort of inventory is something that effects those numbers sometimes, and that tends to lag. It's one of the really long tail items in our integrations. And what you actually are seeing this quarter is still unaffected is more in Telecity markets, because we have the inventory. It is \u2013 this huge population of cross-connects that comes in through these acquisitions are inventoried one by one to reconcile them to the install base and ensure the billing records are accurate, et cetera. And so that often sort of results in puts and takes in terms of the cross-connect count. And so you saw some of that in EMEA this quarter. But again I think the most important thing in our mind is the continued health of the interconnection value proposition, and we measure that by really gross adds. Are people continuing to buy into the full interconnection portfolio, and we're seeing that not only in cross-connects but now also in terms of momentum \u2013 continued momentum with the IX, and then really strong performance of ECX with Fabric now 10,000 plus and we added a good chunk to that this quarter in terms of virtual connections. So the interconnection portfolio I would say is performing very well. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you. Also for that latter part about the ECX Fabric. And then on EBITDA margins, it looks like you saw sequential growth in EMEA and APAC and then pressures in the U.S. and if you can maybe kind of call out some of the factors there? Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: The U.S. is the largest component of the U.S. is related to the decision and it's always embedded in their internal plans as evidenced by our performance relative to EBITDA. There was the investment in ultimately the Verizon assets. As I said, there are three primary areas where we put more energy and invest heavily. And we anticipate that we'll continue to make those investments in Q3 and Q4 and it's really building out our operations team, our business support, do more R&M than was ever done before. And if you go back to the point of time where we originally disclosed down the 8-K, the Verizon transaction they are doing very little relative to what we do, very little R&M relative to what we would invest into meet our operating protocols. And so this is a natural output of our decision to acquire was embedded in internal plans and it's certainly included in our forecast. So there's nothing meaningful, Jonathan, that's going on here other than we're executing consistent with what we said and it has a little bit of a knock-on effect in some of the margin profiles as you look forward. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. And then lastly you mentioned in your script China Mobile, Tencent, Baidu as well as kind of Korean drivers as exports of business into other regions, and I'm wondering are these mainly sources of cabinet adds at this time or are they driving cross-connects, is there an ecosystem developing to speak of related to maybe some of the Chinese cloud players or is it too soon to be commenting on that? Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: My reaction would be it's probably too soon or at least I haven't looked specifically at their cross-connect data to see how much traction they're having. But clearly, it's been resulting in cabinet adds as they build out their platform and with their business growth we would certainly see cross-connects associated with it. But I don't have that, I don't know I'm looking at Charles or Keith to see... Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Well, I would say, I do think that they tend to be \u2013 they come with a high absolute cross-connect count oftentimes, because the private interconnection, they include a private interconnection node along with the cloud footprint, but they also come with a lot of cabinets. And so I think they really serve our interests well strategically in terms of continuing to really enhance the overall platform value proposition. And in the end, that's really the core strategy is to continue to position Platform Equinix as sort of a central hub for people as they sort of deploy their hybrid multi-cloud architectures. And so these things really work very strongly in our favor, but they are high cabinet counts, they are high cross-connect counts. But on a cross-connect per cab basis, they're probably lower than the average, just because they're so large. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Michael, your line is now open. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Investment Research : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Two, if I could. First, as you mentioned, I think the shrink recently in indirect sales and was curious if you talk a little bit more about the types of sales that are being generated out of the indirect channels and how you see that impacting the bookings opportunity as you look out over the next six to 18 months? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Sure. I'll take a first crack at that, Mike. It's Charles. Yeah, we have really strong continued momentum in the channel overall. And I would say there's a variety of selling merchants. Right now, I still think we're seeing mostly sell with activity meaning that we're mobilizing sort of our direct teams to partner with our channel sales to \u2013 channel partner sales teams to win end user opportunities. We saw about \u2013 more than 50% of our new logos came through the indirect channel, more than 20% of our bookings coming from that. In terms of the types of \u2013 types of opportunities to directly address your question, I would say, it really falls into; one, continued sort of network optimization type opportunities, hybrid multi-cloud as a primary use case, people are really beginning to implement that at a much more aggressive pace and doing it really typically with larger enterprise customers with whom these channel partners are well positioned from an account access and decision maker access standpoint. So \u2013 and I think we've talked about who some of those are. For example, AT&T and other NSPs are really acting as very effective sales or channel partners for us as they sell a more comprehensive sort of connectivity and cloud sort of solution and value proposition to their customers. And a lot of momentum with the hyperscalers themselves, they are, I would say, you have a range of appetite in terms of how they view hybrid cloud, but all of them are seeing now that their big customers are saying look that's the reality. That's what I want, that's what I need. I'm going to deploy and implement significant private infrastructure. And so, we see \u2013 with the likes of Microsoft, for example, that has Azure Stack and other really core hybrid private cloud value propositions, really strong momentum and certainly are going to a big large global multinational customers implementing hybrid cloud. So those are probably the ones, but and again AWS same thing. I think you know several years ago I would say that there was not a lot of discussion about hybrid in the context of AWS and now I would say there's a lot more. And so we are actively partnering with them to serve customers who are looking at hybrid cloud architectures. So I think those are probably some \u2013 a little color on what we're seeing there. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Investment Research : Thanks very much. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. Erik your line is now open. Hello. Hello Erik. I'm sorry your line got disconnected. I'm sorry. We have Jeff Kvaal of Nomura Instinet. Sir you may now begin. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet : Hi. Can you hear me? Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Yes. Katrina Rymill - Equinix, Inc.: Yes, we can. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet : Okay, great. I'm hoping to probe a little bit more on the interconnection revenues if you could. You obviously have given us some qualitative sense about why things are lumpy up or lumpy down and in this case maybe lumpy down. I'm wondering if you could add a little bit of qualitative or quantitative color to that or help us gauge how quickly you think that interconnection revenue should be growing over the course of time, whether it's absolute figure or relative to co-lo revenue or anything that will help us think that through would be wonderful. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, you want to take the first crack. Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Well, I was just going to make the comment. We're just continuing to see it outpace the co-location business and feel good about the prospects of that continuing in terms of just all our selling activity and the nature of customers that we're bringing on board a bit, highly interconnection focused. Clearly this quarter the \u2013 a lumpy down, I like your term, some due to specific, as Charles outlined, just billing clean-up and counts in the Telecity centers in Europe had some impact on that growth. But we're just continuing to see it at a growth level, 5,000 to 7,000 cross-connect adds every quarter, and that just continues to move forward with us. So certainly some churn has come from the 100-gig upgrades, but ultimately the momentum of cross-connects is just continuing, and we'll continue to see it outpacing colocation. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet : So would it be fair to say then that a 5,000 to 7,000 per quarter growth rate is plus or minus steady state, aside from some of these clean-ups? Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: That's what it's been, yes. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. I think that's right and I think we're seeing more of the low-end on that because we are seeing some of the 100-gig migrations coming through with larger cross-connect count customers. And so that does \u2013 but I will tell you that in terms of when we look at the health of the overall gross additions, in terms of cross-connect adds as well as just broader interconnection adds across the ECX Fabric, and IX as well, we really see strong sort of metrics both in terms of customer count there, then percentage of customers that are buying across the portfolio, the number of locations in which they're buying. All those things which we sort of view as central to the health of the interconnection business overall are pointed in the right direction. So yeah, I think 5,000 to 7,000 is a reasonable sort of steady state for us, and we're probably operating a bit more at the low end right now because of the some of the 100-gig pressures. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet : Okay. Thank you. Super helpful. Thank you. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. We have now Erik Rasmussen from Stifel. Erik, your line is now open. Erik Peter Rasmussen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Can you hear me? Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Yes, welcome back. Katrina Rymill - Equinix, Inc.: Yes. Go ahead. Erik Peter Rasmussen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Sorry about that, I'm not sure what happened. Thanks. Just two quick. First, I guess in terms of the Infomart in Dallas, you had that now closed in the quarter. You seeing any positive surprises to your prior expectations? And then what are your plans for the adjacent land and timeline for future development? And then in terms of the interconnection, obviously we're talking about 100-gig right now. But the industry continues to migrate and we're even hearing 400-gig. Is this also coming up more with discussions with your customers? Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. So the first one on Infomart, no real surprises to the upside. But coming into it, we knew our investment in expansions that we planned there, we're going to deliver the upside growth in the Infomart acquisition. Clearly we did it for the strategic value of the interconnection hub that's sits there and the opportunity that that Dallas market presents from a just overall co-location and interconnection standpoint. So yes, we're moving on the next phase of the Infomart. Dallas 6, I believe, is the current count. But we're also doing the groundwork to look at expansions and take advantage of that parking lot to do something more meaningful, both at a retail and hyperscale level. And so that work is underway, but nothing to announce from a specific investment standpoint as yet on those expansions. But really a lot of the upside with Dallas will be about our expansions in that market. And then on 400-gig, we're not seeing or hearing anything from customers to that end as yet. We've continued to live through a number of upgrades. 10-gig was a big step years ago and now of course at 100-gig, I don't see anything from 400-gig on the horizon anytime really soon. Erik Peter Rasmussen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have Aryeh Klein from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. You may proceed. Aryeh Klein - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. Just going back to the interconnection revenues, is the reconciliations with Telecity a one quarter phenomenon? Should we expect it to bounce back relatively quickly? And then it looks like you had a couple of push outs on some projects including in Paris. Is there anything notable related to those? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: No, I'll hit last one, and Keith, if you want talk at all about the first one. But the last one, relative to Paris, it was a soils issue that resulted in a slight delay in that project. But it's nothing particularly out of the ordinary, very slight delay in that project, nothing to worry about. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: And, Aryeh, as it relates to the reconciliation of the install base, as Charles alluded to, it's really the long tail of our integration efforts. And because we have to count every single unit to make sure we tie the physical to basically the contract and ultimately to the build, it takes an exceedingly long amount of time to do that. No different than what we've experienced in some of our prior acquisitions. And so it's something that you should continue to expect us to do. I'm not \u2013 I don't anticipate the same level of adjustment from a \u2013 with our customers or from a revenue perspective. But you should anticipate that this is going to last many quarters, well into 2019. Aryeh Klein - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We have Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Simon, your line is now open. Lisa Lam - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, this is Lisa for Simon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a quick one on just how you think about your balance sheet going forward. I know you've targeted kind of 3 to 4 [times] leverage ratio and [ph] there's talks (53:41), and you continue to look for an investment grade rating. So maybe just an update on kind of the progress towards that? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah, Lisa. Thanks for the question. Again, relative to what we talked about at the Analyst Day on June 20, we thought we'd be about 4.5 times levered coming out of this quarter. Number looks more like 4.3 [times], and there is a couple reasons for that. Number one, we're continuing to show progress towards our EBITDA goals, and obviously an uptick in EBITDA helps with that. And then secondly, when we did the acquisition of the Infomart transaction, because of how we \u2013 the way it gets accounted for, we took roughly $200 million of debt off our books from built-to-suit transactions that we had previous to the acquisitions. And also given currency movements in Europe and then the fact that we've got the Informart secured senior note \u2013 I should say, the senior notes that will be paid off at $150 million a quarter. You can see over a relatively short period of time, we're going to get well into our targeted range of 3 to 4 times net leverage. So I feel good about the progress that we're making. That all said, our appetite as again just sort of levering off of what we talked about at the Analyst Day, we're going to continue to invest across our global footprint. And with that comes a lot of capital spend, capital spend with that comes incremental raising of capital. And so as a company we're going to continue to focus on the growth and not \u2013 not that we absolutely care about investment grade, but that will continue to be aspirational because we think the way we can drive the most return to all constituents is really about by growing the business, and driving more cash flow into it. And so that \u2013 what I would tell you over that time horizon and the plan that we shared with everybody 2018 to 2022, we're well within the targeted range of becoming investment grade, simultaneously \u2013 simultaneous with investing in the business, paying our dividends, paying our taxes and scaling the business. So I'm confident we're on the right path. I'm just not confident that it's going to \u2013 we'd be investment grade over the next quarter or two. I think it's going to be a little longer than that. Lisa Lam - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Gutman from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open. You may proceed. Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. As I just look at the guide \u2013 the midpoint of guidance for the full year and for the third quarter, and I just back into what's implied at the end of the year, it looks like there's an implication of an EBITDA margin bit of a step down towards end of the year, is that right, and what would that be due to? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah, Rob. Look there's a lot of \u2013 we've given you relatively broad ranges as we said we're going to continue to invest in a number of areas in the \u2013 related to the Verizon assets, there's a number of integrations that are taking place. But overall when you look at, you look at how we're progressing through the rest of the year depending on whether it's mid to high point of range, we feel very comfortable what we're delivering relative to what we told you at the beginning part of the year. And so just recognize there's a little bit of comfort in the guidance that we've delivered and as we continue to progress through the quarter and into Q4, we'll give you certainly updated color at that point in time. But overall, it's just \u2013 it's a manifestation of hopefully the range that we provided giving ourselves a little bit more flexibility. Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from Jonathan Atkin of RBC. Jonathan, your line is now open. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. Just a follow-up on the channel comment and passing the 20% benchmark, I'm assuming that a lot of that business is sourced from the U.S. including into other regions, but I wondered if there was anything to call out in terms of channel contributions that came from within EMEA or within Asia-Pac. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. Actually, no, I would say that our mix of business on the channel is actually quite good, so I don't have at top of my head exactly how big the range is in terms of percentage of bookings from channel, but it's not like that was \u2013 that 20% is really a big over indexing in one particular region. So all three of the regions now are fairly well advanced in the development of the channel program. It probably looks slightly different in terms of the exact partners because I think that partners do tend to be a bit more regional in their scope of business. We do have some really big global channel partners certainly, but a lot of the activity does come from more localized partners. I'm personally very energized about how the channel program is progressing. And one of the things that's really for folks who've been around these things over time is you have to build the level of confidence in the sales team that channel is good for them. When you have a direct selling team and that's your history and legacy, it is actually often difficult for them to gain a level of \u2013 to sort of trust and credibility, or for the channel to gain trust and credibility with them and vice versa to that matter \u2013 for that matter. But I think we're really seeing that now and as we add talent to our team in terms of \u2013 we're now 460 plus quota-bearing hedge, many of those have been added over the last several years and we try very hard to add people who are sophisticated multi-channel sellers and they get it. They understand how channel partners can be effective for them in sort of meeting their quotas. So \u2013 and again that's strong across the board across the three regions. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: You bet. Katrina Rymill - Equinix, Inc.: Great, thank you. That concludes our Q2 call. Thank you for joining us.",

Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Thanks, Katrina. Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. I am privileged to host my first call today as CEO and I feel honored to lead the incredible team of nearly 8,000 dedicated Equinix employees around the globe in service to each other, to our customers, and to our shareholders. I am as excited as ever about the role we play in helping customers drive their digital transformation agenda and about the value creation opportunity this represents for our investors. Having been a part of the leadership team at Equinix for the past eight years, I am extremely proud of our track record of success. We have more than quadrupled the size of our business since 2010, have now deployed over $22 billion of capital across the globe to build the world's leading interconnection platform, and we are rapidly emerging as the trusted center of a cloud-first world. As stewards of some of the most important digital infrastructure in the world, our priority is and will remain delivering exceptional, durable, and quantifiable value to our customers. In doing so, we believe we can sustain a demonstrably superior business model, which will in turn deliver outsized returns for our shareholders. I'm fortunate to build further on this strong foundation and as a global team, we will certainly remain focused on extending our core sources of differentiation : superior global reach, market-leading network and cloud density, the industry's most comprehensive interconnection portfolio, scaled digital ecosystems, and an unwavering commitment to service excellence. But I also recognize that we must continue to adapt and evolve in response to the rapidly changing needs of our market. We will continue to refine our priorities for the business as we shape our operating plan and prepare to update you on our 2019 guidance early next year. However, I want to outline six immediate priorities that are worth noting as central elements of our go-forward agenda. First, we will expand our go-to-market engine, investing behind the significant momentum we have, helping customers, implement hybrid and multi-cloud as their architecture of choice. Second, we'll evolve our capabilities and product portfolio to make Equinix more powerful, easier to use, more accessible platform to drive digital transformation, delivering new services that will help us sustain and enhance cabinet yields over the coming years. Third, we will look to more deeply engage a shortlist of high priority partners that we believe can substantially extend our solution and amplify our go-to-market reach. Fourth, we will significantly sharpen our focus on driving increased operating leverage to enable investments in the business, drive long-term margin expansion, and fuel AFFO per share. Fifth, we'll focus on delivering against our hit strategy, allowing us to advance our global leadership in the cloud ecosystem, while reducing strain on our balance sheet. And finally, and most importantly, we will continue to invest in our people and our culture as the primary engine behind our sustained performance. As we execute against these priorities, we will be appropriately sensitive to near-term results, but our focus, as it always has been, will remain firmly on the creation of sustainable long-term value, and as appropriate, we will not shy away from investments in the business when we are confident that those investments will generate an outsized return. With this in mind, I'm excited to share our strong operating results for Q3. We had a great third quarter with revenues and adjusted EBITDA above the top end of our guidance ranges, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy and the growth of our interconnection platform. As depicted on slide 3, revenues were $1.284 billion, up 9% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was 7% above our guidance due to lower integration costs and timing of spend, and AFFO was ahead of our expectations. These growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. Bookings were strong across the regions with a record in APAC and particularly, robust growth in the cloud and content verticals. Interconnection revenues continued to outpace colocation growing at 13% year-over-year. Our metrics across the interconnection counts, billable cabinets, and MRR per Cab were all healthy this quarter and reflect solid execution of our strategy. We also saw substantial progress with our three latest acquisitions, Infomart, Metronode and Verizon, all of which are tracking well against our expectations. For Metronode, we're building further in Sydney and Melbourne as well as our new Metro in Perth, which has seen increased interest from cloud service providers and multinationals. For Infomart Dallas, we continue to refine our long-term master plan for the Infomart location including our final phase of Dallas 6. And finally, for Verizon, we opened new capacity in five key markets including our marquee asset, the NAP of the Americas in Miami, the government focused campus of Culpeper as well as new capacity in Denver, Houston and S\u00e3o Paulo. The strong pipeline for these locations combined with focused churn management give us confidence that the Verizon assets will return to growth next year. Now, let me make a few comments on our organic development activity. We are actively investing capital with 30 expansion projects underway across 21 of our markets in response to customer demand. In the third quarter, we opened nine builds across Frankfurt, Miami, Rio de Janeiro and Singapore. Greater than 80% of current expansion project CapEx is allocated to metros each generating over $100 million in revenues. These markets are well established campuses that drive predictable fill rates and high levels of interconnection. With respect to our Hyperscale Infrastructure Team or HIT, we're seeing continued momentum and a strong pipeline as we design and build initial capacity, expand our team and work to finalize our financing structures, which have generated tremendous interest, and which we expect to have in place by early next year. In parallel, we're adding capacity in hybrid facilities such as London 9 and 10 to capture early wins and maintain momentum. We will open our first dedicated HIT facility, Paris 8, early next year and have seen strong pre-leasing with key cloud customers. Shifting to interconnection, our global interconnection platform is powering digital transformation for nearly 10,000 customers around the world, and we see continued adoption across our market-leading portfolio. We now have over 294,000 cross-connects with healthy net adds despite some pressure from 100-gig migrations. Virtual connections had strong adds in the quarter that we now have over 13,000 virtual connections on our ECX Fabric, supporting more than 1,300 customers. ECX Fabric functionality supports secure, high speed connections not only to cloud service providers, but between any customer on Platform Equinix, solving for a variety of IT consumption use cases. We will expand the ECX Fabric to include full inter-regional connectivity early next year. Our Internet Exchange platform also saw continued momentum with peak traffic up over 40% year-over-year. This quarter, we launched new internet exchanges in Bogot\u00e1 and Amsterdam, and now operate this service in 34 markets globally. Now, let me cover highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical captured record new logos as regional carriers extend their global reach to support infrastructure at the edge, augmented by solid bookings from wireless operators and cable providers. Expansions included a Global 2000 Chinese telecom operator expanding their footprint in Europe to support hyperscale requirements and a Fortune 500 telecom provider upgrading to 100-gig to better serve enterprise customers. Our financial services vertical saw broad strength led by banking, insurance, and capital markets. New wins included Navy Federal Credit Union moving infrastructure to improve data management and a top 10 global stock exchange, deploying with Equinix to securely access our expansive financial ecosystem. In content and digital media, we saw record bookings led by APAC, as digital transformation continues to accelerate. Customer expansions included several high profile wins, including both Alibaba and Tencent. Our cloud and IT vertical produced strong bookings led by Hyperscaler demand in APAC and a rapid increase in participants on ECX Fabric globally. We continue to enjoy new logo wins in this space as well, including infrastructure providers BuildCloud (10:25) and TechFlow Services. The enterprise vertical continues to be our fastest growing vertical, recording strong bookings in new logo capture, we're seeing diversified growth across multiple sub-segments led this quarter by manufacturing, healthcare and travel, demonstrating the relevance and flexibility of interconnection oriented architectures to any type of firm undertaking digital transformation. New wins included Lenovo transforming network topology and localizing traffic to improve performance, a Fortune 100 airline transforming supply chain management, and a multinational oilfield services company connecting to the cloud via Platform Equinix. Channel sales had another strong quarter, again contributing more than 20% of bookings and over 40% of our new logos as partners like AT&T, Telstra, Microsoft and NetApp, all mobilized their extensive go-to-market power to help extend our enterprise reach. New channel wins this quarter included a digital wealth management as a service provider that we jointly targeted with Orange Business Services winning the opportunity to provide the platform for their private cloud infrastructure in 12 countries worldwide. Now, let me turn the call over to Keith, to cover the results for the quarter. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. As highlighted by Charles, we had a solid third quarter with revenues, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share ahead of expectations and guidance. We had strong gross bookings in the quarter, our top three results for us and we delivered our highest ever quarter-over-quarter organic step up in recurring revenues. The sales pipeline remains at an all time high with a significant number of multi-market, multi-region opportunities. Across each of our regions, MRR per cabinet yields remained firm with spot pricing improving the Americas for small to medium sized deals. Also we had net positive pricing actions in the quarter, a reflection of our value based decisioning versus simply growing for growth sake. Cross-connect additions both physical or virtual were strong and interconnection revenues continued to grow faster than the overall business. Our hyperscale activity across all deployment sizes is healthy and we're making great progress with our HIT financing initiatives. Turning to acquisitions, we've made substantial headway with our M&A integration efforts. We're raising our annualized revenue run rate for both Infomart and Metronode to $37 million and $70 million respectively. With respect to Metronode's increased performance, we have significantly reduced the adjusted EBITDA multiple used to acquire these assets. Effectively, this acquisition is now accretive, much sooner than planned. And looking forward to 2019, we plan to open new capacity across Metronode's assets and leverage the value of our multi-city footprint in Australia. Also, we continue to feel very good about the progress we've made with the Verizon asset purchase. While the quarterly revenues will essentially remain flat through the end of the year, largely due to the previously discussed MRR churn, we feel highly confident that the incremental capacity brought online and the strong current booking activity will return the Verizon assets to growth in 2019. Finally, as it relates to our 2018 integration costs, we're lowering the estimated cost to integrate our acquisitions to $40 million. Now, turning to the third quarter, as depicted on slide 4, global Q3 revenues were $1.284 billion, up 9% over the same quarter last year, above the top end of our guidance range. Note, all our growth rates in this section are normalized and on a constant currency basis. EMEA and APAC were the fastest growing regions at 14% and 13%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis followed by the Americas region at 5%. Absent the Verizon churn, the Americas business would have grown at greater than 6%, better than the broader market growth rates, reflecting the continued momentum of our substantial Americas business. While the foreign currencies continue to put pressure on our operating results, our FX hedges are working effectively to mitigate the volatility of the U.S. dollar. Simply put, the hedged FX rates are currently higher than their current spot rates. Q3 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $14 million negative currency impact when compared to the Q2 average FX rates and a $1 million negative currency impact when compared to our FX guidance rates. Global Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $613 million, up 7% over the same quarter last year and better than our expectation due to revenue flow through, timing of our operating spend and lower integration costs. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 48%. Our Q3 adjusted EBITDA performance net of our FX hedges had a $7 million negative impact when compared to the Q2 average FX rates, and then negligible negative impact when compared to our FX guidance rates. Global Q3 AFFO was $402 million, or AFFO per share of $5.01, higher than expected. This reflects the third straight quarter we've eclipsed the $5.00 per share threshold in a quarter. Exclusive of integration costs, AFFO per share would have been $5.12. Our AFFO absorbed higher income tax expense in the quarter and increasing recurring capital expenditures. Looking forward, we expect the level of third quarter taxes to be more reflective of our normal tax burden, as the tax expense over the first two quarters benefited from deductions related to acquisitions and refinancings. Q3 global MRR churn was 2.4%. For the year, we continue to expect 2018 MRR quarterly churn to average between 2% and 2.5%. Turning to the regional highlights, whose full results are covered on slides 5 through 7, the Americas region had another solid bookings quarter, both within the region and exported to the other two regions. The Americas team delivered solid revenue and adjusted EBITDA results with record high levels of small and mid-sized deals. MRR yield per cabinet remained firm due to healthy deal mix and strong interconnection performance, while absorbing the expected Verizon churn. Cabinets billing were lighter than the prior quarter due to timing of customer installations. We expect this metric to rebound in Q4. EMEA had another strong quarter, led by our Dutch and German businesses. We continue to significantly expand across the region with 19 builds currently underway, largely driven by cloud and enterprise opportunities. From a cost perspective, I do want to note that we're seeing higher utility prices across the EMEA markets. This cost increase is being partially offset by our utility hedges, which will roll off over the coming quarters. Our new utility hedge positions will track consistent with market movements and these increased costs are reflected in our updated guidance. And Asia-Pacific delivered record bookings with particular strength in Singapore with key wins from the content, cloud and enterprise verticals. Cross-connect counts had a strong quarter-over-quarter step up and MRR per cabinet remained firm in this region. Turning to our interconnection activity, we added over 6,000 cross-connects net in the quarter, which was above \u2013 and again, significant incremental port capacity. The Americas and Asia-Pacific interconnection revenues stepped up to 23% and 14%, respectively, while EMEA was 9% of our recurring revenues. From a total company perspective, interconnection revenues were 17% of total recurring revenues. Now, looking at our capital structure, please refer to slide 8. With respect to our balance sheet, it continues to scale and remains greater than $20 billion. Our unrestricted cash balance is approximately $900 million, a decrease over the prior quarter due to capital expenditures and our quarterly cash dividend, offset in part by our operating cash flow. Net debt leverage ratio remains at 4.3 times our Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA. We also accessed our ATM Program over the quarter, raising $266 million, or roughly 612,000 shares at an average price of $434 per share to fund our future investment needs. To-date, under an ATM Program, we've issued just under 1.4 million shares at an average price of approximately $450 per share. We continue to be highly supportive of this type of program as it allows us to access the market on a timely basis, recognizing our strong desire to fund the business with a balance due to both debt and equity, while working to maximize our shareholders value. Turning to slide 9 for the quarter, capital expenditures were $546 million, including a recurring CapEx of $55 million. We opened nine expansions this quarter, adding over 8,000 cabinets, and currently have 30 construction projects underway. Also, we purchased our Bogot\u00e1 facility as well as our Frankfurt land parcel for future campus expansion. The company has now land bank capacity across 25 markets, an almost $450 million investment to-date. Also, we now own 80 of our 200 IBXs and revenues from owned assets stepped up to 48%. We continue to expect revenues from owned assets to increase as two-thirds of our development activities will be on owned properties. Our capital expenditures are delivering healthy growth and strong returns, as shown on the slide 10. Our 128 stabilized asset revenues grew 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, largely driven by increasing colocation and interconnection revenues. Excluding the slightly increased Americas churn this quarter and the high non-recurring revenue in Q3 of 2017, our stabilized assets would have grown at approximately 4% similar to last quarter. These stabilized assets are collectively 84% utilized and generate a 30% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And finally, please refer to slides 11 through 16 for our updated 2018 guidance and bridges. For the full-year 2018, we're increasing our revenue guidance by $15 million largely due to favorability from our recent acquisitions offset in part by $7 million negative currency impact. Also we're raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance by $9 million primarily due to lower integration costs offset in part by a $3 million negative FX impact. This guidance does imply a 9% year-over-year revenue growth rate, and a healthy adjusted EBITDA margin of 48%. And the momentum of the business is continuing to drive both AFFO and AFFO per share growth. We're raising our 2018 as reported AFFO per share guidance approximately $20.32 per share at midpoint of guidance, or $20.82 per share excluding integration costs. Assumed a weighted average shares outstanding of 80.2 million on a fully diluted basis. AFFO is expected to grow 13% year-over-year on an as reported basis. We continue to expect our 2018 non-recurring capital expenditures to range between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. And finally, with respect to our cash dividends for the fourth quarter, the dividend will be $2.28 per share. For 2018, we now expect the total cash dividend payout to be about $727 million or an AFFO payout ratio of approximately 45%. So with that, let me stop here and I'll turn it back to Charles. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Thanks, Keith. In closing, we delivered a great third quarter with strong flow through into adjusted EBITDA and AFFO and healthy metrics across the board. Today, we're the clear data center market leader and our growth, scale, and innovative product portfolio puts us in a great position to build on a business model that is truly and substantially differentiated from our peers. As we set our sights on 2019, we will focus on the six priorities outlined in my opening remarks, building upon our unparalleled global reach, interconnection and ecosystems, sharpening our focus on driving operating leverage, extending our balance sheet through HIT and enhancing our financial model with accelerated logo capture and new service innovation. These efforts all center on delivering long-term value creation and putting Platform Equinix in the pole position to power digital transformation across the globe. So, let me stop here and open it up for questions. Operator : We will now begin our formal question-and-answer session. The first question is coming from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Thank you. My question is mainly on HIT. It has been a couple of quarters and we've only seen about one dedicated hyper-scale development project announced in your expansions which is Paris 1. I guess, my main question is when HIT was first announced, the takeaway some investors had actually was that there'd be several announce maybe per quarter per year going forward or maybe just more than one, could you give us more color on the degree of selectivity or being around these deals or why they are not been more announced yet because it's been a couple of quarters? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Sure. Yeah, I mean there's a number of projects, we've got \u2013 I kind of think about HIT as a three-legged stool; they are sort of demand, supply and finance. And the demand side is very strong, very solid pipeline of deals. What you're speaking to is really its supply side. Paris 8 actually is our first HIT facility, I was actually out there last week, walked through the facility, it's in great shape and on track to open, I think in the next few months. So that's tracking well. And there are a number of other projects, we just have not announced them. We have a strong land bank and a number of projects underway in terms of our approvals. They just have not made their way through. And to some degree, we're not waiting on those necessarily to have the joint venture fully underway. So, there are projects underway that we're in the planning phases on, but we just have not announced those as of yet. Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. Thank you for the color on them. And my next question has to do with interconnection, your EMEA MRR for cross-connect is about one-third the level of the Americas, and your APAC level is about double. Longer term, should we be assuming this MRR rate in EMEA increases as enterprises deploy hybrid clouds through the region? And maybe could we just get a sense of pricing will ever go up over the next two years just so we can start adjusting or projecting accordingly? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. Fair question and one I asked our EMEA team in our operating review. So, we absolutely ought to expect that. And so, when we did the Telecity acquisition, we talked about the fact that there was a delta there and that we believe that the unique value that our cross-connects provide to our customers justify that value. And so there's always a little more complexity than one would hope as you do those integrations and try to get that and put together and obviously some friction in the system in terms of those increases rolling through. But the short answer to your question is, yes, I think that we should continue to see that that rise as we deliver that value to our customers. Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from Colby Synesael of Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. Two questions if I may. First of all, Charles, thank you for giving us the overview, your areas of focus to start off the call. I'm just curious though does that change any of the guidance that you guys provided at your Analyst Day earlier this year, is all that still intact even with the new areas of focus under your leadership? And then secondly, one of the things that stuck out was the stabilized growth of 2% and I know that you mentioned Americas churn being part of the impact, the other one being the tough comps. Is the Americas churn just what's going on in Verizon or is there something else there and to that point the U.S. or Americas business just grew 5% on a year-over-year basis. And that's somewhat similar to what your typical stabilized growth is, one would assume that's actually growing faster. Can you just talk a little about what your expectations are for growth rates in the Americas on a go-forward basis. Thank you. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Sure. Lots in there, Colby. So, let me go after one at a time here. As to the priorities and whether what we talked about at our Analyst Day still holds, the answer to that is yes. So, we still are feeling good about those ranges. And then as to what it means for 2019, we're going to come back in February and give you a sense for that. So I think, we still have more work to do in terms of digging through the details of how those priorities will play out and when and how and through what means we'll make the investments in the business and that may all play into our forward year look. But right now, we still feel good about the ranges that we provided at Analyst Day. As to stabilized asset growth, it was like quarter and as we dug into it, there's a number of \u2013 and into the underlying drivers, we don't believe that the result reflects any \u2013 really an erosion of the business fundamentals. So one, as you talked about and as we said in the script, one is a tough comp that due to again, some of the elevated NRR in Q3 of last year, the churn although it was in line with our expectations, it was a little concentrated in our stabilized assets. And so, I think that impacted \u2013 it was in line for what we expected, but it did impact the stabilized asset growth. Now, some of that being Verizon, some of that being organic, but nothing unusual in my mind. There were some specific churns in some stabilized assets associated with multi-tiered architectures coming through. But that's nothing new for us. And so, I don't see anything there that I'm overly concerned about. So normalized for those, that would take us into this sort of 4% neighborhood. That said, 4% is below our historical norms. And I would say that we probably believe that we're going to continue to see a little bit of headwind on that metric due to a couple of factors. First, the 10-gig to 100-gig migrations tend to be concentrated in our interconnection hubs, which are almost all in the stabilized asset pool. And so, as you noticed in the stabilized asset performance, interconnection was down a little bit in that one specifically as well. And so, I think that's part of that. Now we do expect that that's going to taper over the course of 2019. It tends to start with the biggest players because they're the ones with the highest motivation and the wherewithal to do it and then it rolls from there. And so, we do think that will continue through 2019, but taper to some degree through the year. And then secondly, we've got a handful of assets in the stabilized pool, like New York 9, which is 111 8th Avenue in New York, and then Atlanta 2, which is 56 Marietta Street in Atlanta. Both of those are sort of traditional multi-carrier telco hotels, carrier hotels and we're actively migrating customers and trying to actively shift the interconnection density from those sites to our own facilities in those markets whether that'd be Secaucus or our AT1 facility, and we view that as a critical business priority. So, we're stimulating that to happen and when we looked at this site-by-site results in a stabilized asset growth, saw that \u2013 and some of that is showing up in that. So, I do think that that's going to be more towards the low-end of kind of where we've been in that sort of 4% neighborhood. And then the last point is the Americas. I think the Americas is an amazing business, $2.5 billion business, approaching 5,000 customers, still growing above the prevailing retail market growth despite having a drag from the Verizon business which is a business about the same size as CoreSite but dead flat. And so we said, we were going to turn that with \u2013 as churn mitigates and as we get the new expansions online, and we really feel like Verizon is going to return to growth next year and we think that will provide some lift for the Americas business, but recognizing also that the growth in that business is growing a business that is 23% interconnection and yielding almost $2,400 a cab. So a very attractive business. I think we do have an opportunity over time. One of the priorities you heard me talk about in my six key priorities was continuing to innovate and deliver new services that we believe can have attach rates on top of our cabs (31:46). And that's something \u2013 well that's probably not going to impact the number next quarter, the quarter after. We think that's the way we can continue to get juice out of the Americas business over time. So, long question, equally long answer. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Very much appreciated. Thank you. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: You bet. Operator : The next question is coming from Jonathan Atkin, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. One for Keith, one for Charles. On HIT, do you expect to have \u2013 you talked about the financing in place in early 2019 and is that a comprehensive arrangement that would cover multiple markets or regions or single regions or would it be more like an initial arrangement to fund a discrete project or two. And then for Charles, I wanted to drill down a little bit on the topic of parasitic tethering. In other words, when other companies pay to be within your ecosystem and then connect \u2013 they basically just leverage your ecosystem as part of their value proposition. And it's not a new issue, but given the opportunity to look at this from the fresh eyes in your new CEO seats, I wonder do you intend for Equinix to be a neutral platform fully open to all partners no matter how they leverage your ecosystem or are the competitive dynamics such that you would be more selective about your partnering relationships with resellers, carriers, peering providers and so forth. Thanks. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Great. Great questions, Jonathan. Do you want to take the HIT first? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. So, let me take the first one, Jonathan. As it relates \u2013 as Charles said, it's a three legged stool. We absolutely have the demand as it relates to HIT. We also absolutely have the potential financing partners and the opportunity to finance, and so it's making sure we develop the supply on an appropriate basis. That supply is going to come in multiple markets, as you probably can appreciate. And Jim Smith and his leadership team are working hard to continue to develop assets that can be discretely placed off balance sheet versus on balance sheet. As you're aware, Jonathan, we do some of our work, already, on balance sheet. We referred to, last quarter, London 9 and 10 as an example where we've got hybrid facilities and HIT deployments that have moved into those assets. But what we want to make sure as we look forward, we want to have \u2013 we want to line up our financing partners with the same type of ideology that we have on how to fund the business. And so, that might mean that we have discrete partners in different markets of the world and, in some cases, we might have a regional partner, a JV partner. Rest assured, Jim, Charles and I as well as others are working hard with our financial partners to identify the opportunities, but recognize that this is something that we'll share more with you as we get further down the road. But suffice it to say there is the opportunity, there is the demand, and there will be the supply, and we feel very, very good about our HIT business as it stands today. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: And Jonathan, I think (34:42), but I think your question was a little bit about might that first JV \u2013 is that first JV likely to be some sort of \u2013 is it going to be comprehensive or regionally focused or what? I would expect it's more likely that we will pick one off that has a particular scope to it and that we will prove that out in terms of a partner in terms that we find acceptable. What I've been telling the team internally here is we've designed the mousetrap, now we got to catch the mouse. And so, I think we'll go catch one in the first quarter that may, in fact, be one that has a more contained scope, and then we would potentially add to that from there. That's certainly a possible scenario in terms of outcomes. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: And then, as to the second question on tethering, very interesting question. And you're right; it's not a new one. But I'm going to go to the end of your question first and simply say that, yes, we believe that continuing to be a neutral party that drive \u2013 and an aggregator of traffic continues to be the sort of value creating strategy for the business. Having said that, I also think that it's fair for us to get a return on our investment \u2013 our substantial investment that we've made to build the ecosystems at scale inside of our facilities. And so, call it a tax, call it a toll, call it what you will, but as appropriate when people are tethering in to gain access to that value, we'll price our services appropriately to get a return on the investment that we and our shareholders have made. And so, I think that's perfectly appropriate for the business. We will make sure that people can access infrastructure across \u2013 from their facilities into ours when that's appropriate, and a lot of our hyperscale customers, for example, do that aggressively and we embrace that and want them to continue to be able to do that. Carrier customers who are delivering value across the ecosystem, we want to embrace that and continue to empower and enable them. But providers who are directly competitive and saying, basically, you can get cheaper services, but the ecosystem value of Equinix, that's something where, again, we want to maintain an open posture, but we also believe that we should be fairly rewarded for the investment and the value we've put into that ecosystem. So, that's kind of our posture relative to that topic. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks very much. Operator : Next question is coming from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Charles, just on the six priorities, coming back to something was talked about earlier, some of them like expanding go to market evolving product, it sounds like it's one of these invest to grow opportunities. Can you just scale it? Are we talking about something material here, or is this going to be fairly much within the run rate? And then, Keith, can you just go into the leverage on the ATM. Are you trying to get down to the four times leverage in the kind of 12 months to 18 months, or are you comfortable, for now, in the low fours? Thanks. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Simon. So hitting the first one, yeah, if you read the priorities, there are definitely some of those where we use words like expand and invest, and augment, and it takes dollars to do those things. And so, what I think we're going through the process of now, as any company should, is saying, okay, what are our priorities as a company, what resources are available to us, how do we stack rank those, and to the extent we can self-fund those investment priorities, we will seek to do that. At the same time, if we believe there are areas where we need to make investments, we'll look at doing that and figure out what the appropriate means of doing that is. And I think, sometimes, those might be OpEx dollars and sometimes those might be CapEx dollars. And so, we're really sorting through all of that, and I think really won't have, I think, the details on that until we sort of go into the full 2019 plan, and solidify that; and, we'll share that with you in February. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Simon, just maybe \u2013 just adding on to what Charles has said, it's not like we haven't been investing in our go to market and new product initiatives as well. And so, it's a continued expansion of the decisions that we've made previously. And under Charles' leadership, what we're going to do is really focus in and emphasize the areas of investment. And so, I just want you to feel comfortable that a lot of it is in our run rate; does not mean that we will not make sizable investments. That'll be something we'll determine at the time as we size the opportunity in front of us. But the point that we really need to make is we are a different company. We have a point of differentiation and we're going to invest around that as being the global interconnection provider with all the different products and services that get attached to that. Having said that, and going to your second question, which is really important on going back to the ATM, the use of the ATM and our leverage posture, we still as a company have a very balanced view on making sure that we raise both debt and equity as appropriate. As you're also aware we generate a lot of cash flow as reflected in our AFFO metric. So as a business just naturally with our growth we're going to de-lever. I think \u2013 not I think, when we talked to you at the Analyst Day we said a few things. Number one, revenue was going to grow 8% to 10%. FFO was going to grow 8% to 12% within those ranges over the period through 2022. And that was reflective of an environment where at times it might be at the lower end of the range and from an AFFO perspective to reflect funding requirements when we do a discrete funding, whether it's debt or equity. And so, our view is that we're going to grow revenue, we're going to grow our EBITDA margin and we're going to fund roughly $10 billion of capital as well as a growing cash dividend. And with that will require us to raise some additional capital. We will always have a balanced view to raising that capital with a posture of we want to get to investment grade and we think we can get there in a reasonable timeframe, under just current course and speed and being mindful about where we raise our capital and how we grow our business. And my belief is that that's something that can happen on a reasonably short time period. Whether you think 12 to 24 months is reasonable, that's what I think is reasonable, getting to investment grade while you're deleveraging the business because of growth. But overall, we are going to bring balance into our capital structure and the impact of AFFO this quarter was roughly $0.05 with the shares that we raised on an AFFO per share basis and about $0.11 for the year. And so we want to continue to make sure we balance that, we think about it in our forward guide with the debt and the equity and we'll continue to update you accordingly as we raise more capital for our future growth opportunities. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from Jordan Sadler, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you and good afternoon. I think last quarter on this call you talked about an MRR step-up in the second half of 2018, that was expected to materialize and I'm curious, is that going to step-up to a greater degree in the fourth quarter or was there a mitigating factor in the third quarter that you would point to? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. Jordan, first and foremost, when you look at the MRR step-up, again we had the highest incremental organic step-up this quarter in Q3. As I look forward to the guide for Q4, we're using a guidance range of roughly $10 million on a revenue basis. If you look at the midpoint taking into consideration the midpoint or if you even take it up more to the higher end of the range, you'll see that there is another meaningful step-up in recurring revenue because we're actually, we're guiding, we're probably going to take $2 million out of the quarter-over-quarter increase in non-recurring revenue. Or said differently, Q4 non-recurring revenue will be that or will be below that of Q3 non-recurring revenue. So we're seeing a meaningful step-up in Q4 recurring revenue as well. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And was that specifically with regard to the Americas, I know you mentioned cabs billing there seemed to be a little bit of a timing issue there with a rebound to come? Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Well, certainly the Americas as Charles alluded, I think we're having great success in the business and we'll continue to grow. But frankly speaking, you've got 13% and 14% organic growth in the other two regions on a sort of organic, normalized and constant currency basis, so a lot of that growth, more than 50% of our business resides outside the U.S. now and so the majority of the growth will come from outside of the U.S. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Sure. Operator : The next question is coming from Philip Cusick, JPMorgan. Your line is open. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan: Hey, guys. Two for Keith. Keith, can you expand and quantify the impact of the utility hedges? How has the green power initiative impacted this and what should we expect for 2019? And then, also as you think about HIT fundraising, are there structures that you ruled out at this point or is everything still on the table? Thanks. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: Great. As it relates to utility hedges, one of the things I just want to share with you and probably no surprise to anybody, there's regulated and unregulated markets and the regulated market is very little we can do. As it relates to the unregulated markets, we put hedges in place and we're always looking at buying forward in anticipation of future consumption, not only what we consume today but what we think we will consume tomorrow. And so, just make the underlying assumptions that we're always putting hedges in place appropriately and hedging out roughly 70% of our exposure. Again markets are volatile and so we want to always let something float. As it relates to green initiative, again we've invested heavily in alternative sources of energy. As you're aware, whether it's solar or wind or otherwise, we're making sure that we stick to our commitment of becoming carbon neutral as it relates to our consumption. And frankly, that's costing us money today. And the order of magnitude is roughly $10 million a year and that's an investment we've made this year. It was in our guidance, but it reflects that there is a need to become more green. It's a demand of our customers and a requirement as table stakes I would argue and therefore, we've made an investment. Now, certainly there's dynamics in \u2013 what we call our prior purchase arrangements with our service providers. It's going to fluctuate year-over-year depending on market conditions and the prevailing price of power on a kilowatt basis. But, this year, we are making an investment and we will continue to make investments, all else being equal. But, power is a relatively important one. It's a relatively \u2013 it's our largest variable component. It represents between sort of 11.5% and about 12.2% of our revenue depending on the quarter and so, of course, it's a meaningful mountain and if you think about a 10 basis point move, that's $5 million a year. So that's something that we pay very close attention to and with rising rates, some of it we can pass through to our customers, some of them unfortunately we consume ourselves. That is a higher cost and we have to find other ways to mitigate the exposure associated with higher utility prices. And so, we're doing that as a business and again, under the leadership of Charles and our team, we're focused very highly in making sure we can offset some of these incremental costs with other ways of running the business more efficiently, including making sure we also have incremental hedges put in place as appropriate. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan: Thank you. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: So, sorry, (47:00) was just reminding me of the second question which was HIT structures. I think all structures are still on the table quite frankly. We're working with different partners. As Charles alluded back that he met partner last week in Europe, there's partners in Asia, certainly partners all throughout the U.S. and elsewhere, in North America. And so we'll continue to look at sort of the best structure for ourselves and of course our partner to reflect on whatever the best outcome is. But right now, it'd probably look more like a JV structure than anything else. But I think it just depends on the level of supply that we create and over what period of time. And that will determine if there's other ways that we would approach it such as fund \u2013 a JV structure versus a fund structure versus something maybe different. And recognizing, one of the first thing that we might do is, we do it on balance sheet. Sometimes we can't get it off balance sheet, there's very discrete reasons or is the hybrid facility. And again, we're going to make sure it's the highest and best use of our capital but we want to move most of this off balance sheet if we can, as we continue to get some momentum here on the billings side. We'll start to break out some of those details for you in the future, but it's not material enough right now in our results to adjust, but certainly as we get into 2019 and certainly 2020, I think it will be more of a discussion that we'll be having on this subject. Operator : The next question is coming from Aryeh Klein, BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Aryeh Klein - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. EMEA has been a strong market for you and you have a lot of additional capacity plan there. Can you describe your visibility into demand for those additions? And then Charles earlier in your six priorities you talked a little bit about adding new services, can you may be provide a bit more color on what those might be? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Sure. So starting with EMEA, and I would say this is true across the board. As we look at Q4 and into next year and one of the things that we've really improved over the last couple of years is our forward visibility on the pipe and used to be that we struggled beyond the next quarter. But I think we've really enhanced that and driven the sales discipline to have better visibility into the pipeline. And I think we have strong pipeline across all three regions. EMEA does have a really strong supply pipeline in terms of capacity and the projects and the investments that we're making there and again that business has performed very well. EMEA has a little bit of a different mix. It has a slightly higher \u2013 large footprint mix. It's a bit of a different market in a number of ways, but that business continues to perform very well and deliver solid returns and we expect that that will continue into 2019 and beyond. Relative to the new services, I think there's a variety of things, at the interconnection layer, ECX Fabric will continue to add the inter-regional element to ECX Fabric. That product is growing ahead of its business case, in terms of both circuits, ports, virtual circuits, revenue and so we feel very good about that business. We have talked about other augments to our business in terms of delivering things in the area of network function virtualization and services that we might be able to easily deliver sort of best-in-class virtualized functions to our customers as add-on services to our performance hub type implementations. And so that's something that we are partnering with some very large players to bring forward and we think that we'll not only be able to bring their solutions, which our customers are demanding, but we'll be able to some degree mobilize their channel on our behalf which we're very excited about. And then beyond that, I think there is a set of investments that we in services, in terms of how we can make our platform a more accessible, more easier to use, higher value-added digital transformation platform and that I won't be overly precise here in terms of what exactly that looks like, but simply to say I think there are a number of things we can do to make it easier for service providers, for example, to view platform Equinix as a place where they can deliver their value to end customers. And a place where enterprise customers can consume that value more effectively. So some ways it is going to be about ease of use API, developer toolkits, those kind of things that really make the platform more accessible. So stay tuned and I think that will be an ongoing investment for us over the coming years. Aryeh Klein - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks. Operator : The next question is coming from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. Your line is open. Erik Peter Rasmussen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. First, circling back on the HIT initiative. You commented that the pipeline is healthy, but can you maybe give us a little bit more depth on the level of activity you're seeing and how that compares to your prior expectations. Any sort of like metrics that you can provide to help us better understand that opportunity? Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah. I won't quantify it specifically other than to say that we have \u2013 we probably have way more demand in the pipeline than we would be able to or want to satisfy. And so, as you guys know, our posture relative to the large footprint hyperscaler demand is that, it is something that we want to participate in because we believe is accretive to our premium retail strategy. And so, we'll be selective about participating there. You know in the right assets, we'll put in \u2013 once we get the HIT assets, once we get the JV structured and we might have more balance sheet firepower that doesn't create opportunity cost in our retail business, we may step up the level of aggression. But right now, I would say that we're going to be selective about that business and again there's, right now, way more demand that that hyperscale community would like to work with us on than we probably have the ability to do. So, we'll continue to work with them. We'll prioritize projects based on their needs and then based on what fits for us and we'll try to select and build facilities to take the right kinds of business. I would also just highlight that our relationship with hyperscalers go well beyond the large footprint. And as you can recall in my Analyst Day presentation, I showed you that that's a $0.5 billion a year business with hyperscalers today and growing at a highly over-indexed rate relative to the rest of our business. And two-thirds of that is really below the retail \u2013 is really retail business and highly interconnected, both on the A side and the Z side. And so, we're going to continue to push that pedal down on that side of the hyperscaler business with every bit of energy and effort that we can. And then, on hyperscale's large footprint side, we'll be selective, and then probably step things up as the JVs come to bear. Erik Peter Rasmussen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And maybe just as my follow-up, regarding Verizon, now that we're coming to the end of the year and you've been able to make progress on investing into that business bringing those assets up to par, what are your growth expectations for next year? Have you been \u2013 have you seen any significant improvements that might have altered your thoughts on that business? I guess, I'm just trying to understand what you mean by return to growth, at this point. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: One of the things we said previously that you should expect it to grow at or above our stabilized asset growth, again, it's going to be very specific to the decisions we make. As you know, we sell across the platform. And we think \u2013 if you look at the Verizon assets in a very discrete way, that's one way to look at it. We actually don't look at it that way. We look across our entire portfolio. But it's fair to say that we would likely see it growing at a stabilized asset level or better, but we also want to make sure we manage our inventory in a very positive way and push the customers to highest and best use principles in the right IBXs with the right applications. And what I would just say... Erik Peter Rasmussen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.: One other thing I'd just say, this quarter we had a slight increase in \u2013 if you look at (55:46) which you can't see it anymore, we've fully integrated the business, but the Verizon assets moved up this quarter \u2013 sorry \u2013 the Verizon revenue increased this quarter over last quarter. Part of it was for \u2013 there's some non-recurring activity as well. But we are starting to see the stabilization of the base, again, recognizing that \u2013 we acquired the business and we grew it substantially, but originally, when this asset was acquired and the 8-K that we filed when we did the transaction, as you know there was a deterioration in revenue associated with the asset prior to our ownership. We've been able to stabilize it. We're investing in the core assets. We're integrating to our standards and we're investing in both physical assets and human capital assets across the portfolio, and we think we're making a tremendous difference. As we step back, we are absolutely delighted with the acquisition and how it's performing. Clearly, we like revenue to continue to step up and the turn to abate. We think that is realistically going to happen because the gross booking activity inside the portfolio of assets is strong. And so, now that we have a strong portfolio, once we can get the turn to abate and continue to make our investments, I think \u2013 it's my belief that you'll see the Verizon assets grow nicely on a go-forward basis. Erik Peter Rasmussen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Operator : The next question is coming from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Just a couple of questions. First, on the development side, if we look at the schedule and where cabinets are coming from, it looks like with some of the facilities that were turned on in the third quarter, the amount of development in the Americas as well as in Asia has fallen off significantly. And just curious if that's just sort of a temporary slow of what's been announced, and if that actually should get better and how to think about development growth in the Americas and Asia-Pac over the next couple of years. And then, secondly, on the sales pipeline that you described, are you seeing a shift in where the pipeline is coming from and \u2013 with respect to enterprise versus cloud versus networks? And maybe a little bit more color on what you're seeing on the sell side, maybe how much is direct versus indirect et cetera. Thanks. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Sure. So development pipeline first, I do think that what we tend to find is things sort of come in waves. And so, I think we saw that we're in the midst of a European sort of capacity wave. I think that if you look at the broader and deeper pipeline, I think that does tend to start to balance out a little bit more. Although, again, as Keith said earlier, when the other two regions are growing at 13% and 14%, respectively, those are probably going to take on more of the development dollars over time. So I think you will see some balancing of that, because there's also meaningful investments that we'll make in the Americas, as we talked about, sort of the Infomart master plan there in Dallas and those kind of things. So I think you'll see some balancing of that. But again, we feel like we've got opportunities across the regions, but the growth is more substantial in EMEA and APAC. As to the pipeline, again, good performance across our verticals, and we continue to see it in virtually every segment. The pipeline is at its high in terms of historically, and so \u2013 I would say one thing on the networks. Networks \u2013 one, we're seeing both continued sell-to demand, meaning they're \u2013 as they sort of reorient their networks towards a cloud world and continue to invest in those, and then also, wireless continues to be a strong segment for us. But network, we're seeing a lot of sell-through business as well to the enterprise. And so, certainly a portion of our network pipeline is actually aimed at the enterprise. And so, we tried to characterize that internally here. And right now, I would say that the enterprise pipeline, when you look at everything that we're selling both through our NSP partners and other partners alongside our strategic alliance partners, and directly with our enterprise selling team, is a really strong market that's over-indexing materially relative to the overall pipe. And again, our motion right now, though, is even our channel motion is largely a sell with motion. And so, it's not yet a really true fully empowered indirect channel that's going to bring those things to market on \u2013 bring offers to market on its own. We believe there's a way to change that and simplify it and skew things more effectively into the channel, and that's a priority for us to try to make that happen. And I think we could accelerate things if we can do that. But right now, the channel is working a little bit more as a sell with, but really bringing a strong new logo demand because of their position with the customer decision makers. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : And our last question is coming from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. Maybe a question on the other acquisitions. Can you give us a sense on how Metronode and Infomart are progressing? And any color you can provide on the upside to guidance driven by those deals, whether it's on the revenue side or on the cost side? Thanks. Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.: Yeah, John. I mean, in our prepared remarks, we actually talked about the performance of both Infomart and Metronode and the fact that we're stepping up the revenues. In fact, the performance of Metronode and our ability to integrate these assets more efficiently and at speed than previously anticipated has allowed us to turn it from a deal that was going to be accretive after a period of time to being accretive immediately. And so, we're seeing performance and part of the reason you're seeing the step up in revenue guidance, again we took revenues up $15 million this quarter before the currency dilution. That's because of the acquisitions. So bottom-line is we're delighted, that when we buy these businesses, integrate them into our run rate or platform. And then, as Charles alluded to in the case of Infomart, which is more an asset purchase have started to develop the master plan associated with that acquisition and the available land, that puts us in a very good position relative to where we originally were. Still, a lot of work to do. No surprise, but we're integrating all the assets and we had eight integrations underway this year and we're almost through them all. Does not mean there won't be a little bit of work to do next year, but by and large, we're taking down our integration cost. We're at the tail end of it and we just have to tidy up some things as we go into 2019, but we're in a very good position. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. Katrina Rymill - Equinix, Inc.: Thank you. That concludes our Q3 earnings call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : This will conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect at this time.",

In the interest of wrapping this call within an hour, we would like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-up questions to just one. At this time, I will turn the call over to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Kat. Good afternoon everybody and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. We had great end to the year delivering our 64th consecutive quarter of revenue growth and eclipsing a key milestone with over $5 billion in revenue for the year. The opportunity for Equinix is as compelling as ever as digital transformation is reshaping virtually every industry across the globe. Digital and the infrastructure that deals it have emerged as board level issues and this digital imperative is transcending the macroeconomic volatility we see in the market. Customers are thinking differently about how they interact with their customers in every element of their supply chain. And the major tech trends whether it be AI, IoT, big data or 5G are all amplifying this digital tailwind. In the wake of this digital transformation wave, a clear architecture of choice has emerged for our customers. That architecture is global, highly distributed, hybrid and multi-cloud. And for a variety of reasons, customers are increasingly looking to locate this infrastructure at Equinix, leveraging our interconnected digital edge to achieve performance, security, compliance, flexibility and total cost of ownership benefits that can only be supported by the physics of proximity and the economics of aggregation. These compelling advantages are translating into strong performance in the business and give us solid momentum as we enter 2019 and beyond. To build on this momentum, we are investing to expand our unmatched global reach with 36 projects across 25 markets adding new markets such as Hamburg, Muscat and Seoul. We are committed to designing, building and operating our data centers with high energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. In 2018, we sourced clean and renewable energy across 90% of our global platforms and we remain committed to our long-term goal of achieving 100%. We are extending our portfolio of interconnection offerings, while building on our traditional interconnection portfolio with our market leading ECX Fabric. We have developed a roadmap for a number of compelling new services for the year ahead. We are continuing to cultivate high value ecosystems and will scale well past the 10,000 participants currently on our platform and we are standing behind those ecosystems with our 20-year track record of service excellence. We remain focused on the six priorities I outlined last quarter, including expanding our go-to-market engine, evolving our portfolio of partners and products and delivering on our hit strategy. All while remaining steadfast in our commitment to deliver against the revenue, margin expansion and AFFO per share targets laid out at our last Analyst Day. We ended the year with a very strong fourth quarter delivering record gross and net booking which sets us up nicely for a good start to 2019. As depicted on Slide 3, revenues for the full year were $5.1 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 7% year-over-year and AFFO was meaningfully ahead of our expectations. These growth rates are all in normalized and constant currency basis. Interconnection revenues continue to outpace co-location growing 12% year-over-year and multi-deployment metrics increased across the board with robust cross-border bookings driven by continued strength in both cloud and enterprise. Today, over 60% of our recurring revenues comes from customers deployed across all three regions and 86% from customers deployed across multiple metros. Our hyperscale initiative continues to enjoy significant momentum and will allow us to capture strategic large footprint deployments from select customers, while mitigating strain on our balance sheet by employing off balance sheet structures. We are seeing strong success with the initial capacity we have brought to market and our customer pipeline is robust. Our Paris 8 assets is more than 60% pre-leased and with our London 10 facility we have pre-sold 20 megawatts of capacity to key hyperscale customers, with an average contract tenure of greater than 11 years. We also have several other projects in development, including Tokyo 12, our first dedicated hyperscale project in APAC and have secured land across a number of other high demand metros, including Amsterdam and Frankfurt. Our discussions with financing partners are progressing well and we expect to have our first JV executed in the coming months with a compelling collection of assets. We expect the JV structure to have minimal impact on our P&L and other core metrics in 2019 as we continue to ramp up the initiatives. We look forward to providing additional details when we announce the transaction. Shifting to interconnection, we have the most comprehensive global interconnection platform now comprising over 333,000 physical and virtual interconnections, over 4x more than any competitor. In Q4, we added an incremental 8,800 interconnections, including 1,800 virtual connections and are adding more per quarter than any providers do annually. Software-defined networking is acting as a technology catalyst for our interconnection value prop, reducing the friction for buyers and creating a thriving environment that is driving demand across all our interconnection offerings. Customers using virtual connections are also our highest users of physical connections showcasing the complementary nature of our portfolio. For our Internet Exchange Platform, revenues, ports and traffic were all up due to strong global demand and new market growth in EMEA and Brazil. IX peak traffic surpassed 10 terabytes per second for the first time and was up 8% quarter-over-quarter. Now, let me cover some highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical had its second highest bookings led by EMEA and fueled in part by continued strength NSP resale to enterprise customers. With our leading network density and over half our size along coastal locations, we also continue to win new subsea cable opportunities and have been selected in more than 25 subsea cable projects over the last few years. Wins this quarter included the carry subsea cable landing station in LA 4, Google\u2019s first private subsea cable connecting Los Angeles and Chile as well as cross-link fibers, connecting the major financial metros of Toronto and New York under Lake Ontario. Our financial services vertical also saw its second highest bookings led by insurance and banking as well as strong new logo performance as firms embrace digital transformation. Expansions included a top 10 global asset manager, re-architecting their network and securely connecting across 7 metros as well as a top 15 multinational insurance company leveraging hybrid multi-cloud and distributed data in Singapore and Hong Kong. In content and digital media, we saw record bookings led by EMEA and strength in the publishing and gaming sub-segments. Customer expansions included roadblocks, Tencent, Thompson as well as Fast Lane, a global cloud edge platform that has been upgraded to a 100-gig to support continued demand of mobile users across 23 IBXs. Our cloud and IT vertical also delivered record bookings led by the software sub-segment as the cloud continues to diversify, expansions included StackPath, a leading provider of edge cloud services deploying infrastructure across 21 metros as well as British ERP SaaS provider expanding to support demand for cloud services at the edge. The enterprise vertical which drove a full one-third of total bookings in 2018 continues to be our fastest growing vertical with bookings in Q4 led by the energy, healthcare and retail sub-segments. New wins included a global grocer transforming their network for a cloud-first strategy, a Fortune 100 global chemical company re-architecting their network to transform IT delivery and a top automotive parts manufacturer leveraging ecosystem partners via ECX. Channel sales continue to represent a critical lever for expanding our market reach delivering our third consecutive quarter with over 20% of bookings and accounting for half of our new logos driven by solid performance across all partner types. We are very pleased with our channel progress and continue to build predictable and repeatable deal flow. In 2018, the channel drove over 4,000 deals, a great indication of the significant velocity of our retail selling engine. New channel wins this included a joint win with Verizon for a high-performance semiconductor manufacturer launching new dev test infrastructure to support the engineering community as well as a partner win with CBRE for a U.S. regional bank using platform at Equinix to lower their total cost of ownership and improve user experience across their 1,700 branches. Now, let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Keith Taylor : Great. Thanks, Charles. Good afternoon to everyone. As we have put a wrap on 2018, it\u2019s great to end the year with our financial results beating guidance across every one of our core metrics. As Charles highlighted, revenues eclipsed another key threshold ending the year at greater than $5 billion, a 9% year-over-year growth rate. AFFO per share was $20.69, a great result showing how we are driving value at the share level and tracking ahead of our key operating metrics as we had said at the June 2018 Analyst Day. For the fourth quarter, we had extremely strong bookings across each of our regions, including a record in EMEA, while both America and APAC regions had their second best bookings performance to-date. Our bookings span across more than 3,000 customers with a quarter of them buying across multiple metros highlighting the unique diversity of our retail co-location business. Simply, we are seeing more cross-region and multi metro deals than at any other time in our history, a reflection of the strength of our platform and the scale of our global footprint. We had net positive pricing actions again this quarter highlighting the continued strength of a differentiated value proposition. Our sales pipeline remains high and we have a significant number of new Fortune 500 prospects. And we have a very active expansion pipeline with over 36 projects underway and we are expanding our interconnected digital edge to 55 metros by the end of 2019, effectively twice the number of metros compared to our next largest competitor. Next, I will cover the quarterly highlights. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and the constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q4 revenues were $1.31 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year and above the top end of our guidance. Q4 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $2 million negative currency impact when compared to both the Q3 average and the guidance FX rates. Global Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $617 million, up 5% over the same quarter last year and better than our expectations due to revenue flow through and lower integration costs. Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA performance net of our FX hedges had a $1 million negative impact when compared to both our Q3 average and guidance FX rates. Global Q4 AFFO was $414 million, including seasonally high recurring capital expenditures better than expected largely due to lower income tax expense in the quarter. Despite the lower income taxes in Q4, as we look forward we expect our earnings in non-U.S. entities to increase which as a result will increase our cash income tax cost as reflected in our guidance. Q4 global MRR churn was 2.1% better than our expectations. For 2019, we expect MR churn to average between 2% and 2.5% per quarter. Turning to the regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7, APAC and EMEA were the fastest growing regions at 15% and 11% respectively on a year-over-year normalized MRR basis followed by the Americas region at 5%. The Americas region had a strong finish to the year better than expected bookings, increased cross-border deals and lower churn. Net cross-connection staffed up nicely, the vast net adds in 2 years. Net cabinets billing rebounded too. The Verizon assets had their best gross quarterly bookings performance since we acquired the assets in part due to the newly opened capacity. Verizon assets as expected absorbed higher MR churn in the quarter. We expect these assets to return to growth in 2019. EMEA had a record quarter led by our Dutch and German businesses. We continue to expand with about half our global construction activity in the region weighted towards the flat markets. As mentioned last quarter, we are seeing higher utility prices across many of our EMEA metros. This cost increase is partially offset by our utility hedges which will roll off over the coming quarters and reset at market rates. These higher cost as reflected in our guidance are the result of higher unit prices, increased utility taxes and the increased consumption from our customers. And Asia-Pacific delivered solid bookings across each of the core metros. Cabinet billings more than doubled compared to fourth quarter average driven by cloud and content deployments. MRR for cabinet moved down the result of significant new cabinet deployments and the impact of the Metronode acquisition. Turning to our interconnection activity, net adds were at the high end of the range for both physical and virtual connections. The Americas and Asia-Pacific interconnection revenues were 23% and 14% respectively, while EMEA was 9% of recurring revenues. From a total company perspective, interconnection revenues were 17% of total recurring revenues. And now looking to capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our unrestricted cash balance is approximately $610 million, a decrease over the prior quarter due to our capital expenditures and the quarterly cash dividend. Our net debt leverage ratio was 4.4x at Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA. We also exercised the remaining portion of our inaugural ATM program in the quarter raising $114 million. As we have discussed previously, we remain steadfastly committed to driving long-term shareholder value an we will continue to fund the business primarily through strong operating results, while also accessing the capital markets with the desire to unlock significant value which includes becoming the investment grade rated company. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $680 million, including recurring CapEx of $70 million. We opened 6 expansions across 5 markets in the quarter adding about 8,000 cabinets. We announced 12 new expansions, including our Dallas 11 build, which will be adjacent to our Informart Dallas asset effectively creating a new and significant campus to support the strategic market. Revenues from owned assets stepped up to 54%, a meaningful increase over the prior quarter largely due to the conversion of our strategic New York 4, 5 and 6 assets to own facilities as we entered into a long-term ground lease with our landlord similar to the Slough campus in our London market. This decision will increase our operating flexibility for future developments, while securing the assets over the long-term particularly given the importance of this financial campus. We also purchased Reserve 5 facility as well as land for development in Frankfurt, Hamburg, Lisbon, Osaka and Rio de Janeiro. All of our real estate activities will help increase the level of revenues from owned assets, a key metric to support our investment grade aspirations. Our capital investments are delivering strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our 130 stabilized assets grew revenues 2% year-over-year on the constant currency basis largely driven by increasing co-location and the interconnection revenues while continuing to absorb the headwinds we discussed last quarter. These stabilized assets are collectively 84% utilized and generate a 30% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 16 for our summary of 2019 guidance and bridges. Also note that we have adopted the new leasing standard ASC 842, the impact of which is highlighted on Slide 12. Starting with the revenues, we expect to deliver a 9% to 10% growth rate for 2019. We expect to start the year with a significant increase in recurring revenues in Q1 largely due to our strong Q4 bookings performance. For the full year, we expect to deliver the largest annual absolute dollar increase in our history, the result of continued strong operating performance and a healthy pipeline. We expect 2019 adjusted EBITDA margins to be 47.7% excluding integration costs, the result of strong operating leverage in the business offset by significant expansion activities including new markets, higher EMEA utilities expense and the new leasing accounting standard. Also we expect to incur $15 million of integration cost in 2019 to finalize the integration of our various acquisitions. 2019 AFFO is expected to grow 10% to 13% compared to the previous year. For 2019, we expect AFFO per share to grow 8% to 11% excluding financings. Including capital market activities and taking into consideration market conditions and timing, we expect AFFO per share to be greater than 8% consistent with our AFFO per share growth targets as discussed at June 2018 Analyst Day. And we expect our 2019 cash dividends to increase to approximately $800 million, a 10% increase over the prior year and an 8% increase on a per share basis. So, let me stop there and I will turn it back to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Keith. In closing, we continue to build our market leadership and cement our position as the trusted center of the cloud-first world. Our reach, scale and innovative product portfolio puts us in a great position to build on a business model it is substantially and durably differentiated from our peers. The market remains in the early innings of the digital transformation journey and our accelerating ability to both land and expand customers along that journey make us confident that we are playing the best hand in the business. We are excited about the road ahead and we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. So let me stop here and open it up for questions. Operator : We will now begin our formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Philip Cusick, JPMorgan. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. I just wanted to follow-up. It seems like a lot of your development \u2013 sorry, it\u2019s Richard, a lot of your developments in EMEA and Asia with a big development in the Americas coming in Dallas in mid \u201820. It seems like in terms of your pipeline and commencements, can you give us a sense of do you feel like you have enough capacity in the United States right now and you want to focus on it and we can spend more capital in EMEA and Asia and kind of balanced that growth rate? And two, do you expect the Verizon assets to ramp through the year or will it be lumpy and kind of following along and kind of following along, with all this, your leverage is therefore 4 versus the 3 to 4 target, do you feel like you needed to use a new ATM to fund it or will it just \u2013 will you grow into it as the business expands? Thank you. Charles Meyers : Okay. Why don\u2019t we start with the development as part of the profile of our development portfolio? Actually, I think it\u2019s pretty much what you are seeing is just the development profile is following the growth rates. And so we are in a period now some pretty significant build activity in EMEA have continued to see very strong bookings and growth out of the EMEA region. And so we are getting through I think sort of a lump of that investment, which will position us extremely well and we continue to extend our market leadership in EMEA. APAC continues to be a very important region for us in the world and I think you are going to see us continue to invest meaningfully there. In the Americas, as you noted, we are going to start the journey to building out Infomart as the campus and I think that\u2019s going to be a big opportunity for us, but the growth rate is slower. We have made meaningful investments in some key assets in the Americas and feel very well positioned to continue that feed the bookings engine there. So I think what you are saying really is just a profile there that one, runs a little bit in waves and two just sort of maps to the sort of region to region growth profile of the business. Second piece was on Verizon, I think little tough to tell you, I think the business at some degree is always a little bit lumpy. I think we have now kind of worked our way through the bulk of the lumpier churn and I think we are seeing those assets stabilize. And when you add in the fact that we have added capacity into some of the critical new markets that where we believe there is strong demand like NOTA and Houston etcetera, Culpeper, we feel good about that returning to growth and we hope that, that will sort of progress positively throughout the year. And then the last piece was on leverage and so I will let Keith comment on that. Keith Taylor : Yes. And you will know Richard on this over the last quarter we did bump up to 4.4x our annualized Q4 adjusted EBITDA. As we look forward again, our goal is to get within 3x to 4x net leverage range. We are going to accomplish that in many different ways. The most easiest way to do that is continue to drive growth on the top line with the strong operating leverage and just by share of growth it will naturally de-lever the business, simultaneous with that as we continue to look for ways to raise capital, we are always going to take a balanced view of course between the ATM program and whether or not we are trying to secure any incremental debt that\u2019s also going to help us de-lever particularly as it relates to the ATM program. And then just overall collectively, I think it\u2019s is important just to elaborate a little bit on, our quest has always been we have an aspiration to become an investment grade rated company. And just simply put, we think it\u2019s worth 75 basis points to 90 basis points on the $10 billion of debt. And so I assume that\u2019s just rounded up to $100 million of cash pre-tax when you put our multiple on to that. It\u2019s a meaningful amount of value that we can create for our shareholders over a relatively short period of time if we work really well to grow the top line show the operating leverage and bring our debt balance into the target range, something that we would certainly share with the credit rating agencies and with many of our investors over the year. So it\u2019s an area of high focus for us and we will continue to have aspirations to get investment grade and so we are going to work hard at doing that in 2019. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from Jordan Sadler, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jordan Sadler : Thank you. First, can you provide a little bit of granularity on the 2019 revenue growth, I think interconnection revenue growth slowed to back 10% year-over-year the fourth quarter versus maybe 18% for the full year, do you expect this driver to stabilize in 4Q or at the 4Q pace in \u201819 or will it reaccelerate along side the increased cross connect volume you have booked in the fourth quarter. And then second what is the year end leverage target just following up on Richard\u2019s question here that\u2019s embedded in the 2019 guide, I kind of noticed that interest expense for the full year guide looks like it\u2019s down somewhat from the full year 2018 interest expense and in the face of rising rates that seems like maybe you are getting some savings either from lower leverage in issuance or maybe from some other area, could you maybe shed some light? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Thanks Jordan. I will let Keith take the second part of that. But as for the interconnection business, look we feel like this was really a tremendous quarter and demonstrates continued strength in the interconnection business. We are at the top end of our range in physical interconnections and now we have starting to report the virtual interconnections with another 1,800 on top of that. And so really feel terrific about the interconnection value proposition and about the value that our customers are getting for that. In terms of the growth rate, it was 10% as reported normalized to 12%. And so I think it moves around a little bit depending on some factors, but we feel like that that is going to continue to outpace co-location business and is obviously a very attractive business for us in terms of continuing to drive the overall financial performance. And there are two areas I think represent upside opportunities for us. One, I think we have kind of began the process of more I am sorry normalizing pricing in EMEA on interconnection which is something we have talked about since the Telecity transaction, so I think there is opportunity there. I think we are starting \u2013 we are continuing to see an evolution as \u2013 in terms of percentage of revenue that is interconnection based in the other two regions continuing to move positively. And again their performance in terms of volumes of interconnection in the Americas portfolio continues to be strong as well. So I am sorry to expect that that\u2019s going to \u2013 that is again it\u2019s not going to be at that previous 18% level, but I think we are going to see very strong interconnection growth in the business. Keith Taylor : Okay. And then Jordan let me take the second part of the question. First and foremost in the prepared remarks one of the things that we have stated is we are highly focused on delivering growth on an AFFO per share basis. Irrespective of our financing, we are going to deliver at an AFFO per share growth of 8% or greater. Thanks. I wanted to highlight that number one. Number two, as I have said there is a lot of value in getting back into the investment grade window. We are working hard with our rating agencies and some of our advisors to execute against that strategy and we think there is no better place to create substantial one-off value right off the gate and getting to investment grades scenario of high focus for us. As it relates to your specific questions on what we want to target, let me just say that we are looking at all alternatives is of course very dependent on market conditions, our quantity, pricing, timing, source of capital and so suffice to say we as a company are going to look at all avenues to make sure that we can execute and maximize our shareholder value. As it relates specifically to the interest rate as it comes no surprise to you, we work very hard to drive down our interest rate costs. And over the years as you probably have noted that we have been able to take our average costs ex-leases sort of a $10 billion of debt is just \u2013 is a notch above 4% for a non-investment grade company, but we have also recently done across currency swap with one of our debt modes. And as a result that we are able to shave off some incremental cost into 2019 to the benefit of everybody and you can see that reflected in the net interest expense. So, again as a company, we are going to continue to drive down as much as possible our cost of capital. I was noting the other day I was thinking it\u2019s worth noting when you look at the flatness of the yield curve whether you are 1 month out or you are 30 years out, you are dealing with a 50 basis point span. We are not overly concerned that interest rates are going to rise up significantly over the near-term and so we will continue to manage ourselves to maximize again the value that we can contribute to our shareholders. Operator : The next question is coming from Jon Atkin of RBC. Your line is open. Jon Atkin : Thanks. Question about hits and I wondered if you could share some parameters or thoughts around build costs now that you are kind of further along in the projects, so basically financing considerations aside, what you are thinking about in terms of build costs, any updated thoughts there, resiliency level, density versus other wholesale products on the market as well as pricing versus comparable products? And then I was interested in just on the network side you have got obviously a bump up in the Americas cost connect trends maybe elaborate a little bit more about what\u2019s driving that? And then as you network your IBXs together and cities together even more so, anything you are seeing in terms of customer adoption? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Sure. Thanks, Jonathan. Hit, again, we feel very good about the progress there making excellent progress against all legs of the stool, the demand side, the supply side and the financing side. In terms of build cost that\u2019s going to vary significantly market by market. What I would tell you is we are very confident that we can build inline with the best in the market in terms of because of our sourcing leverage and our engineering capabilities etcetera. And so we think that, that is we are going to continue to be able to do that. Obviously I think that is going to be meaningfully below our sort of retail build cost just given the nature of those facilities, but we think that we are going to be very much at parity with others in terms of our ability to build at the right price points. In terms of pricing, we have seen fairly stable pricing across the market. So, we feel like supply and demand are still despite a lot of investment in the market, are relatively balanced across the globe. We tend to be focused on the high demand markets where we have visibility to pipeline and access to customers that we think is somewhat advantaged. So we continue to believe that we are going to be able to deliver kind of in line with or maybe slightly above market as we deliver a more sort of comprehensive value proposition for those customers. But as we have said we do believe that the hyperscale market is going to be very competitive. We think it\u2019s going to generate attractive, but more challenged returns than our retail business, which is exactly why we are sort of pursuing it the way we are so that we can minimize our balance sheet exposure to that market, but still have the strategic value of delivering in that product to our key customers. So that\u2019s what I would say relative to hit. In terms of the cross-connect trend particularly in the Americas, yes, you are right we did see that tick up nicely. I think that is actually an artifact as you might remember Jon that I talked last time about the thing that I watch most closely is the gross and in terms of are we continuing to really drive gross adds, which to me tells me that people are resonating with the value proposition in line to continue to consume the product. Well that continued to be very strong and what I think we saw on the other side of it is that our churn was lower this quarter and I think that was partially due to a bit of a breather on the 10 to 100-gig migration. And that\u2019s probably driven by the fact that some of the larger players have moratoriums in their network in the later part of the year and that probably gave us a little bit of pause on that. We unfortunately don\u2019t think that\u2019s the permanent pause, but we do think that that will taper off through the course of the year. And I think what you are seeing I think is a glimpse of what\u2019s possible given the strength of our gross adds. And so again we feel super confident positive about the overall interconnection business and that\u2019s a little bit of the dynamic I think we saw in the Americas this quarter. Jon Atkin : And then just on strategic products, your old job basically you have got the encryption products and can you maybe talk a little bit about how that\u2019s trending and then other things that you feel like you are making progress on? Charles Meyers : Sure. SmartKey is going \u2013 we have got a ton of customers in trial on that service as well as a number of new customers added over the last quarter. It\u2019s not going to be a material differentiator and adder to the overall story, but it is \u2013 it was for us it was a way of demonstrating that we can continue to bring new value added products that really differentiate our position as the trusted party in assisting customers with their digital transformation, we do think it will be additive but to overall growth story. But we are \u2013 but again it\u2019s not kind of a huge offering. But we do think there are others sort of around the corner in terms of continuing to expand the feature set and reach of our ECX Fabric which now is becoming meaningful contributor to our interconnection business as well as we have talked publicly about having our NFE marketplace product that\u2019s not really a product name, but we are working towards sort of finalizing what the actual go to market things will be for these offerings. But they are already from a functional perspective in advance pilot stages with customers. And we think those things can be over time meaningful contributors as we get attached rate on top of cabinets that were already deployed and so that\u2019s one example. And then there are others that we are working through that we will probably to begin to give you visibility to in the next few quarters. Jon Atkin : Thank you. Charles Meyers : You bet. Operator : The next question is coming from Ari Klein, BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ari Klein : Thank you. It seems like you are making a lot of good progress on HIT, but maybe related to JV search is taking a little bit longer than expected, can you maybe provide a little bit more color there. And then what kind of contribution from HIT are you embedding in 2019 guidance? Charles Meyers : Sure. So it\u2019s not the search itself, it\u2019s taking long, believe me those folks found us pretty vast in terms of wanting to have a discussion about what we are doing. And so we have already had initial dialogues with those and began to sort of filter through the ones that we think are most philosophically aligned with Equinix\u2019 partners. And what has taken a bit longer is just the complexity of this from the standpoint of tax and legal structuring and accounting and various other things. And so I think I have mentioned this last time those are I think some of the things that frankly perhaps we underestimate at some level in terms of our ability to get this thing finally executed and off the ground. The good news is the demand side of the business is progressing in terms of building pipeline sort of independent of that or in parallel with that I guess I should say. In addition, the supply side in terms of sourcing land and making sure that we are positioned for the JV to really be effective in ramping quickly once established are all moving in parallel. So the team has done a phenomenal job, our tax, accounting teams have literally been sort of just hedged down trying to get this done. I think we are \u2013 as I have said I think we are going to have this done in the coming months. We are going to shortlist down to a very small set of players that we think are most as I have said most philosophically aligned with us and have the kind of reach and capabilities that we would want to see in a partner. And we think that will happen in the next couple of months. Ari Klein : Got it. And then our same-store revenue growth was 2% this quarter, some of it\u2019s the last quarter, can you maybe provide that number ex-Verizon and then what do you think that number will look like in 2019? Charles Meyers : Sure. Yes. You are right, we are a little light again this quarter and as really dig into the metric and the underlying drivers we would really see a number of factors that one of them you mentioned which is Verizon and that\u2019s having a meaningful sort of suppressing a fact on that metric. It is also a bit of a tough compare still so we are going to need to lap that compare. But the last \u2013 fourth quarter had some elevated NRR in our stabilized assets. And so we think that once you normalize for Verizon and some of that tough compare that you are probably looking at another maybe 150 bps to 200 bps, so a normalized same-store number would be in the 3.5% to 4% range. It\u2019s also being impacted a little bit as I mentioned last time by us actively managing customer migrations out of a select set of sites that are in the stabilized portfolio. And so altogether we\u2019re keeping a close eye on that, but we expect it will probably persist a bit towards the lower end of our historical range even on a normal \u2013 normalized basis for a period of time. Ari Klein : Thanks. Operator : The next question is coming from Colby Synesael, Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Colby Synesael : Great. Thank you. I guess, just following up on that last question, I think last quarter, there was an expectation that, that would improve as early as this quarter and that didn\u2019t happen. And then when I look at your organic growth for 2019 you\u2019re expecting 8% to 9% verse the 9% you just did in \u201818 that you are now expecting Verizon to be a growth driver, so, I think there was an expectations that could be the same, if not slightly higher, just hoping if you could dive a little bit more into that? And then on interconnect pricing, can you just talk about what your strategy is there particularly for some of your network partners and for those specifically who are potentially connecting customers from other data centers into your facility and what you could potentially do to help monetize that maybe in a more efficient way? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Sure. On the growth picture, again, we provide that range. I think we\u2019re going to continue to drive hard in terms of continuing to drive the business. I do think that the stabilized asset growth being kind of where it is somewhat of a contributor. I think that\u2019s driven by not only those factors that we think are probably or temporarily [Technical Difficulty] with more of the sweet spot business. But I think what you\u2019re seeing is really a continued transition phase of the business to really this trusted center of the cloud-first world kind of mindset in terms of the types of deployments, the level of interconnection that we\u2019re going to see. Those are a bit longer sales cycles, but once landed, I think they tend to deliver very attractive cap yields and levels of interconnection. So, I think the growth profile of the business has continued upside opportunity both as some of the \u2013 some of those underlying headwinds subsist or subside. I do think that we\u2019re trying to be appropriately conservative about the pace at which Verizon returns to growth throughout the year, but that\u2019s I think the overall dynamic. We feel very good about the overall growth profile of the business and kind of what it \u2013 what it\u2019s going to look like over the next \u2013 over the next several years. And we think as I said, I think particularly as we add new services and look at the potential to add attach rate to existing deployments, but I think that\u2019s going to be a multi-year process. In terms of interconnection pricing, look the network providers continue to be major partners for us, and we are always in active engagement with them about how to make sure that our product meets their needs effectively. And I\u2019m sure there\u2019s always discussions about price points, but we\u2019ve \u2013 we feel good about the value proposition that we deliver. We have been creative about trying to deliver sort of volume benefits to some of our customers, as well as give them greater degrees of flexibility in how to use the interconnection portfolio more comprehensively and creatively across their business. And so, I think that there is really good momentum with not only the network providers, but also the clouds and the other service providers and, of course, with the enterprise. Enterprise \u2013 actually enterprises are fastest growing segment, enterprise to cloud is our fastest growing interconnection segment. And I think again that\u2019s a reflection of I think the strength of our value proposition in the cloud. Colby Synesael : Okay, thanks. Operator : The next question is coming from Sami Badri, Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you for the question. And you gave us a good amount of context on your prepared remarks regarding virtual cross-connects and the traction you\u2019re seeing there in your business. Could you just give us some color on how billing rates differ between the virtual connections and the physical connections, since you did make the comment that your, I guess, you\u2019d say big customers are using physical connections are also opting into virtual connections. Could you just give us any color on how we should be thinking about that as you projectile your model? Charles Meyers : Sure. Yes, it\u2019s interesting, because we get the question a lot, and I think the way I write \u2013 summarize it all is actually the unit economics are not radically different between the two. The \u2013 because as we look at how people consume on the virtual fabric, typically, they buy a port, sometimes they can buy that as a full buy-out port or they can buy virtual circuits individually on to the port. And when we look at it in terms of our average unit price per connection from customers when you take into account, the port price as well as the virtual circuit price, which is on a unit basis is meaningfully lower than a cross-connect. But as you look at them right now, there\u2019s not a huge gap. And both are good. The cost of goods on \u2013 on the \u2013 on a switched fabric is slightly higher for sure than it is just a basic physical cross-connect, which has very low cost of goods. But what we\u2019re seeing is, is that the way we\u2019re pricing them and the way customers are using them does not represent a dramatically different economic profile across those. And to your point, we are seeing them as very complementary. Generally, it is not, oh, I was using a physical cross-connect and now I\u2019m going to use a virtual cross-connect, it is hey, I have a range of use cases, physical cross-connect is very appropriate for me in certain coincidences particularly with large and repeatable traffic flows, and then virtual cross-connects are really substantially better in an environment that is more dynamic where people need to be turning up and down capacity or moving workloads or traffic between endpoints. And so \u2013 and then, of course, you augment that with IX. And we have many of our more complex customers, who use across the entire portfolio, so they have a lot of Layer 3 traffic that they\u2019re peering through the fabric, and then as they see it \u2013 as they see traffic being exchanged with peers in high volumes, they strip that off to cross-connects and then they \u2013 when they want a private interconnection to a cloud, for example, they might use a cross-connect and a direct connect way directly to Amazon or they would use the ECS fabric and ExpressRoute to get to Azure. So, it\u2019s really a very diverse portfolio that tends to serve complex needs of customers extremely well. And again, there\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re not seeing a dramatic difference in terms of the overall economic profile and return on capital that we see across the \u2013 across types of portfolio. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Very good clarifications. And then the second question is what percentage of your revenues are currently coming in from the channel versus direct-to-customer? Charles Meyers : Yes. We\u2019d said that we\u2019re about 20% of our bookings. We have not sized the actual revenue necessarily, but we did talk about that \u2013 I think we\u2019ve had our third consecutive quarter of north of 20% of bookings. And \u2013 and/or by the way, it\u2019s \u2013 it generates more than half of our total new logo volume. And so it just gives you a real insight into the fact that \u2013 look when we\u2019ve talked about our one of the things that I think is really driving my optimism about the future of Equinix is what I think is a really massive increase in the total addressable market. I think it is meaningfully larger than what we provided in our last analyst day or our last couple of analyst days. And I think that is being driven by a really substantially larger enterprise market opportunity than we had previously given credit to. And I think that\u2019s being fueled our optimism about \u2013 that is being fueled by real feedback from our customers and real implementation of use cases. These are not just theories. These are 4,000 deals that are flowing through the channel. And what you realize is that you this is \u2013 this opens up the addressable market into hundreds and hundreds of thousands of addressable customers. While we can\u2019t get to them, we\u2019re going to add \u2013 we\u2019re going to add to our go-to-market engine this year, but let me tell you, we\u2019re not going to reach all those customers. And so the way to reach them is really through the channel. And so we have now really gotten our sales teams heads wrapped around working with partners as a key way to reach those customers. And they\u2019re really, I think they\u2019ve gotten over the initial reluctance of thinking that somebody was about to steal their account and now they\u2019re working very effectively with channel partners and we\u2019re seeing great channel partners like AT&T, and Orange Business, and those kind of folks really driving significant volumes for us, Telstra. And then also sell with activity with our cloud partners, whether that\u2019s Microsoft, Amazon, Google and others, where we\u2019re seeing their customers say look we need a hybrid cloud solution. We want to engage with Equinix and we\u2019re often being brought into those, Cisco is another one. Their secure agile exchange has really seen tremendous traction with large customers and we partnered with them on some very big enterprise wins. So super excited about what\u2019s going on in the channel. And as I said, more than 20% of our bookings coming from that, I expect that number to go north from there. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. Your line is open. Erik Rasmussen : Yes, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just circling back on Charles on the comments you just made and it was kind of what I was thinking. The enterprise segment, it sounds like you\u2019re then seeing a change in behavior and there seems to be more of a sense of urgency, would you support that sort of commentary? And also does that then support their move towards implementing more of these hybrid architectures. Just want to get some further thoughts on that as you see that especially as we look into 2019 and do you see them moving more quickly? Charles Meyers : Yes, absolutely. I would \u2013 well, I would say, yes, but \u2013 right, because, yes, I see a sense of urgency. Yes, I see a clear sense of consensus emerging around the architecture of choice being hybrid and multi cloud. But what I also see is a very deliberate sense of action and timing. And so these are careful people with jobs that require them to be careful. And so I think they are moving, they are figuring out which workloads they can use to sort of test that architecture. They are absolutely embracing cloud, but they are also embracing it in a very measured way. And so that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing longer sales cycles for sure and we\u2019re seeing average deal sizes being smaller. And so that\u2019s why I think we would love it if these were translating immediately into substantial sort of inflection points or changes in slope on our growth rates. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s not yet happening, but I also think when you look at our land expand and expand activity as people get more comfortable and as they increase their pace of deployment in these hybrid architectures, I think that\u2019s when we\u2019re going to really bear the fruit from our efforts. And so I think the answer is yes, there is a sense of urgency, they increasingly see us as relevant to solving their problem. They\u2019re engaging with us, but longer sales cycles, smaller deal sizes, and it\u2019s \u2013 and so we\u2019re having to work through that in terms of how that translates into our overall financials. But again, feel very good about the business and what the long-term opportunity looks like and about our ability to continue to really be relevant to them. Erik Rasmussen : Thanks. And maybe this is my follow-up back to Verizon. You previously talked about building capacity in 5 markets, but in 2019, is there anything else that you would see that maybe you can make further investments that could potentially get some growth \u2013 turn that growth faster into Verizon or maybe see a better return on that investment? Charles Meyers : Well, one, it\u2019s been a damn good return on that investment. I think we\u2019re super excited about the return that we saw in the level of value creation and accretion that came from the Verizon transaction, so super happy about that. I know it seems like our time here is over the last several quarters has been dominated more by the fact that we saw elevated churn and a flat growth from those. But again, we made the investments where we believe that the fill rates and the utilization levels warranted that. NAP of the Americas, I was just down at that facility recently, terrific group of people, very excited about serving customers as part of Equinix Culpeper. We think the Federal business has continued to be an opportunity. That\u2019s an area where I would say investment I think could yield outsized results. And so we\u2019re going to track that carefully, met with the team that\u2019s doing that, an amazing group of people really energized about what they\u2019re doing. We talked about Denver, Bogota. So we\u2019re making those investments, where the fill rates and the capacity \u2013 and the utilization warranted will continue to invest in them. But I do think we\u2019ve made the investments that we think are key to sort of driving the engine right now and we\u2019re going to watch it carefully in the coming quarters. Erik Rasmussen : Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from Mike Rollins of Citi. Your line is open. Mike Rollins : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Curious, if you could discuss the longer-term opportunity for margins? And if you can \u2013 if you give us a bridge in terms of how the company looks at building some operating leverage with the investments that have been made over the last few years? Charles Meyers : You bet, Mike. Yes, I fully expect that we\u2019d be talking about that on the call to some degree. I think, frankly I would have loved to have us on this call saying here\u2019s our \u2013 here\u2019s the margin expansion we\u2019re going to deliver in \u201819, I realize we didn\u2019t do that, and that\u2019s disappointing at some level to you and probably to us \u2013 and to us as well. But I think it\u2019s really important to put the guide into the appropriate context. At the Analyst Day, we talked about the \u2013 our long-term margin aspirations and shared our view that we could hit the 50% target sometime in that timeframe until \u2013 between now and 2023. And that was based on the assumption that we continue to drive operating leverage in the business, which I can assure you, we\u2019re doing at a very meaningful level. It also took into account though our need to invest in key elements of the business and we\u2019ve talked about that go-to-market expansion, continued product and service development investments, those are really the key areas, as well as overcoming some of the increased level of expansion drag. It should be no surprise to anybody when you look at the \u2013 if you just plot our profile of our CapEx spend over the last several years, it came up substantially and that turns into new projects and new cabinets that it takes time to fill. And in some cases, particularly, if those are first phases that creates sort of some meaningful expansion drag. And so, when you look at those factors, we believe we can do that and we still overcome those things and deliver in margin expansion, the sort of new things that came at us, where the 30 bps as we sized the lease accounting impact and then also but more significantly the utilities cost. And one thing to really understand, I don\u2019t know Mike, you understand this, but I think that our utilities flow through to our business in a very different way than most of our wholesale competitors for example, who pass through power. And so, the impact of the increased utility expenses really chewed up what we had hoped to deliver in terms of drop to the bottom line kind of margin expansion. So, that was a very long answer to the question, but what I would say is, we continue to believe the 50% margin target is achievable. I think we\u2019re going to have to look at whether or not the utility impacts moderate over time. And \u2013 and then we\u2019ll have to \u2013 and then we\u2019ll also, I think we\u2019ll grow through hopefully our expansion drag although if the business continues to be as robust as it is, we\u2019re going to continue to invest behind it. But I think that \u2013 I think the margin target of 50% is still achievable, it\u2019s a question I think of timeline, if \u2013 if we continue to get hit by the utility impacts. Keith Taylor : Mike, let me just add one other thing to what Charles said. The expansion drag in and out itself is, we track that every year and it\u2019s not we recognize that we\u2019re always in the business of expanding. But what was different this year and particularly relative to the prior year is the size and scale, which Charles and I referred to the fact, there\u2019s 36 projects are underway of size and many other smaller projects around the world. But in addition, we\u2019re going to a number of new markets, and as a result, the drag in and out itself just for expansion just 50 basis points this year. And so when you take that into context, you\u2019re going to get the benefit of that further down the road, but you\u2019ve got to absorb it this year and we\u2019re going to bear \u2013 we\u2019re going to bear fruit from these investments. The second thing I think it\u2019s important to note is that as we guide to an EBITDA this year, there\u2019s roughly 20 basis point delta. Charles referred to utilities as one example, that\u2019s roughly 80 basis points, expansion drag is 50 basis points, the new lease accounting is 30 basis points. But as we look through the year, you should expect does all else being equal that margins will continue to improve throughout the year. Q1 is always seasonally soft because of some seasonal costs, but as we get to the back end of the year, I think you\u2019d see us more exiting the year at a higher margin profile than what we exited in 2018. Operator : Our last question is coming from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brett Feldman : Thanks for squeezing me in. During the discussion of the work you\u2019re doing to form the JV, you made a point that once you have this in place, everyone will have a chance to see just how great this asset portfolio is or can be and I actually want to get some understanding of that statement. The way I heard is, it sounded like there might be some considerable degree of asset in the JV once it\u2019s originally formed I know you have talked about maybe putting in some of your existing assets like Paris 8. I am curious maybe as you had discussions you realized or maybe more of your existing assets that would be appropriate for the venture. And also are the JV partners you are talking to are they really primarily passive financial partners or have you discovered that these partners may also have assets that they can contribute to this JV such that on day 1 it might be more of an operating vehicle and we would have guess and I will just throw in a third part to this question, which is once it\u2019s up and running are you capitalizing this primarily to be a business that you grow organically or do you actually see it as an M&A vehicle meaning it could be assets in the past you wouldn\u2019t have one to own, because they didn\u2019t align with your IBX model, but maybe now there is a different approach you could take to M&A? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Okay, a lot there. I will try to tackle some of them and Keith can jump in and help me. In terms of the assets that might go into the JV, I won\u2019t go too far in terms of getting out over my skis, but we simply say that yes, there are assets that we believe are appropriate to include in the JV and those assets have some level of existing either pre-leasing and/or stabilization already making them very attractive parts of the portfolio. And so \u2013 and in fact we believe that, that might also represent an opportunity at some point during the year for us to repatriate capital back into Equinix system. And so we are excited about that. We think it\u2019s a really compelling story. That is the feedback we are getting from partners. In terms of partner types, I would say simply that we want good financial partners who are philosophically aligned with what we want to accomplish. And once it understands strategically what we are trying to accomplish, understand that proximity to the Equinix ecosystem and interconnectedness to it, it is important and so we will be tackling \u2013 we will be attracting and working with those types of partners and then as to whether it\u2019s a \u2013 whether the vehicle would in and itself act as something that would drive other transactions, I don\u2019t know over time I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s certainly not on our radar right now. We are fully consumed with getting a JV structure agreed upon and how decision-making would proceed with the partner and what the assets would look like and how we can start meeting customer needs, because that\u2019s what we are really focused on. And so I think that\u2019s a little bit more color. Anything else in there to add, Keith? Keith Taylor : One of the things I just want to highlight it\u2019s really important for us as we have said before we want to keep this off balance sheet, so recognizing there is the partnership, there is the arrangement on the ownership, but there is also the fee structuring and so it was great, as Charles alluded to, there is a lot of complexity behind the organization of this JV structure. And this is the first of what we think could be many. And as a result, we have got to be mindful of avoiding consolidation simultaneously dealing with the complexity around tax. So, we are looking forward to spending more time talking to everybody about this. As you can tell by Charles\u2019 tone, he is excited, we are excited, we are making great progress and stay tuned.

Charles Meyers : Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We had great end to the year delivering our best Q1 ever, including a largest revenue step up in our history, and our second best net bookings quarter, reflecting strong customer demand and lower churn. Our booking span more than 3,000 customers, with cross border bookings up substantially year-over-year. We processed over 4,000 deals in the quarter, highlighting the diversity and high volume nature of our retail colocation business, and the scale we built across our entire go to market and customer support engine. During the quarter we also announced adjustments to org. structure to globalize our operating model, scale our business, and execute with increased velocity against the growing opportunity for Equinix has a strategic platform on which customers architect their digital business. We moved three company veterans into new roles, including concentrating all of our customer facing functions into a single global organization under Karl Strohmeyer, enabling us to provide consistent execution and deliver increased value as a trusted advisor to the businesses undergoing digital transformation. As depicted on slide three revenues for Q1 were $1.36 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 12% year-over-year and AFFO was meaningfully ahead of our expectations. Our market leading interconnection franchise is performing well, with revenues continuing to outpace colocation, growing 12% year-over-year, as the cloud ecosystem continues to scale. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Penetration in lighthouse accounts increased nearly 50% of the Fortune 500 and 35% of the Global 2,000 showcasing the expanding opportunity as we deepen our reach into the enterprise. We are now the market leader in 16 out of the 24 countries in which we operate, and we're expanding our platform with 32 projects announced across 27 markets, with Q1 openings in Frankfurt, Hong Kong, London, Paris, and Shanghai. With regard to our hyperscale initiative, we are now in the final stages of discussions with a short and highly attractive list of potential financing partners. We expect to announce our first JV in EMEA in Q2, with a collection of both stabilized and development assets. We continue to see strong customer demand and lease up for our London 10 and Paris 8 assets is tracking ahead of expectations. We remain highly confident that the JV structure will allow us to extend our cloud leadership, while mitigating the strain of hyperscale development on our balance sheet. We'll provide additional details when we announced the transaction, but fully expect that the JV structure will deliver significant strategic value and solid returns, all with minimal impact on our P&L in 2019. Shifting to interconnection, we now have over 341,000 interconnections and continue to add at a rapid clip. In Q1, we added an incremental 7,400, including 1,900 virtual connections. We added more interconnections year-over-year than the rest of the top 10 competitors combined. For our internet exchange platform, we're seeing strength in the new EMEA and Latin American markets with IX peak traffic, up 20% year-over-year. ECX Fabric, our SDN-enabled interconnection service now has over 1,500 customers and saw strong growth from enterprise adds. In Q1 we completed the full globalization of our ECX fabric enabling customers for the first time to establish on-demand network connections between the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Our vision is to continue to evolve platform Equinix into a broader platform that interconnects and integrates global businesses at the digital edge. Expanding our capabilities at the edge is critical for our service provider customers looking to fuel the way with digital transformation and for global enterprises striving to keep pace in an increasingly digital world. We are excited about the possibilities of our evolving platform and have developed a roadmap of compelling new services. We anticipate rolling out over the next several quarters. Now, let me cover highlights from our verticals, our network vertical experienced solid bookings led by strength in AP and driven by major telcos, mobile operators and NSP resale. Expansions this quarter included Hutchison, a leading British mobile network operator upgrading the infrastructure to support 5G and cloud services, as well as a leading Asian communication provider, migrating subsea cable notes and connecting to ECX Fabric for low latency. Our financial services vertical saw a near record bookings led by EMEA and strong growth in insurance and banking. New wins included, a fortune 500 Global insurer transforming IT delivery with a cloud first strategy, a top three auto insurer transforming network topology while securely connecting to multiple clouds and one of the largest global payment and technology companies optimizing their corporate and commercial networks. The content digital media vertical produced solid bookings led by strong demand in the social media sub-segment as providers continue to strive to improve user experience and expand the scope of their business models. Our gaming and e-commerce sub-segment grew the fast year-over-year led by customers, including Tencent, neighbor and roadblocks. Our cloud and IT vertical also captured strong bookings led by SaaS as the cloud diversifies towards a hybrid multi-cloud architecture. We see a robust pipeline as cloud service providers continue to push to new markets and roll out additional services. Expansions included a leading SaaS provider expanding to support growth in new markets and with the Federal Government as well as an AI powered commerce platform upgrading to enhance user experience and support a rapidly growing customer base. As digital transformation accelerates the enterprise vertical continues to be our fastest growing vertical led by healthcare, legal and travel sub-segments this quarter. New wins included Air Canada, a top five North American airline deploying a hybrid multi-cloud strategy, Space X deploying infrastructure to interconnect dense network and partner ecosystems and one of the big four audit firms re-architecting networks and interconnecting to multi-cloud to improve the user experience for both employees and clients. Channel bookings also saw continued strength delivering over 20% of bookings and accounting for half of our new logos. We're seeing accelerated success selling with our key cloud and technology alliance partners, including Cisco, Google, Microsoft and Oracle. New channel wins this quarter included a win with Anixter for a leading French transportation and freight logistics company deploying mobility platform, as well as a win with AT&T for a top-five U.S. Bank accessing our network and cloud provider. Now let me turn the call over to Keith and cover results for the quarter. Keith Taylor : Thank you, Charles and once again good afternoon to everyone. As highlighted by Charles we're delighted with the start of our year delivering great Q1 gross and net bookings alongside our 65th consecutive quarter of revenue growth. With this momentum we're raising 2019 guidance across the board and are tracking well against the target set at our 2018 Analyst Day. MRR yields remained firm and MRR churn was lower than planned, allowing us to retain more value in the business by still fulfilling a diverse set of new customer demands weighted towards smaller deal sizes. We're continuing to invest in our growth and scale both as it relate to our organic expansion, as well as new product and services initiatives and at the same time, we've been able to leverage how we spent our SG&A dollars, reflecting our priority to increase the operating leverage in the business and reduce the SG&A line as a percent of revenues. Now I will cover the quarterly highlights. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on slide four global Q1 revenues were $1.36 billion, up 11% over the same quarter last year and above the top end of our guidance range. Nonrecurring revenues were 6% of total revenues, an 11% increase over the prior quarter and reflect the inherent lumpiness of this revenue line. We expect nonrecurring revenues to remain elevated in Q2, but given our current visibility to customer activities, we expect to return to more typical levels in the second half of the year, which is reflected in our guidance. Q1 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $3 million positive FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance ranges. Global Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $660 million, up 12% over the same quarter last year, largely due to strong operating performance and lower than planned utilities and repairs and maintenance expense. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance net of FX hedges included a $2 million positive FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance range. Global Q1 AFFO was $488 million, largely due to strong operating profit as well as lower net interest expense due to our cross currency swap on a portion of our U.S. denominated debt and a lower cost to borrow on a floating rate debt due to the credit rating increase. Also in the quarter we had lower seasonal recurring capital expenditures, offset impart by higher cash taxes as expected. Q1 global MRR churn was 2.1%, better than our expectations for the quarter. For 2019, we expect MRR churn to average between 2% and 2.5% per quarter, although at the higher end of our range in Q2 mainly due to timing. Turning to regional highlights, whose full results are covered on slides five through seven. APAC and EMEA were fastest growing MRR regions at 17% and 13% respectively, on a year-over-year normalized basis, followed by the Americas region at 5%. The Americas region had a strong start to the year with solid net bookings with a higher mix of small deals, and a healthy pricing and pipeline environment. America has had record non-recurring revenues in the quarter, including a meaningful level of exports to the other two regions, as our teams continue to sell globally across our platform. Our EMEA region had a very strong quarter led by the U.K. business with significant additions to our cabinet billings and interconnections. In Q1, we opened meaningful new capacity across our flat markets, with a strong build pipeline continuing over the rest of the year. We also purchased Amsterdam 11, an IBX in close proximity to our existing highly network campus in South East Amsterdam. This acquired asset will help deferred CapEx while creating near-term capacity to fill the growing demand for digital infrastructure connectivity in the Netherlands and then the broader European market. And the Asia Pacific region delivered strong bookings led by our Japan and Hong Kong businesses. APAC saw a particular strength in the enterprise, cloud and content verticals as supported by our channel team. MRR for cabinet remained firm despite absorbing the significant new cabinet installations at the end of last year. And now looking at the capital structure, please refer to slide eight. Our unrestricted cash balance is approximately $1.6 billion, an increase over the prior quarter due to strong operating cash flows and of course, the $1.24 billion follow on equity raise. But offset impart by our corporate capital expenditures and cash dividend. Our liquidity position remains very strong and our net debt leverage ratio dropped to 3.6 times our Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA, well within the targeted range of three to four times net leverage. Also, given the strong momentum in our business and our commitment to use both debt and equity to fund our future growth, S&P upgraded all debt and our corporate family rating to investment grade. We believe we're on a solid path to attain a second investment grade rating, which once attained will allow us to access the IG debt capital markets, thereby lowering our future costs to borrow. So at the end of the day, we have cash, we have liquidity, we're appropriately levered, and we have one of the lowest AFFO payout ratios in the industry. This creates immense flexibility as we continue to scale our business and drive to maximize long-term shareholder value. Turning to slide nine for the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $364 million including a recurring CapEx of $21 million. We opened seven new builds this quarter including three new IBXs in London, Paris and Shanghai adding 7,500 cabinets. We also purchased our Sao Paulo II facility as well as land for development in Milan, and Frankfurt. Revenue from owned assets stepped up to 55%. And our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on slide 10. Our now 134 stabilized assets grew revenues 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Increasing quarter-over-quarter, reflecting a moderation of the prior headwinds experienced. Also consistent with prior years during Q1, we completed the annual refresh of our IBX categorization. Our stabilized asset count increased by a net four IBXs. These stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized, and now generate a 31% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested due to the strength of the new assets added to this stabilized portfolio. And finally, please refer to slides 11 through 15 for a updated summary of 2019 guidance and bridges. For the full year 2019, we're raising our revenue guidance by $25 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance by $30 million, primarily due to strong operating performance. This guidance implies a revenue growth rate of 9% year-over-year, and a healthy adjusted EBITDA margin of 47% to 48%. Also, we're reducing our 2019 integration costs assumption to $13 million, a $2 million reduction compared to the prior guidance. And given the operating momentum of the business, we continue to improve our AFFO and AFFO per share core metrics. We're raising our 2019 AFFO by $45 million to grow 13% to 14% compared to the previous year, which includes the net interest benefits attributed to our credit rating upgrade. We're also narrowing or 2019 AFFO per share range to a midpoint of $22.70, excluding integration costs. AFFO per share is expected to grow between 8% and 9%, which includes the dilutive impact from the Q1 equity raise. We've assumed a weighted average at 84.1 million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. And we expect our 2019 cash dividends to increase approximately $820 million, a 13% increase over the prior year or an 8% increase on a per share basis. So with that, I'm going to stop here and turn the call back to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thank you, Keith. In closing, we believe that digital transformation will persist as a driving force in the global economy. And we are positioning ourselves to seize that momentum. With our unmatched global reach the industry's most comprehensive interconnection platform and unparalleled track record of service excellence, and an expanding portfolio of edge services, we remain confident in our ability to deliver superior value for our customers, allowing us to build on and extend our market leadership. We are tracking ahead of our 2019 targets. And we have a clear set of priorities for this year to drive durable and growing AFFO per share for our shareholders. So let me stop here and open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you. Looking at your average revenue per cross connect in Europe, it looks like it was down double digits year-over-year in 1Q, 2019. So we just want to get a better idea on the market dynamics that are happening there. Just the industry's perception that that business is stabilizing and standardizing in Europe, and with your exposure to financial services, you think that you would see a bit of a mix shift upward? Could you just give us some color on the dynamics in the region? Charles Meyers : Yes, I would say and if I look at that particular step. And I would say more, more generically. I think the interconnection business across the globe and including - inclusive of EMEA continues to be very strong. And so I think the demand for interconnection, both across our full interconnected portfolio of interconnection services continues to be solid. As we've mentioned we are in the process of sort of normalizing our interconnection pricing to Equinix levels across the board. So I'd expect that over time, we're going to continue to see an uplift in terms of our unit performance in that region. So at a macro level, interconnection in Europe continues to be very healthy with strong demand. Keith Taylor : Sami the other thing I would just add, one of the things we did, we adjusted some of the cross connect counts in the last quarter, as we reconcile some of the Telecity install base. And so the revenue was still there, but the count was adjusted upwards to reflect the number of units. And so you're seeing a little bit of a reduction because of that, but there was nothing fundamentally that has changed within our pricing model. And in fact, as Charles said, we're normalizing our pricing structure as we roll that out through Europe in 2019. Charles Meyers : Yeah, that's right, Keith, I forgot about that. So that's maybe a bit of an optical thing. It was - essentially that was whenever we do an acquisition we take a fairly conservative view account because often times the installed base is when you end up going in and doing the audit ends up differently. And so in this case we had that reserve essentially a reserve setting out there on a unit basis, but the revenue was there and then we bought it in so that shows a bit of a - sort of an optical disconnect. Sami Badri : Got it, thank you. Keith Taylor : On that chart on the Q4 earnings deck Sami. Sami Badri : Got it, thank you. Yes, I saw the changes in Q4 specifically. The other question I had was on ECX and maybe we can just get a better idea on the percentage of your customers that are using the ECX fabric to connect to multiple regions. Just as we get an idea on how many clients or customers are leaning on specifically this as the key differentiator versus just deploying in their more traditional sense. We just want to get - could you give us any kind of percentages or a quantified idea that'd be great. Charles Meyers : We do have the obviously the 1,500 customers so you get a sense for just how many of our customers are actually implemented on it and you also get a sense for how much upside remains for us there. I think in terms of the total percentage of those customers that have yet sort of avail themselves of the multi-regional connectivity aspect of ECX Fabric. That's still relatively small, but with a lot upside opportunity there. It is actually well ahead of what our plan was and so we're seeing uptake on that faster than we had even expected. But it's still relatively small percentage I would think of the total number of customers that are yet using the cross regional, but I think that they are absolutely seeing it though as a key differentiator. I think the ability for them to house infrastructure in proximity to the multi-cloud generate the performance and cost benefits that are part of being on platform Equinix and then have the confidence that they can interconnect to the rest of their own private infrastructure and or to cloud endpoints that aren't in their chosen location is a compelling value proposition for them. And I will tell you that as I'm out with our sales teams they continue to see ECX Fabric at least as the primary hook for conversations with customers these days, and so very pleased with how that's playing out in the market. Sami Badri : Great, thank you. And then my last question has to do with your JVs that were announced and you've laser focused on Europe and based on what you laid out in your 2018 Analysts Day and some of the return profiles in the JV structured agreements. Are we looking at similar return profiles in these future JVs that are coming and that you laid out in the 2018 Analysts Day or should we expect it to look a little bit different given just given some time as digestion and partnerships are starting to form? Charles Meyers : Again there's no - we haven't announced any - you are talking specifically about the hyperscale JV. Sami Badri : That's correct. Charles Meyers : Yes, no announcements there yet, as we said in the script we expect that that will be announced and we are focused on EMEA as the first JV opportunity tracking very well there feel very good about the financing partners we're talking to as well as the customer uptake. What we showed at Analysts Day I think continues to be consistent with our expectations, I think we're going to see really good solid headline returns on those projects. And I think our pipeline reflects is supporting that notion right now. And then Equinix just due to the fee structure and the flow fees for us as management fees and some of the other fees that float us in that we'll see some upsize returns from that. We'll get good solid equity returns and then see some juice from the fees as well. So we feel good about the structure overall, tracking well and I think that - I don't think that the structure would look meaningfully different overtime. Keith unless you had different view on that. Sami Badri : Thank you. Keith Taylor : We'll update you in Q2, again we're excited to announce the final formation of the JV and the JV partner and we'll discuss that in the Q2 timeframe. Sami Badri : Great, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jordan Sadler form KeyBanc. Your line is open. Jordan Sadler : Thank you, good afternoon. I had a follow up on the JV, I don't want to jump the gun relative to your planned announcement, but you made the comment of no impact I think to the P&L in 2019 relative to guidance, I just wanted to clarify what's specifically you're referencing if it was guidance or the actual P&L? And then because I would think, as you just mentioned, Charles, there could potentially be enough an uplift to you guys as a result of a fee stream, especially if there's some stabilized assets being stuck into the JV. Then have a follow up. Keith Taylor : Yes, so Jordan, let me just touch base. So on the last earnings call, what we did do is we gave you an update of basically the net burn we're investing in the hyperscale initiative team right now are what we refer to as our hit team. So all the - so there's a lot of if you will cost going through the P&L today and so that is embedded in the guidance. What you will what you have not seen is, what we said was on a go forward basis, the AFFO impact because we're in the development phase, and we'll be putting some stabilized assets into the JV taking some cash out and investing in new developments. There will be no meaningful impact to AFFO per share when we make that announcement, but what that - what that doesn't say is that there is an anticipation of a meaningful amount of cash, as Charles alluded to on the last earnings call of cash coming back into the business. And then that's going to then fund the future developments. And so there's a lot to talk about with respect to JV, but we don't want anybody to assume any incremental AFFO per share in fiscal year 2019 related to this. Jordan Sadler : Okay. It sounds like there could be - it could be a flows issue, as you'll have a cash flow coming in. And over time - that'll drag initially and over time, that'll be redeployed from if I am not putting words in your mouth. Keith Taylor : It goes back to really what Charles said, when you look at - if you look at the assets on at the project level very good returns for both ourselves and what we believe to be our financing partner. And so we are happy at the project returns. In addition, Equinix will receive a certain amount of fee income associated with it. So when you look at this as the return on our equity. It's in a very, very attractive investment decision for us. And it's a good project return for our partners. And then there's always the potential for the upside at some point in the future, depending on how we liquidate the asset. Jordan Sadler : And then lastly, could you speak to the growth in physical versus virtual cross connects? I appreciated the disclosure you guys have been providing there. I'm just curious; the virtual cross Connect volume clearly is growing at a faster rate if make sense. Just maybe talk to what your expectations would be there one versus the other. And then if you could elaborate on pricing? Charles Meyers : Sure, sure. Yes, we see we see continued health across the intersection portfolio. And I think that's one of the key differences is that we bring a very rich set of interconnection options to our customers to solve a very different and varied set of used cases for them. And so depending on what they want to accomplish, depending on their confidence in traffic flows, depending on the timing and duration of their needs, they might choose different alternatives. And so, right now, we are seeing tremendous uptake on ECX Fabric, particularly from enterprise connectivity to the cloud. That should be no surprise to anybody. And we expected that that will continue to be a very strong sort of element of our business going forward. But what often happens is a maturation and a staging of things where people initially sort of begin to test moving workloads into the cloud. They may do that over the fabric using - buy a port and then provision capacity to a cloud. See how that works. But over time, it's often more cost effective and were performing for them to actually move to physical conductivity private in an actual cross Connect at a future stage of the maturation of their cloud strategy. And so that's what we typically see as a customer sort of buying across that portfolio. And given whatever is right for them based on the particular needs of the used case. So, that's why we've said that we don't really - there's probably some very modest level of substitution, but we see them generally as complimentary. And that's why both of them continue to grow well. In terms of pricing, the individual unit cost for a virtual connect is lower, but you have to recognize that you do have to pay the upfront port cost to essentially enable those virtual connects. And so depending on how many virtual connects you might provision over a single port it can vary meaningfully. But in terms of yield to us right now, we're not seeing a dramatic difference. I think as virtual cross connect volumes scale, you will see a slightly lower average price point on virtual than physical. But again, the economics of both and return on capital for both of those products are exceptionally good for Equinix. Jordan Sadler : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Philip Cusick from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Philip Cusick : Hey guys, thanks. Two if I can, one for Charles, for the JV I think it's going to be different sales processes for different customers going forward between the legacy Equinix and the JV facilities, or do you anticipate those being a single sales process? I am just trying to think about how you plan to protect the high price and differentiated legacy business from being used to subsidize the new business? And then, for Keith, can you dig in a little more into the SG&A scaling? How should we think about this long-term trend versus revenue and what's being done to control costs? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Yes, so let me take the JV first. As we said, one of the key things for us is that we wanted to be able to deliver a more comprehensive portfolio of offers to our hyperscale partners. As you recall, what I presented at the Analysts Day, we currently have and now well beyond this at that time, we were at a $0.5 billion a year business with the 12 top hyperscalers. And I showed how that was growing across the portfolio from sort of smaller, highly interconnected footprints up to sort of larger, more wholesale type, hyperscale type of footprints for different needs. But I think the bottom line is that we want to use our single unified relationship with that customer, our understanding of their needs and the trust relationship that we have, as well as the integration between our platforms to continue to service their needs. And - but there's - we see the opportunity as quite distinct though, typically they would be using Equinix facilities more for networking nodes, private interconnection nodes and those kind of targeted elements of their architectures. And looking more for availability zones and large server farm type of footprints in more the hyperscale arena. So we think there's a relatively clean line there for us to manage. And we think there's plenty of opportunity for both the JV and Equinix and our partner to do very well with those large footprint, as well as for us to continue to grow the targeted more interconnected footprints. Philip Cusick : Okay. Keith Taylor : And Philip on the second question on SG&A scaling, I think this is a journey as you can well appreciate. First and foremost, when you look at where we started our SG&A as we sort of top tick we were at between 22% and 23% SG&A as a percent of revenue and today we're closer to the 18% to 19%, with the ability to potentially scale that down further. But how we're doing it is across and I think it's important to understand, first and foremost, it really is about our team and taking our team and figuring out how to align them most efficiently. It is also about our systems and our processes. And the recognition that we're through many of the integrations that we've had, as a company as we have integrated different businesses and acquisitions into the - if you will, the parent company. And then you couple that with we've invested quite heavily in 2018 and certainly into 2019 in the procurement and strategic - procurement team and strategic purchasing team inside the organization. And that's certainly going to pay dividends as well as we continue to work to drive down our average cost units across many different functions and items. And then the last piece I'd just share with you is, as Charles alluded to on the last earnings call, we have talked about it previously, there's was element of - it's the savings we want to make sure we take the dollars and we put them and dedicate them in sort of in the right areas. And so we want to continue to take dollars where we can, where we can find those savings, and we put it back into the business to fund the customer facing initiatives, the new product initiatives, the go-to-market strategies, and alike. And so there's an element where we'll put it back into the business and hence invest in our future. And there's an element where we will drive margins up and that's basically returning to the shareholders in the form of a growing cash dividend. We are doing a real good job again of looking at our systems, our processes, allocating appropriately. And then the last piece I'd just say is, we're doing a real good job of prioritizing and prioritizing throughout the organization. We say here internally, there's never a project that we don't like that is always - they're always well intended, just so many projects we can do as an organization, but we can only do so much. And under Charles's leadership, we're really focusing on how to prioritize to the highest and best use of our capital and that's - again that's part of the reason that you're seeing our SG&A as a percent of revenues go down. Philip Cusick : Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Rollins from Citi. Your line is open. Mike Rollins : Hi, good afternoon. First, if you look at the nonrecurring revenue, it continues to be pretty robust. What is the stay [ph] about the installation and pace for the future? And also how do we think about the nonrecurring line item going forward? Thanks. Keith Taylor : So Mike, one of the things I said at least in the prepared remarks, is we saw a meaningful step up in our NRR this quarter was up 11% quarter-over-quarter. It's roughly 6% of our total revenues. It is a lumpy - it tends to be lumpy as it relates in many cases to custom sales orders or specific goods for resale that we might enter into with some of our large strategic customers. And so Q1, yes, you saw a relatively large increase Q2. I think you're going to see NRR - we're guiding to NRR going down slightly quarter-over-quarter, it still elevated relative to prior years. And then going into Q3, Q4, you should see it start to step down to a more traditional level. So again, it's a reflection of the number of deals we're doing with customers, the amount of custom sales order work, and it will be lumpy. And what we're going to try and do is the best that we can anyways, we'll continue to guide to it, because I think it's an important element of things that could go up and go down over any given quarter, at least on a sequential basis. Charles Meyers : Yes, Mike, I'll just offer also - I mean, I think it's part of the sort of the trusted advisor relationship were developed with our customers they really candidly, a big shout out to our global sales and engineering team around the world who does this phenomenal job of engaging our customers and developing a trust, level of trust there, where they're comfortable with us, implementing these really very strategic implementations that are central to how they do business and trusting us to do that. And so, it is something that we - honestly, we have to watch and be careful, we want to make sure it's an appropriate sort of piece of our mix of business. But we also - we think we can do it at attractive margins. It's something our customers really want us to do. But as we said, we right now are - we think we're going to continue robust through the first half of the year and we've got it to a little tapering of that in the second half of the year based on our visibility. Mike Rollins : Thanks very much. Operator : The next question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simon Flannery : Great, thanks so much. On the hyperscale JVs good to hear the update on the EMEA, are we likely to see other transactions this year either in EMEA or other regions or is it likely to be one and then we'll maybe see more down the road? And then, secondly, any updates on merger integration for Infomart and Verizon. Where do we stand on some of that progress? Thanks. Keith Taylor : Why don't I take the first one, push second one to Charles. On the JV we - the first one is probably the more complex one, it is a European based JV. There is a second one that is going to be forthcoming it will be focused on the Asian market, more specifically at least Japan to start. And then, we would anticipate other JVs after that. But still a little bit early Simon, but we are progressing with it shortly to the second JV. In both cases, we look forward to announcing them over the near-term. Simon Flannery : And whether the second one would be smaller than the first one? Keith Taylor : Well, second one will have probably less units in it to start as I said. But it's still a meaningfully science JV and again, initially dedicated towards the Japanese market. Whereas the initial JV in for Europe is London, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam, gives you a sense. They are going to be somewhat market specific, they're going to be timing specific. And again, without getting into sort of the details the first one will have stabilized assets that we move into it on a go forward basis is unlikely stabilize assets would be moved into JV could really be about a partnership funding the hyperscale initiative. Charles Meyers : And then quickly on the integration, obviously, we're pretty well progressed on most of that stuff. You see that in terms of pretty small stub left of integration costs, for the remainder of the year I think we took that down to $13 million, $2 billion down from where it was. So the bulk of the work is done, I would say that, again, we continue to be very pleased with both the financial and strategic benefits that we've gained from the variety of transactions that we've done. Specifically the Verizon you mentioned, I think we actually are seeing that seeing great bookings into those assets. We actually saw record bookings into the Verizon assets. But now they're really fully integrated into how we think about platform Equinix now, but we see great momentum in a number of those markets. I would say that we're still seeing a little bit of the churn tail on Verizon and it's not that it's bigger than what we thought. It's just that it's taking longer to work through and that's not really all that surprising. And it's a goodness thing. In the end we had - even probably had that revenue for longer than we anticipated, but it is causing a little bit longer churn tail and I think that deferring this sort of return to growth and a bit further into the year than what we had anticipated. So again really pleased with that transaction overall. Infomart that's progressing well, we actually have now a project underway that's going to put nearly 2,000 cabinets on to that campus and we feel very good about our ability to build the portfolio of offerings on the Infomart and really take what we think will be a really outstanding market position in a very large and important colo market there. Simon Flannery : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Colby Synesael from Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Colby Synesael : Great, thank you. Two if I may. You added 4,400 cabinets billing in the quarter, which was down from the fourth quarter and a little bit at least to our number and you added 7,500 new cabinets to the base. Just curious that based on the 7,500 that you did add would you expect to step up in cabinets billing net add if you will as we go into the second quarter? And then, secondly, when I look at the EBITDA guidance for the second quarter, you are guiding to flat to may be down $10 million depending on where you come out, and I'm just curious what's behind that. I think that you mentioned part of the upside to gross margin in the first quarter was tied to lower maintenance and utilities, I'm assuming that that's one-time benefits so maybe that's what explains it. But I'm also curious what the margin profile on the non-recurring looks like and if that changes meaningful quarter-to-quarter. Thank you. Charles Meyers : I will let Keith take second part there on the guidance, but on the cabinets adds, I would encourage just to look at sort of overall body of work over the last two quarters, right and look at the level of cabinet adds, the level of interconnection adds, the number of deals, the margin performance, the margin expansion. And so we continue to be extremely happy with the overall performance of the business and the momentum. I do think that cabinets billing as we've always said is a little bit depending on a variety of factors. Asia had a breakout quarter last quarter and then sort of you sometimes see a bit of a hysteresis from that. And so, I think right now we're seeing the level of cabinet ads, when we look over rolling four quarter averages that is super healthy for the business and would expect to continue to see that going forward. Keith Taylor : And Colby s it relates to the second question there is certainly as we alluded to in our prepared remarks there's a number of things that went on in the first quarter and part of it is just the timing of expenses, part of it is utility based. If you recall on the last earnings call, we talked about the drag associated with utilities and it wasn't quite as anticipated in Q1, but on a go forward basis were planning utilities to continue to step up and so that's affecting to the tune of roughly 60 basis points. And then, the other part is to the extent they don't step up then that's something that would come back to the business of course, so much of what we experienced in Q1. Second part is just timing, again like anything, Q1 you've got Chinese New Year, you've got our annual sales kickoff and so there's cost to move around the quarter and our timing on when we make those decisions. So there is some investment that we're going to make in Q2 as we - relative to what we did in Q1. And then, the last thing I would just say is it's important to note when we originally started the year we thought that would take - we originally anticipated the margins would come down slightly. But those reasons why those big expansion drag, it was utilities, it was ASC 842 and the like. As we look forward now, we're actually taking margins up slightly to 48.3% for the year. And that also assumes that we still have roughly 100 basis points drag in the system, which is reflected in our bridges. And so, again, we recognize that it's not - we'd love to have all those nice straight lines and up into the right, but the reality of how we run a business and the global nature it causes different costs to fall in different quarters, and sometimes it's just timing based. And so, again, I just guide you to the fact that overall for the year, we're now raising our guidance, we raised our margins, and we still are preserving what we anticipate to be higher cost model going forward as it relates to utilities. Colby Synesael : Great, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from John Adkins from RBC. Your line is open. John Adkins : Thanks very much. So I'm interested, I don't know if I missed this or not, but any sort of impacts that you're still seeing or expect to see from 10 to 100 gig migration? And then, secondly, just maybe to put a finer point on some of the SG&A questions, a lot of moving parts. But can you talk about projected ramps or not in sales engineering headcount, sales headcounts, and overall kind of shifts if there are any in kind of your go to market strategy? Keith Taylor : Sure. So let me try to tackle all that. The 10 to 100 as we said last quarter, I think we reported last quarter about 7,000 physical cross connects, 1,800 virtual. So very much at the top end of our sort of ranges that we typically give a 5,000 to 7,000 on physical. We had 5,500 physical this quarter and 1,900 virtual. So we did see a bit of a - we saw some of the 10 to 100 gig resume in terms of that we have mentioned that there was a bit of a pause on that probably due to network moratoriums taking hold previously. So - but we still believe that the larger projects for 10 to 100 are very well advanced. And so we do think we'll see some tapering on that over the course of the year, we probably saw also a little bit of NSP, network service provider consolidation impacts in the quarter. And so with those things combined, when we look at gross adds, we're super pleased with the level of gross adds. Again, we do have a little bit of a headwind associated with the 10 to 100. And a little bit on the consolidation side, but overall, strong performance, and we do think that 10 to 100 will probably taper off, particularly in the Americas through the year we will probably see some of that in the other regions, but to a much lesser degree, given the concentrations of traffic. And then, SG&A, I think that we will ramp, we are expanding the go to market engine. And we have about 500 core bearing heads today, we will add to that in a - probably, over the course of the remainder of the year targeting maybe 5.25 or something like that. But, we'll add - we'll continue to add if we feel like we're getting good ramps to productivity. And yes, we are - we will add sort of the full contingent of resources around the headcount to ensure their success that includes both sales engineering, and solution architect and other support type resources. But we're being very careful about how we do that, to make sure that we keep the - keep our commitments to gaining some operating leverage in the business over the course of the year. Keith Taylor : And John, if I could just add one more thing in that, I think it's important, if you look at the trend line over the last five, six quarters. You see that, yeah, we're continuing to invest in the sales and marketing area. And as Charles said, focusing on the dollars in the right area, at the same time is you're seeing on a cash basis the G&A dollar sort of remained flat. So it gives you a sense of, again, going back to my earlier comment as a percent of revenue SG&A on a cash basis is going down. But you're also seeing a greater investment in the front of house customer facing initiatives, which is exactly where we want to deploy our capital. Charles Meyers : You also asked just a more generic piece about the go to market. I would just offer that, Mike Campbell, our Chief Sales Officer and Karl in his new role are working really closely together and continue to drive efficiency and effectiveness in the go to market engine overall. I think that includes a couple of prominent features. One, continued investment in the channel and partnering with a number of partners who are having great success in partnership with us, the likes of AT&T and Verizon and Orange and some great work with Cisco targeting some joint customers. So we're seeing we're going to continue to invest in the channel then we also are going to continue to add resources to both drive new logo capture as well as land and expand behavior with the logos we've already captured. When we look at it in terms of how much wallet share there is on some of the sort of Fortune 500 and Global 2000 customers that we've landed we think there's an immense opportunity. And so we're shaping both the sales rolls and the patches to make sure that we're continuing to drive that as well. John Adkins : Thank you. And you mentioned channel, any kind of quantification I think you talked about successive quarters of 20% contributions or more. But how does that sort of break out by region? And then, my last question just on Asia Pac, China I saw the Shanghai 6400 cabbies and wondering kind of the expected ramp there, in the past I think you talked about maybe entering new metros in China or is the focus for the time being likely to be just on that one metro? Charles Meyers : Yes, so on channel we are seeing - we had probably led in the Americas just a more maybe mature channel market and we've invested our initial sort of resources and dollars there. One of the things that I think we're going to see - we have seen improvements on and we'll see even more now with Karl taking a sort of consolidated global roll is driving a really consistent channel program across the world in terms of the resources that we have on the ground to do that. But all of them, all three regions are tracking very well in their embracive channel. That 20 plus percent number is overall, but I think - I do think that all three regions are tracking well in terms of embracing channel. And then as for China, again, I think we're seeing good response to the Shanghai capacity it's come online I think we're going to have to continue to monitor the situation in China carefully relative to kind of how much additional capital we would think about putting to work in that market. And we do have the JV relationship now which allows us we think a high degree of confidence in terms of how we've approached the market. But I think we'll sort of see how the capacity uptake and customer uptake occurs there and kind of revisit that as we go. John Adkins : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Nick Del Deo from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Nick Del Deo : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. You noted the cross border bookings were up substantially this quarter. Can you give some added detail on that front like what's your deal respond to that category? And if we were to think about bookings by the region where they were sourced rather than where the revenue was generated, how would your business be split between the three regions? Charles Meyers : Yes, it's a great question, Nick. We do look at it that way and we have as you might expect I think just given the sort of typical maturation cycles of technology and how they sort of flow across the globe. We do have a very significant portion of bookings that are exports from the Americas based sales force to the rest of the world. But we've also seen continued efforts for the rest of the selling teams across the world to really embrace selling the global platform and again it is one other thing that is driving force for moving to this more globalized go to market model under Karl's leadership. So we look at that in terms of - we look at all of our deals in terms of where they are sourced, where the headquarter location is. And then we look at the assets and if it is - if there's a cross border flow there we consider that a cross border or global export booking. Nick Del Deo : Okay, makes sense. And then, one on Europe, I think you historically been willing to do more larger footprint deals in Europe versus other regions. What share of bookings in that region would you characterize as being larger footprint? And to what degree might the hit initiative siphon for often most deals and perhaps weigh on consolidated growth? Charles Meyers : Yes, really good question, I do think that we have had a bit more of an appetite there I think that's impart due to the pricing sort of dynamics in Europe and our capacity situation there and a variety of other factors. But what we have done is really looked at what we think that our sweet spot is in terms of bookings. There's no magical spot I don't think, over time, we used to refer to large footprint as 250 kilowatt and above many years ago, and I think, now you're talking about probably more like megawatt plus type deals that are more in that really large footprint category. And so there's not a ton of those, I do think that we would - our desire would be to funnel those to the JV, because that's the right asset for the - we have a long use the sort of right customer right application in the right asset kind of mantra, and it's one we strongly believe in, in terms of driving returns and appropriate allocation of capital. So, I think on the very large footprint with the hyperscale community, we're going to - we would expect to see those begin to migrate probably to the JV. And that would affect I think our bookings to some degree, but I think we've contemplated that in our guidance. We've contemplated that in our projected growth rates for the business. And so it reflects that to some degree already. Nick Del Deo : Okay, terrific. Thanks, Charles. Charles Meyers : You bet. Operator : The next question comes from John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is open. John Hodulik : Great, thanks. Two quick ones, I think first of all, what's driving the higher MRR churn that you guys talked about for the second quarter, I don't know if it's the Verizon churn you referenced in a previous question. And are we sure that that's just a sort of a temporary move and not going to continue? And then, anything you could tell us about conversations with the other two rating agencies, and potentially any timing on moves on their part? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Yes, I'll let Keith just take the second one. As it relates to the first we reported at the very low end of kind of our 2 to 2.5 with 2.1 this quarter, and I think really, the way to think about is just that we - deferral of churn is a good thing for us, right. And so we work hard to defer it or make it go away as best as we can and in this quarter, I think we saw some deferrals that we probably would have initially expected to come into this quarter. And so we'll always take that. But I do think it represents a bit of - a little bit of an uptick in the following quarter. But nothing structural there, I think yes, there is some of that is definitely from the Verizon assets, absolutely. And so, overtime I think that we feel comfortable with our 2 to 2.5 range. And, our objective would be to continue to really drive discipline in deal selection that over time, we'd hope to lower that range when the time is appropriate for us to do so. Keith Taylor : Hey John, on the second question, as it relates to the rating agencies, no surprise to you on the heels of working with S&P with the upgrade. We're working with the other to rating agencies. I think continuing to have a strong strategic performance like we're having. Our leverage going down again, our commitment to use both debt and equity as we fund the business going forward and having a levered ratio of 3.6. No surprise to you both other rating agencies upgraded as one to one notch below investment grade with a positive outlook. So I remain meaningfully optimistic that we will get that second investment grade rating over the not too distant future. But again, it's not up to us to decide we're going to do all the things that we need to do as a business to make sure we put ourselves in good stead. And we're going to focus on getting that second rating. But again, we're doing as you would expect and working hard with the rating agencies to continue to share with them why we believe we should be investment grade. John Hodulik : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : The last question comes from Frank Louthan from Raymond James. Your line is open. Frank Louthan : Great, thank you very much. A quick question about the JV, just the - sorry for the background noise. Quick question on the JV for two things. First, how important is that to have multiple partners they are you seeking multiple partners from the JV? And then, secondly, talking about the balance sheet and the leverage, how important is the JV structure to helping with the balance sheet? Charles Meyers : Frank, I'll let - we can tag team this, one I'm glad to see your dog's excitement about our results. Frank Louthan : Fired up. Charles Meyers : But I think that the - I forgot your question. Keith Taylor : Number of partners. Frank Louthan : [indiscernible] came value to the call here. Charles Meyers : No problem. I think that right now, we're really focused on getting this initial transaction done. We have talked about the fact that we could have multiple partners over time at the same time, we would be happy to embrace more comprehensively global partners where we can. There's some efficiency and effectiveness in doing that. So I think it will really depend on kind of where we land on this one and we'll evaluate each of the markets distinctly. Keith Taylor : And as it relates to the second question, Frank, I think it's important to understand that part of the reason we really wanted to push it off balance sheet and have a more minority interest was to so we didn't consolidate. And although as we said earlier on, the return profile for Equinix and return on equity on an IRR basis is very, very attractive as it is also for our partner. We want to make sure that we can hold that that debt off the book. And so what will typically happen the rating agencies will look through into the JV structure and they'll allocate on a pro rata basis, the amount of leverage that sits in the JV to the parent company. Again, it's important for a couple reasons again. We care about our balance sheet and our core metrics. But the other part is having the JV in this partnership arrangement, as Charles alluded to, with one or potential more partners allows us to get capital back in, we get to recycle that capital, put it back into the business as appropriate. And then there's a fee stream associated with it. So it gives us the opportunity to continue to focus our cash and our energy on the retail business at the same time increasing strategic value by having it off balance sheet with our partners. Frank Louthan : Okay, great. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Katrina Rymill : Great. That concludes our Q1 call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : That does conclude today's call.

Charles Meyers : Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As you can see in our results, we continue to enjoy significant momentum in our business. Our ability to deliver distinctive and durable value for our customers as they pursue their digital transformation agenda is feeling strong bookings performance and accelerated new logo capture. Our platform continues to be highly differentiated due to our superior global reach, vast operating scale and the power of our interconnection platform, separating us from other data center providers and positioning us as the trusted center of the cloud first world. We continue to execute well against our strategy, achieving our second best gross bookings quarter with incremental deals for more than 3,000 of our customers and strong cross-border bookings driven largely by the Americas team. We achieved our 66 consecutive quarter of revenue growth, tops among S&P 500 companies, and we now serve more than half of the Fortune 500. With a record number of Fortune 500 and Global 2000 prospects, still in the pipeline. The diversity, volume and velocity of our selling engine continues to shine. Generating over 4,000 deals in the quarter, with the majority comprised of small to mid-sized multi metro deals, reflecting the tremendous health of our interconnection centric retail business and foreshadowing future land and expand opportunities, as these customers use Equinix as the nexus for implementing their hybrid and multicloud aspirations. Our global reach continues to fuel our top-line with revenue from customers deployed across all three regions ticking up to 61% and multi-region revenues at 73%. We saw substantial progress against the six priorities I outlined at the start of the year, including evolving our portfolio of products, expanding our go-to-market engine including channel and delivering on our hyperscale strategy. We signed our first hyperscale JV a greater than $1 billion deal with GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund targeting development projects across Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Paris to serve the unique core workload deployments for a targeted group of hyperscale companies. And we continue to expand our global platform with 30 projects underway including 5x scaler builds and Q2 openings in all three regions, including Chicago, Madrid, Osaka, Perth, Seattle, Sofia, and Tokyo. Digital transformation continues to be a top priority for our customers in a variety of key trends are making them think differently about their infrastructure. We are responding to this changing demand by both investing across our traditional strengths and layering in incremental capabilities. We are expanding our data center footprint enhancing our market-leading interconnection platform and have now launched the first offering in our planned and services portfolio. Positioning Equinix as an easier to use, more valuable and more accessible platform and driving attach rates that will help us sustain and enhanced cabinet yields over the coming years. Turning to the quarter. As depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q2 were $1.385 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 12% year-over-year and AFFO was meaningfully ahead of our expectations due to strong operating performance. Our interconnection platform continues to perform well, once again, outpacing collocation revenues growing 13% year-over-year, as our ecosystems continue to scale. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. We now have 348,000 interconnections over four-times more than the next closest competitor. In Q2, we added an incremental 7,000 interconnections with strong growth in virtual connections. For our Internet exchange platform, we are seeing strength in the APAC and EMEA markets with IX provision capacity up 30% year-over-year. ECX Fabric, our SDN-enabled interconnection service now has over 1600 customers. We are seeing increasing adoption of ECX for new use cases, including a diversification of ICX end destinations and more frictionless hybrid multicloud deployments enabled by API level integration between ECX and market-leading cloud and network providers. In Q2, we also launched Network Edge services and NFV offer that provides enterprises a faster, easier and more efficient way to deploy virtual network services at Equinix, as we extend our portfolio of interconnection offerings. Customers can choose virtualized services such as routers, firewalls and load balancers from industry leading partners, including Cisco, Juniper and Palo Alto Networks. Early customer response has been great. We have a healthy pipeline ahead and we are working to build out the service offering with additional partners and locations over the coming quarters. Now let me cover some highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical experienced solid bookings led by growth in EMEA and strong resale activity from our top global network partners. We also continue to deepen our network density, with over 1800 networks now available on Platform Equinix, including every network provider in the Fortune 500 and 90% of those in the Global 2000. New wins included a Chinese telecom provider serving 40% of China's Internet users and Wander, a U.S. regional ISP deploying infrastructure to launch wireless services for West Coast residential customers. Our Financial Services vertical achieved record bookings led by capital Markets, banking and insurance sub segments, as firms embrace digital transformation. Expansions included a key win with CME Group, a top three global exchange, re-architecting their network and securely connecting to ecosystem partners and Hannover Life Reassurance, a top five global insurer deploying infrastructure and connecting to ECX Fabric. The Content & Digital Media vertical produced solid bookings led by the Americas and strong growth in gaming and publishing sub-segments. Expansion wins included Akamai, a top content distributor extending coverage and scale and supporting existing security solutions. And Zynga a leading mobile gaming developer expanding across Platform Equinix to support enterprise IT. Our Cloud & IT vertical captured record bookings led by the APAC region and the infrastructure in services sub-segments. Equinix continues to be the leading solution for cloud connectivity today, with over 40% of all cloud on-ramps from the top cloud service providers in our IBX's across our metros. Expansions this quarter included a Fortune 75 technology company hosting unified communication services and service now, expanding its footprint to support its rapidly growing customer base. Our enterprise vertical experienced diversified growth with particular strength in travel, legal and healthcare sub-segments. New wins included a global build and operator of toll roads enabling IoT smart transportation systems and Tapestry Premium, a leading fashion brand, implementing a multi-cloud strategy as well as expansions, with the top three food services company re-architecting their network to enable data access and analytics. Our channel business had another great quarter with broad-based strength driving over 25% of bookings and accounting for 60% of our new logos, as we deepen our engagement with high priority partners to significantly amplify our go-to-market reach. We are focusing our efforts and driving more productivity and joint offer creation across our reseller and alliance partners, which include Amazon, AT&T, Microsoft, Oracle, Orange, Telstra, Verizon and WWT. New channel win this quarter included a win with Telstra for Genomics England solving for cloud connectivity to increase computing, storage and resiliency. Now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Keith Taylor : Great. And thanks, Charles. And good afternoon to everyone. While after a very strong Q4 to enter the year, followed by our best ever first quarter, it's great to now discuss the continued momentum we see in the business has reflected in our Q2 results. We had better than expected gross and net bookings in the quarter, including strong cross-border activity in addition to healthy core operating metrics. This is simply another positive indication that our strategy is bearing fruit as Platform Equinix continues to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. As a result, we are raising 2019 guidance across the board including a substantial raise in our key AFFO and AFFO per share metrics due to better than expected revenue performance and improved operating leverage in the business. And as you might expect, we are delighted to have received our second investment grade - investment grade credit rating from Fitch, a clear recognition of our efforts to improve our debt leverage and liquidity position. Also this quarter, we are very excited to announce our hyperscale JV partnership with GIC. This joint venture will provide us the opportunity to make significant capital investments to capture targeted and strategic large footprint deployments, while maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet. Upon closing of the joint venture, we expect to receive net cash proceeds from the sale of our London 10 and Paris 8 IBXs and other development properties, as well as other proceeds related to the reimbursement of net cost incurred and fees earned from the joint venture. We are delighted to be partnering with GIC and we will continue to work hard to close the transaction in Q3. Now let me cover the quarterly highlights. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and a constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q2 revenues were $1.385 billion, up 10% over the same quarter last year, reflecting better-than-expected recurring revenues and lower than expected non-recurring revenues due in part to the mix of small and medium-sized deals closed in the quarter. As we have stated before, NRR activity is inherently lumpy. We expect NRR as a percent of revenues to decrease modestly from current levels for the second half of 2019 consistent with our comments on the prior earnings call. Global Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $677 million, up 12% over the same quarter last year and better than our expectations, largely due to strong recurring revenue performance and timing of certain costs incurred. Over the second half of the year despite the increased adjusted EBITDA guidance, we expect it to continue to invest in our growth and scaling initiatives, which includes expansion drag related to new markets and leases, while it also incurring higher utility spend across the platform. Global Q2 AFFO was $498 million, a 14% increase over the same quarter last year, largely due to strong operating flow through and lower net interest expense. Recurring capital expenditures increased $16 million over the prior quarter as planned. Q2 global MRR churn was 2.4% better than expected. We expect MRR churn to remain within our guided range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter over the remainder of the year. Now turning to regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC and EMEA were the fastest MRR growing regions at 17% and 13% respectively on a year-over-year normalized basis, followed by the Americas region at 5%. The Americas region saw continued momentum, including strong net bookings, solid pricing, as reflected in our MRR per cabinet metric and a high mix of small deals including a healthy level of cross-border activity. It's fair to say the Americas region fully embraces the global platform vision and remains a strong source of deal flow for the other two regions. Our EMEA region had another very strong quarter, led by our UK and Dutch businesses. We saw robust increase in billable cabinets and interconnections. As you are aware, we have been opening meaningfully new capacity across our flap and emerging markets and nicely consuming this inventory. We opened new capacity in London, Madrid and Sofia this past quarter. And Asia Pacific region delivered solid bookings across the region, mostly driven by small to medium-sized deals led by our Singapore and Australia businesses. And we booked our first deal into our soon to open sole IBX. And now looking at the capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our unrestricted cash balance is approximately $1.6 billion, flat over the last quarter, as the operating cash flow and proceeds from the ATM program were offset by higher capital expenditures, debt repayment and our quarterly cash dividend. Our balance sheet and liquidity position continues to create a strategic advantage for us. Our net debt leverage ratio dropped to 3.4-times at Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA, well within our targeted range. Our strategic strength, lower debt leverage, increased asset ownership and a commitment to use both debt and equity to fund our future growth, drove our second investment grade rating from Fitch and establish us as a full-fledged investment grade rated company. Reaching this milestone ensures that we have market access to a deeper pool of investors at a lower cost of capital and provides a greater set of immunity to the macroeconomic environment we now operate in. We also expect to drive substantial interest rate savings into the business over the next few years, both as we refinance our current outstanding debt load and as we borrow new incremental funds to invest in our future growth initiatives. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $444 million including recurring CapEx of $37 million. We opened seven new builds, including two new IBXs, one in Sofia and the other in Tokyo. For the quarter, we added 3300 cabinets to our available inventory and we continue to purchase land for future expansion. This quarter we acquired land for development in Madrid. Lastly, revenues from owned assets remained at 55%. And our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our 138 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, an improvement over the prior quarter. Our stabilized asset count increased by net four IBXs, as we are now including the applicable Metronode assets in our stabilized account. The stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and now generate a 30% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. Finally, refer to Slides 11 through 15 for updated summary of 2019 guidance and bridges. Please note that quarter-over-quarter growth rates for both revenues and adjusted EBITDA are now updated to include the expected impact of the hyperscale joint venture closing in the third quarter and certain other one-time adjustments, as shown in our earnings deck. For the full year 2019, after absorbing a $7 million reduction in revenue attributed to the sale of our IBXs to the EMEA hyperscale JV, we're raising revenue guidance by $10 million and our adjusted EBITDA guidance by $15 million, primarily due to strong operating performance in the business. This guidance applies a revenue - implies a revenue growth rate of 9% year-over-year and a healthy adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 48%. Also we are reducing our 2019 integration cost to $11 million, a $2 million reduction. And given the operating momentum of the business, we continuing to improve our AFFO and our AFFO per share metrics. After absorbing a net $5 million reduction in AFFO from the sale of our IBXs to the joint venture, we're raising our 2019 AFFO by $25 million, a growth rate between 13% and 14% compared to the previous year, largely due to strong adjusted EBITDA performance and a lower net interest expense. AFFO per share is expected to grow between 8% and 9%, which includes the dilutive impact from both our ATM program and the prior equity raise. We have assumed a weighted average 84.6 million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. And we expect 2019 cash dividends to now increase to approximately $825 million, a 13% increase over the prior year and reflects an 8% increase year-over-year on a per share basis. So with that, I'm going to stop here and turn the call back to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks Keith. In closing, we're delighted with the performance of the business and we continue to execute with focus and urgency against our priorities. We see a large and expanding market opportunity and believe we are uniquely positioned to capture this opportunity, as customers embrace digital transformation and adopt hybrid and multi-cloud as their architecture of choice. We remain confident that the reach and scale of our global platform, the breadth of our ecosystems, the strength of our interconnection portfolio and the depth of our balance sheet will allow us to further extend our market leadership. We are continuing to scale our go-to-market engine and will maintain our focus on operating leverage, balancing margin expansion with additional investment in developing innovative new services and curating a robust partner ecosystem that will help us drive top-line growth and sustain our industry-leading return on capital. We remain firmly focused on building a company that attracts, inspires and develops the best talent in our industry, delivering distinctive and durable value to our customers and sustainable long-term value creation to our shareholders. Bottom line, the Company is executing well on a highly differentiated strategy to become the trusted center of the cloud-first world. We're excited about the road ahead and look forward to sharing our continued progress. Let me stop there and open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Philip Cusick : Let's talk about the company sort of potential to grow either organically or inorganically from here. Outside of price, what are the important strategic characteristics that drive your decision to do acquisitions from here? And are there significant holes left in the portfolio? You've moved into South Korea in the last year, what else is left that you really need to do? Thank you. Charles Meyers : Sure. Phil, I'll start and Keith can add on as needed. Look, I mean, we definitely think there are substantial remaining growth opportunities for the business both organically and non-organically. I think in particular, I think, I'd focus on the organic side, which is the - our customers are responding exceptionally well to our value proposition, we're seeing strong bookings growth, new logo capture and really strong land and expand activity with those customers. So, we're going to continue to focus on that as our primary growth factor. That said, I do think that there are, we've said it on multiple occasions, we think M&A is still a tool in the toolkit for us. We have said that we think there are gaps in the platform in terms of our opportunities to expanded and add to our market leadership in terms of global reach. We've talked specifically about a couple of opportunities areas, where our customers are asking us about our future plans. Those include India. Eventually I think they include the African continent for us, and probably another - other select opportunities, including potentially Mexico as an opportunity for us south of the border here. And so I think there, as you said, well there is - we'll have to look at those carefully in terms of understanding the price for those assets that might be available and we'll be disciplined about that, but I do think that those represent an opportunity for us for growth. Keith Taylor : Phil I've just said, what I'd add on just to what Charles said is, there's two other things it's certainly come to the top of my mind, it's new products and services. And Charles alluded to NFP as one example of a new service that we're going to deliver, but we're going to continue to invest around product and service offerings and think of that is a potential for growth. Certainly continuing to invest in included that is the hyperscale initiative, albeit it's going to be in the JV in the majority of that, the growth at least on a cash flow basis would come below the line. And then the last thing that sort of you feel it today's for certain given the macro environment, we're operating in and with the strength of the U.S. dollar as a reminder, 60% of the business in rough numbers is outside of the U.S. and we've got a, with a strong dollar policy and soon to be maybe a weaker U.S. dollar policy on a go-forward basis. There is an opportunity on a currency basis, as our hedges flush out that I would provide an element of growth, whether it's the Brexit - no matter how we think about Brexit and the implications of that and how that's affected our revenue base out of the UK to other markets in Europe and beyond. So, I think there is a lot of opportunity for growth in addition to what Charles has alluded to. Philip Cusick : That's really interesting on the currency side. if I can follow-up once, should we think of new capabilities is a sort of relatively small tuck-on acquisitions to really drive the internal knowledge of the company? Or do you think of bigger service acquisitions as possible? Thank you. Charles Meyers : Well, I think that in terms of our edge services portfolio, which is probably, we're going to continue to grow the interconnection portfolio in terms of reach in services and feature function and then the edge services portfolio. The first one off the line so to speak, is the Network Edge, which is a little bit of a blend between interconnection and these edge services. But I think that we are going to, we probably will look at augmenting our capabilities, potentially through targeted M&A, but I think that we'll be looking at a lot of organic development in that portfolio initially. And over time, we'll have to determine, whether or not that warrants a more aggressive posture there from the services addition standpoint. Operator : Our next question comes from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ari Klein : It sounds like you're seeing some better momentum in the Americas. Can you talk a little bit about that market, what are you seeing there and how you kind of expect that growth rate to maybe improve over the next few quarters? Charles Meyers : Sure. Yes, I think what you know the Americas business for us continues to be an exceptional attractive business, its size, the profitability of that business. If you look at it from a MRR per cab standpoint at almost $20 for a cab. It's really an exceptional business, large number of customers and really good traction from the selling team, not only selling our capacity local to that market, but as a huge outbound engine for the rest of the world. And so, we're super pleased with the performance of the business. It is growing at a rate that's probably roughly in line with the broader retail colocation market. But in some respects, I think that's a bit of an unfair comparison, because we are - what I would say is our real addressable market is, the market opportunity for colocation services that deliver a 30% cash-on-cash yield. And I'll tell you our share in that business is substantially higher than then it's a vary to the high share and in terms of being able to grow that business at market rate is, I think an impressive accomplishment. So, we still are seeing a little bit of headwinds from the tail of churn in Verizon assets in particular, we talked about that, it just continues to take a little bit longer to come out than we had anticipated. Again net-net, that's a good thing, but it does create some a little bit of headwind in that business. But yes, we see good success. And I think now, as we add new services like Network Edge and some of the other things, I think we're going to continue to have the opportunity to sustain that business in a very positive way. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Your line is open. Jon Petersen : I wanted to talk about the GIC joint venture in Europe. You guys have been a little bit coy about the details. I think towards the end in Keith remarks you said is about a $5 million net impact to AFFO for the balance of the year. But I'm hoping you can maybe give us just a little more details on what we should expect for the balance of the year and then kind of the growth of that JV over the next couple of years. Keith Taylor : Sure. Jon, let me start off, I just want to make sure there's a clarifying comment. So, when we talk about the $5 million impact, that is basically from us selling the assets to the JV, so we're reducing our AFFO by $5 million because of that. That all said, as you're all aware, we are going to close the transaction in Q3 and we'll certainly update you on the next earnings call with all the specific details. But suffice it to say, there is a number of things that are going to happen and the first thing that's going to be important for everybody note, is the amount of cash proceeds that come back into the business, given the sale of our Paris or London 10 and Paris 8 assets. And again, we've said that we're going to get add market or better cap rate on basically the recovery of our cash flow. We're going to get reimbursement of fees, reimbursement of costs, but we're also going to get our stake our 20% equity interest in the joint venture. And so we're excited about that opportunity. We've announced the two assets that will go in to the stabilizers, potentially out of the gate for more, as we've highlighted in the earnings deck. But then we're going to be active elsewhere in the world. And we really want to be clear, this is not about getting into wholesale business. This is about us being very, very strategic by the decisions we make that would add value to the overall franchise on our platform. And so we'll be very transparent about the deals that we do. We will share with the market. But they're going to be - there's going to be a number of different JVs that will be established over the coming quarters and years that will give you a good sense of the momentum and that value will come in typically through the income from affiliated entities, which will be below the line. Some of the fees will be the fee income that we earn from the JV will be on the top-line. And again, it will be typically and typically on the top-line, but I will just be with the fee income. So, there's a lot of discussion still to be add here, the deals got to close, but we're very optimistic about the decisions we're making and we're delighted by I'll get out with our partner. I think they're going to be a great global partner for us that we will go to almost any market that choose to partner in. Jon Petersen : And then just maybe one follow-up. I'm curious about the decision you - I guess essentially bringing GIC as a development partner to kind of share in the development like through the whole process versus finding more of a takeout partner, where you can develop on your own balance sheet and then sell into a joint venture, once it's stabilized, which I assume would probably carry a lower cap rates. Just curious your thought process around how you wanted that capital to come in? Charles Meyers : Yes. I think first recognizing is the first two projects, which are stabilized, we're going to get full return for the investment decisions we've made, including all of the development profit associated with those assets. That's said on a go-forward basis, our decision is not to take what we think it is very dear capital and try and use that as a means to fund a low returning business. We think partnering with GIC, we're happy to share on those development profits because our focus is really on adding to the overall global platform, in the retail business and we're going to consume all the capital that we have in our balance sheet and more as we shared in the last Analyst Day on growing the retail business. So, this is about making a good decision, driving value into our shareholder base and at the same time augmenting, and I said - I've said on a number of - at a number of investment meetings, between the new services, which includes the hyperscale and the new interconnection services. We're not only sort of widening our mode, we're also deepening the mode around our business. And I think that's just a good use of our capital and let our partner participate with us and appropriate returns. We'll get outsized returns because the fee income that get attached to, to those levered returns. Operator : Our next question comes from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Colby Synesael : I just have two modeling questions actually. One is on the ATM the $348 million that you raised in the quarter, a bit surprised just considering you just done the equity raise the quarter before. Can you give us any color on expectations further range of this year to extent possible. And then secondly cabinet and cross connects they were down quarter-over-quarter and just taking into consideration the developments and how much you are building out, any color on what we can expect for both cross connects and talk about physical, cross connects and cabinets as we go into the back half of the year as well? Thank you. Keith Taylor : Why don't I take the first one, Colby and Charles will take the second. One on the ATM, we've always said that we would use it appropriately at the right time. And as a Company we knew what our funding needs where between now and the end of the year and as we looked into 2020 and we always felt that there would be a little - that always be a little bit of ATM that we take off the table at the right time and certainly with market conditions being as volatile as they were, I was doing this deal take using this ATM at roughly an average price of $485 a share. We thought it was the right thing to do. Having said that, in my prepared remarks, I really wanted to - I was trying to highlight our new ones that as we look forward a lot of our capital needs will come from debt. So, we want to make sure that we continue to balance that debt. The capital scores with debt and equity, but this was a unique opportunity because one, we knew that we could get to the market - the market. We've got a good price for to sell the equity for our shareholders. Yet at the same time, it also assured us of that second investment-grade rating. And so you saw the market reaction after that, it was very, very positive. And ultimately when I step back and now reflect on what we potentially could do to save from an interest perspective, we historically said, it could be $100 million, I believe today given market conditions and also because of that second investment grade rating that number can now be between $100 million, say $130 million, $140 million of cash interest savings over some period of time. And that's, what really excited us, it's making sure that we have the liquidity position, the strong balance sheet, we'll use the ATM sparingly, but on a go-forward basis. I would tell you - absent any M&A or any other sort of strategic thing, we would typically focus more on debt than anything else at this point. Charles Meyers : And then I will take the second one Colby. Relative to cabinets, we feel very good about the momentum in the business. We've always said that sort of cab adds is one that can be a little lumpy in depending on timing and various other factors and so. We really encourage folks to look at sort of rolling four quarter average as sort of an indication the health of our ability to translate capacity into sort of utilized and billable cabinets. And when you look at that we think that the trajectory across all three regions continues to be very strong. And again we have added a lot of capacity. It is also it is important to note that we're doing that with a very attractive deal mix. And so large deals are a way to add a lot of cabinets, there's just not a way to add as much value. And so, I think what you're seeing is shifting in our mix and is still being able to deliver the cabinet additions that we think are appropriate and attractive by doing that at much higher returns. And so we feel good about that overall and again, we encourage you to really look primarily at the rolling four quarter average as the primary metric. And then relative to interconnection and cross connect - physical cross connects in particular. Solid quarter we were sort of right at the bottom end of our range. I do think that we\u2019re seeing a little bit of the continued 10 to 100 Gig migration sort of impacts in terms of slowing that down a little bit, but gross adds continue to be very strong. And when you combine that and you look at then you add in the virtual I think you're seeing a number that looks very good. And recognize that both of them are very important to us and actually with very similar economics. We talked about that previously, which is our ARPU and return profile on virtual interconnection is actually every bit as good as physical. And so it's a matter of just the customers choosing a - different tools for different jobs, so to speak. And so I do think that we're going to see. I think - we kind of stick by our prior views on the sort of evolution of 10 to 100 Gig migration flattening out at the end of this year. And we think that will represent some upside in the Americas as we go into next year. So interconnection overall, we feel great about 13% year-over-year growth. I think we're seeing some improvements in pricing globally and again strong performance on the platform overall. Operator : Our next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Your line is open. Frank Louthan : Can you comment a little bit on the Americas business and what you're seeing in pricing, particularly in Northern Virginia and then I have a follow-up? Charles Meyers : Sure yes, I think that revolves around the, some of the others who have reported some of the challenges in Northern Virginia, which I think revolve primarily around the hyperscale business and large footprint capacity and sort of the supply-demand dynamics of that business. I think that as we've said in the past, we're kind of taking a pass on playing in that market relative to hyperscale in Northern Virginia. Instead, we\u2019re kind of the center of that universe relative to interconnection and relative to sort of the overall ecosystem in that market, which again continues to be the largest teller market in the world and so. So I think there is going to be, I think there is some sorting out at the hyperscale side is impacting pricing, but it's not really having significant effect on our business there, which we continue to see strong levels of interconnection, good solid cabinet yields in pricing and feel like we really play out a differentiated position there in terms of the center of that ecosystem. Frank Louthan : I believe you will raise pricing in Europe earlier in the year, was that pretty much - if those price - increase is pretty much played out - the quarter is anymore to bleed in to impact the back half? Charles Meyers : Now they're going to bleed in actually over a long period of time. We took a very measured approach in terms of how we wanted to go about normalizing those to what we thought were appropriate market rates. And we did that for a variety of reasons because we really value the long-term relationship with the customers who want to do that in a way that is measured. But we also want to make sure that we're getting a fair return on what we think is an exceptionally high value service. And so, the way we've done that as we've rolled them in at renewals typically. And so, they're coming in as - and we've already changed the price on new adds. And so, those will begin to obviously to have an impact. And then others will roll in and renewals over the coming quarters and years. So, it will be a bit of a slow growth there, but we think it will have a positive impact and sort of ongoing lift in that business. Frank Louthan : Any competitive reaction from that? Charles Meyers : No I think, well I think that, what we've seen is that there is general stability in that market in terms of people delivering. I think there has been some upward lift in the overall market pricing. And so, and again I think that's a reflection of the value delivered to the customer and so. So overall, it seems to be going well. Operator : Next we will hear from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead. Tim Horan : Well, thanks guys. The 40% of all cloud on ramps could you just elaborate on that a little bit, what do you mean by that. And do you think that's been growing as a percentage of share and will platform Equinix is that designed to capture more of those on ramps broadly speaking? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Yes, it's a great question. We will - I don't know that will continue to grow share on the - on-ramps because I think that we - most of the providers are looking for some level of redundancy and they're looking for often times multiple on-ramps in a market. They've very frequently led with us. And so that is why I think we jumped out with a very large share position. And so, I think we can continue to grow with them. And as our geographic footprint expands, hopefully continue to maintain very, very high market share ratings there. If you look at it in terms of a coverage - from a coverage standpoint in the markets in which we operate, we have a 70% coverage of on-ramps with the - largest cloud service providers and 40% share overall. So it's going to continue to be an area of focus for us. We think that the combination of us being able to continue to invest in sort of the retail-centric portions of our hyperscale relationships with Equinix. And focus our balance sheet firepower on that. And then being able to leverage the strength of our X scale JV with GIC to pursue the large footprint is really absolutely spot on and the right strategy for us. And we think we're going to continue to play a very differentiated position in the overall cloud ecosystem. Tim Horan : And can you add many new products to platform Equinix and I guess, can it be like a material business for you? Charles Meyers : Yes and yes, I think that the edge services portfolio that we're looking at I think network edge services is absolutely capable of being a meaningful contributor to the topline over a period of years and as we look at other augmentations to our edge services portfolio. I think, we absolutely think those can be meaningful additions. And we think that they can come at attach rates strong attach rates and low cost to sale that we think will prove out to be very, very attractive economics. And will be able - to allow us to sustain return on invested capital at our market leading rates. Operator : Our next question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simon Flannery : I think and Keith you talked about on the EBITDA, some delayed spend, can you just give us a little bit more color around that. And then, just coming back to your comment on the currencies, can you just remind us of the hedges that you have right now and what the remaining term - do you have any hedges that extend deep into 20 or is it pretty much say 6, 9 months left on the existing hedges? Thanks. Keith Taylor : I think as it relates to EBITDA, and when we talk about delayed spend. Again as a company as you recognize, we've been able to increase our EBITDA guidance this year relative to the beginning of the year, roughly $45 million and $70 million at AFFO line. And part of that of course is timing and timing relates to things that we talked about at the outset when we highlighted some of the areas that we - expose the P&L to this year, it was about expansion growth at a rate that we've never seen before. Through the second half of the year, you're going to see some of those costs come in whether Seoul or Hong Kong, Singapore, where we're making substantial investments for future opportunity and those costs will run through the P&L. Now our affect is by roughly $7 million through the second half of the year incrementally. And then utility spend as we've said, utilities are going up and we felt it. We've experienced a lot of it both from a pricing perspective and a consumption perspective, and that's going to hit us by roughly another $7 million. So there's $14 million of costs that we anticipate at least we've embedded into our guidance that reflect that outcome. As it relates then to just currency, we hedge out typically over eight quarters. And as you can see in the stated guidance that we delivered with our press release, you can see that we breakdown our - what I call the blended rates. So not only the spot, but also the hedge rate and right now with the euro is roughly at 111 and we're hedged out at 117. Pound is trading at 121 and we're hedged at 134. And so it just gives you a sense, and I'm sorry let me size that for you. The euro is roughly 20% of our revenues and pound is 9% of our revenues. And one of the things that was really telling to me so, we've got a good hedge position. Of course, those will fall off over again in the next 6 to 8 quarters and we'll continue - to feather in future hedges and sort of smooth the impact of the currency movement. But the thing that was very telling to me is, if you think about the UK sterling alone and from pre-Brexit, sorry pre-Brexit to where we are today. The rate differential is roughly, it was 160 when dollars to the pound and today it\u2019s roughly 120. So there is a $0.40 movement and we have $500 million roughly 9% of our revenues are $500 million just for that - for the pound to go back to its level of pre-Brexit. I mean that's roughly $170 million to us on the topline. And so, you get a sense of how substantial those currency movements have been and the impact that we've absorbed in the business over this relatively short period of time. So we're optimistic as things get back to normal, one day whenever that one day will be. So it's hard to imagine anytime soon. You're going to see the benefit that will accrete to this business because of our diversified portfolio with a lot of growth occurring in markets outside of the U.S. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Your line is open. Michael Rollins : Just thinking back a little over a year ago, you provided some long-term financial goals. And you now had a little more than a year of operating results and progress. And I'm curious how you see future performance relative to some of those annual goals, including the revenue target of 8% to 10% annually? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Yes, Mike I think relative to our Analyst Day - what we talked about at our Analyst Day last June we continue to feel good about that. And I think that we've delivered in retrospect over the past year, plus in strong fashion relative to those expectations. And so, and I think the results today show another step in that direction. So again, I think our business is performing very well. I think we're comfortable with kind of what we had laid out there. We think there is a huge opportunity for us. We think the addressable market is actually expanding. We think we are actually adding to it by continuing to deliver new and incremental services on top of what we're already doing. And so yes, we feel good about what we articulated. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura's Instinet. Your line is open. Jeff Kvaal : Yes, thank you very much. I'd like to follow up on Mike's question a little bit it sounded as though in your prepared remarks that your sort of organic growth is in the 3% range. And it also sounded as though your intention over time is maybe to lean, a little bit more on organic and inorganic for growth. So I guess if organic is only growing at 3% of that 8% to 10% growth rate. Are you suggesting that the organic growth should pick up a little bit with some of these new products or how should we think about that? Charles Meyers : I think you're referencing, our stabilized asset growth at 3%. But our combined growth is much higher number. So, I think our organic growth - again we're comfortable in that in the range that we just had articulated. So, I think in fact, we just delivered a quarter that was 9% year-over-year. And so - that we feel very comfortable that the organic growth can sustain in the range that we had articulated. Jeff Kvaal : Okay, so ongoing CapEx that makes sense? Keith Taylor : Yes and Jeff just to be fair, I mean we have stated over a five-year period when we delivered our guidance to our investors at the June 18 Analyst Day. We said over the next five years, you should expect growth to be in eight - and this is what I call non-acquisition growth 8% to 10% on a normalized basis, normalized for currency movements and the like over that five-year period. And that was in our CAGR it would be play in that range depending on inventory development and timing of builds and the like that. We feel, 8% to 10% is a reasonable expectation from that 2018 through 2022. Jeff Kvaal : And then on follow-up, I think Charles, you talked a little bit about being resilient to the macro, it's been quite a while since there has been a bit of a down turn in some respects. And I'm wondering if you can sort of help us understand how your business has played in prior downcycles or how the business is different now from prior downcycles? Charles Meyers : Well, again, I think our history in terms of our performance during downcycles has been very, very good. And so I think that - and I think the importance of the infrastructure that we provide to our customers in terms of how they operate their business I think makes it quite resilient. I think that's particularly true as you look at how they use us in terms of thinking through things like the priorities for our customers like when we architecture, which is a way of improving the performance of their business, but also taking cost out. And so, and as they implement hybrid and multi-cloud as a way to stretch their CapEx dollars and drive application performance those are things that we think are going to be very, very resistant to sort of fluctuations or macroeconomic conditions. So again, we feel good about the strength of our business, and I believe it will be very resilient through the macroeconomic cycles. Keith Taylor : Jeff, let me just add one other a couple of a quick comments. First and foremost as Charles said, we love the fact that we can be resilient and we've historically thrived in periods of economic turmoil and yes, we can sort of influence how the market reacts and so at times and values at start, we certainly can take advantage of the opportunities and we've done that over the years. The other part that I think we really tried to highlight that today being an investment grade rated company but understanding that we have $1.6 billion of cash on our balance sheet, we have an unused line of credit of $2 billion. We are generating AFFO of $1.9 billion a year that and we said we think you can grow from - it can grow meaningfully over that five-year period. Our leverage is 3.4 times. We've just partnered with GIC for our hyperscale initiative. And our payout ratio over an extended period of time, it's going to be in the mid to sort of low to mid 40s. And so that gives us a lot of strategic flexibility as a Company and the extent thing we have to pull back. We're absolutely weak. We've always felt we can push and pull levers as needed whether it's the operating spend or the capital spend. So we have a lot of comfort in who we are and what we're doing and as we said in the prepared remarks, we think we're strategically advantage relative to anybody else in our space. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Nick Del Deo : First, as we think about the new products and services that you're introducing or planning to introduce, are there boundaries we should consider regarding how far you're willing to push out, for example limit in terms of your willingness to hardware that customers consume virtually or services that may compete with customers, things of that nature? Charles Meyers : Yes, what I would say is I think that we view ourselves really as an infrastructure company and I think, but I do think the ways people think about consuming infrastructure is changing and I think we have to adapt to those changing market needs and be willing to adapt the how we deliver our underlying value proposition, which is centered around global reach, ecosystem and access, interconnection and service excellence. And so I think that we will - we are probably not likely to go way up the stack. I think we are very comfortable being an infrastructure provider that is an enabler to other people sort of broader digital transformation aspirations. We believe we unlock ecosystem value by combining our infrastructure value proposition with sort of higher layer value propositions of our partners, and I think that's proving out every day whether those be partnerships that we have with the likes of our network service provider partners or the hyperscalers themselves or other things that - we'll continue to look at further down the road. So I think that we're going to - we're not going to go too far away from what we believe we're really good at. But I also think that we certainly wouldn't shy away from things that are slightly different than what our traditional business has been, if that's what's needed to deliver the value proposition to our customers. So, and in terms of competitive overlap I do think that we are - we really believe that we need to continue to be that trusted partner. We have a - our business has been built on an ability to be a sort of a neutral provider that gave us people broad choice and access to a broad value proposition. And I think our strategy will still within reason need to stick to that underlying heritage. Nick Del Deo : And then I was hoping to get a few more details on xScale, how do you determine what deployments going to xScale versus what goes into Equinix. A material amount of your current leasing shift index scale and how tight or lose the exclusivity component of the agreement with the GIC? Charles Meyers : Yes, let me take some of them and Keith can add on as needed. But really, there is a pretty distinct difference typically in terms of a very large multi-megawatt footprint and the requirements of that for hyperscalers as they look at availabilities zone type of deployments. And they look very different than a typical either sort of on-ramp platform or network node. And so most of that business I think on a very large side of that, we will try to direct to the xScale facilities and so because we think that's a better way to allocate our capital. And so there - there are mechanisms in place for us to evaluate that and again if we have availability of capacity in an xScale environment to take on those very large footprint we would prefer to do that just because that provides better returns overall. Nick Del Deo : Just a follow real quick. My understanding was willing to take some larger deployments in your European footprint, you're saying that what xScale is targeting is even larger than what you've done there historically? Charles Meyers : Well, as you look at what we did in London 10 for example that was exactly that type of footprint and it was in a hybrid facility and that now that facility is being sort of recap, being sold to the JV. And so, yes, we were doing some of those, I mean, I do think that there are - we talked a little bit that this I neither last - is the prior earnings call or last one, or the one before that. But we've been - we selectively done some of that in our hybrid facilities in Europe. I think our preference would be to do that in the xScale data centers. That has to say it's out of the question the dynamics of the market, either from a capacity or availability standpoint would preclude us from doing something different. But given our druthers, we would prefer to move that capacity into the xScale JV. Nick Del Deo : Okay. And then regarding the exclusivity component? Keith Taylor : Yes, so on exclusivity and other parties exclusive to the other, but there is a lot of compelling reasons that we want to partner for allowing the extended period with each other and again there is the flexibility that we choose to do something that they are not interested in. Then, we can go do it ourselves or they can go do something their selves. But overall, we have to be careful there is no competitive tension in the markets that we operate in. And that's sort of the understanding of the parties that we're not going to compete against each other in market, but there are - there could be markets where again one of the other chooses to be in. And the other is not interested. Operator : Our next question comes from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Your line is open. Erik Rasmussen : And maybe just continue with xScale. How should we think about the particulars of the xScale opportunity, especially around capacity at full build out. I know you put out in the announcement is - what do you expect the capacity of would be, but and then just a number of sites initially in relation to what was laid out at Analyst Day. Maybe just compare how that compares to what was laid out? Charles Meyers : Yes, I think it's very much the first step along the vision of what we painted at Analyst Day. So we continue to feel like that we can, I think that if you recall that slide from there, we were talking about larger number of markets and probably 500 megawatts, I think over time. Those are things that I think are absolutely doable through a series of joint ventures, and so obviously this one covers sort of four key markets that are really we think critical to the overall ecosystem. And as we add incremental JVs we think we'll add additional metros, and so, yes, I think the vision that we laid out is I think very, very accessible. If not, I think we can, it may even - we may even have the opportunity to grow. I think the overall collection of JVs for xScale to something that is better than that. We think there is a big opportunity there. We think we're going to operate at the sort of deep into the demand pull there and. And so I think this is a great first step for us and several more I'm sure to come in the not too distant future. Erik Rasmussen : And then maybe just related to that, one of the properties, that was I guess under committed and will be under development, would be in Amsterdam. And I guess it relates to what we've heard recently about the 12-month moratorium on data center construction, do you have any thoughts on the potential impact and what that might mean for this project. And maybe just in relation to others. Charles Meyers : Yes, I mean we've - obviously the Amsterdam is a significant market for us. And in the sort of global scheme of things we've stayed very close to that. And the good news is that I think we have the runway on our projects that are already sort of grandfathered in and so we're going to have, I think plenty of capacity to keep things moving as we sort through that moratorium and I think we'll stay very close to that. But I also think that we're going to have the opportunity, as the market leader there to a really continue to serve that market. Well, and because we have so much already committed development to do. I think we're going to be well positioned as we go through that phase. Operator : We do have time for one more question. Our last question comes from Robert Gutman with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Robert Gutman : Yes, thanks for taking the question. Regarding the $12 million portion of the revenue guidance that raise attributed to outperformance, can you - with any more specificity to what is performing better than plan. We've talked about a lot of stuff in this call, but it's something is going faster than you thought it would. Is it, would you say it's Europe, would you say it services uptake. Is it the channel deals is it multi-region deal demand, would you highlight anything in particular that's pushing your head faster. Keith Taylor : So Robert I mean the 12 part of us just highlighting that is - that where we try to sort of give everybody an indication of where the strength is coming from us in the recurring element of our revenue stream. And now, it's important for us to highlight on the prepared remarks, number one, number two, when you look at our forward guide for Q3 is relatively modest to the overall guide for the second half of the year, which really is telling you that the momentum is going to come in the fourth quarter more so than that of the third quarter of based on some book-to-bill differentials and then there some one-off anomalies they're going through our results in Q3 from asset sales to how we get reimbursed for some costs with under a favorable tax ruling situation in Dallas. But overall, I mean there is momentum right across the portfolio across the platform and we're delighted with all three regions, and how they're performing and that was really what Charles alluded to earlier on today. Katrina Rymill : Great. That concludes our Q2 call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

[Operator Instructions].  At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We had our best-ever third quarter bookings, reflecting strong execution of our strategy and demonstrating our ability to deliver clear and quantifiable value to our customers as they pursue their digital transformation agenda. Our retail business continues to thrive, generating over 4,400 deals in the quarter across 3,100 customers, with the majority of our bookings comprised of small to midsized multi-metro deals, fueling one of the strongest interconnection quarters in our history. We're executing effectively on our commitment to unlock the power of Platform Equinix for our customers, expanding our geographic reach, enhancing our market-leading interconnection portfolio and responding to evolving customer needs with the launch of new and innovative edge services offerings. By focusing on driving enhanced operating leverage in the business, we're enabling investment across our traditional retail business, while layering in incremental capabilities, which together will drive higher attach rates, reduced churn and sustain and enhance cabinet yields over the coming years, allowing us to continue to deliver industry-leading returns. We are aggressively activating our channel, combining the value of Platform Equinix with partner solutions to accelerate our customer's journey to hybrid and multicloud as the clear architecture of choice. We outgrew the market globally with notable momentum in EMEA, and Equinix now holds the #1 position in 18 of the 25 countries in which we operate. And we continue to extend our global reach, announcing our plans to enter Mexico, the second largest economy in Latin America, with two new markets serving Mexico City and Monterey. In tandem with our strong operating performance, we're advancing a bold sustainability agenda with meaningful progress across environmental, social and governance aspects. We've made significant progress on our goal to use 100% clean and renewable energy for our data centers, with over 90% of our energy consumption today now covered by renewable sources.  We were recognized by the U.S. EPA for our leading Green Power use, ranking #4 on the EPA's National Top 100 Partners List, and receiving the Green Power Leadership Award for the third consecutive year, recognizing our contribution in advancing the development of the nation's voluntary Green Power market.  During the quarter, we also announced the addition of Sandra Rivera to our Board of Directors and the hiring of Justin Dustzadeh as our new CTO. We are thrilled to add their deep and diverse experience as world-class technology leaders as we continue to refine and expand our vision for the future of Platform Equinix. Turning to the quarter, as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q3 were $1.397 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 9% year-over-year, and AFFO was ahead of our expectations, including -- excluding FX and FX-related impacts.  Interconnection growth again outpaced colocation revenues, growing 13% year-over-year, driven by solid traction across all interconnection products and particularly strong momentum across our Cloud Exchange fabric. These growth rates are all in a normalized and constant currency basis.  In October, we closed our first hyperscale JV, a greater-than-$1 billion deal with GIC, the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund. This is a strategic milestone for Equinix, enhancing our ability to respond to the rapidly expanding needs of the world's largest cloud and hyperscale companies, while strengthening our leadership in the cloud ecosystem. We look forward to launching similar JVs in other operating regions and believe these efforts will continue to further differentiate Equinix as the trusted center of a cloud-first world. We now have over 356,000 interconnections, adding more per quarter than our top 10 competitors combined. In Q3, we added an incremental 8,500 interconnections, with high gross adds from both enterprise and network segments accompanied by lower-than-expected churn. We also surpassed 20,000 virtual connections, more than 5% of our overall count, and we expect these connections, which are dynamic and operationally efficient, to accelerate as customers leverage the capabilities on our SDN-enabled ECX Fabric. With over 1,800 customers now on ECX Fabric, we're seeing the strong ecosystem effects driven by expanding use cases, including WAN rearchitecture, distributed data, and rapid adoption of hybrid cloud across an increasingly rich range of cloud destinations.  We also saw a growth of our Internet exchange in the existing and new markets, with 27% year-over-year increase in IX provision capacity. Our newly launched Network Edge product is generating strong market interest with a robust pipeline. This offer provides enterprises a faster and more efficient way to deploy virtual network services at Equinix, including routers, firewalls and load balancers from their technology providers of choice, including Cisco, Juniper and Palo Alto Networks. Now let me cover highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical experienced record bookings, led by the major telcos subsegment and significant global MSP reseller activity as we partner with global providers to evolve their architectures and serve rapidly expanding enterprise demand.  New wins and expansions included Silica networks, a leading fiberoptic provider, optimizing network to support growing customer demand; and Telia, a Nordic provider extending coverage with regional edge deployments.  Our financial services vertical achieved robust bookings and strong new logo growth, with an uptick in the banking subsegment as firms continue to embrace digital transformation. Key new wins included Sterling Bancorp, rearchitecting the network to securely connect to partners, and a U.S. exchange startup, leveraging the depth and reach of our expansive electronic trading ecosystem. Our content and digital media vertical produced solid bookings, led by strong growth in publishing, advertising and video subsegments. New wins and expansions included a global social media firm upgrading infrastructure to support their growing product line as well as a leading global ad tech firm, transforming network topology to distribute and analyze data. Our cloud and IT vertical continues to over index with strength in the security subvertical as well as a strong increase in ECX Fabric participants as cloud consumers diversify towards hybrid and multicloud architectures. We continue to lead in cloud connectivity with over 3x as many metros with multicloud arm ramps as our nearest competitor.  Our enterprise vertical experienced diversified growth across professional services, retail as well as notable strength in government. New wins included PruittHealth, deploying on Platform Equinix to support its growing health care ecosystem; Steve Madden, rearchitecting network and connecting to multicloud to better enable digital business; the Myers-Briggs Company, optimizing network and interconnecting the business partners to support data management requirements; as well as further expansions from Walmart, deploying distributed infrastructure to support AI use cases.  And our channel team had another great quarter, accounting for more than 30% of bookings with 60% of this activity going into our enterprise vertical as we use the reach and relationship of our partners to efficiently expand our addressable market. We saw partner wins across all end-user types, including insurance, federal government, banking, public utilities and pharma, with network optimization and hybrid multicloud as a key use cases.  New channel wins this quarter included a multi-partner win with Presidio, F5, Microsoft and Oracle, for a large U.S. energy company supporting their data center consolidation and implementations of hybrid and multicloud access. Now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Keith Taylor : Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. Let me start my prepared remarks by saying we remain very pleased with the performance of our business and how Platform Equinix is differentiating us from others in our space. We continue to successfully scale the core business while simultaneously investing in our future, both as it relates to our operating structure and our new products and services. And we continue to invest in sustainability and diversity inclusion and belonging initiatives, 2 areas that are very dear to our communities, our customers and our employees. We had another solid quarter with our operating results consistent with our expectations, although impacted by FX and FX-related items.  From a booking's perspective, we had our best-ever Q3 gross bookings performance, including very attractive deal mix and strong pricing. Interconnection activity was very strong, both at the physical and the virtual level. We're making good progress across our new edge services. Again, we had net positive pricing actions this quarter. As a result, our MRR per cabinet metric remained firm both on an as-reported and FX-neutral basis. In early October, we closed our first hyperscale joint venture in EMEA, and transferred two of our operating assets into the JV, London 10 and Paris 8. As a result, the joint venture distributed a net $355 million of cash to Equinix, and we expect an additional \u20ac60 million over the next four quarters as certain contingent milestones are met. And we continue to expand our global platform with 28 projects underway across 21 metros and 16 different countries, another critical point of separation compared to other companies in our space.  Now let me cover the quarterly highlights. I note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q3 revenues were $1.397 billion, our 67th straight quarter of top line growth, up 8% over the same quarter last year, and at the midpoint in our guidance range on an FX-neutral basis. In the quarter, we experienced an unusually high level of FX volatility, largely derived from the Brexit implications to both the British pound and the euro. Also, the Brazilian real weakened considerably, a currency that is typically too expensive to hedge. And as previously guided, there were a number of one-off advance that impacted the quarter-over-quarter revenue step up, including lower tenant recoveries from a favorable tax decision in Q3 related to our Infomart Dallas asset and then lower-than-expected nonrecurring revenues. Q3 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included an $8 million negative FX impact due to the stronger U.S. dollar in the quarter when compared to the prior guidance rates. Global Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $675 million, up 9% over the same quarter last year despite higher seasonal utility cost and the expansion drag. Q3 adjusted EBITDA was better than expected, primarily due to lower maintenance costs. Q3 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, included a negative $4 million FX impact when compared to the prior guidance rates. Global Q3 AFFO was $473 million, an 18% increase over the same quarter last year, above our expectations on a constant currency basis, while still absorbing the higher-than-anticipated increase in our recurring CapEx. Also, AFFO, on an as-reported basis, absorbs a net $16 million higher-than-planned income tax expense, attributed to FX-related tax gains from our hedging program. Based on the current FX exchange rate through October, we expect a significant portion of this tax expense to reverse in Q4, and accordingly, has been reflected in our AFFO and AFFO per share guidance. Q3 Global MRR churn was 2.3%, consistent with our targeted range. For Q4, we expect MRR churn to remain in our guided range of 2% to 2.5%. Interconnection revenues increased significantly over the prior quarter with momentum in each of our regions. Interconnection revenues now represent greater than 17% of our recurring revenues, a significant quarter-over-quarter step up. Interconnection -- our interconnection portfolio grew at a healthy pace, driven by strong net adds from both the physical and the virtual connections, while also provisioning significant incremental port capacity. The Americas and EMEA interconnection revenue stepped up to 24% and 10% recurring revenues, respectively, while APAC was 14%. Turning to the regional highlights, which full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC and EMEA were our fastest MRR growing regions at 13% and 12%, respectively, on a year-over-year normalized basis, followed by the Americas region at 4%. The Americas region saw continued strong bookings with a high mix of small deals, healthy pricing and strong new logo adds. And Export Bookings to the other 2 regions continues to remain at a high as the Americas region does an excellent job of selling across our global platform. And a new federal segment had a stellar quarter, and we remain very excited about the potential opportunities we see across this customer set. Our EMEA region had another very strong quarter led by our German and French businesses, including strong network service provider activity. EMEA had a robust increase in billable cabinets, firm deal pricing, while experiencing its best ever net cross-connect adds in the quarter, and we opened up capacity in 3 new markets in EMEA : Helsinki, London and Stockholm.  And Asia Pacific region showed continued momentum over the quarter despite the U.S. trade dispute with China and the unrest that we see in Hong Kong. We enjoyed strong bookings in both our Hong Kong and Singapore businesses. And we opened our first data center in Seoul, South Korea, entering into one of the most vibrant digital economies in the world, our 25th country to operate from. To date, the Seoul business is tracking ahead of its bookings plan. I'm now looking at the capital structure. Please refer to Slide 8. Our unrestricted cash balance is approximately $1.4 billion, lower than the prior quarter's operating cash flow and proceeds from the ATM program were more than offset by our quarterly capital expenditures and our cash dividend. Our net debt leverage ratio was 3.5x our Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA, up slightly due to the lower cash balance, yet still well within our targeted range. As a new investment grade-rated company and given the current interest rate environment, we expect to drive substantial interest rate savings through the refinancing of our currently outstanding debt as well as enjoy a lower cost to borrow on any new incremental capital raise to fund our future initiatives. At the end of Q3, our liquidity position, alongside the strong balance sheet, continues to provide us a strategic and unmatched business advantage. Turning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $557 million, including a recurring CapEx of $47 million. Q3 had 6 new expansion projects completed, adding 2,800 cabinets of capacity, including new IBXs in Helsinki and Seoul. And we continue to expand our land bank, acquiring land for development in Tokyo and Warsaw. Our capital investment delivered strong returns, as shown on Slide 10. Our 136 stabilized assets increased revenues 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, similar to last quarter. Our stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and generate a 30% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested.  And now please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for an updated summary of 2019 guidance and the bridges. For the full year of 2019, on a constant currency basis, we're maintaining our full year revenue guidance while raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance by $6 million due to strong operating performance. This guidance applies -- implies a revenue growth rate of 9% over the prior year and a healthy adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 48%. Also, we're reducing our 2019 integration cost to now be $9 million.  And given the strong operating performance, we're also raising our 2019 AFFO by $8 million, while our growth range will range between 13% and 14% compared to the previous year on a normalized and constant currency basis. We do expect slightly lower net interest expense in Q4. AFFO per share is expected to grow 8%, including the dilutive impact of both our Q1 equity raise and the effects of the ATM program activity. We've assumed a weighted average 84.8 million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. And finally, we expect our 2019 cash dividend to now approximate $825 million, a 13% increase over the prior year and reflects an 8% year-over-year increase on a per share basis.  So with that I'm going to stop, and I'm going to pass it back to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Keith. In closing, we had another great quarter, building on our unique source of competitive advantage in demonstrating the underlying strength of our business. We continue to separate ourselves from the competition, using our diverse go-to-market channels and our expansive balance sheet as tools to extend the scope, scale and velocity of our flywheel business, while partnering with world-class players like GIC to enable us to simultaneously capture strategic footprints and deliver attractive returns in the hyperscaler market.  We also continue to build new capabilities that will allow us to achieve our vision for the future of Platform Equinix, a future that will our customers to reach everywhere, connect with everyone and integrate everything on their digital transformation journey. I am extremely pleased and privileged to work with our team of over 10,000, focused on building on our products and platform, and executing against an ambitious set of priorities in service to our customers, all while steadfastly ensuring that our culture continues to thrive, making sure that we have the right people in the right roles at the right time, building a company that is positively impacting their world and wherever employee can confidently say I'm safe, I belong, and I matter.  So let me stop there and open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Philip Cusick with JPMC. Philip Cusick : First, maybe you can dig into the tax issue in the Infomart and if that impacted the Americas colo revenue? And then second, what are the incremental costs, Keith, of the green initiatives that we should expect from here? Keith Taylor : Phil, very astute question that you asked vis-\u00e0-vis the tax implications. We've talked about two sort of currency or tax matters in our prepared remarks this quarter. First and foremost, as it relates to the revenue side of the equation, because we -- when we bought Infomart, there was a, shall we say, a negotiation with the local taxing authorities and the value that gets ascribed to that building and we came to a resolution in Q3. But prior to that, there was a very large assessment that basically was charged, of course, to the tenants of Infomart building. And so we absorbed the cost, and the tenants absorbed, if you will, the pass through of some of those costs.  In Q3, once we settled the arrangement with the tax authorities, there's a meaningful step down in the amount of taxes that we -- collectively, we're going to pay. And as a result, for those tenants that were part of Infomart, they effectively are going to get a reduction on -- of their taxes, and that affects us directly on our recoveries, if you will, the revenues attached to that. But bottom line is, you've got to step back and say, okay, the revenues' come down, but economically, this was good for, not only our tenant, but it was even better for Equinix because of the -- because we have won a large tenant in the facility and we also absorbed a lot of the unused capacity, if you will, in that space, and that tax gets burdened on to us. So that was the first one. The second matter I just want to raise, because I think it's important, just to make sure, that was a property tax issue and it's always attached to recoveries. The second issue for us, vis-\u00e0-vis tax, is income tax attached to a very favorable hedge gains that we had on our hedges. And as a result, our income tax provision went up in Q3 because of how weak both the sterling and euro were relative to the U.S. dollar. As you know, a lot of that is reversed already in Q4, but we had to book the provision in Q3, and that's why you see that, that comes out in the bridge. And then to go back then to your last question, really, which was on the green initiatives. Suffice it to say, Charles has made comments, as did I. We're very, very focused on ESG as a corporation and our green initiatives. And those green initiatives, of course, come in many different shapes and sizes, if you will, from how we procure our power, to offsets, to variable indirect purchase -- power purchase arrangement. But there is a-- I would tell you, it's somewhere right now, we spend somewhere between $10 million and $20 million that we absorb to become 100% sort of, if you will, green-oriented and -- sorry, 100% focused on driving our power consumption through green initiatives.  And so we're highly focused on that. It is a $10 million to $20 million cost to the business, but we recognize it's important to not only the constituents in the company, but certainly to our communities and very important to our customers, given that we're in their supply chain. Charles Meyers : But important to note, Phil, that that's -- basically, we've been doing that for a while, and so that's been kind of already baked into our operating results, and it's fully accommodated in our guide. Philip Cusick : Yes. Okay. I heard on the call -- I thought I heard something that it was incremental cost to be absorbed there, but it sounds like that's mostly done. Charles Meyers : Yes. Philip Cusick : Okay. And then on the -- just following up in the Infomart side. Can you give us an idea of the net impact on revenue from that? Or maybe what the sort of underlying trend of the business would have been without that? Keith Taylor : Yes. So basically it would've taken us to the top end of our guidance range, on an FX-neutral than normalized basis. So basically, it was $4 million. Operator : Our next question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : So we obviously had a large acquisition and merger in the industry last night. I was just wondering if what your thoughts would be on how that might change the industry dynamics. Do you have any perspective on what the European market might look like after that? And where does Equinix stand today in terms of looking at additional either acquisitions or on the JVs? You've talked about doing those. Or is that anything we'll see in the near term? Charles Meyers : Sure. Yes. We fully expected that question would surface, Simon. Obviously, a big transaction in our industry for sure. So I'll start with this, we've got tremendous respect for both of those companies. It's not too difficult to, I think, to see why each of those parties might be interested in this combination. Interxion has always been a big risk competitor of ours in Europe, and I'm sure they'll remain as such. As for DLR, as I've said in many a public forum, it's my experience that then overlap between our business and DLR's business is actually fairly small. That will probably not be the case with our xScale joint venture, where we're likely to be more consistently head-to-head, but in our core retail business, we only see them sort of selectively as a competitor. Just to put it into context, according to Synergy Research, DLR's entire retail business outside of Europe and others what we would be appending from a retail perspective on to the Interxion business, that entire retail business outside of Europe is about a tenth the size of Equinix overall. So in reality, I think the combination represents bringing together 2 very different businesses, a strong European retailer and a strong global wholesaler. So I think there's probably merit in the deal and an industrial logic to it. I think it's a bit of a stretch to say that the combination really meaningfully closes the gap in terms of trying to replicate the scope, scale and value of Platform Equinix. So -- and I would say I think the challenges in combining those businesses, just mechanically, let alone operationally, financially and culturally, will certainly be nontrivial. And even if and when that's done successfully, I think we'll -- what comes out at the other end is a company we'll feel pretty comfortable competing against, certainly in Europe, which we've been doing obviously for years, and in particular, on a global basis.  So I think it's understandable, but I think we're going to continue to sell the strength of our value proposition globally and feel like we're going to have great success with our customers. From a -- answering the second question in terms of our own M&A, we've said that we're going to continue to be -- we continue to believe that's an appropriate tool. At the same time, we're going to be pretty disciplined about that, and we're not going to chase valuations if we think they don't make sense for the business. Obviously, we feel really good about the transaction we recently announced in Mexico to enter that market. I feel like it was really sized right and priced right and gives us a real nice entry strategy into a very important market for us.  There's few other markets that I think we would entertain as M&A opportunities to enter. And -- but again, we're going to make sure that we do that on a disciplined basis. So we'll -- we feel like it's an appropriate tool in the bag, but one that we're going to use with real discipline. Simon Flannery : And the hyperscale JV timing for new markets? Charles Meyers : We haven't really -- we're actively working on that. As we had said previously, we're engaged in Japan actively. The exact timing on those, just given the complexity of the transactions is hard to fully predict. But I think if you look out over the next couple of years, we would expect to add several more JVs to the mix in terms of being able to offer the xScale sort of portfolio in key markets around the world. Operator : Our next question is from Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Jonathan Atkin : So Charles, in your prepared remarks, you talked about edge products, and it got me thinking about any sort of trends that you're seeing in your cabinet adds in the Americas and the mix shift between Tier 1 markets and slightly smaller markets. Are you noticing any changes as you sort of develop new capabilities? And could that maybe inform your appetite to enter into, say, minor-league cities rather than just major-league cities? Charles Meyers : Yes. We're not any seeing any significant shifts in trends. Obviously, our major metros continue to drive the lion's share of both cabinet adds and revenue growth, but we're -- we do see real health in our other markets. I would say that we're going to start by offering our edge services in probably the more logical major metros. But to the extent we see momentum, I do think those will represent an opportunity for us to deploy infrastructure and drive cabinet yields into those markets as well. And then -- and again, depending on, I think, how use cases evolve, whether or not we would need to continue to look at expanding that reach beyond our current footprint, I think is something we're actively looking at. We have a team that we refer to as the evolving edge team, and we're actively looking at how we would do that.  But I would say right now, the bulk of the use cases that we see are well met by the current footprint that we have. And so being able to deploy our edge services, whether that be Network Edge or some of the others we might contemplate into our very expansive aggregated edge footprint today, we think meets most of the needs of the market and we'll just continue to evolve -- or adapt as use cases might dictate that. Jonathan Atkin : Okay. And then, on Seoul, just interested, are businesses going to you for the very first -- going with you for the first time into that market? Or are they already in market and then they're kind of using you for their expansion needs? Charles Meyers : It's more, typically, our existing customers wanting to expand -- extend their infrastructure into Seoul, although we do have a team on the ground that is sort of cultivating local business as well. But we said that our bookings are ahead of plan, thus far. And that's driven by the strength of a couple of key deals where some of our cloud and IT service customers were looking to expand their footprint into that market with a pretty significant deal that we landed in Seoul. Jonathan Atkin : And then, lastly, just on churn, are there any differences you're seeing in what's driving edge? And any reason to think that you would gravitate towards the low end to the high end of your traditional range going forward? Charles Meyers : No. It depends more on, I think, it's more timing issues in terms of shifts between quarters, but no substantive shifts. As I said, we've talked about the fact that we are continuing to work through the last bits of the churn tale in the Verizon assets. And I think that we're now feel like we're positioned to get back to growth in 2020 on those assets. And -- but no meaningful shifts.  What we have seen is, there's not a lot of -- our churn is driven mostly by frictional churn, and to some degree, by things like bankruptcies and those kind of things. We see the occasional shift in terms of moving selective workloads to the cloud, but that's typically churning a portion of an implementation rather than the whole thing because again, what we're seeing is people are very much committed to sort of hybrid and multicloud. And so they're maintaining private infrastructure and then integrating that with cloud assets, public cloud assets. And so no meaningful shifts that we're seeing right now from a churn perspective.  I will say, over time, though, I would hope that we're going to be able to -- one of the things that you are seeing in our bookings mix is a very clear discipline around these sort of sweet spot deals, well interconnected that's -- so you're seeing that show up in terms of the volume of transactions and number of deals done as well as levels of interconnection. And so those are really encouraging signals for me in terms of execution of the strategy. And over time, I actually think that will help us hopefully trend towards the lower end of our range in terms of churn.  So that is -- because as I've always said, the best defense against churn is getting the right deployments in to begin with. And so as we look at that, I think some of maybe larger footprints that were more susceptible to longer-term churn are things that we're not going to be doing. We will probably -- we'll be pushing those, particularly a very large footprints off to our -- into our -- into the xScale sort of entity, which is more equipped to deal with those dynamics. And I do hope that will improve our churn position over time. Operator : Our next question is from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Frank Louthan : Can you give us a little color on -- you mentioned the multi-partner win with an energy company. We're the only data center company on that deal and what was in particular anything special about that -- with that? And then I've got a follow up. Charles Meyers : Yes. It was -- we were, I believe, the preferred -- the only data center involved in that particular transaction. It was a data center consolidation activity, and also sort of integrating into a hybrid cloud architecture. And so they were really utilizing Cloud Exchange fabric as their mechanism to integrate both their network and their cloud connectivity between -- with their private infrastructure. And so really good multi-partner win and one we're really excited about in the quarter. Frank Louthan : Okay. And looking at America's growth, just curious what you might be able to do to maybe accelerate that going forward? And in particular, can you give us an update on the additional land that was around the Infomart that you could expand? And then what's sort of -- where you are in NAP of the Americas to be able to finish building out that facility? And how that might help improve the growth in Americas? Charles Meyers : Yes. We -- I think the Americas business continues to perform well, particularly in terms of mix of business. I think we are -- probably the biggest driver is going to be sort of getting us through the last of the churn activity that's been sort of above the -- above prior levels, which is creating a drag in terms of what was essentially a $500 million business, which has not had any growth, and that impacts the overall America's growth rate. And so I think as that subsides, I think we'll start to see some growth there.  I do think we have opportunities to add in some of our key markets. We've already added capacity, which we're filling at a nice rate in NAP of the Americas. The deal -- or the Dallas campus expansion is underway. Over time, we'll probably add both large footprint capability there as well as increasing retail, so that will probably be an opportunity for us to get some additional growth from that market.  But I think the bigger things that I'm excited about longer term is us continuing to -- one, continuing to drive additional quota-bearing head count into the market to capture the significant enterprise opportunity we see. Our gross bookings engine is performing very well in the Americas, and not only in terms of landing bookings in the Americas assets, but also delivering those globally across the platform.  And so I think being able to continue to expand both our channel as well as our direct selling efforts in the region, and then over time, as we add new services, I think we're also going to be able to continue to enhance cabinet yields, but that's going to take some time for those new edge services to really mature. Operator : Our next question is from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Colby Synesael : Maybe just following up on the growth. Stabilized growth, I think, was 3%, you said, in the quarter. And I thought at least a few quarters ago, there was talk about getting that number back up to 5%. Just curious what you think the longer-term growth rate for stabilized growth should be? And what are the parts that potentially get us a bit higher? Maybe it's just the improvement in the Verizon assets that you mentioned. And then secondly, I think in your previous guidance from last quarter, you had assumed that the JV, the GIC JV would close, and I think it was August and they had them closing in October. Curious what the benefit to guidance is in terms of the update you just made for 2019 as a result of that delayed close? Charles Meyers : Let me take the first one, and I'll ask Keith to address the timing and the GIC transaction. Relative to stabilized asset growth, yes, we've been kind of hovering around that 3% to 4% mark, Colby. And I think the catalysts for getting back into that 5% kind of range would be, one, as you noted and as I noted in the commentary, getting the Verizon assets sort of through the knothole. I do also think the 10 to 100 gig migrations have impacted those to some degree. We did see a good quarter in that. We actually saw a reduction in interconnection churn. I don't think we're all the way through that though. So I think we're -- it's going to sort of continue to go in ways, although the biggest thing -- the biggest players who I think have -- who were going to make that change have largely made it in the Americas. But there probably will be some more of that, that I think will create some downdraft on the stabilized asset growth. And we talked about, there also being a few assets that we were actively migrating sort of business out of -- and those kind of impacted as well. So there's a variety of factors. I'm encouraged by what we can do, both with our Network Edge offer as well as with what we see on the horizon in terms of some of the additional edge services because we can deploy infrastructure, shared infrastructure into some of those kind of facilities and get kind of meaningful returns on that and maybe drive some additional growth in cabinet yields into those. But I think that's going to be a longer-term proposition, and we'll probably really stay in that 3%, 4% range for a bit. Keith Taylor : And Colby, as it relates to the second question, for Q4 -- for Q3, there's really no meaningful movement, as you know, for the Q3 quarter. And when we offered our prior guidance, it was really more about the influence that was going to take place in Q4. And just to remind you and everybody else on how this is going to get accounted for, recognizing that there is fee income that will come with the joint ventures. And as we continue to scale them up, there's fees that get attached to it. The fees come in through the top line through revenue. The equity ownership, the 20% ownership, that effectively comes through below the line, it will be in AFFO, but below EBITDA in the form of income from affiliated entities. And so that's how it sort of will present itself in our financials.  Suffice it to say, this quarter for Q4 and our guidance and implications on Q3, was -- is negligible. Think about $2 million on either side. And the reason for that is, it's all about timing. It's the timing of the cost, timing of the fees, timing of the income stream associated with how those customers in Seoul and the environment, and those two assets that we have and then as we continue to scale them. So overall, what we'll try to do is continue to keep everybody fully abreast of not only this JV, but the ongoing JVs on what, if you will, the fund flow is. But for this year, as we said, there's really never going to be any meaningful impact to our financial results, and for all intents and purposes, it's just been absorbed into the ongoing. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael Rollins : Two questions. First, just curious how you're looking at the opportunities to recycle capital for maybe some of the existing assets, whether it's some market that you may not think of as core to the portfolio or situations where it might be just opportunity to take advantage of the private market. And then the second question is just with the ATM program. Is there a framework or allocation strategy that investors should think about in terms of the timing or ways you may access that program in the future? Keith Taylor : So Charles and I are looking at each other. Which one -- who wants to answer that question? I think, on the first one, let's just touch base on that, first and foremost. Overall, as you hear us continually say and talk about, we really referred to Equinix as a platform. Periodically, there are assets that would be disposed of. Not so much because we're trying to recycle capital, but it's more because when you look at the strategic value of that asset relative to what we're doing with our platform and where we want to invest our dollars, we choose occasionally to turn down a site like we've recently done or sell a small asset when it came with an acquisition. And we did that with Switch & Data. We just recently sold one of Verizon's small assets. We referred to as our New York 12. We sold our Istanbul 1 asset, which came -- was part of Telecity. It's not really about recycling. It's more about making sure we create the momentum and the right assets for ourselves. And again, I think it's really important, Michael, for you and for all the listeners on the call today, we sell across this platform. Every asset is highly important to us. And so that's why we're not probably as traditional as some of the others in thinking about recycling because it is the platform. As we get then into the discussion around ATM. ATM, I think it ties into a much more broader discussion on how we will fund ourselves in a go forward basis. If we all go back to the June 2018 Analyst Day, we talked about how we could grow the business over the 5-year period in '18 through '22 and what that would mean from capital dollars spent, and if you will, the scale of the dividend and the like.  As a result, we knew at that point in time that we still -- there was going to be funding in the business, funding needed for the business, and it was going to come in the form of both debt and equity. And so what I would tell you is that there's no -- I wouldn't -- there's no perfect way to describe how we use the ATM, other than what we're trying to do is take advantage of it when it makes sense for the shareholder, and stay away from it when it doesn't make sense for the shareholder. And a perfect example would be, in December of last year, when we're at a 52-week low, we were not in the ATM program. When we're reaching some of our all-time highs, we occasionally pulled down a little bit of equity to fund the business because we know that between now and 2022, there is still some capital need to fund all that we have in front of us, including some of the M&A activities.  And I've said on the last call, you're going to see us do more and more of debt because, one, I think the cost of debt is going down; but two, we've brought some real balance into our capital structure. We'll guard our investment grade rating, and we're at a point where we're well within our targeted leverage range.  So it's a long-winded way of saying that we're going to moderate. We'll do it wisely. It is a cheaper source of -- so it's a cheaper way to go to the equity markets than doing a follow-on offering. Think about 50 basis points versus something ranging from 1 to 1.5 basis points to do those transactions. And we use it -- we do it at our discretion based on market conditions and targets.  And so bottom line is, we'll continue to monitor it. Right now, we have roughly $300 million left on the program that we approved last December. We've got a lot of cash in our balance sheet, $1.4 billion, as I said, at the end of Q3. And then you heard me also say with the October closing of the JV, that brought in another $355 million. So we're going to be really prudent about how we refinance our debt, how we raise new debt and how we use our ATM on a go-forward basis to make sure we maximize the return for our investors. Charles, anything else that you want to add or? Charles Meyers : No. Keith Taylor : Okay. Operator : Our next question is from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jordan Sadler : Just moving back to sort of the drivers during the quarter, EMEA was called out as a powerful driver for the quarter. Can you give us a little bit of an update in terms of where we stand vis-\u00e0-vis the accelerated demand you're seeing in the region? Or maybe the catch-up versus the Americas? And then I have a follow-up. Charles Meyers : Yes. I mean, I think we've seen relatively broad-based sort of demand and strength in the European market. So honestly, our U.K. market continues to be strong despite sort of Brexit uncertainty, et cetera. I think that we have the luxury of a really broad-based business on the continent. And so I think it continues to perform very well. Whereas, I do think we are still seeing the movement of cloud providers into that market more comprehensively. And so that has driven both our direct business with us in terms of their network nodes and their private interconnection nodes, and I think now will fuel the JVs business in a significant way associated with the large footprint.  And then you're seeing the enterprise movement to hybrid and multicloud really start to catch up, I think, with where the Americas have been as well. So overall, it's been a pretty broad-based strong market for us. And I think the breadth of our business there is showing up nicely. And the teams are doing a great job. We're seeing strong channel activity in that business as well. I would say both Europe and Asia were a little bit sort of a little later in terms of the adoption of the channel, but we're seeing really strong channel uptick there as well.  So I wouldn't -- in that point, say necessarily anything in particular, but it definitely is a strong market overall. Jordan Sadler : And the outlook continues to be good, right? It sounds like it still has legs? Charles Meyers : It does. Yes, we're not -- we're definitely not seeing a softening there. We're -- we have the luxury of when we look at new projects and the fill rates that go with them, we have deep visibility into our pipeline. We have a really clear understanding of what our fill rates have been, and so we're continuing to allocate capital. We probably had a bit of a peak of -- or a bubble of capital that came through over the last couple of years in Europe. But definitely, there's sustained demand there, and so we'll continue to invest in that market as well. Jordan Sadler : Was there incremental hyperscale leasing volume during the quarter that you could speak to? Charles Meyers : No. We're still working through in terms -- but I would say that we have a very strong pipeline. And so we're relatively fresh off close in the JV and really getting our pipeline and forecasting and processes really refined between ourselves and our partner. But I would say that we have had really productive discussions with the 12 or so companies that we see as the primary drivers of hyperscale demand. And so I feel like we've got plenty of pipeline to support the JV aspirations. Jordan Sadler : And then, just lastly, if I may, maybe for Keith. I think you talked about overall best ever bookings, deal mix and pricing. Can you elaborate on the pricing strength that you're seeing? Is that a function of sort of escalators, renewal spreads that you're seeing? Or is this just -- is it -- what is it? Keith Taylor : Yes -- no, Jordan. I think -- so to just add, I just want to make sure. This was the -- one of our top performing quarters when we look at it across the whole year, but it was our best ever Q3. There's always a little bit of seasonality that comes into play. No surprise in our business. Jordan Sadler : I did hear that correct. I'm sorry. I misspoke. Keith Taylor : Yes. And -- but the real drivers behind that are threefold. Number one is, and you heard Charles refer to it, is the deal mix is very, very positive. So the average deal size is a lot smaller, and that allows us to enjoy a better return on a per cabinet basis than we would otherwise see with a larger deal volume. No surprise. Second, you've got to add to that, the interconnection revenues and the opportunities that, that presents itself. But we do a very good job and we have done a very good job of selling this platform. And then you add to that the ancillary services that aren't -- clearly, they're just starting out, if you will. The attach rate that we would see to revenues on a go-forward basis could be very, very attractive. And again, Charles referred to that. But the third piece is, and I hope it isn't lost on people. When we think -- but look, we're always having to live within the environment that we operate in, and market conditions at times make it very competitive. But when we renegotiate with our customers and this time there are price adjustments downwards, I think what you should draw great comfort for is that you keep on hearing us talk about positive pricing actions. That means those are the price escalators that are pushing pricing upwards. And so we tend to be in a very net positive position. And so as a result, you've got 3 things that are working to your advantage, and hence, why you see the firmness across all 3 regions of the world despite the currency impact that we're seeing as we report all of this in USD, as you know. But despite all of that, you see very, very firm pricing, and I think it's a reflection of who we are and what we do and where we're taking the business. You can't lose sight of the fact that what Charles and all of us believe right customer with a right application, and the right data center makes a huge difference. And if we can mitigate some of that churn by all the incremental services you're going to continue to see, I would argue, a very firm pricing on a go-forward basis. Charles Meyers : Yes. I'd just reinforce that, Jordan. I think that when you look at -- that's one of the reasons why disciplined execution of the strategy, even though it's hard to drive the growth using -- with the smaller deal sizes, it requires significant volume and you've got to really drive the selling machine. It's the right thing to do, we think, in terms of generating long-term returns and value for our customers. And so we're really committed to that.  And when we look at the broader industry, in terms of what people are seeing, in terms of, really, spreads, particularly people who are exposed to the wholesale -- primarily the wholesale, or even the Hyperscale market and what sort of at pricing looks like, current pricing versus what maybe the entry was and what therefore that implies for re-leasing spreads, it's not a, I think it's not always a pretty picture. And so, luckily, I think we have limited exposure to that on a relative basis for sure.  And again, what we're seeing is essentially positive spreads because we're able to get the cumulative effect of PIs which we're very successful in implementing in our contract across huge number of contracts that are sort of rolling through the system. And even if that means that we do a price adjustment on a single contract on a net basis in the quarter, we're continuing to actually deliver more than sort of an overall positive price action. So that's really important dynamic in our business that I think is quite unique. Operator : Our next question is from Aryeh Klein from BMO Capital Markets. Aryeh Klein : Maybe related to the channel strength, how broad-based is that geographically? And is there an opportunity to further build out those relationships in new markets? And then separately, you are adding some meaningful new capacity next year in the Americas. Would you expect that to drive an acceleration in net cabinet adds in that market? Charles Meyers : Yes. Great questions. The answer to both is probably a simple yes, but let me give you a little more color. I think, channel-wise, I do think we are able to continue to add both geographic coverage and coverage in terms of additional partner types that I think are going to be able to give us both increased reach. We, like many channel programs, see a bit of a sort of 80-20 rule, which is we see our 20% of our partners delivering a big chunk of our bookings. Although, it's interesting, we're seeing greater productivity across the full basis that we're starting to really get more breadth in the channel. So I do think both from a geographic standpoint and a partner-type standpoint, we're going to continue to add.  But our focus is less on adding new partners as it is making our existing partners more productive. And so that's really -- and our team is really doing a great job all right that. I'm super excited about some of the -- some of our key channel partners. If you look at two of the major partners here in the U.S., with AT&T and with Verizon, both is really critical strategic partners of ours. And now, really, they're leaning on our data center portfolio as the key way to deliver into their customers. And so we're super excited about that and have seen a lot of momentum.  And then also working with the hyperscalers themselves. And most of them are really seeing that their customers are saying, yes, we want to continue to consume more and more of your services, but we're doing it and we're integrating it with private infrastructure. And we want that private infrastructure to be immediately approximate to the cloud. And so that's really driving joint selling with the hyperscalers.  And then the -- relative to your second question, on the Americas. Yes, I do think -- any time you add new capacity, I think you tend to see a little bit of uplift. And so hopefully we'll see some -- we typically contemplate some anchor customers inside of larger phases, and so you might see some lift there. But again, we're -- I do think that we'll be able to get a bit of lift on that. But what you're seeing, I think, in terms of cabinet adds, is really just the really tight discipline on the business, and then a really attractive mix profile. Operator : Our last question is from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Ahmed Badri : I just wanted to follow up on the prior question. If you could just rank the regions that contributed or basically hit over this 30% hurdle rate that you guys reported this quarter from bookings, which regions were above the 30%? Which ones were below? And then I have a follow-up. Charles Meyers : I don't know if I have that right off the top of my head. I expect that the Americas was meaningfully above that. And I'm not sure if the others were at or below the 30% in terms of their indexing. But I would say that from a trajectory standpoint, both APAC and Europe are really meaningfully increasing their percentage of bookings. I would expect they probably were both lower than 30s, and that U.S. was the over-indexed piece there, but I'd have to go back and confirm it. But I would tell you that I think all three regions continue to trend positively in terms of channel bookings as a percentage of overall. Ahmed Badri : Got it. And then at what point do you think would be the limit or the ceiling to this contribution, right, from this kind of sales motion? Would it -- would you throw out like 40%, 50% of bookings any given quarter. Is that where this is going to top out? Or maybe you could give me any kind of idea on where we could expect this thing to top out in the future? Charles Meyers : Yes. I think it's going to depend a little bit on how our business mix and new product portfolio continues to perform. Over time, I think that we're delivering digitally-enabled services, in some cases, like Network Edge. If you look at that service, it is one that should be able to be consumed by our customers directly and via channel partners with relatively limited friction. And I think that will enable us to increase the percentage of bookings that are done through our channel. I would say that we're still, at this point, more of a sell with sort of motion in our channel, and we're fine with that. We still get the expanded reach and relationship that those partners are giving us, and has very attractive economics.  But I think that, over time, I think we'll have a combination where we're really getting sell-through activity on a broader portfolio. And I've said it in the past, there's no reason it can't be north of 50% for sure. And so I don't know what the timing of that is. I think it will depend on a variety of factors, but we're really encouraged by the trajectory we're seeing there because at the end of the day, the customer's trying to solve a problem. And very often, almost always, that problem means combining the value add of another player with the compelling value proposition of global reach ecosystems, interconnection and service excellence that Equinix brings to the table. And combining those and solving the needs of a customer is what fuels the business. And so we're really excited about that. I think there's a lot of upside potential for it. Ahmed Badri : Great. And then one last question. Sorry to keep everybody on this call. But on stock-based compensation, Keith, could you probably just give us a little bit more color on how come stock-based comp grew 34% year-on-year and now makes up about 4.5% of revenues? Whereas, the same time last year, it was more around 3.5% or a bit above that? Can you just give any color on the recent increase and intensity? It's about the second quarter this happened. So just give us an idea for this quarter. And how do we... Keith Taylor : Yes. That's what a strong stock price does, as you can appreciate. So I mean, think about where the stock was on December of last year and where it is today. And so I think the most important part is we look at not only our Compensation Committee, but certainly Charles and myself and Brandi, who runs HR with us. We're always looking at appeasing the burn. And it's very important, number one, that we look at compensation and we look at it on a relative basis to what we need to do to attract the right people into the organization. But we also look at the burn and how that affects our financial results, and then what I'm more referring to here is the AFFO on a per share basis. And so all of these things are considered as we figure out how to fund our business and drive value into the share.  But no surprise to you, when the stock performed exceedingly well and you're growing a business, stock-based comp as a percent of revenue does go up. But that does not mean that dilution -- that we're diluting our stockholders anymore. It's just -- it's a reflection of what takes place. And as you look forward, of course, with the stock where it is, it's all about delivering value to an employee. And all else being equal, you would issue less shares next year because of the value of the stock as it is in its present form. So those are the thoughts I have. Happy to take it offline with you a little bit further, but there should be no surprise, our stock-based comp has been going up. Katrina Rymill : Great. That concludes our Q3 call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference. All lines may disconnect at this time.",

In the interest of wrapping this call within an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow on questions to just one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks Kat. Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. We had a strong finish to 2019 and the momentum within the team and across the business is clearly evident, reflecting solid execution of our strategy and indicative of the tremendous opportunity in front of us. We closed over 17,000 deals in 2019, demonstrating the extraordinary scale of our retail go-to-market engine and the differentiated nature of the Equinix value proposition. The pace of digital transformation continues to accelerate, creating seismic shifts across industries as businesses embrace interconnection as critical to their infrastructure strategy and adopt hybrid and multi-cloud as the clear architecture of choice. The secular forces driving demand for digital infrastructure are as strong as ever. Data is being created, moved, analyzed and stored at unprecedented levels. These dynamics are expanding the Equinix addressable market as customers seek to distribute infrastructure globally. Responding to increasingly demanding workloads and the need to locate and interconnect private infrastructure in close proximity to a rapidly expanding universe of cloud-based resources. Against this backdrop, we continue to focus on four critical vectors to position the business for significant value creation in 2020 and beyond. As it always does, it starts with our people. We will continue to invest, first, in our people, our organization and our culture in order to attract and inspire market-leading talent and service to one another, enabling us collectively to be in service to our customers, to our shareholders and to the communities in which we operate. Second, we will continue to evolve and grow our go-to-market engine, targeting the right customers with the right workloads in the right locations. Amplifying our reach via the channel and ensuring that our sales and service delivery capabilities, continue to be globally aligned and locally responsive. Third, we will continue to invest in Platform Equinix, expanding our global reach, while also adding new services and capabilities that will allow customers to more flexibly combine Equinix value with that of our partners to more quickly implement hybrid and multi-cloud architectures at the digital edge. And fourth, we will focus on simplifying and scaling our business, implementing our own targeted digital transformation initiatives focused on increasing operating leverage and enhancing our customer experience. These areas of focus and our long-term orientation will allow us to widen the mode around our business, enhance our yields and increase service attach rates, enabling us to deliver durable revenue growth and attractive AFFO per share. Expanding our reach remains a core tenet, and we now operate across 55 metros in 26 countries. As we recently closed our Mexico acquisition and will open new markets this year including Hamburg and Muscat. The benefit of our unparalleled reach is reflecting in strong cross regional activity, which continues to trend positively with multi-metro customer revenues ticking up 87%. We also continue to make significant progress with our hyperscale strategy, with six announced projects underway across all three regions, and a strong pipeline of customer demand. We are already looking to expand our European JV and advancing additional JV conversations in Japan and other targeted geographies. This strategy will enable us over time to extend our leadership in the cloud ecosystem, while mitigating strain on our balance sheet and maintaining market-leading returns. Turning to our results as depicted on Slide 3. Revenues for the full year were $5.6 billion, up 9% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA was up 10% year-over-year and AFFO was meaningfully ahead of our expectations for the year Interconnection revenues grew 14% year-over-year, driven by strong customer response to the Equinix Cloud Exchange Fabric, good traction in our new Internet exchange markets and solid interconnection adds. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our interconnection differentiation continues to pay dividends as we expand our product set, driving growth and customer value. We now have over 363,000 interconnections and delivered our 12th consecutive quarter of adding more interconnections than the rest of the top 10 competitors combined. In Q4, we added an incremental 7,400 interconnections fueled by high gross adds to support new streaming services, expanding inter-metro connections and seasonably lower churn. Peak Internet exchange traffic grew by 10% this quarter, also helped by these new OTT video offerings. ECX Fabric is diversifying well as an exchange platform, with over 2,000 customers now connecting their own deployments to over 600 other participants on the platform. Our longer-term vision for Platform Equinix continues to take shape, influenced by direct feedback from our customers and partners. Our Network Edge offering, which provides customers' access to a number of different virtual network functions provisioned over ECX Fabric is tracking ahead of plan. And our announced acquisition of Packet represents a bold move to accelerate our strategy to help enterprises quickly and seamlessly deploy hybrid multi-cloud architectures on Platform Equinix. By combining Packet's market leading hardware automation capabilities with our platform and integrating directly with the ECX Fabric, we intend to create a world-class enterprise grade bare metal offering that allows customers to rapidly deploy digital infrastructure at the edge with differentiated performance and robust integration to the public cloud. We expect the Packet transaction to close in Q1 and look forward to updating you further on progress of our platform strategy. Now let me cover highlights from our verticals. Our Network vertical achieved solid bookings with robust reseller activity from our global NSP partners as well as continued expansion activity across various networks sub segments. New wins include RTI Connectivity, a leading subsea cable operator, extending their solutions in Tokyo and Sydney. We also launched an expanded partnership with Telstra enabling full API integration with ECX Fabric giving enterprise customers on-demand access to Telstra services across 38 metros. A good example of how we're automating connectivity with key partners to their last mile networks via the ECX fabric. Our financial services vertical achieved its third highest bookings led by capital markets providers and large multinationals as cloud adoption accelerates. New wins included a top three Nordic Bank, re-architecting their global network for digital payments and a Fortune 500 financial advisory firm, transforming their network topology. Our content and digital media vertical saw record bookings, led by APAC and strength in gaming, publishing and e-commerce as cloud adoption continues to shape this vertical. Expansions included a Fortune 500 media company expanding to launch new OTT delivery services and a multinational conglomerate building out its edge to support growing multiplayer online gaming in South America. Our cloud and IT vertical saw strong bookings led by APAC and double-digit growth in services and infrastructure as cloud customers diversify. Equinix continues to be the clear global leader in cloud connectivity, with over 40% share of total cloud on-ramps and 15 new on-ramps added in 2019, 5 times the nearest competitor. Our enterprise vertical saw healthy and high quality new logo adds with continued strength in manufacturing, healthcare and retail as enterprises build out hybrid architectures. New wins included a Fortune 150 retailer, building out infrastructure to support digital transformation and a global life sciences firm, enabling multi-cloud capabilities. Our channel accounted for more than 27% of bookings and we are very pleased with the progress we made in building this important go-to-market vector. Two-thirds of our channel bookings are now driven by resellers, with integrated solutions like Performance Hub and ECX Fabric, delivering faster and more predictable order flow. We're working together with these resellers to more effectively prioritize join offerings to bring mutual customers the benefits of Platform Equinix, enhanced by our partner services. New channel wins this quarter included a win with Telindus for the city of Amsterdam, as well as a win with Optus to support Children's Cancer Institute of Australia with data analytics for genomics research, highlighting how with partners we are truly better together and reminding us of the far reaching impact Platform Equinix in helping make the world a better and healthier place. Now let me turn the call over to Keith, to cover the results for the quarter. Keith Taylor : Thank you, Charles. Good afternoon to everyone. As highlighted by Charles, what a great way to end the year, and an even better way to start a new one, very similar to last year. We delivered $5.6 billion of revenues and as reported increase of slightly under $500 million, compared to last year. We're at 9% year-over-year growth rate on a normalized and constant currency basis. AFFO per share scaled to $22.81 and as reported year-over-year increase of greater than 10% better than our expectations as we drive value on both the top line and at the per share level. Our core strategy, our go-to-market engine and our team are delivering performance at a very high level as we continue to separate ourselves from our competitors. And our strong fourth quarter performance sets us up nicely to invest in growing and scaling the business in 2020. We continue to fund organic expansion and new product and services initiatives, while also scaling our go-to-market efforts, these investments are directly attributable to the volume of high quality interconnection rich wins across both our direct and indirect channels. Our MRR per cabinet metric remained strong, largely due to solid pricing discipline, favorable deal mix and positive interconnection momentum. We have an active construction pipeline, expanding our global platform with 32 projects currently underway across 23 metros in 15 countries. We'll leverage our recently achieved investment grade credit rating to reduce our future debt service burden, has initially demonstrated by our fourth quarter $2.8 billion debt raise to favorably refinance a portion of our outstanding high yield debt. Our financial strength remains a significant and strategic advantage. Now let me cover the quarterly highlights. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, the global Q4 revenues were $1.417 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year, our 17th year of consecutive quarterly revenue growth, a trend that we expect to continue as we look into 2020. We had our second best gross and net booking quarter, largely due to strong organic performance coupled with net positive pricing actions again, and then some delayed churn. Q4 revenues, net of our FX hedges included a $4 million positive FX benefit due to the stronger euro and British pound in the quarter, when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $676 million, up 9% over the same quarter last year and better than expected due to lower than anticipated employee costs and utilities expense. Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges included a positive $1 million FX benefit, when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q4 AFFO was $473 million, above our expectations on a constant currency basis, while absorbing the seasonally higher recurring CapEx investments similar to last year. Interconnection revenues were very strong across all three regions this quarter, reflecting the benefit of our global platform and diversified product portfolio. Interconnection revenues now represent 18% of recurring revenues, a significant quarter-over-quarter step up. The Americas and EMEA interconnection revenues are now 24% and 10% of recurring revenues, respectively, while APAC stepped up to 15%, a meaningful increase throughout the year. Turning to regional highlights, whose full results are covered on slides 5 through 7. APAC and EMEA were the fastest MRR growing regions at 13% and 12% respectively on a year-over-year normalized basis, followed by the Americas region at 4%. The Americas region saw continued strong bookings both local and export with their high mix of small deals and healthy pricing, and the Dallas market has been a highlight for the Americas business, we've seen healthy performance with our existing Infomart asset and we're eager to complete our new build adjacent to the Infomart, which will be known as Dallas 11, and we closed the Axtel acquisition in Mexico in January, and have already received favorable inbound queries from multinational and carrier communities. We're eager to start our expansion efforts in Mexico, thereby, enhancing our interconnection opportunities between North, Central and South America. Looking forward, we expect Americas revenue growth to trend upward to 5% or greater, as we progress through 2020. Our EMEA region saw a continued growth throughout 2019, largely driven by our four largest markets Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Paris, as multinationals deploy their infrastructure across these major regional hubs. EMEA, again, had robust billable cabinet additions and firm deal pricing, as reflected in our solid MRR per cabinet metric. Export bookings continued to remain high across the region and for the first time ever EMEA export bookings were greater than their import bookings, a reflection of the continued globalization of our go-to-market activities. And Asia-Pacific region, saw record bookings with an uptick in small deal activity and strength in our Australian markets. Also, our investments in new markets like Seoul are progressing well, and we're starting to see the front edge of a new ecosystem developing as key domestic NSPs deploy their infrastructure into these assets. And now, looking at the capital structure. Please refer to Slide 8. At year-end, our unrestricted cash balance was approximately $1.9 billion, which included about $344 million of cash that was used in January, to redeem the remaining portion of the debt refinance, in November, 2019. Our net debt leverage ratio was 3.7 times at Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA, within our targeted range. We continue to expect to drive substantial interest savings into our AFFO per share metric, as we refinance our currently outstanding debt over the next 12 months, taking advantage of current market conditions. As you would expect the Nashville trade-off will be the cost attributed to the call premium or make whole provision offset by the present value of the future interest savings. Of course, we want to make each of these transactions net present value positive, while negotiating the best terms and conditions for the business. To be clear, there is no benefit attributed from our future refinancings in the current AFFO per share guidance. Turning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $715 million, including recurring CapEx of $81 million, we opened nine new expansion projects in the fourth quarter, including new IBXs in Melbourne, Singapore and Sydney, while we added another 13 projects for expansion tracking sheet. This gives you a sense of the level of activity in the business and the speed that we're building in filling capacity. We continue to expand our ownership acquiring additional land for development in Frankfurt and purchasing - and we purchased our Toronto 2 IBX, revenues from owned assets increased to 55%. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our 136 stabilized asset increased recurring revenues by 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, while total stabilized asset revenue grew 2% due to lower non-recurring revenues this quarter versus the prior year. We expect our stabilized asset growth rate to trend up to 3% to 4% in 2020. And similar to prior years, we'll update the stabilized assets summary on the Q1 earnings call. Our stabilized assets are collectively 84% utilized and generate a 30% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And please refer to slides 11 through 15 for our summary of 2020 guidance and bridges. Do note our 2020 guidance includes the anticipated financial results from the Axtel acquisition, but does not include any financial results related to the pending Packet acquisition. Starting with revenues, we expect to deliver an 8% to 9% growth rate for 2020, delivering over $6 billion in revenue, a reflection of the continued momentum in the business and the opportunity that we see in front of us. Our 2020 revenue guidance includes $18 million to $22 million of revenue attributed to Axtel and MRR churn is expected to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter for the year. Pardon me. We expect 2020 adjusted EBITDA margins of 48%, including integration - sorry excluding integration costs the result of strong operating leverage in the business, offset in part by expected higher utilities and property tax expense and a meaningful investment in our go-to-market and product organizations. Also we expect to incur $10 million of integration costs in 2020, to finalize the integration of the various acquisitions. 2020 AFFO is expected to grow 11% to 14% compared to the previous year and our AFFO per share will grow 9% to 11%, excluding any benefit attributed to future refinancing activities. And we expect our 2020 cash dividends to increase to approximately $912 million, a 10% increase over the prior year or an 8% increase on a per share basis. So let me stop here. I'll turn the call back to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks Keith. In closing, 2019 was a great year for Equinix. We took significant strides and continue to execute effectively on the ambitious agenda we outlined to you at our Analyst Day in 2018, positioning the business to effectively scale and capture the enormous opportunity ahead. We dramatically scaled our go-to-market machine to capture the rapidly growing enterprise opportunity, we embarked on a broad change agenda to drive consistent global execution, we added significant talent to respond to the technology shift shaping our industry, including two outstanding additions to our Board in Sandra Rivera from Intel and Adaire Fox-Martin from SAP. And as we undertook these changes, we communicated tirelessly and engaged our teams around the globe to be a part of rearchitecting our collective future together, achieving record levels of employee engagement, market leading organizational health scores and being recognized as a global leader and sustainability. We aggressively worked the balance sheet side of the business raising more than $4.5 billion in debt and equity, and achieved an investment grade credit status. We delivered on our commitment to form a hyperscale JV, joining forces with a world-class partner to advance our cloud aspirations, while avoiding undue strain on our balance sheet. And the market is taking notice, as we were recently recognized by IDC MarketScape, as the top leader in their inaugural worldwide colocation and interconnection vendor assessment. In 2020, we'll continue our focus on evolving Platform Equinix, adding new capabilities and service offerings to better meet the digital transformation needs of our customers. We'll continue to scale our global multi-channel sales engine to support growing bookings and will focus on providing a more seamless and globally consistent digital experience for our customers to improve the adoption and consumption of Platform Equinix. I am as excited as ever about the future of Equinix, an honored to work with our dedicated teams around the world in service for our customers, to our communities and to our shareholders. So let me stop there and open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jon Atkin with RBC. Your line is now open. Jon Atkin : Thanks very much. I wanted to ask an operational question and then a question about xScale. So on the operational side, I wondered if you could call out any trends that you saw around sales cycles lengthening or shortening closing rates? Any different than what you've seen in book-to-bill that is any different from what you've seen historically? Charles Meyers : Sure, Jon, I'll take the first one and maybe - first couple and maybe you can comment on book-to-bill. In terms of win rates in sales cycles, I wouldn't say any meaningful change. I do think, maybe, we're getting a bit better I think that our targeting of the enterprise in the enterprise space in particular continues to improve. I think, we're probably seeing perhaps some shortening of sales cycles, but there is still - I think we're still fairly early in terms of customers thinking through their long-term, hybrid multi-cloud architectures. And so, oftentimes, they are - they do continue to be longer sales cycles. Once landed, I definitely think we're seeing a shortening in terms of their ability to expand their wallet share or us expand wallet share with the customers. And then win rates, I think are probably pretty stable if anything I think going up, we are - we're again we're doing a really nice job I think of targeting. I think our value proposition continues to resonate with customers. And overall, we've been very pleased with the performance of the go-to-market engine. Keith Taylor : Jon I just want to mention of the book-to-bill. There is no meaningful change in our book-to-bill, in fact, as Charles said, once we land them, we tend to move very fast to install the customer. But what I would tell you is no surprise when you look at our - this quarter relative to - Q4 relative to the Q1. The timing of different events causes us to report our revenue slightly differently. So the timing of, when you booked something versus when you might churn. And so, as an organization, I think we're seeing exactly - as is happening exactly as we planned. But there is no meaningful shift in what I call the book-to-bill interval in the business. Jon Atkin : And then one more operational question just in terms of churn. And as you look at 2020, are there any influences this coming year different than we saw in 2019 related to customer migrations or really anything else? Charles Meyers : No, I would say it's pretty, pretty linear sort of extrapolation of what we saw last year. I think some of the pressure for example on stabilized asset growth is coming from the fact that there is some level of cloud substitution, that's something I've talked about before, but it's really a matter of - I think people kind of really figuring out what their workload sort of distribution is going to be between private and public infrastructure and making those adjustments. But as we said, we've been able to comfortably kind of live within the 2% to 2.5% range and we continue to feel comfortable with that going forward. Jon Atkin : And then my xScale question is, just any sense around timing, around JV arrangements outside of Europe and how they might differ structurally from what you have in place already? And then for xScale Europe JV that's already in place, how do we think about the impact on AFFO per share? Charles Meyers : Yes. I'll let Keith take the latter. But the - in terms of timing, we've learned not to draw too brighter line, because the complexities associated with sort of getting these things closed out from a tax and treasury and REITs standpoint and various other factors and always seems to be more than we think. But I would say that, I think we're making really good progress Jim and Eric and the whole xScale team along with a lot of an army of people on our tax and treasury teams and various other elements within the organization are working hard on getting those things going. I think you're going to see good momentum during the course of 2020 for us on the xScale side. Keith Taylor : And then, just as it relates to the impact on the quarter on an xScale, the largest impact that you really saw was the amount of cash that came into the business. As you recall from the Q3 earnings call, we had $355 million of cash come onto our balance sheet and there is roughly \u20ac60 million of what we refer to as milestone payments. They would come over the next sort of 12 to 24 months in the business. As it relates to the operating performance, we're just really getting started, and this is going to be I think an appropriate and really good discussion at the June Analyst Day, just giving everybody an update on how we are performing. But it's - it's as good, if not better than we anticipated and the momentum that Jim and his team see in a marketplace is substantial. So from our perspective, there is no surprises and nothing meaningful running through the fourth quarter results. Operator : Our next question will come from Phil Cusick with JPMC. Your line is now open. Phil Cusick : Can you dig into what gives you the confidence in the 2021 expansion and development after what looks like a robust 2020 plan as well? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Yes, I mean I think it's just, if you look at multi-year view on the business, we probably - I think right now, we have a better multi sort of longer term view of the customer opportunity in the funnel than we've ever had. And so, I think that if you look at fill rates and the trajectory on our fill rates, if you look at sort of any I think underlying industry drivers in terms of the pace of adoption of cloud, you look at what's happening in terms of overall data volumes, you look at the impact and influence, sort of things like AI and an IoT, I mean, I think you start to see the front edge potentially of 5G increasing sort of both traffic and overall, sort of data volumes. And so, I continue to think that the secular forces driving the overall demand for infrastructure are strong. We're hearing that from our customers and we're hearing them be very responsive to our sort of long-term vision for the platform and that includes the expansion of capabilities and services as well as our plans for geographic expansion over time. So, the combination of all of those things continue. Obviously '21 is a bit far out, but we feel very good about the projects that we have underway right now and the fill rates that we're going to - that are supporting those investment decisions and I'm super optimistic that '21 will be just as exciting. Keith Taylor : And Phil, if I can just add to what Charles said. The beauty of our plan too is we've got 32 projects underway across 23 different markets. So it's the diversity of our investment and they're coming in different shapes and sizes based on the demand profile of a given market. So we feel we have that visibility. It is a little bit far out as Charles referred to. But given the strength of our pipeline, the momentum that we saw in 2019 coming into 2020 and the depth of our pipeline and the opportunity set, that's what gives us the confidence to continue to build, particularly in some of the markets where we're one of the few that is building. Operator : Our next question will come from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Your line is now open. Erik Rasmussen : So, as it relates to your 2020 guidance, is sort of like a two part question. But have you turned the corner with the Verizon assets and is this the year you're starting to see growth? And then within that, it sounds like you're a little bit more confident in the Americas, 5% or greater. What's driving this sort of positive dynamic and then what sort of the long-term growth rate that you would see or sustain rate on that business or region? Charles Meyers : Yes. I do think we have that one of the factors, certainly Verizon has been one of the factors that has been delaying, I think the grow or sort of a bit of a growth headwind to the region. Now, that's been a net economic benefit to the company. So we're not complaining about it. But it has been a bit of a churn because that - there's a bit of a headwind as that churn continues to drive through. But again, we feel - we feel like we're going to be able to see a return to growth as Keith indicated in the script. I think that we feel like as we move towards the end of the year, we're going to be looking at a greater than 5%. And I think the strength of the go-to-market engine in the Americas selling across the world continues to be substantial. And so, so I think that, I do think the Americas business, we feel a level of optimism there that we're going to sort of get through some of the remainder of the churn tail on Verizon and really see that business pick up a bit in growth. Keith Taylor : And Erik, we've always said this certainly in the investor conferences, that Charles and I and others go to. We always can grow the business faster if we want, but it's - it's what we do as the pricing discipline. And Charles referred to going after the right customer, right application, the right IBX and being disciplined and going after those interconnection rich opportunities that really cause us to feel very comfortable on what our guide is, and recognizing - yes, we can certainly can go do a lot of very substantial hyperscale deals in the Americas. But we think that would be value destructive for our business. And so, we focus that opportunity in our hyperscale initiative with our JV partner in other parts of the world where we can get an appropriate churn alongside our partners. But I think it's the discipline that we bring to the Americas region, it gives us the confidence that we don't have to go stretch ourselves here. We're - it's a very good and very successful business and we want to keep on doing what we're doing. Charles Meyers : Yes. One last comment I'd make Erik is that we noted in the script, the continued globalization of the selling engine is a really important thing, is something Karl and Mike and team have really focused on in terms of making sure that we're as I always used to say, we're making sure that every rep selling, every data center every day, right, and that they're out there positioning the full global platform. We saw EMEA have a - for the first time sell more out outbound than they got inbound. And that's a really positive step for us. It really shows the strength. And those are the things that when you have the global platform and companies, large companies perhaps, they're headquartered elsewhere sort of - would that - that are driving demand into all our regions, including the Americas. I think that's going to be a contributor to growth. Erik Rasmussen : Maybe just as my follow up. This is more of a maybe a bigger picture, a theme. But are you seeing any shifts in the underlying trends in the industry that are giving you increased confidence, and sort of how you are positioned and your ability to achieve your current long-term growth objectives? Charles Meyers : Yes. I mentioned a number of them, I think. I think the - I guess, I would put a sort of an overall umbrella frame or overall frame around it in the context of digital transformation. Digital transformation is an absolute priority at a board and senior executive team level in virtually every company that we are talking to and targeting. And so it matters a lot to them. They're thinking hard about how to drive digital transformation in their business and how to deploy infrastructure to support that. And so I think, one, that focus on digital transformation aim - and that's happening because of these various trends. People, for example, seeing AI is central to their ability to create competitive advantage and they're using - they're viewing data as central to their ability to create competitive advantage. And they're just - they're investing behind a lot of these trends and they're needing to deploy infrastructure globally to have their infrastructure work and their applications to operate as they're designed. And so I think though - that's sort of the secular backdrop, and then you bounce against that sort of the Equinix position, which was, we have this unique position I think in terms of being able to really promote and accelerate the hybrid and multi-cloud as the architecture of choice. There are many customers are, in fact, using us as an avenue to access the cloud, to move workloads between cloud resources and then to place their private infrastructure, even if that private infrastructure maybe getting smaller than it used to once be when it was living inside their enterprise data centers, they're taking what remains as private infrastructure and they want to place it in direct proximity to the cloud, and that's really what I think Equinix does better than anybody else in the world. And so I think those are - there is a variety of both secular trends as well as sort of our own market position that combined to give you a sense of optimism for the road ahead, which is exactly why we're continue to invest behind the platform, invest behind the go-to-market engine and excited about what lies ahead. Operator : Our next question will come from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Ari Klein : It looks like EBITDA margins are coming in a bit in 2020. Keith, can you maybe parse through the impacts in a bit more detail. How much from higher utility expense is taxes? And then the meaningful investments in the go-to-market strategy that we're alluded to, can you talk to where those investments are being made? Charles Meyers : Maybe, Ari, this is Charles. Maybe I'll jump in and just give you the broader context for I think our decision in terms of how we're guiding in the margin, then Keith can add any color there. But if you look at 2020, it's pretty similar to what happened in '19. In both years we showed significant operating leverage, but we saw some specific items that impacted our ability to drop that through to the bottom line. In '19, it was projections on utility costs combined with some pretty significant expansion drag that last year that led us to guide to a roughly flat margin line. As you know, we ended up delivering expansion in 2019, finishing at about 48.5%, because utility trend was frankly a bit better than we projected. But we are seeing those utility increases materialize, not just in EMEA, but in some of our other markets as well. And those combined with the property tax increases compared to '19, those things together consume most of the operating leverage. So we are kind of left in the position of either offering out some modest margin growth and not investing in the business or funding the key investments and guiding to a flatter margin and we did that - and that's obviously we chose in the latter. We feel like it's our job to maximize long-term value creation and we're confident that bringing up the dollars to invest in the platform evolution, growing the go-to-market engine, driving our own digital transformation are all things that are going to help us sustain AFFO per share growth, and frankly, that's our lighthouse metric and we feel like it would be irresponsible not to invest behind the momentum that we have right now. Ari Klein : Got it. Charles Meyers : Keith, any color you want to add? Keith Taylor : No, I mean - I think you hit it square on - square on the head, so. Ari Klein : Maybe shifting gears a bit. Does the Packet acquisition reflect the shift in M&A strategy in any way? Should we expect future acquisitions to be more focused on the services front versus maybe new markets given how many you're already in? Charles Meyers : No, I wouldn't call a shift, I'd call it an augment. It's a - look, we're going to continue to view geographic expansion of the platform as a strategic priority for us and where that can be done in a value creating way via M&A, then we certainly will - will think about doing that. So we've talked about the fact that we still have additional - additions to our platform from geography - geographic coverage standpoint that we'd like to make, and I think M&A will be a vehicle for us in that regard. Having said that, I also, I do think that's an augment you saw Packet as really the first of a really a capabilities type of acquisition. We're super excited about what they bring to the table. What that is going to allow for us in terms of bringing an enterprise-grade bare metal offering to the table that is really going to be responsive to customer needs and will help animate our core value proposition in really compelling ways, in ways that our customers are asking for. And as for to whether or not we might see other things that look like that, that are more capabilities oriented, I would certainly say that's a possibility for us. We're going to continue to build by our partner as we need to execute it on the strategy and to make sure that we can capture the opportunity in front of us. Keith Taylor : Ari, one of the things I'd just add on maybe just making one other comment just about the EBITDA margins, because one of the things as we do recognize that there are these higher costs that are going through the financials. But if you look at it on a quarterly basis, Q1 theoretically will be our lowest guide and then as each quarter goes by through the year, you would see an improving EBITDA margin. And so it gives you a sense that with the operating leverage in the business that we're realizing plus recognizing these costs, but the momentum that we foresee will cause our margins to continue to go up. So when we enter 2021, obviously we're in a - we'd be in a better position than we are coming out of Q1. Operator : Our next question will come from Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Colby Synesael : Maybe just a few housekeeping items just to start off. First off, on the greater than 5% Americas growth that should be thought it was like a fourth quarter 2020 growth number, right, not a full 2020 over 2019 number, correct? Charles Meyers : Yes. We see it growing throughout the year as we're trying to say. So I think it's more second half than the first half. Colby Synesael : And then the next question, you mentioned I think 3% to 4% stabilized growth. Charles Meyers : Yes. Colby Synesael : Is that recurring stabilized growth or is that total stabilized growth? Charles Meyers : Recurring. Colby Synesael : Okay. Recurring. And then you had previously guided to greater than 50% EBITDA margins by 2022 at your 2018 Analyst Day. Is that still your expectation? Charles Meyers : Well, since that time, Colby, and we had sort of you had put more perhaps uncertainty around the exact timing, I think our posture over the past year and a half or so has really been that we believe the 50% it's achievable, but that we're not willing to trade off sort of long-term value creation for achievement of a near-term margin objective. And so I think that we still believe it is achievable. I think our primary focus as a team is going to continue to be a long-term value creation, and by the way, that does not mean we have in any way shape or form lost focus on driving operating leverage. It's a key priority for us to allow us to invest in the business and still deliver the financial results we need, but right now I wouldn't want to put a particular timeline on the 50%. Colby Synesael : And then just my last one, cabinet adds. So cabinet adds in 2019 were lower in aggregate across all regions total versus 2018. And in this most recent quarter, you added a decent amount of cabs to your inventory and we really didn't see any meaningful acceleration in installed and your utilization rate actually came down again. And I think now is slightly below 80%. What's your expectation for cabinet adds? You mentioned 32 expansions that are ongoing. How should we think about that number maybe on a year-over-year basis in '20 versus '19? And how big of a focus is that metric for you guys when you look at the performance of the business. Thank you. Charles Meyers : Yes, I mean, I think there's a couple of things. One, there is always some level of volatility in it, I mean, that's why we've always encouraged people to look at the rolling four quarter. Having said that, even when you look at our rolling four quarter. I think you're seeing some downward pressure, and I think that is primarily a factor of couple of things. One, it's really a factor of execution. It's a reflection of execution of the strategy, frankly. And by going to the xScale product, that is going to take some really lumpy things out of the mix. If you look at the non-financial metrics sheet and you look at Asia, which was I think Q1 of last year, it was like if memory serves 5,700 cabs or something crazy. And a lot of that was stuff that we would be pushing off into xScale. And so I think that - I think the mix of business is going to shift probably to put a little downward pressure on cabinet adds. I think by the way we have sized our capacity investments and all of our new builds to reflect that strategy. So we didn't overbuild and then go - while we didn't - and now we got too much. That was always our plan and so, so I think you're going to see a little bit of a movement in utilization as new capacity comes online, but I think the - if you take the last few quarters, you're probably - and average them, you're probably seeing a reasonable reflection of what we're going to do from a cabinet adds perspective. And again you'll always see a little bit, of lumpiness in that, but I do think there is a little bit of downward pressure, but I think that should not be viewed as a negative. It should be viewed as a really a reflection of the strength of the core strategy and how we're delivering against it. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi. Your line is now open. Michael Rollins : First, can you give us an update on where your customers are from a grooming perspective for interconnection? And how that could play over the course of the year? And then just taking a step back. Are you seeing any change in demand for the markets and data centers kind of below the original primary interconnection points that have been part of the heritage Equinix story for a long time? And just curious given the trends that you talked about, if there is just an expansion of interest and where customers want to locate their infrastructure. Thanks. Charles Meyers : Mike, what was the first part, again? I'm sorry. I was thinking about the second one. Michael Rollins : Update on the grooming\u2026 Charles Meyers : Phase grooming. Yes, okay got it. Michael Rollins : The interconnection grooming. Thanks. Charles Meyers : Yes. By the way it sounds like cold got you, so I hope you feeling better. Michael Rollins : Thanks you. Charles Meyers : The grooming, I would say that we're, again, particularly as it relates - the biggest interconnection grooming tends to come either in the form of 10 to 100 migration for really large interconnection consumers. And as I've said, I think that the really big ones have already come through the process and particularly in the U.S. and when I say the U.S., they are really U.S. based companies, but they have really sort of largely embarked on their global grooming already. So I think we're - I'd use the words that we were going to probably see it tapering through 2020. I think that's still the case. We saw fourth quarter was - we did not see what we thought we might see, which was something that happened in fourth quarter of last year of '18, which was - we felt like the network moratoriums really kept people from - we saw really a Q3 and Q4 that was roughly, kind of linear or roughly flat. But bottom line, I think that we'll see some tapering of that, I think that - a lot of our customers are very advanced and then the other major form of grooming you see is when carrier consolidation occurs. And we see, we've seen some of that over time, but I wouldn't say that we're seeing any sort of acute levels of that. So I think that on balance over the course of 2020 that's something that we'll see improve. And I think we're going to see - we've kind of guided to the 7,000 to 9,000 on interconnections, that typically is made up of sort of 5,000 to 7,000 on physical cross connects and then call it in the couple of thousand range on virtual. I think we're going to see virtual continue to climb, although there is a bit of a mix there in terms of how people - what speeds they're buying at and those kind of things. But overall, I think it will taper off and we'll see a really - I think we'll see a strong interconnection year. I mean this last quarter was a really strong interconnection quarter, we're really, really pleased with the performance of the business. And then, your second question as to sort of the mix of demand from sort of first tier interconnection rich campuses and locations versus others. I do think that there is - one of the things that has really helped us, Mike, is that we extended the ECX Fabric and interconnected all of our facilities. And so now people still have the ability to on-ramp to the broader ecosystem from any of our facilities and there are people - our teams have really been able to work that into the selling. And so let's face it, the - it's the Ashburns and Silicon Valleys and Frankfurts and Londons and Amsterdams that continue to drive big investment and really big growth, but some of these - some of the second markets or even the second - more of the second tier facilities within primary markets, I think that the Fabric has been a help for us in terms of making sure that we're monetizing those effectively. Operator : Our next question will come from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Your line is open. Frank Louthan : Following up on the Packet questions. Are there any other products that you think that you need to have in your arsenal there to service the customers? And in the past, you sort of skewed things that might compete with your customers, are you rethinking that to a certain extent, maybe with network for other things. Thanks. Charles Meyers : Yes, well, we had talked in and as we've sort of laid out our platform - our evolving platform strategy in the past, we've talked about this edge services layer, and we talked about Network Edge, Compute Edge, Edge Data, Edge Security, etc. We think there is opportunities for us in all of those and it will be a mix of things that we will deliver ourselves, which we did with Network Edge and which we did - which we now are facilitating via the Packet acquisition with some level of Edge Compute. But we also think there will be perhaps even more of those that are Edge based services that represent combinations of our value with third party value and partner value. And so, which gets me to sort of the second part of your question, which is - are we kind of our - we have - we typically have had a position, where we are a bit of a neutral player. And I think that serves us well and we've always been about choice and optionality and making sure customers can select from the providers that they want. And I don't think that from a philosophy standpoint changes a bit for us. And so we're going to continue to embrace that, we're going to continue to invite partners in to deliver value. In some cases if customers are pressing us to deliver services that they want to see from us, then we're going to seriously consider that. If we think those are areas where we have the capability to play, the permission to play and that they'll deliver - very kinds of returns. And so it's going to be an evolution of our strategy, but I think that we're going to continue to be about building ecosystems, where people can bring value, combining with what we do and solve customer problems. So I'd encourage you to come to Analyst Day, which I'm sure we'll see you there in June and I think we'll probably have a little bit more meat on that bone that we can share with you. Operator : Our next question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Simon Flannery : Keith just on the leverage, you've obviously done a nice job bringing that down. How are you thinking, I know the 3 to 4 range, but given where interest rates are, is it more optimal to stay in the upper half of that range. And are you seeing any opportunities to build in - buy in more of your real estate? And then for Charles on the bill timing, the point on funnel visibility was very helpful. But there is a lot of stuff 18 plus even 24 months out. What's the thought process around that? Is any of that driven by - in your construction or other complications, or is it really just phasing the buildings out there? And I'm thinking of some of the stuff like the Amsterdam moratorium and stuff. Are you seeing any other municipalities looking at some of those issues? Thanks. Keith Taylor : Sure. Hey, Simon, so let me take the first part and then we'll push it to Charles, for the second part. First on leverage, right now we're 3.7 times levered. But clearly that's well within our guided range and historically we said 3 to 4. But after we got our credit rating upgrade, we always felt that we probably play at the higher end of that range, but truthfully when you just look at the operating leverage in the business, as you look forward over a number of years, all else being equal, you're going to be in a deleveraging scenario or said differently, it's going to give you the flexibility to choose how you deploy that capital and keep leverage at an appropriate level. So we feel very, very confident that we're appropriately levered, we think to adjust the growth of the business that we will - we would otherwise delever again, all else being equal. And we know that we can then borrow money, we can borrow money today and all likelihood tomorrow at a much lower cost than we are incurring today, and that's what gives us - again, we're trying to be very clear with our AFFO per share that the interest burden that we're bearing today, relative to what we'll bear tomorrow, is more substantial. And you just can do the math on the $3 billion worth of euro debt or the $2 billion of high-yield debt is yet to be refinanced, there's substantial savings that can be realized from just refinancing those today at current rates versus where the rates may eventually go is substantial to the AFFO per share. As it relates to buying some of our real estate, we're always looking at it, but - it's a buy versus lease decision and it's really about economic control of the asset, but absolutely to the extent there is something out there that makes sense, we'll be active. Particularly, when we look at the lease costs of our - the lease cost that we're bearing in the contract with our landlord. And so that's just, let me just assure you that's something that we'll continue to look at, we have a very strong real estate organization inside our company and we remain active at looking at our properties. Simon Flannery : Thanks. Charles Meyers : And then on the build-out. Yes, I get the gist to that question, obviously, some of those are a little bit more protracted in terms of their delivery time frames. Some of that is just markets where for a variety of reasons, it's more difficult to get things done from a permitting perspective, from a power perspective, it's oftentimes power that is the - and the availability of power that dictate the timeline on these things, but generally, we are building phased projects, so we have a level of confidence in terms of not putting too much capacity into the market in the get-go, unless those are xScale that are fully pre-sold in which case, obviously, if those are pre-sold, we want to get them built out as quickly as possible. I would say that from a construction standpoint, it's a robust market. And so there are, I do think part of it is just macro forces, which is the demand for labor for example in these markets is high. And so that is an area where I actually think we end up being differentiated, because we kind of often can get to the front of the line, because we have a history of having done 4 or 5 or 8 or 10 projects with somebody. And when we say, we need your best teams, we often get them. And so - but there are some protracted timelines, and it's something that I think Ralph and our construction teams globally are continuing to work on. There are also some times where there is specific circumstances. Whether they'll be for example Olympics, that is often something that sort of changes the circumstances of a particular build, but I wouldn't say right now it's anything in terms of extending project timelines due to supply chain challenges or anything like that, but there are some that are further definitely further out there in time. Operator : Our next question will come from Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Jon Petersen : In the press release you - talking about cross connect adds, you guys called out new streaming services as a big demand driver. I'm kind of curious with your experience with some of the streaming services that have been around for a few years, that I'm sure you have those customers kind of what the ramp is in terms of how they add cross connects, is it - are you guys kind of expecting as one big wave when they launch the product or is it kind of a steady stream of demand going forward? Charles Meyers : Well, you are right, we do have experience in this area, but I would say the dynamics of those and also potentially the market power of the players involved are different. And I think if you look at public information in terms of what some of these services have done, they have been exceptionally successful in terms of subscriber acquisition. So I'm not sure, I would apply any prior experience necessarily to these things, but they're very thoughtful organizations. We work very closely with them in terms of capacity planning and we're excited about what they - what we think those could imply in terms of continued sort of tailwinds really for the interconnection business. Jon Petersen : And then maybe to kind of come back to the leverage in equity needs. Potentially it looks like the 2020 guidance assumes no equity issuance. I think, last year you initially gave guidance that didn't assume equity issuance and then you did. And so I'm kind of curious what your resources of capital needs are for equity throughout the year? Should we expect you guys to dribble out through the ATM or any other - anything else? Charles Meyers : Again in 2019, we really, we sort of front run the process as far as raising equity sooner in the year than we originally anticipated. And then as you know in the back end of the year, we raised a little bit more debt than we needed to, want to refinance the debt that we are taking out, but to put some cash on the balance sheet, which was really a precursor to funding for 2020. And so we're in a - obviously a very good position from a cash and liquidity perspective and we're going to take this posture is always about creating long-term shareholder value and - but what we also believe it is a combination of debt and equity that's got us to where we need to be. Obviously at - pardon me, debt is the cheapest form of capital today and we're going to continue to look at the markets on that basis. There is nothing, nothing imminent. And as you also know we have an ATM program that still has capacity on it $300 million, of the current ATM programs still has our availability. And so if we were to draw on capital for any purpose, it'll be a combination of both and we're going to be very strategic about those decisions as we have in the past. Operator : Our last question will come from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Nick Del Deo : And question on Packet to start. I think people generally understand where the sustainable competitive advantage for core Equinix comes from. How would you describe the source and durability of the competitive advantage for Packet? Charles Meyers : The great answer to it I think, is that it's actually the Equinix value proposition. If you look at it, Packet is really a reflection of shifts in how people want to consume our value proposition. Our core value proposition is - continues to be what it has been, superior global reach, advantage to access the scale, digital ecosystems to drive cost and performance, the most comprehensive interconnection portfolio and the business and an unparalleled track record of service excellence. And we have for 20 years, been animating that value proposition with Colo but what Packet allows is for us to essentially, animate that same - those same value propositions via a different consumption vehicle for our customers. And so the durable advantage still relies - still resides very much in what core platform Equinix delivers and the bare metal service obviously, we're going to need to deliver a - from a usability perspective and from a API integration perspective and the efforts and capabilities that Packet has to for automation and integration with the software ecosystem with the likes of VMware, et cetera, those are all things we're going to leverage to make sure that that's a really competitive bare metal offer, but it's the powerful part about this is its unlocking and extending and increasing the addressable market for the core Equinix value proposition. Katrina Rymill : Great. That concludes our Q4 call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : This concludes today's conference. All participants may disconnect at this time.

Also, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'd now like to turn the call over to Katrina Rymill, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Katrina Rymill : Good afternoon, and welcome to today's conference call. Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking in nature and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those statements and may be affected by the risks we identified in today's press release and those identified in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 21, 2020. Equinix assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or comment on forward-looking statements made on this call. In addition, in light of Regulation Fair Disclosure, it's Equinix' policy not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. In addition, we will provide non-GAAP measures on today's conference call. We provide a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a list of the reasons why the company uses these measures in today's press release on the Equinix IR page at www.equinix.com. We have made available on the IR page of our website a presentation designed to accompany this discussion along with certain supplemental financial information and other data. We'd also like to remind you that we post important information about Equinix in the IR page from time to time and encourage you to check our website regularly for the most current available information. With us today are Charles Meyers, Equinix' CEO and President; and Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call within an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow on questions to just one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks Kat. Good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Before we get into the results of the quarter, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the unprecedented times in our world and share our approach to this continuously evolving situation. First and foremost, our hearts go out to all those who have been impacted by COVID-19, and we extend our gratitude to all the frontline workers who are helping to keep us safe and healthy as we navigate this together. From the beginning, we've approached this situation with a consistent set of priorities : protecting the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners; ensuring the availability and continuity of our services that underpin the operation of the digital economy; and stepping up to do our part to mitigate the impacts of this crisis on people and communities around the world. Very early on, we activated our business continuity plans with the goal of ensuring seamless operations through this crisis. I'm incredibly proud of our teams across the company and moved by the care, kindness and courage they are demonstrating each day in service to each other, to our customers and to our communities. As in many other crisis situations through the years, the dedication and professionalism of our operations team has been unwavering, particularly as they were forced to adapt to our policies and procedures to rapidly changing conditions, keeping safety first while ensuring responsiveness to the needs of our customers. Thanks to our global teams, our facilities have remained safe, available and fully operational, and our customer satisfaction scores are at an all-time high. As is often the case, times of crisis reveal fundamental insights about an organization, and COVID-19 is no exception. First, we have seen remarkable resilience of our people and the tremendous strength of our culture. We talk every day about the magic of Equinix. A reference to our culture that might sound light or ephemeral to many, but when a global pandemic puts every aspect of your business and your life into flux, you quickly realize that 10,000 people committed to value like we before me and find a better way is truly a force to be reckoned with. Second, we're seeing a magnification of the role that Equinix plays not only for our customers but in the basic operation of our society. The massive work-from-home experiment in which we find ourselves, has created a spike of near-term demand from a variety of customers, much of which we believe will sustain even as we calibrate on a new normal. And perhaps most importantly, the unique characteristics of this particular crisis have increased the resolve we see from customers relative to their focus on digital transformation as a long-term priority and have highlighted the relevance of Equinix in supporting these efforts. But this crisis has also created a level of distraction and friction in the overall economy that reinforces the importance of the real-time on-demand scalability provided by services like ECX Fabric and Network Edge, and highlights the need for us to continue our efforts to deliver an even more digitally-enabled experience for our customers. And finally, it's times like these where we must stay focused on long-term value creation and maintain the level of commercial discipline that has served us so well for the past decade. We continue to make prudent decisions in the face of our current realities, maintaining the priorities I outlined and ensuring that our balance sheet will sustain us through a wide range of scenarios. These explicit decisions, along with some limited purchase and installation delays, have led us to modestly widen our full year guidance, but we continue to see strong underlying performance of the business with particular vibrancy in our market-leading interconnection franchise, which is rapidly approaching $1 billion run rate business. Our funnel remains healthy with a line of sight to a strong Q2, and we're reaffirming our AFFO guide as a midpoint for the year on a constant currency basis. We are delighted that the Equinix business model continues to be resilient through times of uncertainty enabling us to step-up for our employees, our customers and our communities. While there are undoubtedly many challenges and much uncertainty still in front of us, I've never been more optimistic about the future of Equinix and the magnitude of the opportunity ahead. Now, let me turn to the quarter and the details of our results. We had a great start to the year, delivering strong Q1 bookings, underpinned by a diverse customer demand and robust interconnection growth. Our bookings span more than 3,000 customers, with cross-border bookings up substantially year-over-year. We processed over 4,000 deals in the quarter as our retail go-to-market engine continues to scale in response to our expanding market opportunity. Turning to our results, as depicted on slide three, revenues for the first quarter were $1.4 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 5% year-over-year and AFFO was meaningfully ahead of our expectations. Interconnection revenues grew 15% year-over-year, steadily rising in the last few quarters and a strong reflection of demand across our portfolio of Interconnection products, supporting a variety of customer needs and use cases. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our interconnection portfolio reflects a unique product set that is driving quantifiable customer value. We now have over 370,000 interconnections and delivered our 13th consecutive quarter of adding more interconnections than the rest of the top 10 competitors combined. In Q1, we added an incremental 6,800 interconnections fueled by video streaming and conferencing services and offset by a slight increase in network grooming after a Q4 pause. Peak Internet Exchange traffic grew 44% year-over-year and over 20% quarter-over-quarter, a significant jump driven by work-from-home traffic spikes. Customers are scaling into previously provisioned 100-gig growth capacity and ordering new capacity as we head into Q2. And ECX Fabric continues to be a bright spot with a strong growth in volume and ARPU as higher bandwidth and inter-metro connections become a larger share of the total. In March, we closed our acquisition of bare metal leader Packet, accelerating our ability to deliver physical infrastructure at software speed and enabling both service providers and enterprises to quickly and seamlessly deploy hybrid and multi-cloud architectures. Bare metal is a rapidly emerging category of digital infrastructure that enables businesses to deploy workloads on secure single-tenant hardware distributed geographically to support high levels of application performance and integrate fully with their choice of software and management platforms across a range of vendors. Deploying bare metal as a service on platform Equinix allows companies to accelerate time to market and reduce CapEx while enabling new use cases that require both public cloud and private infrastructure. This is a strategic part of our vision to evolve platform Equinix, interconnecting and integrating global businesses at the digital edge. We're excited to welcome the Packet team on board and are pleased to report that we expect the Packet acquisition to be roughly breakeven in 2020 from a dilution perspective. In April, we also announced our next milestone in our hyperscale strategy, launching a new xScale JV in Japan with GIC, following the success of our initial xScale JV with GIC in Europe. Our xScale approach is a critical element in our strategy amplifying our already deep balance sheet and allowing us to deliver superior returns on invested capital while strengthening Equinix' leadership position in the cloud ecosystem, and leveraging our substantial existing presence and go-to-market strength in major markets around the world. Now, let me cover highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical achieved its third highest bookings, driven by strong network reseller activity as well as meaningful capacity upgrades to support increased bandwidth for work-from-home employees. Expansions included Hurricane Electric, a leading global Internet backbone, utilizing ECX Fabric across 33 locations to allow enterprise customers real-time access to their IP transit offering as well as Reseller Goal Data, a leading America's telecom provider deploying edge nodes in advance of a cable landing station to improve connectivity with Latin America. Our financial services vertical continue to diversify led by APAC and capital market wins. This sector saw healthy new logo adds with meaningful growth in Fortune 500 and Global 2000 customers. New wins and expansions included a Fortune 500 financial services firm re-architecting their network and securely accessing ecosystem partners and a top five global currency exchange tapping into our dense financial services ecosystem across eight locations. Our content digital media vertical saw solid bookings with strength in video and social media. Expansions included Zoom extending coverage and scale to support their explosive market demand as well as TikTok. A top 10 social media platform deploying edge nodes to support coverage and scale of its content delivery platform. Two good examples of COVID-related demand on platform Equinix. Our cloud and IT vertical also saw strong bookings led by APAC and a significant increase in ECX Fabric participants. Expansions included a Fortune 500 security and networking company, deploying infrastructure to support new product offerings worldwide and Link [ph], Japanese IAS MSP deploying infrastructure to support customer experience and ecosystem access. Our enterprise vertical saw healthy bookings despite COVID-related friction in the back half of the quarter reflecting broad strength, including government, healthcare, and education. We continue to focus on helping firms re-architect their infrastructure to solve the challenges of speed, scale and security while enabling the move to next-generation digital platforms. New wins included Phreesia Inc., a U.S. healthcare platform, deploying regional infrastructure to deliver an enhanced customer experience as well as a Brazilian education institution deploying to support digital transformation and improved performance. Our channel program accounted for approximately 30% of bookings, and we continue to see great productivity from this go-to-market vector. We processed over 2,000 channel deals this quarter, our highest ever, with wins across a wide range of industry segments with projects focused on digital transformation efforts as well as COVID-19 response. New channel wins this quarter included a notable win with Verizon for a premier U.S. retailer transitioning from on-premise data centers to a hybrid multi-cloud solution to enhance elasticity and performance, and a joint win with British telecom for a Fortune 150 biopharma firm, deploying a multi-region SD-WAN solution optimized for speed and agility. Now, let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Keith Taylor : Thank you, Charles and good afternoon to everyone from Burlingame, California. Equinix yet again delivered another very solid quarter of performance. Our success stems from the strength of our teams, who come to work day in and day out to meet the needs of our customers and so many others, including you, our shareholders. We started 2020 well positioned to create significant value for the year and beyond. And right out of the gate, the team delivered as our go-to-market engine yet again produced a solid set of diversified bookings in the quarter. It was our second best Q1 bookings quarter in our history. So, as we sit here today, we firmly believe our platform is not just relevant, but even more essential as the world we know quickly shifts to digital, only accelerated by the opportunities and the challenges created by COVID-19. Our xScale and Packet acquisitions, which both closed in Q1, are tracking well against our early expectations. Also after the quarter end, we entered into our second hyperscale JV for the Japan market, which we expect to close in Q3 and are already looking at our third and other joint ventures for the rest of Asia and elsewhere. And we continue to look for other platform enhancing acquisitions, both targeted and opportunistic. Our inter-region activity remain strong, a reflection that we're selling well across our global platform. We continue to enjoy net positive pricing actions resulting in very firm MRR per cabinet on a currency-neutral basis. And lastly, after funding the two acquisitions this quarter, we have about $1.2 billion of unrestricted cash on our balance sheet and pro forma for our new 364-day facility. We have an incremental $2.5 billion of liquidity to support our global growth and expansion initiatives. We have an active construction pipeline with 32 major projects currently underway across 22 metros in 14 countries. We made a few minor adjustments to our ready for service dates in certain markets, while we continue to work closely with our suppliers and partners to deliver the capacity as close to the target dates as possible with limited impact on our guidance for the year. And we expect another year of active builds and are maintaining our full year capital expansion guidance. As we have said before, we believe the diversity of our business across verticals, sectors, markets and customers, puts us in a highly favorable position to both capitalize on industry trends, but also weather the macro shifts and increased volatility. Specifically, our current revenue exposure to the travel, energy and retail industries is less than 3%. Also, I want to reiterate the importance we place on our employees, our customers and our communities. Let me provide you two examples : We placed certain restrictions on access to our IBXs to protect both our employees and our customers. As a result, in certain circumstances, we're providing three Smart Hands professional services to the affected customers for a period of time. This has a direct impact on our short-term revenues, but is the right thing to do. This adjustment has been reflected in our current financial guidance. Also, our greater than 2,500 IBX employees received a one-time cash bonus to help them address personal needs, given the shelter-in-place requirements in their communities while all other employees were provided a stipend to help support their work-from-home requirements. As a result, for the first quarter, the COVID-19 impact to revenues and adjusted EBITDA was $3 million and $14 million, respectively. On a constant currency basis, and absent the COVID-19 adjustments, both revenues and adjusted EBITDA were above the top end of our guidance range and AFFO and AFFO per share were above our expectations. Now, let me cover the quarterly highlights. Know that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on slide four, global Q1 revenues were $1.445 billion, up 7% over the same quarter last year, our 69th consecutive quarter of revenue growth. Q1 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $15 million negative FX impact due to weaker operating currencies with particular impact on the Euro, the British pound, and the Brazilian real when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $684 million, up 2% compared to the prior quarter and 5% over the same quarter last year, mainly due to strong revenue flow-through from price increases and deal mix. As is typical, we had about $18 million of higher seasonal costs in Q1, primarily attributed to the FICA reset and our annual sales conference. For Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, included a negative $7 million FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q1 AFFO was $535 million, above our expectations on a constant currency basis due to strong operating performance and lower than planned interest expense and income taxes. Our strong operating performance is expected to offset financial impacts related to COVID-19. And as such, as Charles noted, we are reaffirming our AFFO and AFFO per share guidance at midpoint on a constant currency basis. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on slides five through seven. EMEA and APAC were the fastest MRR growing regions on a normalized year-over-year basis at 12% and 9%, respectively, followed by the Americas region at 4%. The Americas region saw its best-ever Q1 price adjusted gross or PAG bookings with a high number of small deals and healthy pricing. Also, as expected, the Americas region continued to export substantial activity to the other two regions, highlighting the value of our global platform and the strength of the Americas selling engine. Bookings included wins with mission-critical digital infrastructure networks and work-from-home service providers. We continue to expect the Americas revenue growth rate to trend upwards to 5% or greater as we progress through 2020. Our EMEA region saw growth across its 22 metros and limited impact from COVID-19. Demand was weighted towards our four largest markets, being Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London, and Paris, with channel activity driving solid bookings into our smaller markets as well. EMEA cabinets billing reduced over the prior quarter due to timing of cabinet installations in both Q4 last year, which was very strong. And delayed installations in Q1 this year, which we expect to be realized in Q2. Deal pricing remained very firm. And Asia-Pacific region saw solid bookings with a record in Hong Kong and a significant uptick in Shanghai. Demand was strong across all verticals with increased need for bandwidth across many organizations, given the extended work-from-home mandates. And now looking at the capital structure, please refer to slide eight. As it relates to our liquidity position, we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of unrestricted cash on the balance sheet with an additional $1.7 billion of unused capacity from our revolving line of credit. Our net debt leverage ratio was 3.9 times at Q1. Annualized adjusted EBITDA up slightly due to the cash used to complete the acquisitions in the quarter. Also, we remain steadfastly committed to driving long-term shareholder value. And we will continue to fund the business from the healthy operating cash flows generated by the business, while also accessing both the debt and equity capital markets as appropriate. Also, note that achieving investment-grade our investment-grade ratings last year has proven to be a highly strategic and an important milestone for Equinix. Despite the recent volatility in the debt markets, we continue to review opportunities to refinance our existing debt tranches on a net present value positive basis. And today, that would not be possible without being investment-grade rated. We do expect to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt over the next 12 months. And note, there is currently no benefit attributed to our debt refinancings in the current AFFO or AFFO per share guidance. Turning to slide nine for the quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $400 million, including seasonally low recurring CapEx of $18 million. We opened two new expansions in the quarter, including a new IBX in Warsaw. And we announced two new expansion projects, one in Frankfurt and the other in Singapore, two of our strongest global markets. We continue to expand our ownership, acquiring land for development in both France and Australia. Also, we recently purchased our S\u00e3o Paulo one IBX. Revenue from owned assets remained at 55%, but we expect this percent to rise by the end of the year. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on slide 10. Our now 148 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Also consistent with prior year, during Q1, we completed the annual refresh of our IBX categorization exercise. Our stabilized asset count increased by net 12 IBXs. These stabilized assets are collectively 84% utilized and generate a 29% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for our summary of 2020 guidance and bridges. Do note, our 2020 guidance includes the financial results from both the xScale and Packet acquisitions. Starting with revenues, we expect to deliver a 7% to 9% growth rate for 2020, a reflection of the continued momentum in the business and includes a negative FX impact of $105 million, net of our FX hedges compared to our prior guidance. Also, we expect revenues attributed to the Packet acquisition for the 10-month period of our ownership to range between $32 million and $40 million. And MRR churn is expected to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter for the year. We expect 2020 adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 48%, excluding integration costs, the result of strong operating leverage in the business, offset in part by the expected higher utilities and property tax expense and a meaningful investment in our go-to-market and product organizations. We expect to incur $20 million of integration costs in 2020, $10 million to integrate Packet and the remaining $10 million to finalize the integration of our various other acquisitions. 2020 AFFO is expected to grow between 11% and 16% compared to the previous year. For 2020, we expect AFFO per share to grow between 8% and 12%, excluding capital market activities. Including capital market activities, we expect AFFO per share to be greater than 8%, consistent with our long-term AFFO per share growth objective, as discussed at our June 2018 Analyst Day. So, let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Keith. Despite the challenges from COVID, the Equinix business is performing well, and we remain focused on the clear set of priorities we laid out at the beginning of the year; investing in our people; evolving our platform and service portfolio to meet the changing needs of customers; expanding our go-to-market engine to fuel long-term growth; and simplifying our business to drive operating leverage; and enhance our customers' experience. As we continue to navigate an uncertain environment, we will remain diligent, flexible, disciplined, and prepared across the company from how we set up our IBX technician shifts to enhance safety to increasing balance sheet liquidity, investing in new service development and hiring top talent to expand our selling engine, all while closely tracking our financial and operating metrics to ensure profitable growth and maintain a keen focus on AFFO per share as a lighthouse metric for the business. As we have in prior market dislocations, we will manage the business prudently with a long-term orientation and a clear objective to extend our market leadership. As our customers continue to make clear, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach and scale of our platform, the depth of our balance sheet and critically, the passion and resilience of our people will not only enable Equinix to weather the storm, but will position us to execute aggressively on the other side of this unprecedented crisis and capture the massive opportunity that lies ahead. So, let me stop there and open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Phil, please check your mute button, your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Richard for Phil. I just want to get a better sense of the bookings through the quarter. Was it pretty steady? Or did it start to fall off at the end? And what have you seen more recently? And then a quick follow-up on Packet. Charles Meyers : Hey Richard. Yes, I think we saw -- definitely saw -- it was quite a normal quarter, I think, for the first couple of months. And then as we as sort of COVID situation became a bit more acute, I think there was uncertainty that created some level of friction. Although, again, we had a really strong quarter across the board generally. But there was, I think, some buying friction in the system, but I would say we entered Q2 with a really healthy pipeline and actually saw strong early conversion of that pipeline in the quarter. And I think right now, we're seeing the early signs of a bit more return to normal and I think what we're also seeing is our selling team really becoming more accustomed to driving sales cycles in this setting. And so overall, we continue to feel good about the bookings productivity of the sales engine. Unidentified Analyst : And then with Packet really quickly, it has a pretty wide range. But I guess, looking beyond this year, should we expect more steady growth? Or can we see a bit more of a hockey stick as it kind of scales out? Charles Meyers : That's a great question. I do think that we can accelerate growth in that business. It's obviously a relatively small business now. I think there's a meaningful opportunity associated with this kind of bare metal private infrastructure immediately proximate to the public cloud. And by the way, I think it really fits well with kind of what people are seeing and how they're responding to COVID in terms of their desire to be able to deploy infrastructure in a more frictionless way. And so we think as we add enterprise feature set, as we extend our partnerships with the software players and platforms like VMware, Red Hat, et cetera, that people have really invested significantly and that it's going to be a real tool for us as people deploy hybrid and multi-cloud architectures. So, I think that we'll have to reset when we give you a more longer-term guide and talk about that. But I do think there's an opportunity for us to expand growth in that offering. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jon Atkin : Thanks very much. So, two questions. One, kind of high level. Any impacts in Europe that you're seeing from the merger involving interaction? And then a second one for either Keith or Charles. We're kind of now beginning in May and where have things settled out now that we're kind of into COVID on pricing. I took away from Keith's comments that pricing is actually pretty healthy, but where are we kind of settling out in terms of the run rate around cabinet adds and cross-connect adds? Thank you. Charles Meyers : Sure. Remind me the first one, Jon, I'm sorry. Jon Atkin : Europe and any impacts you're noticing from the merger involving the interaction, any opportunities with that--? Charles Meyers : Yes, I think we haven't really seen a meaningful change in the competitive environment in Europe, and our demand continues to be strong. I think we're seeing healthy pipeline and healthy bookings as well as strong pricing in the European theater. So, we haven't really seen a meaningful change. We'll continue to monitor that and determine if that's -- if there's any change to that. And then relative to the broader sort of COVID in terms of how it's settling out in cabinet adds and pricing, et cetera. I'll let Keith add here as he wishes. But yes, as we said in the script, I think firm pricing, in particular, in Europe, we're continuing to navigate sort of adjustments in our interconnection pricing very effectively. I mean I think that's given us some nice lift from a price adjusted gross booking standpoint. I think cabinet adds, you saw Europe was a particular oddity caused by basically something that happens every now and then, which is a pull forward from cabinets into Q4 from Q1 and a push out for cabinets out of Q1 into Q2. And so I do think you're going to see -- we saw a very strong Q4, and I think we're going to see a strong Q2. But obviously, we saw a weaker Q1. But I don't think that's a reflection on demand. I just think that's one of the things we've always encouraged you to look at sort of rolling four-quarter averages on cabinet adds. I think cabinet adds are going to be slightly lower, particularly in Europe, maybe as we continue to adjust our mix. Because if you look far enough back, you saw quarters where there were really large cabinet adds in there, associated with hyperscale type deals. We would really prefer, obviously, to direct that business to the xScale JVs and keep our capacity and our capital applied to the very high-return retail business. And so I think that will impact cabinet adds to some degree, but that's fully contemplated kind of how we're guiding in the business, and we think it's going to, again, have favorable impact on other core operating metrics. Keith, anything to add there? Keith Taylor : Charles, just further to your comments, I'd make the comment that we saw not only strong pricing in Europe, we saw it across the platform, which is important, Jon, as we think about our business. We talked about the fact that there's net positive pricing actions. Again, it's not just Europe, but again, it's across the platform. And it gives us confidence that we're continuing to see, on a currency-neutral basis. Clearly, there was some currency impact to the metrics which we share in our earnings deck. But overall, we're delighted with what we're doing. And part of what Charles also alluded to and we talked about it, Packet and some of our other service offerings, it is our view that it will continue to add value on a per cabinet basis. I think there's going to be a higher attach rate, and I think interconnection is going to continue to be strong. And all of that sort of lends to a more positive pricing environment for Equinix. Charles Meyers : Yes. And I might add -- I might, Jon, have just one more bit of color that kind of bridges between your question and Richard's prior question. What we're finding from a booking standpoint and overall selling productivity is a bit of kind of puts and takes. There's been -- as I said, there was some friction associated with sort of, I think, the near term towards the end of Q1, we're getting back to where people are adjusting, and we're seeing some relief on that. But interestingly and perhaps counterintuitively, we're seeing greater access to decision-makers. Decision-makers are kind of having -- maybe having a different schedule phenomenon, and we seem to be having greater access to decision-makers and seeing a greater resolve on their part to make commitments to move forward aggressively with their digital transformation needs. Now, I think it may mean some delays in some cases, just out of, again, depending on the sector and depending on how acute their other issues might be. But if anything, we're seeing a greater level of resolve in terms of how they're thinking about digital transformation. So, it's a bit of puts and takes. But again, I think we're off to a strong start in Q2 and feeling good about the pipeline. Jon Atkin : If I can squeeze one in for Keith just on the variability in maintenance CapEx. It was quite significant, and you talked a little bit about that. But what's kind of mix of that bucket? And what's the -- I guess, what were the surprises around that, that what were the normalized levels that you're kind of leading us towards? If you maybe review what makes that up and what's the source of variability of going forward? Thanks. Keith Taylor : Sure. Yes. We did see slightly less this quarter than we anticipated, roughly 1.2%. If I go to the same quarter last year, it was 1.5% of revenues. Meaning, certainly, as we're all aware during the latter part of the quarter, things started to slow down a little bit. We also were putting our IBXs into a more restricted fashion. No surprise as things took root in different parts of the world. But all that said, when you look at our overall guidance, we're still looking at somewhere around $150 million to $160 million of capital that will go into recurring and only a portion of that, of course, is maintenance, roughly 2% of our recurring CapEx is maintenance. And so you'll see it go back to a more traditional level in Q2. That's reflected in the guidance. And then for the year, you'll see it. Roughly a little bit lower than we saw last year, but roughly in line with what our expectations would be on a go-forward basis. Jon Atkin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Frank Louthan : Great. Thank you. Two questions. One, any of the recent strength coming from business you think might be being pulled forward as customers are kind of grabbing some space, it could impact the back half. And then what do you think the conversion rate will be on virtual cross-connects as you've been doing well with those and as folks are signing those up and then converting them into more permanent facilities. Thanks. Charles Meyers : The -- Frank, I'm sorry, I lost the first one again. These double questions are killing me today. Frank Louthan : Yes, just any recent strengths that you've seen, do you think any of that's coming from business that might be pulled forward from, say, the back half that could maybe cause a headwind then and-- Charles Meyers : Yes, I'm sorry. Yes, I don't think so. I think that I think we're seeing that as a response. I think the question of whether or not the demand that is creating that will be sustained over time. I think that's a reasonable question. And -- but I think for the most part, people are generally, they design their networks with a certain amount of headroom where they design their overall delivery systems with a certain amount of headroom. The work-from-home obviously chewed up a lot of that headroom and people had to scramble to add capacity. I think we were incredibly responsive in helping people do that. But I don't think that -- and I think there's some chance that the headroom increases as we moderate more towards a new normal. But I don't think it's going to -- I don't think it will have a huge impact because I think it was more of a burst that we saw there offset to some degree by other factors. And I think we're just kind of going to normalize, hopefully, more so in the back half, again, barring any kind of second wave or any other strange dynamics. So -- and I don't think from a capacity situation, I think most markets were in very good shape, and not worried about parting ways with that capacity in terms of creating constraints in the back half. And as for interconnection, again, I really feel good about the way the business is trending. We were more towards the low end of what we were guiding in terms of total count, but we had a very strong gross adds quarter, the strongest in several years. And -- but we also had some elevated churn associated with some network grooming, both seen 10 to 100 migrations and some consolidation activity in terms of people who are undergoing acquisitions and consolidating networks associated with that. But the virtual cross connection, we think people -- one of the things we talked about in the script is ARPU going up, and that's a real reflection of people buying ports. And then provisioning cross-connects and driving traffic on them in ways that are increasing the ARPU on a per-connection basis. And so we're actually seeing that right in line, if not better, than our physical cross-connects. And so we're really, really pleased with the overall trajectory on the ECX Fabric. Frank Louthan : All right, great. Thank you very much. Charles Meyers : You bet, Frank. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Rollins from Citi. Your line is now open. Michael Rollins : Hi. I have two questions; I'll break it up into two parts. The first one is just thinking about the disclosure that your channel I think, you said was 30% of bookings this quarter. I'm curious, is that what's driving that strength? Is it the enterprise interest in adoption? Are there other things that are driving that up? And what kind of visibility do you get into the pipeline that the channel is looking at versus your own sales force? Charles Meyers : Sure. Is that -- was that it? Or do you have another one? Michael Rollins : I was just going to ask for a clarification also. When you described the zero to $50 million revenue impact from COVID-19. Earlier in the conversation, I think you mentioned Smart Hand fee waivers. And was curious if that range is only waivers for Smart Hands services? Or are there some other things that were just anticipated in that guidance impact range? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Sure. I'll take the first one, and then Keith can comment on the second one, and I'll add as appropriate. So, channel, yes, again, very excited about the momentum we have in channel. And I would say it's largely attributable to the enterprise market, Mike. We -- I think that's where we're really seeing the effectiveness of our channel partners in terms of reaching enterprises with whom they have long-standing relationships, existing contractual vehicles, et cetera. And then also with some of our channel partners, where we're combining our value with theirs to create a full customer solution. And by the way, the hyperscalers fall into that category as well, as they have now seen a very clear sort of signal of the demand for hybrid cloud. If they're seeing a sales cycle being restrained by the need to satisfy the private portion of the hybrid cloud requirement, then they're coming to us, bringing us in and allowing us to help them get that resolved so that they can really satisfy the public cloud demand. And so we see it across a range of channel partners and also across a range of verticals, but really combining our value with that of our partners to solve end customer needs. And in terms of -- but definitely very slanted towards the enterprise. And then in terms of visibility, what I would tell you is that today, we are primarily what I would refer to as a sell with channel. So, we are still in the relatively earlier phases of channel maturity and we're not yet at a point where, generally, people are selling the Equinix value proposition on their own. They're typically engaged with the client, a customer. They engage our sales team. We sell jointly. We comp our direct rep as well as the channel partner, a little bit of cost in there, but really quite modest when you consider it relative to the total customer lifetime value. And so we are getting really good visibility. And of course, they have to register deals to get paid. So, we get really good visibility to the overall funnel on the channel side. So, Keith, I'll let you handle the sort of the discussion on the revenue guide. Keith Taylor : Sure. The second question, Mike, the zero to $50 million that Charles commented in his prepared remarks vis-\u00e0-vis the revenues. It's really a reflection. There's a lot going on with the global pandemic, and there has been some uncertainty that's created. Having said that, we had a really strong Q1. Charles alluded to the fact that we have a very, very healthy pipeline, and we've had a great start to Q2. And so we recognize that. All that said is, when we think about the scenario planning, which we and I assume many others are doing, what are the potential implications on the business. And of course, we've thought about different things. Could there be an extension of the book-to-bill cycle? Could there be a weakening of the pipeline? Again, we haven't seen that yet, but these are examples. And hence, as you look forward in understanding what are the overall implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, we sized it of $0 to $50 million. Now, having said that, the first quarter, we've absorbed $3 million already. That $3 million, $2 million of it relates to Smart Hands that we basically in certain cases, with customers will offer free Smart Hand services because of the restrictions that were placed on our IBXs, and then there was a small sales allowance that we put in place. As we look forward, we're going to continue to offer those on a selected basis to certain customers Smart Hands. And therefore, on a go-forward basis, that will continue for some period until we have better clarity on how, if you will, our business and the rest of the businesses around the world will open back up. And then other things that we've thought about are what are the implications on customers on whether we need to make concessions as it relates to invoices that have already been generated, to write-downs to companies that go out of business, and we've reflected all of that. And hence, when you look at the revenue guidance page that we delivered in our earnings deck, you have a pretty good sense of what the scenarios are that we could plan for here. Yet having said all of that, we're going to run the business to deliver against our AFFO target at the midpoint or better. And so that sort of gives you a sense of what we're anticipating. But right now, the most concrete thing I can tell you is that there's selected -- sorry, select cases where we're delivering Smart Hands for free to our customers to certain customers. Charles Meyers : Yes. And Mike, I mean, obviously, just it is more than -- that range is impacted by more than just as Smart Hands, as Keith indicated. And it was just argued that given the uncertainty about the depth and duration of exactly what we'll see here, that it was prudent for us to give a -- consider those other items like book-to-bill and some modest level of concessions. And try to size those and say what could that impact be during the course of the year and let's adjust accordingly. But again, we're feeling good about the early start to Q2, feeling good about the discussions we're having with customers, which are quite limited relative to concessions, et cetera. And so we're feeling good about where we're headed. Michael Rollins : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question will come from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. Good evening. I wonder if you could update us a little bit on the xScale progress. How are things going with the initial JV? Nice to see the latest signing here. And then just continuing on the previous theme, you had churn at 2.4, you reiterated the two to 2.5 range. Do you think you're likely to remain at the upper end over the next couple of quarters? Or whether it was that more the onetime items that you were calling out, so you might go back down to where you've been in the last couple of quarters? Thank you. Charles Meyers : Sure. So, xScale is going well. I think there's lots of demand. It's a complex business in terms of both the construction side of the business and all that comes with building large-scale projects like that as well as the sort of demand side of the business and dealing with very -- certainly large and important and strategically critical, but also very demanding customers. But the -- I think that they've always demonstrated a strong appetite for us to be satisfying a portion of their large footprint demand. And so we're very engaged with them and seeing a strong pipeline not only for the projects that we already have underway or built out, but for new markets as well. And so very healthy and vigorous dialogue with customers. And as I've always said, it wasn't our -- we aren't planning to be really chase after market share at all costs and hyperscale. Our view is work to generate -- work to win the market demand that we think is critical to cloud ecosystem positioning and we think we're -- we feel like we're being very successful in those conversations. And then obviously, we're very excited about the Japanese JV. We think it's a terrific market. We think we're well-positioned. We think that supply is going to be somewhat scarce and difficult. And we think -- and therefore, we've had a lot of interest in the capacity that we're projecting to bring to market. So I really feel good about that. And again, as Keith indicated, we're underway with additional JV conversations in other parts around the world as well already. Relative to churn, again, we did have some churn that impacted the EMEA cabinet adds and brought us a little bit towards the higher end of the range. But I think two to 2.5 is -- we're just -- we're comfortable in that range. And we, of course, are doing everything we can to manage that towards the bottom end. But I would just reiterate, we're comfortable with that range. Simon Flannery : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question will come from Ari Klein from BMO Capital Market. Your line is now open. Ari Klein : Thanks. Chuck -- Charles, you mentioned some friction in the enterprise. How challenging is it to add new logos in the current environment? And what are you doing there to kind of help with that? And then some of the -- you mentioned network grooming impacting cross-connect net adds. Was any of that related to COVID? Or is it unrelated? Charles Meyers : Sure. Yes, we did see -- we actually had a good quarter on new logos, and we tried to unpack that in terms of was that in the first two-thirds of the quarter and what do we see in the back half. And it was lighter and I would say our bookings from new customers was slightly less than it has, but not in a meaningful -- a particularly material way. I do think it's harder. We're finding that we're having to learn a new set of skills around being able to get an account over the line fully without the physical interaction. But I think we're already seeing that take root. And we've already actually given our sales teams, a number of new tools to be more effective in that setting. And so I think if there is that -- but obviously, there is some level of friction. And I think we just need to be cognizant of that. And that's why when we talked about the bottom end -- widening the bottom end of the range a little bit; it really reflects some of that. And our hope is that we are -- we return to some form of normal sooner rather than later. But even without that, we feel like the sales team can be fairly productive. But there is some level of friction in new logo capture undoubtedly. And then relative to network grooming, it is no, we did not see it as COVID-related. It was associated with some additional 10 to 100 kind of migrations and then also associated with some network consolidation associated with prior acquisitions. And so we saw a little bit of a and it's not atypical. You usually see a slowdown in Q4 because of the sort of network quiet periods. And then you see some of that activity sort of take place in Q1. So, not particularly surprising to us. And as I said, I do think that we're probably at a point now where a lot of the initial bump of 10 to 100 kind of went through with some of the largest players. But there's going to be a continuation of that as -- because the minute it becomes economic for somebody to upgrade electronics based on their route analysis, they're clearly going to do that. So, there's going to be a little bit of that in there, but we feel really comfortable with that sort of $7,000 to $9,000 per quarter guide and the gross adds are particularly encouraging. Ari Klein : Great. Thank you. Charles Meyers : You bet. Operator : Our next question will come from Colby Synesael with Cowen. Your line is now open. Colby Synesael : Great. Thank you. Two follow-up topics. One is related to a question, I think, Jonathan Atkin had asked. When you think about your bookings for the full year in the new environment that we're in versus what you may have thought they are going to be entering the year on January 1st. Do you think with all the puts and takes that you expect bookings to be down, the same, or up today versus what you would have thought on January one for the full year of 2020? And then secondly, as it relates to Rollins' question on the $50 million, I know in the disclosures, you mentioned Remote Hands. But given the number that was in the actual first quarter, I think it was $2 million versus the $50 million, it seems like it's obviously a lot more than that. Am I fair that -- am I correct that you're just really trying to be conservative and give yourself kind of a plug, if you will, for what could be happening, but it's not necessarily something that you're seeing right now and, therefore, actually could potentially be a source of upside as we go through the course of the year. And then lastly, just a housekeeping question. You guys are supposed to have your two-year Analyst Day coming up in June in New York City. Just curious what the expectations there are? Thank you. Charles Meyers : Great. Let me comment on the first one, for sure. I'll give you a little bit on the second one, maybe Keith can add in, and then I'll ask Kat to maybe jump in and talk about the status on Analyst Day. But in terms of bookings, as to if we looked at it and said, what's our is our expectation now that it's going to be the same, better or worse than what we would than what we thought be coming into the beginning of the year. Obviously, I think by virtue of the fact that we've widened the bottom end of the range and, therefore, slightly lowered the midpoint on our revenue guide; I think we're indicating that there will be risk balanced towards the downside in terms of bookings and revenue. But that, that risk is actually fairly modest. And so I think that would be the way I would characterize it. Again, we've very strong Q2 strong Q1 bookings, strong Q2 pipeline, where we see signs of sort of friction and some of the factors that were impacting us sort of at the peak of COVID beginning to moderate. And so our hope would be that we -- we'll see that, that risk will dissipate. But I think that's an accurate characterization is that since we lightened the bottom end, we would see a little bit more downside risk from what we had originally planned. But I also think there's opportunities for us to continue to close those gaps during the course of the year, which kind of brings me to the second question, which is, is that all one? Reiterating it is in all Smart Hands, it's a portion of that. If you -- as Keith said, a couple of million made in the quarter. But obviously, it was a relatively short stub period. Should that occur throughout Q2, Q3, and Q4, we would see, obviously, more than that, which would contribute to a meaningful portion of that $50 million but then there's other things in terms of potential book-to-bill delays, concessions and sales reserves, et cetera, that might also impact that. And so I think it was our best judgment about how to reflect what we thought the risks were by opening up the bottom end slightly and leaving the top end. In that if things mitigate quickly, we get back to a more normal environment that -- and the business continues to perform well even in this environment, that we think we can close those gaps. So, that's kind of what I would say. Keith, I don't know if you have anything to add on that second topic? Keith Taylor : I think it's well said, Charles. Thanks. Katrina Rymill : And then, Colby, to your question on Analyst Day on -- so as you can appreciate, given that all is going on, we will be moving our Analyst Day back. We absolutely love hosting our investors out of New York. We typically host a very large event, but given COVID, we will have to push back. In the meantime, Chip and I are going to be increasing the amount of reach outs all virtually, but were aimed to increase amount of conferences, the times and engagements, and looking forward to having a very active May and June with our investor base. Colby Synesael : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Jordan Sadler : Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on a couple of other questions or topics that have been discussed. First, regarding concessions and/or collections looking into April, either with regard to the $50 million or otherwise. The have you seen or have any requests from some of your customers? And can you quantify either number of requests or percent of rent reflected by those requests to date? And then separately, just touching back on the book-to-bill. What -- can you quantify maybe any delays that you've seen as a result of COVID or as a result of the lockdowns related to COVID, directly as it relates to book-to-bill? And then coming back to the churn, specifically in EMEA, what was that attributable to specifically, if you could add a little bit more color? And then on the timing in the quarter, that would be helpful. Thank you. Charles Meyers : Sure. That's a lot, but I wrote it down this time and I make a note so I can remember it. Keith, maybe you can start with the first pieces there on concessions and collections, et cetera. Keith Taylor : Sure. Jordan, as you can appreciate, still pretty early in the process. As we've referred to, it was really the latter half of the quarter where we start to feel the more larger impact to the pandemic. Having said all of that, our Q1, when we reported out, our DSOs actually improved, particularly in Europe and particularly for those extended terms. And so our DSOs dropped one full day to 42 days. So it gives you a sense that our collections continue to be very strong. You'll see in our 10-Q that we report that are actually our even though our revenues went up, our accounts receivable went down quarter-over-quarter. So that gives you a sense really that right now, we don't see it as an issue. As we look into April, we still don't see it as an issue. And now that we've closed April, but we have a pretty good idea on how we're coming in, in April. And as Charles and I have both alluded to, we feel pretty good about the first month of the new quarter. As it relates to concessions, absolutely, there are customers out there that have asked for concessions. But do remember, our top 50 customers represent 40% of our business, and you know who our top customers are. And so it will be at the far end of the tail, typically that customers will be asking for some type of concession. I to be honest, I don't have the visibility given that it just hasn't amounted to anything significant at that point at this point in time. But we are assuming that there will be customers who will eventually ask for concessions or who already have asked for concessions. Just like you're hearing out in the marketplace from our peers and other like industries. So why don't I stop there, let me pass it back to you, Charles, just on the-- Charles Meyers : Yes. And then maybe on the -- you like to ask for a little maybe more specifics on the book-to-bill. We do see occasionally, some people saying, hey, we were scheduled to implement this and begin billing on this commencement date. Obviously, we're not comfortable having our teams out there to finish that deployment. We'd like to push that out a bit. And so I think there is some of that, again, fairly limited in the grand scheme of things, but I think those are the types of things that we think we -- and we do see some of those. And we're accommodating those requests because we think that's the right thing to do given the situations. But there's a relatively small number of those. And then relative to the churn and EMEA, there was some large footprint churn. I think it's pretty -- it would be pretty typical indicative of it. As I said in our -- in my prepared comments, maintaining our commercial discipline, continuing these were really larger footprint deals, lower-yielding returns on capital and the kind of things where you do continue to see people re-architect towards different solutions. And so nothing particularly surprising there, but a couple that hit in the quarter and caused both a reduction in -- or an increase in churn and a reduction in cabinet adds. But of course, those cabinets go right back into the hopper. And we intend to resell them at a significantly higher price point and margin profile, given what is a really favorable trend on mix of business in EMEA. Jordan Sadler : Thank you. Charles Meyers : You bet. Operator : Our last question will come from Erik Rasmussen from Stifel. Your line is now open. Erik Rasmussen : Yes, thank you very much. I'll keep it brief then. Just on the JV announcement for your xScale data center built in Japan, can you just comment on how you see this changes your opportunities across the region and your market position? And then with that, who do you see as your biggest competitors in the region? And then just the follow-up there would be, I know you've been focused on international markets, but at what point do you see the U.S. becoming more interesting? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Yes. I mean, we feel really good. I would say that the -- look, we view ourselves very much as a global platform. And so continuing to extend the strength our strength in key markets around the world and being able to meet a more comprehensive set of our customers' needs across a variety of solution requirements, including the very large footprint, just we think increases our overall global position, not obviously, in market, in Japan, and we think that, as I said, I think given what we see as potential supply constraints in that market and what others customers are seeing as potential supply constraints, we feel really good about our ability to generate utilization and bookings and, therefore, strong returns from our Japan JV. But it is part of a much bigger picture. We have an incredible business in APAC. Being able to serve customers in the primary sort of APAC markets that they're looking to deploy and is a key part of our strategy, and we're excited about the overall trajectory there. And then in terms of the U.S., looking more interesting. Again, I think it continues to be a very highly competitive market with some markets like in Ashburn, for example, at the large footprint end of the spectrum being, I think, in an imbalanced supply and demand situation, which is highly pressuring prices, et cetera. We feel very fortunate that we maintain a very different franchise in Ashburn and have seen tremendous health and strong price durability in our Ashburn -- in our business in Ashburn. But I think our appetite in the U.S. will be more limited for sure. Although I do think that we look at a campus like Dallas with having the potential to add large footprint capacity in immediate proximity to the Infomart, that is a very unique proposition that we would sort of resonate with. So -- but we're going to be very selective there just because we think there's other better opportunities for us around the world. Erik Rasmussen : Okay. Thank you. Charles Meyers : You bet. Operator : That concludes our Q1 call. Thank you for joining us.",

Also, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'd now like to turn the call over to Katrina Rymill, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Katrina Rymill : Good afternoon, and welcome to today's conference call. Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking in nature and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those statements and may be identified by the risks we identified in today's press release and those identified in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 21, 2020 and 10-Q filed on May 7, 2020. Equinix assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or comment on forward-looking statements made on this call. In addition, in light of Regulation Fair Disclosure, it's Equinix' policy not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. In addition, we will provide non-GAAP measures on today's conference call. We provide a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a list of the reasons why the company uses these measures in today's press release on the Equinix IR page at www.equinix.com.

We'd also like to remind you that we post important information about Equinix in the IR page from time to time and encourage you to check our Web site regularly for the most current available information. With us today are Charles Meyers, Equinix' CEO and President; and Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call within an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow on questions to just one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As we all continue to navigate various health, economic and social changes occurring in our world, our key priorities remain clear, focusing on health, safety and well being of our colleagues, customers and communities, and enabling our customers to respond effectively to the increased urgency of digital transformation as a critical business priority and a driving force in the global economy. Even in the face of an uncertain macro environment created by the global pandemic, the Equinix business continues to perform well, in our relevance in enabling digital business and conductivity remains a core tenet of customer purchasing decisions. In Q2, we delivered the third best gross bookings in our history driven by a record quarter in the Americas continued strength in channel bookings, robust inter connection performance and high volume of small deals. Our expanding go-to-market engine continues to fuel the business generating over 4200 deals in the quarter across more than 3000 customers. And the importance of our global reach continues to shine as our customers scale and expand across the globe, leveraging our platform across 56 metros in 26 countries. We're continuing to increase the scope of customer deployments and customers operating in all three regions now represents 62% of revenue, up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our organic expansions continue opening Hamburg this quarter and adding Bordeaux as a strategic subsea landing location in support of a key hyperscale. And we're using disciplined M&A as a tool to enter new markets and scale our platform. On June 1, we announced our intent to acquire 13 Bell Canada data centers, expanding our coverage in Canada to a national platform and unlocking opportunities for global corporations to capture growth and innovation in the Canadian market. This acquisition which is expected to be immediately accretive upon closing Q4, reflects Equinix has continued commitment to executing platform enhancing acquisitions on financially attractive terms. Before we get into the detail quarter of the results, I want to share a few thoughts on our commitment to social change and our continued work to build a culture and community that can have a meaningful sustainable impact on the future of our society. Recent events in the U.S. have triggered outrage and an outpouring of emotions around the world. We have actively tapped into this energy fostering a rich and inclusive dialogue on the topics of equity and social justice, with a focus on improving our collective understanding of each other and creating a commitment to action, which is imperative to moving us forward positively as individuals, as a company and as a society. While still early in our journey, our vision remains clear for Equinix to be a culture where every employee, every day can truly say I'm safe, I belong and I matter. And for our workforce at all levels to better reflect and represent the communities in which we operate. We acknowledge that we have work to do in achieving this vision but are fully committed to demonstrating measurable, enduring progress against a multi-year strategy and continue to believe that our culture remains a key competitive differentiator. Our approach includes traditional aspects such as diversity targets, bias training and mitigation, community plan the programs and employee mobilization. But we also believe that lasting change will only happen by pushing ourselves even further in our pursuit of becoming a truly equitable and global organization. Our objective is to continue to make our culture a critical competitive advantage, seeking to engage every leader and every employee at Equinix and integrating diversity, inclusion and belonging in every aspect of how we run the business. As a company, we will continue to put in the work and reaffirm our commitment to cultivating a workplace in a society that embraces and vigorously defends equality and diversity. Now turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3 revenues for the second quarter were $1.47 billion up 8% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was at 9% year-over-year and AFFO was again meaningfully ahead of our expectations. Interconnection revenues continue to over index substantially, growing 16% year-over-year, reflecting the important role of interconnection in digital transformation and highlighting our clear market leadership in this area. Unit volume was fueled by growth in provision capacity to support increased traffic and solid new product performance reflecting our ability to meet the evolving connectivity requirements of hybrid and multi-cloud architectures. These growth rates are all in a normalized in constant currency basis. We now have over 378,000 interconnections and we continue to see healthy expansion of our dynamic ecosystems across the globe. In Q2, we add an incremental 8000 interconnects driven by streaming, video conferencing, enterprise cloud connectivity and investments in local aggregation to support work from home. Internet exchange had one of its best quarters ever with peak traffic up 44% year-over-year as the peering community augmented capacity for video conferencing, gaming and over the top video replacing headroom that had been exhausted by COVID related traffic growth. ECX Fabric also had a great quarter, eclipsing 2200 participants and demonstrating robust multi-cloud adoption, particularly from network providers with one-third of them scaling bandwidth to five or more clouds. We're also making good progress in integrating the packet business with strong new logo engagement and continue go-to-market integration as we work to deliver on our vision for platform Equinix to underpin the foundational infrastructure for today's digital leaders. We're also strengthening Equinix's leadership position in the cloud ecosystem through expansion of our hyperscale strategy, allowing us to service both retail and large footprint in key markets. While maximizing the efficiency of our balance sheet through our partnership with GIC. We're seeing strong customer demand in our initial xScale JV in Europe and will soon expand this JV to include our seventh asset Paris 9. This facility is slated to open early next year, it is immediately proximate to our market leading Paris campus and its already 100% pre-leased to a major hyperscaler. We're also tracking to close our new xScale JV in Japan with GIC in q4, adding new locations in Osaka and Tokyo. Now, let me cover highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical achieved record bookings driven by robust reseller activity and network expansion to support traffic growth. Expansions included Colt a global telecom provider adding capacity at the interconnected edge to support increasing user demand, as well as Vocus Communications an Australian specialty fiber and network solution provider deploying infrastructure to increase scale and improve end-user experience. Our financial services vertical heads second highest bookings with strengthen global financial and insurance firms as they accelerate digital transformation. New wins and expansions included a leading Nordic insurance company leveraging hybrid multi-cloud and distributed data and Galileo Financial Technologies, a payment solutions platform rearchitecting their network and securely connecting the ecosystem partners. Our content digital media vertical also saw solid bookings with particular strength in gaming and video, driven by the spike in demand for indoor entertainment. New wins and expansions included IOTA, a leading audience technology platform, looking to expand their footprint to serve the ad tech industry. And Moody's, leveraging ECX Fabric to rearchitect their network and multi-cloud access for increased performance. Our cloud and IT vertical also showed strong bookings led by the infrastructure and software sub-segments with continued momentum and cloud adoption. We continue to extend our market leading cloud density adding 10 cloud on ramps this quarter alone, as cloud providers expand services into new metros including Bogota and Mexico City. New wins and expansions included Cisco extending service capabilities to additional regions to support new product offerings and security and client demand for Cisco WebEx communication solutions, and BMC Software, a leading platform provider of digital workflow solutions, deploying infrastructure to support their expanding customer base across the region. Our enterprise vertical saw solid bookings and broad-based demand with particular growth in business and professional services, government and energy despite some COVID-related friction. COVID continues to shift enterprise spending patterns resulting in increased demand for various cloud-based services including telephony, messaging and conferencing.. New enterprise wins include a Swedish engineering company, optimizing its global network to provide optimal employee experience; the global [spirits] [ph] distributed that switch from building its own on-premise data centers to Equinix to support rapid deployment, as well as Fung Group, a global leader in supply chain solutions leveraging ECX Fabric to digitize its supply chain ecosystem. Our channel program had a record quarter accounting for over 30% of bookings and delivering great productivity from this go-to-market vector. The channel program continues to be a new logo engine for the company generating over 60% of all new logos. We had great wins with reseller and alliance partners including Orange business, Cisco, AT&T, Microsoft and Dell, across a wide range of industry segments, with projects focused on both digital transformation and COVID-19 response. New channel businesses quarter included notable wins with AT&T, for a global insurer transitioning from on-premise data centers to a hybrid multi-cloud solution to enhance elasticity and performance and the Vodafone for a premier global energy company supporting their adoption of SD WAN and hybrid multi-cloud enabling. Now, let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Keith Taylor : Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. It's nice to speak with you again. Charles and I, hope you and your families are doing well and staying safe. With respect to Equinix the business continues to perform well. Q2 revenues adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share were ahead of expectations despite disruptions experienced by our customers, our suppliers and partners or employees over the past few months. In the quarter we had significant gross PAG and net bookings including very strong net positive pricing actions. Interconnection activity was very healthy, both as a physical and the virtual level. We're making a solid progress across our new edge services products. Our performance scans our key operating metrics was again positive, including solid increases in our MRR per cabinet and global cabinet metrics. For the quarter, we're tracking against our expectations on COVID-19 related impacts and costs. As expected, there are certain cost trends going both directions and will continue to make the appropriate adjustments to our forecast as needed. And as you've heard us say before, but it's certainly worth repeating again, achieving an investment grade rating and now from each of our three credit rating agencies after Moody's May upgrade has proven to be a highly strategic and valuable milestone, enabling us to access the debt capital markets expeditiously, while broadening the investor base and tightening the credit spreads under issued debt. This is particularly important during times of great volatility and disruption like today. In June, we refinanced 2.6 billion of high yield debt at a blended interest rate of 2.07%, the lowest interest rate ever achieved by any triple BBB minus rated issuer. Interest savings on an annualized basis will approximate 50 million and these savings more effectively offset the dilution associated with their $1.27 billion equity raise in May. We have an active construction pipeline with 29 projects underway across 20 markets in 14 countries and we continue to work closely with our suppliers and partners to deliver capacity as close to the target date as possible. Now let me cover the quarterly highlights and note the growth rates in the section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q2 revenues were 1.47 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year, our 70th consecutive quarter of revenue growth including a $3 million net FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. We've seen positive momentum in the first half of the year driven by strong net bookings and price increases, resulting in a healthy recurring revenue uplift but lighter than planned non-recurring revenues due to the timing of custom work and decreased smart hand revenues. Global Q2 adjusted EBITDA was 720 million or 49% of revenues up 6% compared to the prior quarter, and 9% over the same quarter last year, due to strong operating performance and favorable revenue mix, including a $1 million net FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance range. Global Q2 AFFO was 558 million above our expectations on a constant currency basis, largely the result of strong operating performance. We continue to manage the business in support our AFFO per share goals. Turning to our retail highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. EMEA and APAC were the fastest MRR growing regions on a year-over-year normalized basis at 16% and 10%, respectively, followed by the Americas region at 3%. The Americas region saw record gross bookings but healthy pricing and strong exports to the other two regions in the quarter. The Americas growth rate was partially muted by our decision to waive certain smart hand fees and the timing of planned churn. We expect the Americas growth rate to step up in the second half of the year. We also completed the integration of the Mexico assets and won several key internationally based magnets into our network and cloud verticals, as customers start to leverage the value of Equinix platform into our Mexico markets. Our EMEA region saw strong bookings in the quarter particularly across a number of smaller and emerging markets including Dublin and Madrid. Paris continues to perform well and our market networks were seeing an increase in demand and the tightening of supply, a broad build out addition across the region remains active. Interconnection was substantially up on a year-over-year basis driven by volume and pricing initiatives and billing cabinets stepped up in the quarter. And finally, the Asia Pacific region saw another very strong quarter bookings including a record into our Japan markets and the region enjoyed solid exports particularly into EMEA. APAC interconnection had a strong quarter with many providers scaling network connections for future growth but higher than average net adds and cross connects and inter-metro connections. And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. We continue to increase our operating and strategic flexibility through the management of our balance sheet and capital allocation decisions. Pro forma for the debt refinancing activities, we approximately 2.7 billion of unrestricted cash and investments on the balance sheet, our total liquidity, including our available revolving line of credit of almost $5 billion. We will use this liquidity alongside our capital and balance sheet initiatives to opportunistically expand the business, both organically and inorganically, as we work to maximize long-term shareholder value creation including the benefit of the $1.7 billion equity transaction completed in May, our net debt leverage ratio decreased approximately 3.3x in Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA well within our target leverage range. Turning to Slide 9 for quarter capital expenditures were approximately 482 million including recurring CapEx of 30 million. We had seven openings in Amsterdam, Chicago, Dallas, Hamburg, Hong Kong, Toronto and Washington DC. This included the opening of Dallas 11, a new IBX completed on the Infomart Dallas campus, which is an interconnection epicenter and a major hub for the southern U.S. We announced four new expansion projects the majority of these projects to be developed on own land being Bordeaux, Hong Kong, Milan and Warsaw. We continue to expand your ownership acquiring land for development in both Frankfurt and Manchester markets. For the year, we now expect capital expenditures to increase by approximately 150 million, which reflects the anticipated timing of the closing of the Japan joint venture with GIC. Once this transaction closes, GICs portion of the capital expenditure spent prior to the close date will be reimbursed Equinix and amount that is expected to range between $150 million and $200 million, including certain pre-existing current costs. Revenues from owned assets is currently 55%, a metric that we anticipate will increase over the next 18 months. Our capital investments deliver strong returns as shown on Slide 10, 148 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 84% utilized and generate a 28% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested. Please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for our summary of 2020 guidance and bridges, Starting with revenues, we expect to deliver an 8% to 9% growth rate for 2020 a reflection of the continued momentum in the business and includes a net FX benefit of $23 million compared to our prior guidance range. Non-recurring revenues are expected to remain at these levels for the rest of the year. MRR churn is expected to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter for the remainder of the year. We expect 2020 adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 48% excluding integration costs, the result of strong operating leverage in the business including the revenue mix, offset in part by the anticipated investments on a go-to-market and profit organizations and higher than initially planned severance and benefit costs. We expect to incur $20 million of integration cost in 2020 for the integration of our various acquisitions. And when raising our 2020 AFFO, which is expected to now grow between 14% and 18%, compared to previous year. For 2020, we expect AFFO per share to grow between 8% and 12% including the effects of the capital market activities completed in Q2. So, let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Keith. We're delighted with our Q2 results and are pleased with the continued outperformance of the business a result of our focus on providing customers distinctive and durable value as they embrace digital transformation. Our impact for customers and the financial results that follow as a reflection of the dedication, flexibility and ingenuity of our teams. Over the course of Q2, we like many others had to rapidly adapt our business, adjusting our go-to-market motion of the current realities, evolving operating procedures while maintaining our exceptional service reliability and executing on highly attractive equity and debt deals to enhance liquidity and drive AFFO. Customers remain at the center of everything we do and our customer satisfaction rating moved up the last two quarters to its highest score in the last three years. While we are delighted with how the business is performing, we fully recognize the strain, the shifting challenges and the continued uncertainly we are all facing and as such, we will remain diligent and closely monitoring market dynamics and further adapting our business as appropriate through the back half of the year. The secular drivers of demand for digital infrastructure have never been stronger. And we believe that Equinix is uniquely positioned to execute on the expanding opportunity presented by the accelerating importance of digital transformation and the shift to hybrid and multi-cloud as the architecture of choice. We remain steadfastly focused on evolving our platform to respond to this unparalleled market opportunity. Investing to drive top-line growth, leveraging our operating scale to fuel the AFFO per share growth to our investors and delivering positive impact to our many stakeholders as we continue to build an enduring and sustainable culture and business. So let me stop there and open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open. Tim Long : Wanted to start off with a smaller newer piece of business with packet if I could. Sounds like it's moving along pretty well, just curious, if you can give us an update on how you're moving along with features and the sales force and the channel with the ability to sell the new products? And maybe just a little color with the business that you're doing. Now, if you can give us a sense maybe what kind of customers or applications are being sought out by those to take on this new business for you? Thank you. Charles Meyers : Sure, Tim. Thanks. Its Charles. I guess it's important to have backup and continue to put the acquisition of packet into overall context. I think that, as we have talked about on prior calls, this was a way for us to continue to adapt to the changing consumption patterns of our customers in terms of how they want to sort of gain access to the value, if you will, of the Equinix platform. And I think we are adding the bare metal service that packet brings to the table and integrating that with the bare metal service that we had under development organically, we think is really, really represents a big opportunity for us to continue to adapt to those changing needs. The integration is doing well. We've now aligned on a coordinated and integrated roadmap for and coordinate that into a single offering that we will as a company. We continued to integrate the go-to-market motion. And we've actually taken some folks from within the Equinix organization, blended them into the sales team and have that acting as a bit of an overlay today to our larger sales force, still early days there. And I think probably a lot of the customer activity is with some of the more digitally native targets that packet had traditionally been serving. But we're really starting to see a building funnel of enterprise targets, particularly large enterprise targets, as well as some service provider sort of types that are really resonating with the packet opportunity and that offering. So it continues to go well, again -- still very early days. But one of the things that we've been talking about internal as we talked about delivering physical infrastructure and software speed, which has kind of been a rally crier, a tagline that really resonates with us internally and more importantly resonates with our customers. So, again, a product roadmap is well aligned now, the engineering teams are underway on bringing a fully enterprise features set -- the full enterprise feature set to the bare metal offering over the coming quarters and go-to-market motion still relatively early but good momentum in the pipeline. Tim Long : Okay. In fact, the precursor to a quick follow up you talked about pricing looks like Europe and Asia saw a pretty good MRR per cabinet, ASP growth, could you just give us a little highlight on why you're seeing better pricing there. I'm done. Thank you. Charles Meyers : Sure. The key to pricing for us is really continuing, targeted discipline -- discipline in our sales targeting. And we've talked about that for many years now, right, delivering the -- targeting the right customers with the right use cases into the right IBX locations. And I think we're really doing that well in terms of adapting or delivering against the use cases that are really important to customers right now in terms of hybrid multi-cloud implementations, win [rearchitecture] [ph], distributed security, a number of things that are really highly featured, and I think their digital transformation plans. And when you're doing that, I think you're able to deliver outsized value and therefore get good solid pricing. And we're seeing that show up in our yields. So I think and if you look at it, the way our quarter was composed in terms of bookings, we talked about 4200 deals across 3000 customers, that means we're doing a lot of deals, more sort of small to mid size deals, interconnection oriented, ecosystem centric and that really helps us on the pricing front. In Europe in particular, we're also seeing the effects now as a realtor of the interconnection pricing adjustments that we've made. And I think those have gone really well obviously, generally customers don't jump up and applaud when you raise pricing and your services. But I think in this case, our team has done a really good job of articulating the value that people are getting from interconnection. And I also think we've been very measured and kind of appropriate about how we phased those implementations and those price implementations and working with customers. And so that's far it's gone well, we're starting to really see that roll through -- in the impact on the EMEA numbers in particular. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Atkin with RBC. Your line is open. Jon Atkin : Thanks very much. Two questions. First one probably for Keith. I'm just interested in kind of the medium term margin, puts and takes as we think about where you are in Asia Pac now comfortably past the 50% margin threshold. What are the factors to kind of think about at a corporate level of you getting towards those levels over the next kind of several years? And then I have a follow up on an xScale. Thanks. Keith Taylor : Yes. Sure, Jon. I think overall as it relates to margins, as we sort of said in our prepared remarks, we're very pleased with where we are pleased with where we are, pricing actions have certainly been a net positive to us. So that's representative, it sounds very well in our gross profit, or EBITDA and our AFFO margins. All that said, there is a number of things that are going on in the business. One of the things that we did want to surely highlight was we want to continue to invest in our go-to-market and product organization. And this ties nicely back towards Charles, when we talked about with packet. So there's an examples of where we can continue to drive profitability up. I think Q2 was, I don't want to say it's aberrational, because obviously, it's an outcome of many, many great things including revenue mix, where non-recurring revenue came down and recurring revenue went up, and as a result, we got a favorable mix shift, something that we think will continue for the rest of the year. But the other part is, we want to continue to invest in the business and we think we're on track to deliver against our expectation. Again, I'd refer you back to the June 18 Analysts Day, we believe we can deliver 50% EBITDA margins or greater. I don't think that's ever a question for us, doing it with the right discipline and mindset knowing that we want to continue to invest in the business. And right now we just see a very substantial opportunity, not only in the assets we have today, the ones we're acquiring an example being Bell Canada. And so we'll continue to make those investments and the same time, I think we can continually find ways to drive more profitability in the business if we're not investing in our future growth. Jon Atkin : And then I don't know, Charles, if you would have anything to add to that. But my second question was just on xScale. And I think there have been, maybe some management changes one or two, maybe getting a commentary on that. And it kind of milestones around future JV financings? And then, if you could maybe provide a little bit of color or maybe reminder on the fee structure that you've secured in these agreements, so we can kind of understand more of the impact on AFFO? Charles Meyers : Sure, Jon. Yes, maybe I'll make just a couple reiterate, couple of comments on the margin side and just again, say I think we're seeing, as we've talked about the past, we're continuing to try to look at driving operating leverage in the business. I think we're being successful in doing that. And then, again, we're seeing some positive benefits associated with mix of business, mix shift. And then again, that's balanced against the reality that we want to continue to position ourselves to take advantage of what we think is a really big growth opportunity in front of us as hybrid and multi-cloud really plays out. And so we will continue to invest in the business and that will be both on the CapEx side and the OpEx side, which I think will be a bit of a moderating factor on the margins. But I think we can continue kind of up into the right, in terms of over the long haul. Relative to xScale, things continue to really go well, in that overall, we did have some adjustments. Jim Smith has made the decision to step down from his role as Managing Director of the program that does remain as an advisor to the initiative. And we've asked Krupal Raval, who's been on the xScale team now for a period of time and incredible background and we've asked him to step into the MD role. He's done that and really kept the continuity with the team is recruited in there, I think is incredibly strong, very experienced and is really starting to hit their stride. So it's going well, we've talked about in the script that we are probably likely adding or very soon adding the Paris 9 asset that is 100% pre-leased to hyperscaler. And we continue to see good customer interest in pipeline on the other facilities. The JV in Japan has now been announced. We're working towards closing that later in the year. And then, we're looking at additional JV beyond that, so good momentum overall. And then relative to the fees, maybe I'll let Keith comment quickly on kind of how that's structured and impact on the business. Keith Taylor : Sure. So, Jon, just as it relates to the fees, there's really full and primary fees. So put aside the equity ownership right now. We're treating the businesses both looks like the Japanese JV will be an equity oriented investment likewise, initial media JV. And so the way it works is, there's basically an asset management fee, a facilities fee, a development fee and sales and marketing fee. And when you break those down, some are recurring revenue, some are non-recurring. And then, the benefit we get from the profitability created by the joint venture that comes in below the line through income from an affiliated entity. So that's how it sort of the fee structure works right now, still pretty early on, as you know, because we've just got the first two assets up. Charles alluded to Paris 9 and having that 100% pre-leased. And we're actively engaged across a number of other assets, both in development and also in the marketing of those assets across the platform. So we're pretty excited about the performance that a group is going to cave to take a leadership role and in this entity, so great progress today. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Your line is open. Colby Synesael : Just a few. Last quarter, you called out a zero to $50 million headwind to guidance --revenue guidance for COVID-19. I was wondering what the headwind or impact was in the second quarter. And if you still feel that you're going to be within that zero to 50. And maybe you could tighten that up a little bit, if possible at this point. Secondly, your Americas growth, missed our estimate, I think that was probably one of the weaker parts of the quarter. Keith, I know you mentioned the smart hand wave fees. I think there's just a $3 million impact. And on the churn side, when I look at least the cabinet and the interconnects, both those numbers still went up, yet the revenue came down, which seems just more of a pricing impact. So, I'm trying to get a better understanding there. And then, before Katrina kills me, just one last one. Your previous guidance on organic growth was 7% to 9%. You raised it to 8% to 9%. And I believe that excludes that fact that the only change I saw in your guidance was in fact FX, I'm wondering where that extra 1% to 8% of the loan came from. Thank you. Keith Taylor : Charles do you want me to take the first part. Just want to make sure because we're in different locations, everybody, so we're just making sure that we're going to organize accordingly. Let me first start off by saying look, we're absolutely delighted Colby with the performance of business for the second quarter. And as you know, when we went into the quarter, we give ourselves a relatively wide range, wide berth from zero to 50 and for this quarter as you know, we basically delivered slightly above the top-end of our guidance range. So said differently then we basically got a lot of flexibility through the second half of the year. And we chose to leave it intact other than FX, very similar to what Charles did last quarter, he made the reference to the fact that we're going to adjust for currency and here's a range of zero to 50. And we're also going to hold absent FX, we're going to hold AFFO, we're going to target a midpoint. Well, when we look at the second half of the year, there's just a lot of uncertainty that still remains -- not too much in our business per se. But the reality of how all of the terminal gets manifested into our results. We let that flexibility inside our guide. And so what you're seeing is not per se specific headwind. On the margin, there's a few adjustments that are affecting us. We have seen pretty larger bad debt reserves than we had before but was planned for. I've made some reference to the fact that there's cost going both directions, clearly our travel and entertainment, or is relatively low -- almost zero. But that offsetting that of course, is our salary and benefits cost, less attrition, less paid time off. And we're doing a very good job of hiring the staff that were slated to be hired. It's our salaries are a little bit higher. So I think that sort of deals with perhaps the majority of the discretion other than the Americas. Americas, as we said, relatively flat this quarter. Colby, you're right there is $3 million of smart hand fees. There's also the impact of the Brazilian currency, fairly substantial segregation to an unhedged currency and then, you've got non-recurring revenues. When you look at it from a pricing perspective, though, MRR per cabinet was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. And so we're delighted with where we are, we allude to the fact of pricing strong, good gross bookings, we have momentum in the business. But you also have some things timing of churn and smart hands, plus non-recurring in Brazil all affecting the results. And that's the benefit we get there for having a very global and diverse set of assets that things are going to move around on a continuous basis, in this case, you're starting to see currency trends moving in our favor. And so, albeit we might be a little bit more susceptible to weaker currencies in the Americas. You're seeing uplift in Asia and in Europe. So let me stop there. Charles, you jump in if there's anything you want to add, or if there's anything you need to clarify. Charles Meyers : No. I mean, I think again, I'm on the zero to 50. Obviously, we saw the smart hands impacts across the regions in the quarter as well as, a fairly meaningful impact on our custom MRR and so, but, so the MRR was meaningfully impacted. I think we had a strong recurring revenue quarter bookings were solid. We are seeing some level of friction still out there. But as our results imply the team powered through that and had a good quarter but we have to two sort of big step up quarters remaining in front of us in the back half the year and as we looked at that way and plus I think, very uncertain environment still in terms of sort of second wave, if you will on COVID and the implications of that and how the protracted economic impacts are going to begin to affect companies et cetera. We felt like it was proven to sort of maintain the revenue guidance and just book the FX impacts into there. So that's where we landed. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Your line is open. Frank Louthan : So talk to us a little bit about more in the Americas. We've talked in the past about what's going on with the Verizon space and how that's going and talk just a little bit about that. And then, follow up thoughts on inorganic growth for the remainder of the year and they've already done one deal clearing not shying away. What are your thoughts on those opportunities? Thanks. Charles Meyers : And Frank, I'm sorry, the first one was on Verizon assets. Frank Louthan : Yes. The Verizon assets where you are, as far as, fill that that space out to maximize the utilization there. Charles Meyers : Yes. Again, it's been a good long time now that we've kind of integrated these. So we tend to think about them all as really part of the platform now. So it's tough for us to think about or even, fully measure that but we are seeing good utilization, obviously made some investments into some of the assets. We actually had some really strong deals this quarter into Miami and Culpeper actually. And so we're seeing good progress on some of the very key assets there. Overall, as we said, I think that the Americas business, we expect that to step up to more like a 5% growth rate in the back half of the year. Again, it was a really solid quarter from a bookings perspective. And so overall, I think, with a start, I think really having worked through the issues on the Verizon portfolio in terms of the churn and things that happened there. And seeing that stabilize I think we're looking at a solid back half of the year for the Americas there. And relative to inorganic, I think that, there are plenty of opportunities out there still. We think that -- we're going to continue to have a posture that -- if you really look at it, our strategy remains unchanged, we have used M&A for market entry for market scaling, for sort of capturing strategic interconnection assets and now for sort of capability additions as we look at the future of platform Equinix and what that means. And I think there are opportunities in all those categories. Obviously, the Canadian deal was really an opportunity for us to really scale in a market and reach national presence in Canada. We think there are some other opportunities, in terms of new market entries that areas that we're continued to be focused on, that are potentially actionable out there. And so, and it's one of the reasons really, that we went and did the equity deal is making sure that we kept some dry powder on the balance sheet to be appropriately opportunistic about growth opportunities that present themselves. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open. Michael Rollins : I was curious if you could delve a bit more into what you're seeing out of the enterprise vertical, in terms of the ability for them to make decisions and the growing interest that they manage team's been describing that you're seeing for hybrid cloud architectures. Thanks. Charles Meyers : Sure. Thanks, Mike. Yes, I think that we're seeing a -- there's a few things. One, I do think that we've seen some projects have delayed decision-making, so things pushed out, further in the pipeline. But I think that's been offset to some degree by a broader realization that I think you've heard us and probably many other companies in ours and related spaces, for example, the cloud providers talk about this elevation of awareness around digital transformation and the priority that exists there even in sectors of the economy that are meaningfully impacted by COVID. I think that what people are seeing is that those companies that were better prepared are further ahead in their digital strategies weathering the storm better. And I think that's leading people say we've got to make that investment. In some cases, even if their businesses are a bit on their back, they kind of say, look, we're going to take that medicine, but we're going to invest in the business and in the future, and make sure we're making the digital investments that are necessary. So, that is I think, we are seeing a little bit of sort of both sides of the coin there, which has some delays, particularly new projects that might be delayed just by a variety of factors, including -- taking longer to be able to visit sites, although they are and we are now having tours and visits into the sites on an appointment basis, and so we're sort of freeing up, some of the wheels are turning on that. But there is some of that, if you look at new logos that are a little bit lower than our pre-COVID levels, but we also -- they targeted more at larger accounts with bigger wallet sizes. And so a little bit of a mixed bag, we are on balance, I think, what the enduring phenomenon that we think we're really seeing is this increased commitment to digital and also very much in terms of people saying, look, we still have private infrastructure requirements. We want that private infrastructure over time to be, is probably going to be smaller than what we are doing now. But we need what remains to be immediately proximate to the cloud and deliver both performance and economics in a different way. And we think Equinix really rises to that challenge for them. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matthew Niknam : Just to if I could, first go back to the last question in terms of sale cycles, any notable delays during the quarter that you'd call out that may have deferred some bookings into the third quarter. And then secondly, on the competitive front, if you can talk about the competitive backdrop in Europe, whether you've seen any changes in the landscape in recent months after some of the recent M&A, larger scale M&A in the region. Thanks. Keith Taylor : Sure. As I said, yes, we have, obviously, we've got a very sort of deep command in the pipeline in terms of deals that are in there. We did, there were certainly some opportunities that we had originally, as targeted to close this quarter that pushed out, but that's the case every quarter. Obviously, there's some of that, and but some of those were, you know, that people would chalk up to COVID related sort of delays and decision making. But on balance, when you look at it, you see, our third best gross bookings for quarter ever record in the Americas. Obviously, we've been able to sort of power through some of that and still deliver, strong overall bookings, results. So there's some of that. What we are seeing, I think quite encouragingly is that, those are just delays, they're not cancellations of projects. And at this point, we think it's just a matter of when we're going to bring those opportunities in. So on balance, I think feeling very good and feel like, the team really rallied and delivered an exceptional quarter, given the broader circumstances that we face. In terms of the competitive backdrop, I would say, not a meaningful change, I feel like particularly in, I know, relative to commenting on the sort of post interaction, digital combination in Europe and impact there. I would say it's still very much seems to be in a digestion phase. And I think customers are working to sort of figure out what that means for them. I think employees are of those companies are trying to or now that company are trying to figure out what it means for them. And we're trying to stay focused and deliver and execute effectively while that digestion occurs. And so, I think obviously the performance of our business in EMEA sort of speaks for itself in the quarter. And we continue to as I've always said interaction was always a very credible competitor for us in Europe. And I expect they will continue to be one, but we are right now, I think we're seeing the digestion period and we're trying to take advantage of that while it exists. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simon Flannery : Just coming back to xScale. I think when you were talking about the project, initially, you talked about mid teens type returns. I wonder if you could update us on what -- given you've done some leasing now, you've got a better sense of pipeline and economics. What's your latest thoughts on the return profile on these projects? And just coming back to the enterprises, what's going on the renewal side? What sort of pricing are you achieving on renewals obviously, your pricing commentary has been pretty bullish overall. But, we do see a lot of pressure on IT budgets broadly. And are you seeing any of that coming through in terms of customers trying to get some relief when they renew with you? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Sure. Yes. I would say that relative to xScale and return expectations, I would say that, when you look at it, we obviously get some of the benefit, particularly as it relates to our lens on the returns of both fees flowing through as well as the development returns, which give us a bit of a lift on the returns overall and I think will allow us to continue to have those into the double digits. I do think there is some pressure on returns caused by just an overall pricing environment that continues to be aggressive, I think In terms of people competing aggressively for the hyperscale business and that is out there. So I think there's been probably a bit of pressure there. But I think that it continues to be a very attractive return profile, I think both for us and for our partners. And for us, I think being able to do that with relatively limited sort of dry powder off our balance sheet, which we want to allocate to our higher returning retail business. I think that strategy still makes a ton of sense for us. But I would say some, some downward pressure on returns, it will be interesting to see, whether that persists. I do think that, Keith mentioned for example, there are markets where we see supply tightening. And obviously, that tends to improve pricing. But you do have a very powerful set of customers in the hyperscalers that are looking to sort of get the best available terms. So, there's been a bit of downward pressure there. Relative to enterprise renewals, as I said, what we're seeing I think is generally people are continuing to figure out how they can make most effective use of Equinix in pursuing their long-term, hybrid multi-cloud architectures. And so that might mean that people are downsizing sort of elements of their architecture as they move certain applications to cloud. And then, focusing their private infrastructure or the private part of their hybrid cloud into Equinix facilities proximate to the cloud and are still willing to renew those at what we consider to be very attractive rates that are good for us and deliver significant value for the customer. We do see some sawtoothing, which is because we have escalators -- annual escalators built into our contracts virtually across the board. Oftentimes, when you see a renewal, you might see that if you implemented a 3% to 5% annual escalator over say a five year contract that at renewal you may be above market and you may see a sawtoothing of that occur. But that's all sort of part and parcel that are all included in our overall model, which again continues to reflect overall positive net pricing actions, which we think reflects the value that we deliver for customers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Jordan Sadler : So, just wanted to come back to xScale one more time. It does sound like you characterized the overall bookings solid and seeing maybe a little bit of friction because we talked to maybe overall enterprise. Is that also, that characterization pertains the xScale business as well and was Paris 9 leased during the quarter? Charles Meyers : Yes. I would say the -- I think the dynamics are a little bit different in that, obviously, we're targeting a much smaller set of customers. And so when you look at the xScale dynamics, I think it's a bit more about where are these hyperscalers are in their expansion, how that matches up relative to a sort of capacity where it's needed, kind of element. And so, if you look at hyperscalers, we're actually, if you look at the performance and results of some of the other companies that are more focused on that, they tend to be lumpy. They have sort of a bit more boom and bust in their quarters based on the timing of sale or timing of bookings and kind of where hyperscalers are in their cycles of expansion. And so, I think the dynamic is a bit different. But yes, the leasing was completed in the quarter for Paris 9. And so we were very pleased to get that done. And we do see a strong pipeline, it just takes -- those are a bit bigger more complex deals with longer sales cycles. And I think the results in any given quarter tend to be a bit lumpier. Jordan Sadler : Okay. And then just as a follow up, I think you touched on interconnection pricing in Europe, the adjustment that you've made there, where are you in the rollout of those adjustments and what sort of the magnitude of that pricing adjustment? Charles Meyers : We're reasonably well advanced. I think that we'll continue to see those adjustments flow through over the course of the next year or so because we try to be fair and balanced and not kind of overly aggressive or greedy about how to -- the timeline on which we wanted to implement those as we tried to -- as we talked to our customers and tried to implement something that we thought was fair and balanced. And so it'll continue, I think through the course of -- the remainder of this year and well into in the next year, I think probably through the course of next year as well. But I think we've probably seen, a good chunk of that probably more than -- well, more than half of that roll through and begin into our results, but there is more work to be done. I think it will be a bit slower as we go through the course of the next several quarters. And in terms of magnitude, I forget what the percentage increase was, it was meaningful and that is showing up in the results. But again, you still are seeing interconnection prevailing pricing in Europe meaningfully below what it is in the Americas and I don't think we will be in a point where we will equalize that, but we are making progress in terms of delivering a pricing that's more consistent with the value delivered to the customer. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Nick Del Deo : First, Keith, I want to drill down a little bit more on the EBITDA, which was pretty meaningful. I think you suggested it was a function of revenue mix. And you said you expect those mixed benefits to continue but your guidance implies lower EBITDA in dollar terms, the next couple of quarters relative to Q2 and margins that are quite a bit lower. Was there anything else besides the mix shift that we should be bearing on in like, power costs or anything along those lines? Keith Taylor : Overall, but when we look at the second quarter specifically, we made a comment about price increases across the board. Number one was, good to see ramping, most of that was really focused in the EMEA region. And then offsetting that was non-recurring revenue, you saw the step down to roughly 4.8% of our revenue of non-recurring. And so that comes into different margin profile. So you've got the benefit of those two things happening. So, revenues are roughly at the high end of our guidance range and currency neutral basis, but the mix is favorable. And you saw the benefit of that going to the EBITDA. In addition, we also saw was some moderation in our utility consumption until we got some benefit attached to that. And then, in some of the markets, particularly one I will refer to is Singapore, those making concession due to the current climate. And those concessions come through in a couple of different fashions, is tax abatements, it is rent abatement, in some cases, salary adjustments that is not you don't apply for you allocated and the company was the recipient of certain dollars from the Singaporean government as an example. But overall, I was just saying, we're on top of our numbers, I think the look forward is, as Charles alluded to, it is giving us the flexibility to look at the next two quarters invest in the places that we need to and therefore that's why you see revenues are moving up nicely. But we're also keeping the cost model at roughly 48% pre-integration costs. And that gives you a sense of that we're still spending in the areas go-to-market, new product. The other thing I did, I referred to in one of my prior remarks, salaries and benefits are going up inside the business and that's not because that was something sort of an implication coming out of the pandemic, less people are taking vacation in that and how it gets represented in the financials something that we want to certainly encourage people to do more and more time off. And also just the timing of our hiring, because when you're getting the full quaterization of the hiring, we had a record hiring quarter in Q2, 400 net adds to the business, quarter and that's going to run through the quarter -- the next two quarters as well. Now, last thing, I would say there's some seasonality built into our spent recurring CapEx Q4, more specifically, and that's why you see the impact coming through our guide on the AFFO as well. So overall, we look at on an annual basis, we allocated dollars appropriately, some of it just a little bit more front loaded than originally anticipating, and you'll get the full quarterization impact of it. Charles Meyers : Yes. And I guess, I just reiterate the S&B, that's salary and benefits piece of that which is, we are -- one we were seeing lower attrition. I think that partially due to maybe concerns about the pandemic, also, I think it is just a reflection of people, sort of being very excited about where we are and the culture and what the opportunities in front of us are. But I think that's rolling through in ways and we're hiring -- we're moving forward to hiring plans across both go-to-market product technology because we believe the opportunity is really big in front of us. The net impact of that, in terms of is that, we have more cost on the books, and I think that we're kind of calibrating on that in terms of pace of hiring and that kind of thing. But even if we were at the same sort of targeted number of heads, with the attrition being a bit higher, you get some time in there where it takes to rehire and that sort of keeps things a little lower. So we are seeing a little bit of that. And I think that's part of what is impacting that in the back half the year. Nick Del Deo : Okay, got it. That's great detail. And maybe one quick one on ECX Fabric. I think earlier this year you dropped a node into a partner facility in Belgium. Since first, when you've done like that. Any initial insights into how that's going or updates as to whether we'll see more deals like that. Charles Meyers : Still very early days, we have not seen it. And I think it's obviously happened right in the teeth of the pandemic. So, I think probably still too early to tell there. I would say that I think that more broadly speaking, are thinking about how we want to extend the utility and the reach of ECX Fabric, both within our facilities continuing to do our build outs, align the ECX Fabric closely with our packet offering to make a more powerful edge offering in our own facilities. And then, I think also look to potentially position that as something that could be deployed, in non-Equinix facilities. And so I don't know that it would look exactly like what we did in Belgium. But I do think the notion that we would be looking at extending the reach of the ECX Fabric and ensuring that the ability to use the ECX Fabric as a way to plug back in from -- a bit of a further edge back into the ecosystem, in particular, the cloud ecosystem is something that we are absolutely actively looking at. So I do think that's something that we'll be continuing to monitor and look at how to do that over time. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brett Feldman : It's really just a point of clarification. You've talked throughout this call about an outlook for improved revenue growth in the Americas in the back half of year and last quarter, you were talking about growth -- improving to something in the range of 5% or maybe better than 5% as you were getting into the fourth quarter. I think that's still the -- what's embedded in your outlook based on your commentary. But I just want to clarify that you're still targeting that 5%. And then, whether it's 5% or anything, it seems like it's going to be better and I just want to be sure we understand where the momentum is coming from the extent to which it's in MRR as opposed to non-recurring because if it is on the MRR side, it would seem like you have really good momentum into 2021 as well. Thanks. Charles Meyers : Keith, you want to take that? Keith Taylor : I will take that Charles. So the reference that Charles already said earlier on but in my prepared remarks said the second half of the year and Q3 looks like the quarter that we will achieve that step-up and goes back to your comments. Number one, we saw good pricing, we saw record bookings. We still see some element of churn inside the Americas business for the next few quarters. That all said when we calibrate across the remaining part of the year, we're firmly believe that between the pricing and the momentum of the business, including a strong pipeline, you should see a step up in the growth rates. And that's something that from our perspective, it would carry on into 2021. So early to give guidance on that, but there's no reason why we wouldn't see that momentum continue. Katrina Rymill : That concludes our Q2 call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference. Please disconnect at this time.",

Charles Meyers : Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. This year has been an exceptionally challenging one, as we all continue to navigate the economic, health and societal changes happening in our world. Despite these challenges, we find Equinix in a unique position to help our customers adapt, respond and accelerate digital transformation, a key priority for business across every sector and a critical driver for economic recovery. With over 10,000 customers cultivating and curating ecosystems that enable digital business remains central to our strategy and has been accelerated by COVID, as businesses shift to operating, selling and expanding online. As we respond to these shifts, we remain focused on driving disciplined growth, extending our global leadership and effectively scaling our business. We are augmenting our capabilities and enhancing our service portfolio in targeted ways to expand our addressable market, responding to evolving customer requirements and ensuring that we remain well positioned for the future. We continue to complement and extend our global platform, both organically and through acquisitions, enhancing cloud and network density and offering our customers the richest range of options to support their adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud as the architecture of choice. Platform Equinix allows our customers to more effectively distribute infrastructure, putting connectivity, data, security and applications where they need them and interconnecting them easily to the cloud, delivering the performance required to service increasingly global digital businesses. In October, we closed the acquisition of Bell Canada's data center portfolio, positioning Equinix as a leading national provider in Canada, while giving Canadian customers the global reach they need. We also announced our long-awaited entry into India, one of the world's largest economies and fastest-growing data center markets, and now the 27th country served by platform Equinix. Once completed, our GPX acquisition will add two highly interconnected data centers in Mumbai and will serve as a critical foundation for Pan-Indian expansion. Our global reach remains as important as ever, combining unparalleled facilities-based coverage with integrated systems, delivery and care. This competitive differentiation continues to drive our business, with revenues from multi-region customers increasing 1% quarter-over-quarter to 74% and revenues from customers across all three regions remaining at a healthy 62%. The Americas continues to lead in exporting business to our other regions, as network, cloud, financial and manufacturing customers take advantage of our reach. We continue to deepen our penetration of the Fortune 500 and Global 2000 and the consistent growth of our top accounts demonstrates the depth of our addressable market and the stability of our business despite the pandemic, with over 90% of our top 50 accounts increasing their business with Equinix quarter-over-quarter. As we grow the business, we are also investing in our future, by making Equinix a place that attracts and inspires diverse talent and making sure that our mission reflects our responsibility to leave our world better than we found it. Equinix was recently recognized as one of the top companies for diverse talent and received the 2020 Green Power Partner award from the U.S. EPA, recognizing our contribution to helping advance the development of the nation's green power market. In September, we issued our first green bond offering as a mechanism to further invest in innovative designs and technologies, meaningfully increasing our efficiency and resource consumption to ensure we continue to operate sustainably and advancing our commitment to reach 100% clean and renewable energy across our portfolio. Turning to the quarter, in Q3, we continued to adapt our selling engine, tapping into a healthy demand environment to deliver another strong bookings performance. These results were driven by continued strength in channel bookings, solid interconnection growth and firm pricing. And the quality and quantity of our pipeline looks strong as we close out the year. We continue to instrument and automate our business to support high deal volumes closing over 4,400 deals in the quarter across more than 3,100 customers with a significant quantity of these orders serviced through digital interfaces giving our business superior predictability and creating a huge opportunity to drive attach rates for interconnection and other incremental services. Turning to our results, as depicted on slide 3, revenues for the third quarter were $1.52 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 11% year-over-year and AFFO was again meaningfully ahead of our expectations. Interconnection revenues grew 15% year-over-year as both unit volume and pricing continued to trend favorably. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. We now have over 386,000 interconnections with 14 of our top metros having ecosystems with over 10,000 interconnections and growing. In Q3, we added an incremental 8,500 interconnects more than the next 15 competitors combined, driven by work from home, video streaming, and enterprise cloud connectivity. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 43% year-over-year with a 7% quarter-over-quarter step-up albeit returning to a more normal revenue growth rate after the surge of capacity buying in the previous quarter. Equinix Fabric also had a great quarter eclipsing the $100 million in annualized run rate with over 2,300 customers fueled by broad-based adoption across all verticals and geographies. As cloud adoption continues to accelerate, we are also making great progress extending our leadership in the cloud ecosystem, capturing new cloud on-ramps and continuing to expand our xScale business. We're seeing strong demand for our assets in our initial European JV and are on track to close our new JV in Japan with GIC in Q4 adding locations in Osaka and Tokyo. We've already signed our first xScale deal in Japan, securing a key anchor tenant who will take the full Phase one capacity of Tokyo 12. And in Q3, we toppled the final domino to give Equinix direct cloud on-ramps for all five of the top clouds across 11 of the metros most critical for global infrastructure deployments : Silicon Valley, D.C., Chicago, S\u00e3o Paulo, Amsterdam, London, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo, nine more global markets than any other provider. We continue to adapt Platform Equinix to the evolving needs of our customers. And despite the significant challenges of integrating a new team during COVID, we effectively merged our Packet and Equinix road maps and launched our integrated Equinix Metal offering in four global metros with plans for an additional 10 by early 2021. Equinix Metal is a feature-rich and fully automated bare-metal service giving our customers the option to deploy the physical infrastructure of their choice at software speed across our platform, enabling digital leaders to place infrastructure where they need it when they need it. Equinix Metal is also directly integrated into Equinix Fabric helping enterprises quickly interconnect to thousands of networks, enterprises and clouds on Platform Equinix advancing our vision to make Equinix the world's digital infrastructure company. Now, let me cover highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical continues to be a foundation of the platform, achieving its second best bookings driven by carriers expanding capacity for digital business. New wins with local telcos included Airtech Internet, a Latin American fiber Internet provider deploying a network hub to improve peering and performance; and Mint Telecommunications, a British regional network provider deploying infrastructure for increased performance, security and scale. Our financial services vertical had a solid quarter led by EMEA and the insurance subsegment. New wins included a Fortune 500 commercial bank, simplifying their digital ecosystem, as well as expansion with BidFX, a subsidiary of Singapore Exchange Group adding new colocations for its FX trading solutions. Our content and digital media vertical saw particular strength in markets catalyzed by the shift to virtual, including video, social media and gaming. New wins included Rakuten Mobile, selecting Equinix as the foundation to deliver its communication platform to global operators and enterprise customers; as well as an online real estate brokerage, interconnecting to enrich digital experiences for our customers. Our cloud and IT vertical continued to over-index significantly with strength in the Americas and in infrastructure and software sub-segments as adoption of hybrid cloud continues to accelerate. We remain focused on enhancing our market-leading cloud density adding eight cloud on-ramps this quarter alone, and bringing us to 160 direct cloud on-ramps at Equinix, or 42% market share in our metros. Our enterprise vertical had another great quarter with particular strength in health care and manufacturing. New enterprise wins included health care companies Maxor Pharmacy Services; Sandata Technologies; as well as Guardant Health, a leading precision oncology company. Our channel program continues to deliver great results accounting for over 30% of bookings and generating over 60% of all new logos. We had great wins with reseller and alliance partners including Cisco, Microsoft, Oracle, WWT and Zenlayer, across a wide range of industry segments. Channel partners are also contributing to the success of our new market expansions, we're excited to expand our relationship with Bell Canada, as a strategic partner working to deliver industry-leading joint efforts -- joint offers in Canada and globally. This partnership also allows Equinix to engage with Bell resale partners to build stronger relationships across the Canadian channel ecosystem. Other notable wins this quarter included Alestra in our recently acquired Mexican assets for an upscale retail chain and Capgemini in S\u00e3o Paulo for a Fortune 100 pharma firm, both transitioning from on-premise data centers to hybrid multicloud solutions for elasticity and scale. Now, let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Keith Taylor : Thanks Charles and good afternoon to everyone. I hope you and your families are doing well during these unique times. As Charles noted, despite the challenges in 2020, our team continues to deliver. Equinix' leadership is so very grateful and thankful for the almost 10,000 employees that come to work every day to make Equinix a success. We have a fabulous team and culture. This makes a huge difference. As it relates to the quarterly financials, we delivered another strong quarter with revenues, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO, and AFFO per share ahead of our expectations. We had significant growth in PAG bookings and once again benefited from net positive pricing actions. Performance against virtually every key operating metric was positive. Interconnection activity remained healthy with net adds towards the higher end of our targeted range resulting in strong MRR per cabinet step-ups in each of our three regions. In September, we entered into our third debt financing initiative in less than a year raising another $1.85 billion. We used the proceeds of this debt raise to refinance a portion of our existing debt on a net present value positive basis. Effectively, the interest savings more than offset the redemption premiums and unamortized debt issuance costs creating a financially attractive outcome for the company. As part of this capital raise, we issued our inaugural green bonds demonstrating Equinix' continued long-term commitment to green our data center footprint and deliver wide-reaching environmental benefits not only for ourselves and our communities but also for our customers. And we established a green finance framework that raises the bar for sustainability in the data center industry. This new framework targets elite, gold, or better on new construction an objective to design average annual power usage effectiveness or PUE to 1.45 or better which also exceeds industry benchmarks. To-date our refinancing activities has resulted in annualized interest savings of approximately $125 million. We have another $1.8 billion of debt to refinance which at current rates could result in another almost $50 million of annualized interest savings. Now, let me cover the quarterly highlights. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on slide four global Q3 revenues were $1.52 billion, up 9% over the same quarter last year, our 71st consecutive quarter of revenue growth. Q3 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $13 million benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates largely due to a stronger euro and British pound. Global Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $737 million or 49% of revenues, up 2% compared to the prior quarter and 11% over the same quarter last year meaningfully better than expected due to strong operating performance; favorable one-time benefits including a reduction in COVID-related bad debt reserves given strong customer collection activities; and timing of repairs and maintenance and other spend shifting between our Q3 and our Q4 quarters. Adjusting for the shift in EBITDA between quarters and after normalizing for FX and the Bell Canada asset acquisition, adjusted EBITDA was consistent with our expectations and we expect Q1 2021 adjusted EBITDA margins to return to traditional seasonal levels. Our Q3 adjusted EBITDA performance net of our FX hedges included a $6 million net FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 AFFO was $580 million above our expectations on a constant currency basis largely due to strong operating performance and lower income tax expense but offset in part by higher seasonal recurring CapEx spend. As a reminder, our Q4 quarter typically includes higher recurring CapEx spend compared to any of our other prior quarters. Turning to our regional highlights whose full results are covered on slides five through seven. EMEA and APAC were our fastest-growing regions by revenues on a year-over-year normalized basis at 16% and 11% respectively followed by the Americas region which stepped up to 5%. The Americas region saw its second consecutive quarter of record gross bookings with healthy pricing favorable deal mix and record exports to the other two regions. Americas net cross-connect adds were the highest we've seen in several years while we experienced negative billing cabinet additions in the quarter largely due to timing of churn. Also in the quarter, we experienced the churn of some lower power density footprints in some of our acquired assets. This occurred a quarter earlier than expected. Americas' billing cabinet additions should return to traditional levels next quarter and we expect a larger step-up in the first half of 2021. After quarter end, we completed our acquisition of 12 Bell Canada data centers and expect to close the remaining asset allocated to this transaction in November, positioning Equinix as a leading digital infrastructure provider in Canada, adding seven new metros and 500 net new customers to sell to across the platform. Our EMEA region saw strong bookings in the quarter with a healthy mix of small deals and new logo adds led by our London and Amsterdam markets. Interconnection was substantially up on a year-over-year basis increasing to 12% of the region's recurring revenues due to both strong volume performance and favorable pricing initiatives. IBX asset utilization remains high and more than half of our major expansion projects are being constructed in the EMEA region including four hyperscale projects related to our EMEA One JV with GIC. And finally, the Asia-Pacific region saw another strong quarter of bookings led by the Singapore and Japan markets. We're seeing early traction with our pending acquisition of GPX India with interest across all of our customer verticals for the Mumbai market. We expect to close the GPX acquisition in Q1 2021. And now looking at our capital structure. Please refer to slide 8. Our balance sheet remains foundational to our future success. We ended the quarter with $2.7 billion of unrestricted cash on the balance sheet. Our total liquidity included our unused revolving line of credit of $4.6 billion. Our net debt leverage ratio remains at 3.3 times our Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA. During the quarter we raised a net $197 million of equity completing our 2018 ATM program at an average price of $777 per share. As we complete this year and head into 2021 and beyond, we intend to enter into a new $1.5 billion ATM equity program, which runs through Q4 of 2023 under which Equinix may offer and sell from time-to-time our common stock for working capital and general corporate purposes. As we've stated before an ATM program is an efficient capital-raising tool that we've used to fund our various business initiatives. And we continue to expect to use a balance of debt and equity to fund our future business needs, and we'll continually seek to maximize the long-term value attributed to our shareholders. Turning to slide 9. For the quarter capital expenditures were approximately $565 million, including recurring CapEx of $38 million. We opened three new projects in the quarter, including our entry into Muscat, Oman creating a second neutral hub along with Dubai for the region's networks and subsea cable traffic. Additionally, we added 50 new projects to our expansion tracking sheet, including our first expansion in Mexico following the Axtel acquisition in Q1, bringing our total significant builds to 41 projects across 25 markets and 18 countries, the result of a very strong customer pipeline. Approximately 75% of our major project spend is going to metros generating over $100 million in annual revenues, where we leverage the established ecosystem density and our installed customer base. And we continue to expand the ownership of land for development, including acquiring land in Bogot\u00e1, Frankfurt and Paris. Revenues from owned assets were 56% and we continue to expect this number to improve in the near term. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on slide 10. Our 148 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and generate a 28% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And please refer to slide 11 through 15 for our summary of 2020 guidance and bridges. Do note our guidance includes the anticipated financial results from the Bell Canada acquisition, excluding the Ottawa one facility, which we expect to close in Q4. Starting with revenues. For the full year, we expect revenues to grow 8% on a normalized and constant currency basis, which includes an incremental $39 million compared to the prior guidance through the acquisition of the Bell Canada assets and an expected foreign currency benefit offset in part by Packet revenues being slightly below our prior range and the deferred timing of Equinix custom order work, which we anticipate will move to early next year. MRR churn is expected to be within our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% for Q4. We expect 2020 adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 48%, excluding integration costs an incremental $21 million compared to prior guidance due to the acquisition of the Bell Canada assets and an expected foreign currency benefit. Also we expect to incur $20 million of integration costs in 2020. We're raising our 2020 AFFO, which is now expected to grow between 16% and 17% compared to the previous year through the acquisition of the Bell Canada assets and expected FX benefit and lower interest expense. For 2020, we expect AFFO per share to now grow between 10% and 11%. So, with that, let me stop here and I'll turn the call back to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks Keith. We're very pleased with our results this quarter. And as Keith noted, we're immensely grateful to our teams around the world who continue to keep the customer at the center of everything we do and are delivering sustained performance in the business. Even in these uncertain times companies in every sector are embracing digital transformation as a critical business priority and we are uniquely positioned to help our customers scale with agility and create digital advantage. Our consistently strong bookings and healthy interconnection growth give us confidence in the strength of our digital ecosystems and the depth of the addressable market created by broad scale digital transformation. We continue to invest in our strategy, evolving our platform in response to evolving customer needs, expanding our global reach to accelerate digital delivery, committing to a more sustainable future and ensuring that our culture is widely recognized as a place that attracts, embraces, inspires and develops exceptional and diverse talent. So let me stop there, and open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Thank you and good afternoon. So first I just wanted to touch on what you're seeing in the business and whether or not you're seeing any evidence of the enterprise positioning ahead of 2021 for a possible acceleration vis-\u00e0-vis sort of the digital transformation you referenced in your in the release and your remarks. Charles Meyers : Sure. Yes. No I definitely think we're -- I think we're continuing to see enterprise as a very strong sort of vertical for us and cloud -- both cloud and enterprise which are sort of the two sides of the adoption of hybrid and multicloud as the architecture of choice we're seeing that show up both on the supplier side in terms of really strong cloud performance and on the demand side of the ecosystem from enterprise. And so, I think what I've been really pleased with is our ability to continually generate both new logos and enterprise bookings despite COVID. We've adapted I think very well in terms of our selling and marketing engine, overall go-to-market approach in light of, what is now a largely virtual selling cycle. But yes, I think we are seeing enterprise continue to pick up in terms of their adoption of cloud. And I think we're going to be in a good position to continue to invest behind that. I think we're going to look carefully at the productivity of our sales teams and look to continue to add where we think that makes sense. But I think there's a lot of opportunity in front of us in terms of the enterprise opportunity. And if you look at how we're evolving the platform by adding things like Network Edge; continued success with Equinix Fabric which we talked about is a $100 million run rate business now; and then Packet which we now have in market -- in four markets with 10 more coming. I think those are all opportunities to expand the proposition for enterprises. Jordan Sadler : And then just a -- one point of clarity on the guidance, you touched on a couple of things a couple of factors, but I just want to make sure I'm capturing all of it. The for the fourth quarter the implied AFFO guidance sort of suggests at the midpoint at least about a 15% decline from what you produced in 3Q. And I know there were a bunch of puts and takes. And I think the magnitude is smaller at the adjusted EBITDA line in terms of the decline. But maybe you could just walk us through Keith what's sort of driving that? Keith Taylor : Sure. Like anything in Q3, I mean you can see that we had just an excellent quarter. And I'd like to say that things generally balance themselves out but in Q3 we tended to have more goodies than we had baddies, if you will. And as a result we meaningfully overperformed relative to our guide. So let me try and put that in perspective for you because it -- so again when you look at the year in totality and you look at the margin for the year, we're right where we want to be and then you add an accretive transaction like Bell Canada. We're very -- we're delighted with what's going on and then throw on top of that currency. But as it relates specifically to the operating cost, there's really three main things that have happened between Q3 and Q4. So let me deal with Q3 first. There's roughly $15 million to $20 million of what I'd call favorables. And that favorable comes in three areas. One, repairs and maintenance was lighter than we had planned and because of that we have costs moving from Q3 where you got benefit into a quarter where we typically do more repairs and maintenance as we moved into Q4. So you have a roughly $11 million swing there quarter-over-quarter. The second one relates to utilities. And again no surprise to, I think many people on the call. Utilities does move around a lot. There's seasonality. But we had basically between one-off rebates and other things we had another sort of $5 million of favorable going through the utility line. And then you flip that into Q4 and we're going in the opposite direction where basically we have some settlements with our indirect power purchase arrangement for our sustainable energy. And so, you're swinging about $10 million there. And then the last thing that happened was effectively, as I said in the prepared remarks when we started the year as you might recall in Q1 we had basically a negative hit to revenues of $3 million and $14 million to EBITDA. At that time we took up a very conservative view on basically what the implications of COVID-19 would be on our business. And because customer collections have been very, very strong we're in a position to release a portion of the reserves that we created. And so we had a six -- I think about $6 million $7 million benefit in Q3. But the flip side is, as we move -- as we deal with COVID and the return to office and one-off payments to employees, we're moving to a negative 4%. So all of a sudden you've got everything going from if I could summarize it sort of a net -- a positive sort of $15 million, $20 million in Q3 to a negative $15 million, $20 million in Q4. And that's why I was very deliberate in my comment that once you get back to Q1 we get -- we return to our seasonal norm, if you will for EBITDA margins. So again there's a lot of moving pieces a lot of favorability. And quite openly it's -- I think we've got a conservative guide on our Q4 numbers. But if everything went as anticipated that's what you would see. And yet we'd still deliver against our expectations for the year plus the uptick from currency and then Bell Canada. Long-winded response. I apologize for that. Jordan Sadler : Okay, thank you for all the color. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Sami Badri with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. You may go ahead. Sami Badri : Hi. Thank you very much for the question. I just wanted to touch on first the channel strategy. And you've obviously been doing a lot of trailblazing and creating new connections and new partners and formulating a much more robust sales motion than I think many of us really kind of thought about a couple of years ago. So, I was hoping you could give us a little bit of an update, not necessarily on the percentage of revenue flowing in from channel partners, but more specifically has this channel strategy now formulated to where you guys want it to be? Or is there still essentially a lot more to go with more channel partners to come and to complement your business complement, how you sell through or if you guys are going to continue selling with the channel? Just so we can understand how this could potentially evolve over the next coming years. Charles Meyers : Yes. Great question, Sami. The short answer is, I think, there is a long way to go still. I think a bunch of opportunities are still in front of us. As you've noted you were -- 30% of our bookings coming through the channel, but primarily on a sell-with basis. A lot of success in selling alongside our cloud partners and other technology partners who, I think, have aligned interest on -- sometimes somewhat begrudgingly, but sometimes quite -- in a quite embraced way on hybrid and multicloud as the architecture of choice. But, I think there is a way -- if you really look at it we -- one we probably actually have gone through a pretty normal cycle where we added a lot of partners realized that we weren't probably having that -- it was a smaller subset of them that we're really driving productivity and we've actually gleaned that a bit and more focused on the partners that really make a significant difference in the bookings now. But I think the areas where we have room to go is really finding those partners who have a more sophisticated selling capability and can sell on their own, who can create selling machine then complete this. And then also partners who bring complementary offerings that provide a more complete solution for our customers. And I think we're definitely seeing success and you could see companies like VMware who's a great partner of ours for people who've made big investments in VMware as their tool of -- tools of choice in terms company potential infrastructure within that environment and then sort of marrying that up with the value proposition that Equinix brings both in traditional colo and what we -- they might be doing there, but also with services like the Equinix Metal offering which we just brought to market off the backs of what we acquired with Packet. So I think there's a fair amount of opportunity there in terms of growing the channel and taking it to a new level. Sami Badri : Thank you. And then one quick follow-up regarding just the xScale JV and initiatives. You've clearly had some new announcements in some new regions with GPX in India coming into the pipeline. Is there a potential for taking the xScale JV -- I want to say sales motion or opportunity into regions like in India and into potentially say Latin America where there is high growth and large opportunities for both hyperscale or just very large deals? Charles Meyers : Yes. We -- I think we've gotten comfortable with our ability to navigate some of the complexities associated with these things. As you will recall it took us a while get there on the xScale JVs and get them -- sort of, fully work through all the complexities that come with that. But I do think there's opportunity for us to extend that either directly in terms of just additional JVs which we have commented in this script and in others that we're already well underway on discussions in other markets where we think the JV structure will work effectively. And we think that that includes some of the markets that you described. But I also think there's other ways that we kind of think about potentially over time using, \u201cother people's money\" as a point of leverage in terms of getting financial partners who are really excited about the returns that we could offer and that would give us the ability to gain more runway out of our balance sheet and focus our firepower on the high-returning investments that are really down the middle for us. So I do think there's more opportunity for that there. I think the near-term focus is really going to be on additional markets where we would look at JVs and I think you'll be hearing more from that -- more about that from us in the coming quarters. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. You may go ahead. Ari Klein : Thank you. Can you unpack the performance in the Americas a little bit? Churn was higher in the quarter. Maybe just address that whether or not that's something that could continue. And then you noted the expectation for improvement in the Americas, but how are you viewing the organic growth profile there? And what will specifically drive improvement from here? Charles Meyers : Sure. Keith maybe I'll start and you can add anything that you want there. But look we actually feel very good about the Americas business. We talked about over the last several calls that we expected to sort of return to about a 5% growth rate in the Americas towards the back half of this year and you're seeing that now. As you noted churn was a little bit higher. That was associated Keith actually mentioned that in his script really two larger deployments one that came in a quarter earlier than we thought the other one that was came in as forecasted in terms of churn. But candidly those were both deals that wouldn't have met our commercial hurdle in terms of deals we would have done in terms of our focus on really ecosystem-centric interconnection oriented footprints. And so even though we're seeing some -- we saw a negative billable cabs movement associated with that churn I think as we backfill that with the right kind of business that we're showing we can -- that we can find out there and deliver bookings on, I think we're actually going to get improvement on yields in the facilities that were impacted. So it's definitely a more mature market. We're working hard to continue to drive traction in the enterprise market and seeing good success there. I do think there is organic growth opportunity for us particularly in the enterprise market and also by the way using that selling force to export business to our other regions, which is playing a very, very key role in doing. So I think really that's the quick snapshot in the Americas. And again definitely a more mature market, it has returned to grow pretty nicely. I think we are going to see some of those churns come out that were deals that we wouldn't have really targeted prior. And I think as we stabilize we'll see continued improvements in yield. Keith Taylor : And Charles I would just add -- a couple of comments I would just add to what Charles said is number one when Charles made the reference to the fact these aren't deals that we necessarily would have done ourselves having now churned it -- churned those deals what you've actually effectively seen as our MRR per cabinet increase and it's part of the reason for that increase. The second thing that's really important is we are dealing with a mature market. But two points are worthy of note that were in our commentary. Number one, Americas had one of its best quarters ever. So that's another positive. But the interconnection activity continues to be exceedingly strong and that's on a net basis. And so you've got a very healthy ecosystem that's being developed. Then on top of that we're investing around our new products and services. So I only think over some period of time you're going to see an acceleration of that opportunity but you also will see a higher attach rate. And so despite some of the negatives that you see there are some real positives that are coming down the road. The last thing is in my prepared remarks I did make the comment that the Americas has been choppy. It's been choppy for a few years, but we are anticipating a return next quarter to a more normal billing quarter. And then we do anticipate a more meaningful step-up in the first half of next year. Ari Klein : Thanks. And then just if I can briefly on the Packet acquisition. Can you just talk about what the customer response has been to metal? And then I think if you noted in the guidance that the growth has been a little bit lower than you expected maybe address that too. Charles Meyers : Sure. You bet. I'll tie those together. Yes, we had previously guided $32 million to $40 million. And I think that we're going to come in a little below that prior range. It's really an artifact of a decision that we made in terms of focusing on -- when we first did the acquisition our belief was that we would kind of let the existing Packet offering run for a period of time and then seek to launch a fully integrated Equinix Metal offer in early 2021. But the response frankly from customers was super positive in terms of our intentions to offer metal as an offering. And they were really encouraging us to bring together the feature set that we envisioned in our -- in the organic product that we had underway when we bought Packet. And so we decided to bring the teams together, but then we waited a bit in terms of we wanted to make sure we had the offering in market before we put the real wood behind the arrow from a sales enablement perspective. And so I think that resulted in us being slightly behind in terms of where we had hoped to be from a bookings and revenue standpoint. But if you look at it in terms of what we expect to deliver in Q4 and what that implies on an annualized run rate, about $30 million, it's really not too far off expectation. And I think the encouragement that we're getting from customers about what they believe is possible with the Equinix Metal offering as we enter new markets over the course of the first half for 2021. I think there's great opportunity there. So, we feel very good about it. We bought that business primarily because of the technology and the team and to really give us some credibility in a market we thought was super additive to our value proposition. And I would say along all three of those dimensions it has been what we hoped for. The team is terrific. We've seen very little turnover in that team. I think they're a great cultural fit. They've come together with our engineering team to really develop I think an Equinix Metal offer that's going to be very successful in the market. And we feel very optimistic about the path forward. Ari Klein : Appreciate the color. Thanks. Charles Meyers : You bet. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi. You may go ahead. Michael Rollins : I was just curious as you're getting into the 2021 budgeting process if you could give us a preview on how you're thinking about balancing top line growth with the company's long-term margin goals to get above 50%. And then just secondly, in the quarter, I was curious if you can unpack some of the strengths in nonrecurring revenue sequentially and year-over-year and how to think about that level going forward? Charles Meyers : Sure. Keith, maybe I'll take the first one. You can comment on the second one if that works. You can add anything you want on the budget too. But we're kind of well underway on that. We do believe that it's -- and you've heard from us Mike over the years the same old song and dance if you will which is we really think about this as a long-term -- long-term value creation is our objective and we want to maximize the market opportunity and leverage our significant differentiation to do that. And I think that does require that we continue to evolve our service offerings and our platform to be adaptive to what our customers are asking for. And I think that will require investment. But we also have a focus on continuing to drive operating leverage in our business and converting that into margin expansion. And so, we continue to believe that that 50% is an achievable long-term target and we want to drive margin expansion where we can. I think if you look at the operating performance and the sort of EBITDA levels that our mature markets operate at, it's something that we ought to be able to achieve. And we're very focused on trying to make some investments in automation to drive operating leverage. And we'll -- and then we'll trade-off, when we drop that to the bottom line and give margin expansion versus putting that in and doing things like adding additional services to the platform and investing in further automation. So we'll come back to you obviously with more clarity as we align that, but that is the approach that we take and I do think it's going to be a journey still for us. And my -- on balance I would say I believe the opportunity is such that we ought to continue to invest in the business. And I think it would be a mistake for us not to do that. But we also need to make sure that we don't lose sight of the importance of operating leverage. Keith Taylor : And Michael, as it relates to the second question so this quarter we did -- roughly 5.8% of our revenues came from nonrecurring. In fact, that was a meaningful step-up as you note over the prior year and also over the prior quarter. In fact, we actually did a little less than we anticipated. We thought we'd do $4 million to $5 million more this quarter than we actually did here. That all said, I did make a comment that that deferred custom work that we do as a company will likely push into the first part of next year. And I think it's fair to assume for all the different reasons that somewhere between 5.5% and 6% is a reasonable nonrecurring revenue expectation. We'll certainly update that when we give the full annual guide in February. But that's a reasonable assumption to make vis-\u00e0-vis our nonrecurring revenues. And again, it's relatively -- it's 5.8% on average for the year -- it is for the quarter and it's not meaningfully -- it's not a meaningful departure from where we were year-to-date last year. So I think we're about $245 million year-to-date last year. At this point I think we're about $242 million $243 million year-to-date in 2020. So again, I'm comfortable in the 5.5% to sort of 6% range and then we'll update that accordingly. Michael Rollins : And Keith, just to understand the business activity under those dollars, can you describe what's happening in terms of -- is this representative of some of your customers that can't get to your facilities and they need your Smart Hands or they need your installation services more than they did in the past? Or is this tied to just the normal-course installations and what you're processing? Just curious if you can unpack a little more what that is. Keith Taylor : Yes sure. There's a number of things that certainly go on in that particular line. First and foremost, of course, there is the deferred installation revenue that we realize with every sale that we make. And certainly, there's a drag-along effect. For every MRR dollar we -- that we book there's an NRR dollar as well. And so you defer that over basically the relationship of that contract. Then in addition to that, there are -- at times there's goods for resale. There's custom work that we do as well. And think about a large -- perhaps a large hyperscaler or a large customer who's looking for build-out of their environment. And so we do some of that work and we do a fair bit of the work, particularly for the hyperscalers. And as a result, it can be a little bit lumpy. And it'd be custom cabling and installation work for the customer. So effectively they move in put their servers in or their equipment into their racks and they're good to go but we do all the prep work. Again, it's a great line of business for us. It varies in margin return. Again, we use in some cases our own workforce. But that's a line of business that generates roughly 25% to 30% margins. And it appears on the nonrecurring revenue line. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Colby Synesael with Cowen. You may go ahead. Colby Synesael : Great. Just a few numbers-oriented questions. First off just to make the point. So we should be adding if I'm correct $15 million to $20 million back to our first quarter 2021 EBITDA when we're modeling before taking in the other considerations like seasonality. Is that correct? Keith Taylor : You say -- there's certainly the -- take away the seasonal aspects Colby as you know we have the FICA reset in Q1 and we also have our annual sales conference. So, if you put that aside and that's why I wanted to say back to traditional seasonal margins. That has ranged anywhere from 46% to sort of 48% to give you a sense over the last few years. But suffice it to say there absent any investment that we'd make given Charles' comments that is -- you're talking about $15 million to $20 million that would come out of the Q4 numbers. Colby Synesael : Great. And then we add it back into the fourth -- into the first quarter number. Keith Taylor : Yes. Colby Synesael : Okay. And then secondly, you guys gave guidance back in 2018 at your Analyst Day of 8% to 10% revenue and 8% to 12% AFFO per share. And you gave that guidance for each year through 2022. You normally have an Analyst Day every two years. It would have been in June of this year, but you didn't. Is that guidance that you gave back in 2018 in terms of how to think of the business still valid?  And then if I could just sneak one extra question in there, you gave guidance earlier this year for $0 to $50 million impact from COVID-19. Curious where are we in terms of the actual impact year-to-date and what the thinking is for the fourth quarter? Thank you. Keith Taylor : Charles, do you want me to take those? Or... Charles Meyers : Yes, there's a few of them there. Why don't we -- why don't you go ahead and jump in where you want there and I'll add. Keith Taylor : Okay. Well first and foremost Colby as it relates to the Analyst Day guide the 8% to 10% was a number that we embarked upon again in June of 2018. And as you know, we've done very well against those expectations particularly around AFFO per share again 8% to 10%. There's been a lot of activity. And so we've done a good job of normalizing both for currency and then for the acquisitions. And suffice it to say, we're -- we are a third, well I guess this is our third year into it and we're running ahead of what we originally told the market at that point in time.  As it relates to the next five years, it's probably a little early to give you a sense. But generally speaking, I feel very good about sort of the ranges that we were giving at that time. A lot has changed since then and we'll update you accordingly including some of the acquisitions we've made and we've been very active as a business.  But overall, I feel very good that we can deliver against that profitability target that we set for ourselves vis-\u00e0-vis on a per-share basis to make sure that shareholders recognize the value that we've delivered. I'm sorry\u2026 Colby Synesael : COVID-19 impact guide? Charles Meyers : Yes. COVID. Keith Taylor : As it relates to COVID again you're right. We basically set a relatively wide range as you know about then we targeted around midpoint. And you can see us starting to peel back some -- there's definitely some impact even as we talk a little bit about the Packet acquisition and just the difficulty on making sure that we could pull that all together as Charles said in a COVID world. That certainly slowed it down a little bit.  But put that aside for a second, I think, overall, the things that we were most worried about is what customers were going to go out of business? What payments were we not going to receive? What were the incremental costs? Certainly as a business again, we said $14 million of cost in Q1 on the EBITDA line. For all intents and purposes, we wrote back $6 million of that in the third quarter and then were going to book another $4 million of new costs in Q4. So net-net you're sort of somewhere in the $10 million to $15 million range on EBITDA. And I would say I feel pretty good about that.  As it relates to the top line, it's hard to quantify. There's certainly some impact from COVID. I think, I'd size it in the $20 million to $30 million range. And here's how we got there. For a number of reasons, we've had very good success in being able to book particularly on the gross line. There absolutely will. There will be some -- there has been some fallout of -- from COVID for companies that have gone out of business and we've made concessions and other things and so we're absorbing that. But I also think there's been a timing implication. And the timing implication, particularly in Q2 and less on Q3, customers were having difficulties getting to sites and doing deployments and all that. And so the knock-on effect on the revenue line, again our estimate again as we share with our internally and also with our Board is probably at a $20 million to $30 million number. And so that sort of gives you a sense of the ranges that we've absorbed.  Again, we're delighted with where we are vis-\u00e0-vis all the -- what could have been when we first started here in Q1 and started locking things down. Clearly, we've done meaningfully better than we originally anticipated from that original guide. But that's I think because the company has been running exceedingly well and our customers have been paying their bills as they come due absent a few concessions that we'll be making here and there. Charles Meyers : Let me just add a little color on all of them. One just backing up to the very first question you had in terms of again, just to be clear, I think that what we're saying here is that the Q4 downtick which is apparent in the guide is really a matter of movement between Q3 which obviously significantly over performed on EBITDA that was pulled forward and shift in.  I think if you take that and you sort of adjust for that the movement between quarters, I think you would see a much smoother trajectory and then we would expect that to sort of continue to roll into Q1 with a margin profile that's more consistent with kind of what we typically see. So that's the, I guess, clarification, I'd offer on that one.  In terms of multiyear guide, we're going to come back and obviously provide that in -- hopefully, we'll get back to an Analyst Day here this year and we can offer that. But I do think that we continue to believe that our addressable market opportunity continues to grow. And I think we're going to continue to find a way to invest behind that. And then again on COVID, I think Keith gave the color. But there were a number of hard costs that we continue to see in that. There's definitely trade-offs and there are some things that are better. But we're also putting we've made significant investments in terms of trying to address our employee well-being during this period of time, putting investments in making sure that work from home is a good experience for our employees. And so there's been some hard dollars that have hit that. It's tough to put all of the revenue impacts fully into play -- or into perspective. But overall, I'd got to tell you I think we're extremely happy with how the team has performed despite the pandemic. Colby Synesael : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from David Guarino with Green Street. You may go ahead. David Guarino : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I actually got two legislative-focused questions for you. The first one, with Prop 15 on the California ballot in November, could you help give us an idea of what the increase in Equinix' property tax bill would be, if that measure were to pass? And then the second one, in New Jersey., I'm just curious have you started having any conversations with some of your financial tenants, as a result of the proposed financial transaction tax there? And if you could just remind us what percentage of your cash gross profit comes from New Jersey that would be great also. Thanks. Charles Meyers : Yes. Let me jump on the second one first. And give a little bit of color. And then Keith maybe you can take Prop 15. And add any color on sizing potential impacts from the New Jersey thing. But what I would tell you is, yes, obviously we're deeply engaged with our financial trading customers. We have a very healthy ecosystem globally. And certainly New Jersey is an important one. I would tell you that those companies are designed with -- in partnership with Equinix to be highly resilient. And I think that they're going to make it clear that they can move their trading platforms around as they need to. Traditionally that has been in response to a disaster. I think some of them would consider the New Jersey tax a disaster that they would respond to. And I think we just -- and we're there as a partner to support them in terms of, making sure that they can continue to run their business effectively. So I think that it would be -- there would be a potential impact to that. But I think it would be a movement around the ecosystem, I think in terms of being able to re-stabilize that trading volume in other venues. And so, I personally think that -- I think people are -- cooler heads are going to prevail. And I think we will realize that that's probably not a great outcome. And it wouldn't accomplish what people had hoped for. And -- but we're very closely aligned with our trading customers. And I think in a coordinated approach to try to make sure people are thinking clearheaded about that. Keith Taylor : Thanks Charles. And then -- so I would say that, as it relates generally to the legislative matters that come in front of us particularly around tax, first and foremost as we -- I think we all know Equinix is a REIT, a U.S. REIT and because of that no matter what the outcomes are I think we're not going to pay much in the form of corporate income tax. I don't think that would be a meaningful change. As it relates to some of the propositions though, Charles, I think has highlighted well what our position on the New Jersey, financial transaction tax or the potential for that. Prop 15 in California. Again we have roughly 11 triple-net leases to give you a perspective. We own some of our properties. If it moved forward, Prop 15 moved forward, we would estimate it's not going to be a huge number. But it's probably going to be in the $5 million to $10 million range. That's the -- at least our estimate today of what could be. Again, we're paying very close attention to this. And again, we'll know over the coming quarters, basically on the outcome. And then, we'll update the investors accordingly on the future analyst -- future earnings calls. David Guarino : Great. That's helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And that was our last question. Speakers, I will turn it back to you, for closing remarks. Katrina Rymill : Thank you for everyone joining the Q3 call. That concludes the call.

We'd also like to remind you that we post important information about Equinix in IR page from time to time and encourage you to check our website regularly for the most current available information. With us today are Charles Meyers, Equinix's CEO and President; and Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call within an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow on questions to just one.  At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. I hope that 2021 is off to a great start for all of you and that you and your loved ones are safe, healthy and ready for an exciting year ahead. As I reflect on the extraordinary events of 2020, it's clear we are living in a time unlike any other in our history. Without question, the COVID-19 pandemic changed nearly every aspect of our lives. For some, the impact has been and continues to be devastating. Our hearts and our support continue to go out to those suffering or facing great loss. Despite the rapidly changing landscape, our focus has remained clear. Ensuring the health, safety and well-being of our employees, customers and partners, keeping our data centers safely operating around the world and continuing to be a source of strength for our communities. I'd like to take a moment here to thank our employees for not only enduring but excelling in the face of adversity and for powerfully demonstrating our commitment to be in service to : in service to each other, to our customers, to our shareholders, and to the communities in which we live and operate. In the midst of all that has transpired, our business model has proven resilient, and we continue to innovate, execute and deliver for our customers. We closed over 17, 500 deals in 2020, reflecting the strength of our value proposition and highlighting the tremendous scale and momentum of our go-to-market engine. We expanded our scale and reach, both organically and through M&A, solidifying our position as a leading digital infrastructure provider in Canada, entering the Mexico market and announcing our GPX transaction in India, which we believe will be an ideal springboard in this large and growing market. We completed 16 new expansions, our most active build year ever, and have a sizable construction roadmap still ahead to support our backlog and healthy pipeline. We've introduced transformative capabilities on Equinix Fabric and Network Edge, revolutionizing the way enterprises connect digital infrastructure and we launched Equinix Metal, a fully automated and interconnected Bare Metal as a Service offering that provides even greater flexibility for customers to place their digital infrastructure where they need it, when they need it. We also had a very active year in the capital markets, leveraging our investment-grade ratings to refinance our debt, driving substantial interest savings into the business as reflected in our AFFO per share metric. For the year, we delivered $6 billion in revenue, completing our 72nd consecutive quarterly top-line increase and amazing 18 years of continuous revenue growth. In terms of the road ahead, one post-pandemic reality is already clear : our world is increasingly and inescapably more digital. Digital is reshaping our everyday lives and is impacting every element of our customers' businesses, not just how they interact with their customers, but how they interact with their data, how they collaborate and innovate, how they support their employees, how they engage partners, how they architect their network. Everything is changing. Digital transformation is reshaping the competitive landscape across every sector of the global economy and is fueling demand for a new generation of digital infrastructure. Infrastructure that is more distributed, more cloud connected and more flexible, characteristics that represent the hallmarks of Platform Equinix.  As service providers build out their infrastructure to capture burgeoning digital demand and enterprise customers embrace hybrid and multi-cloud as the architecture of choice, Equinix continues to play a key role as a nexus for advancing their digital transformation journeys. We believe that the overall market for digital infrastructure will continue to expand significantly, creating a massive long-term opportunity for those providers able to adapt to the evolving needs of digital buyers. We believe Equinix is uniquely positioned to capture this expanding addressable market, and we entered 2021 with a clear set of priorities to build on our market leadership, reinforce our competitive advantage and invest in targeted ways to position us for sustained value creation. First, supporting our people and strengthening our extraordinary culture will continue to be at the center of our strategy. People are foundational to how we will navigate the challenges and opportunities ahead. And our goal is to ensure that our culture creates a sense of opportunity and belonging for all our employees, affording us a durable source of competitive advantage. This year, we're expanding our award-winning sustainability ambitions, a priority that has resonated with both employees and customers as diversity, inclusion, social justice and climate change all remain front and center on the global stage.  Equinix is an important component of greening digital infrastructure, and we have seen a significant increase in customer interest in this area. We continue to expand our efforts around renewables coverage, energy efficiency projects, green building certifications as well as our pursuit of science-based targets and innovative techniques to push sustainability forward in all 3 regions. Second, we will focus on simplifying and scaling our business to drive long-term operating leverage and enhance our customer experience. This will include targeted efforts aimed at streamlining and automating, ordering and billing, enabling channel self-service and delivering enhanced digital engagement options for our customers. In parallel, we'll continue to evolve and scale our highly productive go-to-market engine, investing in more quota-bearing headcount and leveraging our growing channel to amplify our reach to prosecute the opportunity in front of us. Third, we'll continue to expand our global reach with an ambitious plan across both retail and xScale in direct response to customer demand.  And fourth, we'll accelerate our digital services business, adding new product capabilities, expanding market availability and augmenting our go-to-market motion, all aimed at accelerating new customer acquisition and positioning us for future growth as we drive attach rate across our expansive customer base. Turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for the full year were $6 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 8% year-over-year and AFFO per share grew 12% year-over-year. Interconnection revenues grew 14% year-over-year, driven by strong adoption of Equinix Fabric and solid interconnection adds. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our longer-term product roadmap and platform vision continue to advance to support our position as the world's digital infrastructure company. We now have over 392,000 interconnections and continue to build out ecosystem density across our metros. In Q4, we added an incremental 7,700 interconnections, more than our top 15 competitors combined, fueled by continued strength in network and cloud connectivity. Internet Exchange saw significant increases, both in port capacity and traffic growth, with peak traffic up 8% quarter-over-quarter and 43% year-over-year, driven by cloud, content and gaming segments. Equinix Fabric also saw strong growth, driven by port additions as well as existing customers upgrading to higher speed connections and increasing their use of our intra-metro offering. We also launched a new capability that allows Equinix Fabric users to quickly and easily connect to any other customer on Platform Equinix, unlocking the full value of our scaled digital ecosystems. And with Equinix Fabric integration built into both Network Edge and Equinix Metal, digital leaders are finding it easier than ever to use Equinix to create and connect their foundational infrastructure. In its first quarter as an Equinix branded product, Equinix Metal demonstrated solid momentum and is now available in 8 global metros, with plans for an additional 10 markets early this year. On the xScale side of our business, we continue to be very pleased with our JV strategy and are making significant progress expanding the reach and scale of that business. As planned, xScale is enabling us to extend our product set, capture hyperscale demand and deepen cloud density, while leveraging our balance sheet with the JV structure. We have an ambitious plan for 2021 and are resourcing xScale to accelerate growth. Plans include incrementing our existing JVS, entering in new markets such as Australia and evaluating new options to broaden our reach and leverage our existing land bank. We currently have 8 xScale builds underway, spanning all 3 regions and are moving forward with the second phase of Tokyo 12, given early success in this market. Now let me cover highlights from the verticals. Our Network vertical, again, achieved record bookings, driven by carriers upgrading core, edge and mobile networks to address shifting traffic patterns resulting from the pandemic as well as continued strength in enterprise resale. Network service providers have proven to be some of our most productive channel partners, which has led to sustained momentum in this vertical. New wins and expansions included Senia Networks, a Danish network provider, connecting to partners in Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Hong Kong and London, as well as a Fortune 500 cable operator, leveraging Equinix to re-architect core infrastructure for cloud access to support video-on-demand caching and delivery. Our Financial Services vertical also had a record quarter, led by multinational financial services firms, with particular strength in the Americas. Expansions included a Global 2000 fintech player, expanding their equity options present to access our dense financial ecosystem and a Fortune 500 insurance company, implementing a hybrid cloud strategy on Platform Equinix. Our Content and Digital Media vertical saw particular strength in video and digital advertising as companies are investing to bring their services directly to consumers. New wins, included one of the largest shopping and e-commerce retail groups, deploying infrastructure to support digital e-commerce activities; and Index Exchange, a top independent global ad tech marketplace expanding compute nodes to manage increasing traffic from customers. Our Cloud and IT vertical delivered solid bookings, increasing density and coverage of software-as-a-service providers and winning new cloud on-ramps in smaller markets, including Dubai and Melbourne. Expansions included Fortinet, a global cybersecurity platform provider, expanding to support scale and user experience; and ServiceNow, deploying infrastructure closer to users in Europe to optimize performance, enhance user experience and support their rapid growth. Our Enterprise vertical had a strong quarter driven by healthcare and retail as telehealth and digital initiatives see continued momentum. Work-from-home and collaboration-related use cases remain active, although less than pre-pandemic levels as enterprises shift their focus back to broader digital transformation initiatives. New enterprise wins included Atrium Health, the largest health system in the Southeastern U.S. deploying digital infrastructure to enable compliant, multi-cloud and business partner interconnection as well as a Fortune 500 manufacturing company deploying digital infrastructure at Equinix to facilitate cloud connection. And our channel program had another great quarter, accounting for 35% of bookings. We saw particular strength with our hyperscale and technology alliance partners, capturing wins across a wide range of industry segments focused on digital transformation efforts as well as pandemic response. New partner wins included a Canadian automobile parts manufacturer, accessing our network and cloud density to interconnect to the connected car and broader automotive ecosystems. We continue to expect channel bookings to be an important pillar of our go-to-market strategy in 2021 and beyond. Now, let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Keith Taylor : Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. As Charles noted, we're living in unique times, and I hope you and your families are healthy and well. Despite the challenges of 2020, the Equinix team rallied at all levels of the organization and delivered another strong year for our investors, our customers and our employees. We ended the year on a high note with record gross bookings, strong inter and intra-reaching deal flow activity, positive net pricing actions and a healthy sales pipeline as we head into 2021. Also, we ended the year with significant backlog of cabinets booked but not yet installed. And consistent with my prior quarter's comment, we anticipate a meaningful increase in our cabinets billing metric in the first half of 2021. So simply put, we continue to drive value on both the top-line and at a per share level. And our core strategy as the world's digital infrastructure company continues to separate us from our peers. In the year ahead, we're leaning into our product and services initiatives, scaling and automating our business and investing to expand our platform. We're also managing substantial construction activity at a level previously not seen. With 44 major expansion projects currently underway across 30 markets and 20 countries, including 8 xScale builds. Our build efforts are dollar-weighted towards major metros that generate over $100 million in revenues. Both the OpEx and CapEx investments are driving and supporting the continued volume of high-quality interconnection-rich wins across both our direct and indirect channels, resulting in durable long-term value creation for our shareholders. We've also been active in the capital markets, benefiting from our investment-grade ratings that helped drove down our cost of borrow. Over the past 2 years, we raised over $11.5 billion in capital, funding the growth and scale of the business, while lowering our overall blended cost to borrow by approximately 160 basis points, another value driver as reflected in our AFFO per share metrics. Now, let me cover the highlights for the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q4 revenues were $1.564 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year and better than expectations, in part due to strong NRR activity, although offset in part by a one-off accounting adjustment. We enjoyed another quarter of net positive pricing actions, a strong reflection of how our operating model differs from our peers. Q4 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $9 million benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. Looking forward, we expect NRR activity to decrease in Q1, although step up again in Q2. Global Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $711 million or 45% of revenues, up 5% over the same quarter last year, outperforming our expectations due to favorable revenue mix, strong operating performance and lower utility costs. Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, included a $4 million net FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q4 AFFO was $517 million, meaningfully above our expectations on a constant currency basis due to strong operating performance while absorbing seasonally higher recurring CapEx investments, a similar scenario to prior years. Consistent with AFFO, our operating cash flows increased significantly in the quarter, largely due to strong collection activities. Interconnection revenues were greater than 18% of recurring revenues, showing continued strong momentum across each of our regions, both on a dollar basis and as a percent of our recurring revenues. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on slides 5 through 7. APAC and EMEA were our fastest-growing revenue regions on a year-over-year normalized basis, both growing 11%, followed by the Americas region at 4%. The Americas region saw its third consecutive quarter of record gross bookings with firm pricing, a high mix of midsized deals and our highest number of new logos in 2 years. Additionally, the team continued to sell across the global platform, delivering on our second consecutive quarter of record exports to the other 2 regions. Americas interconnection adds remained strong. Cabinets billing trended back to normal levels, and we expect a large step-up in cabinet billing in the first half of 2021. Bell Canada assets had a good start under the Equinix banner and our integration efforts remain on track. Our EMEA region saw solid bookings in the quarter, including our best intra region in 2 years, with firm pricing led by activity in both our Amsterdam and Frankfurt markets. Revenue growth remains strong, although we expect some 2021 moderation as we lap past our successful cross-connect repricing initiative in 2020. Also, we're investing broadly in our growth and emerging markets, or GEMs to meet the anticipated demand in these edge metros. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had its second best gross bookings quarter with a solid mix of small ecosystem-accretive deals in our Singapore and Japan businesses. Utilization rates remain high. We expect to bring new capacity online over the coming quarters in key markets to ease the anticipated capacity constraints. And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. At year-end, our balance sheet is greater than $27 billion, including unrestricted cash of approximately $1.6 billion, a meaningful decrease over the prior quarter due to the close of the Bell Canada asset acquisition and the settlement of debt refinanced in the quarter. Also, we moved our Paris 9 asset into the EMEA JV and closed our Japan JV with GIC in December. As a result, net of our equity investment, the JVs reimbursed us over $300 million in the quarter. At year-end, our xScale joint ventures had total assets on their balance sheet of greater than $1 billion, including the capital deployed. In 2021, you should continue to expect a meaningful increase in xScale activity. Our net debt levels remain low relative to our peers at 3.8 times, our Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA within our targeted range. Over the past 2 years, we refinanced a large portion of our historically high-yield debt structure. Yet, we still have another $1.8 billion of debt to refinance over the coming quarters, which at current rates would result in another $50 million plus of annualized interest savings. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $834 million, including a recurring CapEx of $74 million, a meaningful increase over the prior quarter, but as expected. Our construction and procurement teams continue to actively manage our expansion pipeline, delivering capacity at robust build levels, while incorporating the health, safety and well-being of our internal and external teams. Over the past year, we've experienced an average construction delay of a few weeks due to the pandemic, a trend that we will continue to monitor and assess. In Q4, we opened 4 new expansion projects, D.C., Frankfurt, Paris and S\u00e3o Paulo. Additionally, we added 7 projects to our expansion tracking sheet, including our entr\u00e9e into Genoa Italy in support of the subsea cable landing station opportunity. Genoa 1 will have a direct fiber access to Milan 5, our new flagship facility in this metro ready to open in Q1. We continue to expand our ownership, acquiring land for development in Genoa, Madrid, Mexico City, Milan and S\u00e3o Paulo. Revenues from owned assets currently represent about 55%. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our 147 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 84% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested, a step down over the prior quarter due to the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar on our non-U.S. stabilized assets. As a reminder, similar to prior years, we plan to update our stabilized asset summary on the Q1 earnings call. Now please refer to slides 11 through 15 for our summary of 2021 guidance and bridges. Do note, our 2021 guidance does not include any financial results related to the pending GPX India acquisition.  Starting with revenues for 2021, we expect top-line growth of 10% to 11%, reflecting the continued momentum in the business and favorable FX rates relative to the prior year. On a normalized basis, revenues are expected to grow 7% to 8% over the prior year. MRR churn is expected to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter for the year. For Q1, we expect the MRR churn to be at the lower end of this range. We expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 47%, excluding integration costs, the result of operating leverage in the business, offset by investments in our product, xScale and business simplification initiatives. We expect to incur $30 million of integration costs in 2021 for various acquisitions. 2021 AFFO was expected to grow 10% to 12% compared to the previous year. AFFO per share is expected to grow 8% to 10%, including integration costs. We've excluded any capital market activities here. 2021 CapEx is expected to be $2. 5 billion to $2.8 billion, including approximately $180 million of recurring CapEx spend, which represents about 3% of our revenues. This guidance also includes approximately $250 million of on-balance sheet spend related to xScale projects, which we expect to be reimbursed for in the future as we move or sell assets into either our current or our future JVs.  And finally, we expect our 2021 cash dividends to increase to slightly greater than $1 billion, a 10% increase over the prior year or an 8% increase on a per share basis. So let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Keith. In closing, as 2020 showed us, our world is a very dynamic place. I'm proud of how we have navigated and adapted through this challenging environment, and I'm pleased with our increasing momentum in unlocking the tremendous opportunity ahead. We had a strong finish to the year, delivering across each of our areas of strategic focus, all while maintaining a disciplined and long-term oriented approach to our capital allocation and shareholder return strategies. Undoubtedly, as with all times of transition and transformation, there will continue to be challenges ahead. But I am as optimistic as ever about our business and the opportunity to serve our customers, partners and shareholders as the world's digital infrastructure company. We need to continue to invest in extending our market leadership and ensuring our long-term relevance to the expansive opportunity presented by digital transformation. As a society and as a company, we learned a lot in 2020. And I believe there are a plethora of silver linings that will come from this past year. We enter 2021 filled with gratitude, ready to tackle the challenges and opportunities ahead and collectively energized by the pursuit of our purpose : to be a platform where the world comes together, enabling the innovations that enrich our work, life and planet. So let me stop there and open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael Rollins : I was curious if you could talk a bit more about the revenue growth guidance, organic constant currency of 7% to 8% for 2021. What's driving the difference between 2020 and '21? And with the investments that you're making this year, how do you look at the opportunity to grow in the future? Can you accelerate that? Would you expect to maintain that level? Just some additional color would be great. Charles Meyers : Yes, why don't I -- I'll start, Mike, and then Keith, you can comment as you see fit. I think that we're seeing, as we've talked about in the past, it's getting harder and harder to grow on a very -- a much larger base, and I think -- and doing that while maintaining a level of discipline on the strategy. And so that's definitely our focus. We believe that that's the way to continue to drive value creation. We're seeing strong uptake in terms of customers being resonant with the value proposition, but it does take a lot of productivity to drive the bookings that are going to fuel the kind of growth rates that we're seeing at given the size of the business overall. I think in terms of the investments, yes, we do believe that those are going to continue to translate to us sustaining and hopefully maybe increasing growth rates over time. But I think -- and I think we've already seen that. I think without the investments that we've made in the past, into our product teams, in particular, and into other areas of business like xScale, I think -- I don't think we would have seen growth that we saw in 2020. And so I think it has been an opportunity for us to invest in the business and generate returns. I think one factor on operating margins, I think, in 2020, going into 2021, 2020 was an unusual year. And I think it was a difficult time for our world overall. I think we made a decision to both continue to invest in our people in various ways that we've given you visibility to in our last several calls. And give them confidence that they have their jobs. And I stand by that decision is the right one for the company, and I'm confident that the long-term return on that decision is compelling. But it's -- interestingly, I think as we -- I guess, partially expected employee turnover fell significantly. Because I think as people sought the security of a really strong employer like Equinix, and they probably fell even more than we anticipated. And it really, to some degree, reduces your range of motion as a business.  So I think when it falls and yet you're wanting to continue to evolve and adapt your workforce to the changing needs of business and the strategy at hand, you're left with the decision as to whether you add and kind of overrun where you thought you were going to be from a headcount standpoint or whether you delay doing that in an effort to sort of stay tighter on the expense side. Like many, we probably ended somewhere in between. And -- but undoubtedly, I think that's a contributing factor in terms of growth of SG&A as a percentage of revenue. And reversing that trend is a priority for us in 2021 and beyond. But we do feel like we needed to make these investments, need to continue these investments in the business because I think the opportunity associated with the digital transformation sort of needs of our customers are significant, and I think we're uniquely positioned to play into those. Keith, anything you want to add, buddy? Keith Taylor : Yes, why don't I just maybe add just a couple of other comments? I think the other thing that's very telling about '21 over '20, and particularly as you look into Q1, there's a meaningful step down in our non-recurring revenue. And as we've said before, it tends to be lumpy. We said there'd be a step-up in Q2. That ties in nicely to the incremental cabinet additions that we should -- we expect as a business. And so that's sort of playing into. The other thing that we can't lose sight of is the level of price increases that went through last year. And as I said in my prepared remarks, that we're going to lap over that. And so you get -- you don't get the same benefit, but you get it in your run rate. And then the last thing I would just say is that we continue to invest in xScale, and I talked about a lot of activity taking place there. But we're not yet banking on that as it relates to how the year will progress, either in fees or contribution from our equity interest in the JV. And so that's sort of what's going on with the business.  And again, when you look at overall, 10% to 11%, recognizing normalized is 7% to 8%. I'll tell you, maybe just one other thing that really comes to note here. Again, the Americas region grew about 4%, as I said last quarter in my prepared remarks. As you come through Q1, you'll continue to see relatively modest growth in the Americas, but then you'll see the acceleration through the last 3 quarters of the year. And that's what was really exciting about what we see in the plan. So part of it is just timing based, part of it is the impact of non-recurring revenue, part of it is the price increases. But overall, we feel very confident in the numbers that we put forth here. Operator : Our next question is from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Richard Choe : This is Richard for Phil. Just wanted to follow-up on that a little bit, about the Americas growth. I assume some of that is the growth of the acquisitions of Mexico, Packet and Bell what kind of growth rates are you expecting from them versus kind of the average for the overall region? Charles Meyers : Keith, you want to grab that? The one thing I would say on Packet is we don't really think about that as a regionally-oriented investment, it's -- since the capabilities are going to be deployed on a global basis. We definitely expect that to grow, seen a substantially over-index over the rest of the business, but we expect to see success across the regions on that. And then the other businesses also, I think, are likely to over-index, but I think there's other factors. I think it's more a sustained -- the sustained performance having really moved through, I think a lot of the churn that we're seeing associated with the Verizon assets and some of the churn that occurred through there and I think a stabilization business and are really -- several really productive bookings quarters from the Americas bookings into. Richard Choe : And to follow-up on that, the churn, I guess, was a little higher in the second half of the year, the 2.6%, but you said it would be lower in the first quarter. Is it mainly because of the rise in churn as well? Or is there something else there that is showing that improvement or driving that improvement? Charles Meyers : No. It's -- we did say that, in fact, we had -- in the last call, we had said that this quarter, we expect it to be back in range. And we saw a little bit of timing, adverse timing again this quarter and a little bit of unforecasted churn that pushed us up to 2.6%. So I'm a tad reluctant to tell you we're back in range in Q1, but I do believe that's our firm expectation. So we -- I would say that there -- if you look at it, there were several churns over the last couple of quarters that were from acquired assets that were the types of deployments that we wouldn't generally be targeting. And so I don't think it's a fundamental sort of issue in the business as it is, I think, some of the things that weren't -- aren't really part of our strategy moving through. The other thesis that's similar to that is about 20 bps of the Q4 churn was associated with large, lower margin managed services deal in Europe. And so again, I think when you back those things out, you're really looking at sort of a level of churn performance within the business that's pretty consistent with our expectations. Churn is definitely a focus for us in the year ahead. And I do think kind of where we land on a full year on a revenue basis is going to really depend on where we can land in the churn range that we\u2019ve forecasted through the course of the year. So it's going to be a critical area of focus for us. But nothing fundamental that we're seeing, just volatility in terms of -- or just movement in terms of people evolving their architectures and the normal frictional churn that exists in our business. But I think nothing beyond that. Operator : The next question is from Tim Long with Barclays. Timothy Long : I wanted to ask on the interconnect business. Maybe a two-parter. Can you just update us on the initiatives for global pricing there for the international markets, getting them more up to Americas type of levels? And can you talk a little bit about your view of that, kind of as we head into 2021, particularly with the really strong cabinet equivalent billing in the first half? Could that be a positive indicator for what we'll see from interconnect activity as we head into the first part of the year? Charles Meyers : Sure. Yes. I mean, I would say that overall, we're incredibly pleased with the performance of our interconnection business and what that means for the broader performance of the business because interconnection isn't really -- even though we reported as a product line, if you will, and talk about the performance in its growth, and it continues to over-index meaningful versus the rest of the business, it's really a core part of the value proposition and fuels the rest of the business in terms of the strength of the value proposition when it comes to digital transformation. You mentioned specifically pricing, obviously, we had tremendous success implementing a pricing sort of normalization effort in Europe over the course of 2020. We're largely through that now. And so as Keith said, that's impacting the year-over-year compare on revenue growth in Europe, but we're now seeing those benefits sort of built into our run rate. In terms of broader opportunity for pricing adjustments, I think that we're continuing -- we'll continue to evaluate that. I don't -- I wouldn't see anything meaningful on the horizon for us there. I think we, obviously, are just coming off the European adjustments. But I think that we do have to continue to look at both our underlying costs and the trajectory of those and whether or not adjustments are needed for us to continue to maintain our margin profile. And then also, the real focus for us is looking at the value delivered to our customers. And we do think it is so substantial as they look at implementing Equinix Fabric, for example, as a foundational part of their hybrid multi-cloud architectures that we feel comfortable that we're going to be able to continue to get strong pricing from the interconnection offerings. And then last point, Keith did mention we're expecting sort of strong cabinet adds because of the strong backlog. And yes, that's going to -- it is going to continue to fuel interconnection because we're seeing really good sort of ratios in terms of -- because we're maintaining a level of discipline in the strategy, and we're not reliant on these super large footprint deals that are poorly interconnected, we are seeing cabinets fuel interconnection growth. And so overall, I think those things will move nicely in tandem. Operator : The next question is from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Aryeh Klein : Charles, you mentioned in the prepared remarks some of the bigger picture changes as the world digitizes. Can you talk about how this is impacting deal flow, deal sizes? Any impact on sales cycles? Are they lengthening in any way as a result? Charles Meyers : Yes. Sure. Yes, I mean, I talked about that we're really seeing digital take off and be a Board-level priority for people, and it's changing the way, as I said, people think about not only electronic commerce and digital interaction with their customers, but how they think about data and how they're using AI to create competitive advantage, how they're architecting their networks. And those last 2 examples are 2 really good ones of that are central to what we have in our funnel today and what's fueling our strong bookings on a quarter-over-quarter level. And that is that people thinking about using Equinix as a nexus for their data, locating their data there, intersecting it with cloud services across the globe to create insights and egress those insights to the people within the business that need them. And then network re-architecture has been bread and butter for us for a very long time in Equinix Fabric and then things like Network Edge and now Metal even adding to the mix there, really substantially improving the way people can -- and accelerate in the way people are thinking about network re-architecture. And in terms of how it's affecting our -- I would just say this. I think that if you look at our mix of business, if you look at the kind of volumes that we're doing, 17,500 transactions over the course of the year, it is, we're really focused on those sort of -- on those sweet spots in our business where we can demonstrate differentiated value. And I think that's why we're seeing such strong pricing. We continue to see positive pricing actions and firm even spot pricing, in many ways, in our business because I think the value proposition is so strong. And so -- and I -- but I do think it's still at a point where these are not really short sales cycles. There's a lot of solution selling still being done with us and through -- and in combination with our partners. And it's why we need to continue to invest in re-architecting and refining and adding capabilities to our selling organization, including scaling our channel. And so those are areas of investment we're making. And I do think that the prospect is, over time, that those -- I would say that I don't think sales cycles are lengthening. And in fact, if anything, I think they're starting to shorten, in particular, follow-on sales cycles, meaning after you've already brought a customer in, that first win with the customer is still -- it can be pretty extended. But follow-on sales cycles, I think, are shortening. And I think that hopefully, that points to us continuing to add even further productivity from the selling engine going forward. Aryeh Klein : And then just real quick on xScale. You're building in Brazil, you mentioned Australia being in the roadmap. Where does the U.S. stand on that list? Charles Meyers : Yes, we talked about that in the past and generally said that it's not a big priority for us. We think that the competitive intensity of sort of the hyperscale business in the U.S. is significant. I would say capacity -- supply and demand are coming more into line in the U.S. markets, whereas I think they were a little out of balance for a while. So I think that's a good improvement overall for the industry. I would say we're -- never say never in terms of whether -- if a customer really had a specific need that they wanted us to be working with on, we'd be receptive to it potentially. But I would say that we're so comfortable and confident in our -- in the durability of our interconnection value proposition in the U.S. and in the strength of our ecosystems, both network, cloud and others, that I think the strategic imperative is a little bit different. And so it wouldn't be a key priority, but I do think we'll be open-minded about opportunities as they might surface. Operator : The next question is from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Sami Badri : One for you, Charles, is you commented about an enterprise acceleration really starting to kind of come into fruition, at least in 2021, do you still really believe this to be kind of the case or the observation for the year? Or has your view slightly tilted mainly kind of tied to some of the sales cycle commentary you just gave? Just want to get your latest thinking on any kind of enterprise acceleration mainly taking place in 2021. Charles Meyers : Yes. I mean I do think that we're seeing -- in fact, if you look over a multiyear period, I think you've seen a pretty substantial acceleration of the enterprise component of our business. And I think that is really tapping into the traditional service provider density that we -- and ecosystem density that we have as well as our geographic reach and how that plays into hybrid and multi-cloud and distributed architecture as an end state for enterprise customers. And so it's interesting because if you are -- the way we report externally, it has network service. We talk about our Network segment, our Financial Services segment and then Enterprise. In reality, all of those 3 segments have significant enterprise components because our enterprise resale and the network vertical is reported there in terms of how we look at that, but we have a meaning piece of that -- meaningful piece, which is Enterprise business that's sold through a network service provider partner. And then on the Financial Services side, yes, we have our trading ecosystem, but actually, the larger piece of that is Enterprise Financial Services business. And obviously, Enterprise I mean, financial services is one of the markets with a very large IT spend and a very, I think, thoughtful and aggressive agenda about moving to hybrid and multi-cloud as their long-term architecture. So all that has created this enterprise momentum for our business over the last several years and I think that absolutely continues into 2021. And like I said, I think that our selling engine is quite productive. It's not yet -- I don't think we're -- we haven't crossed the chasm by any means, but I actually think that's a -- it's really a good thing when you look at the overall Equinix thesis because I think you're looking at a very large addressable market, and we're still in the early innings of tapping that market. And so that means that solution selling takes a little bit longer to get people over the hurdle and really get them through thinking about their hybrid and multi-cloud end state and how we play in that. But as you -- I think as you get them over the hurdle, there's just a lot more wallet share to be gained. And so I think there is an acceleration opportunity for us. And I would expect enterprise to over-index as a segment for us in 2021. Sami Badri : Got it. And then just one quick follow-up on adjusted EBITDA margins. On one side, pulling this up, you have interconnection, xScale should have slightly higher margins. And now you have to 35% of sales coming in from the channel. And then you did comment earlier about some of the big investments you are making into your teams, your human capital and your channel. And I guess the perception a little bit is that your adjusted EBITDA margin should level up a little bit higher than what you're guiding to in 2021. Could you maybe just give us a little bit more of an idea, maybe a multiyear view in terms of how you see kind of the trajectory playing out, just we can visualize where Equinix is going to shake out in the next couple of years? Charles Meyers : Sure. Keith, you want to start maybe with a view of kind of what the moving parts are on the guide? And then your thoughts on that and I'll add color as needed? Keith Taylor : Yes, sure. Sure. Partly, we have to start off with last quarter, one of the things we spoke of last quarter was, there are a number of one-off items that were going through the quarter. And so then you look at the guide that we offered in Q1 and then for the year. I think it's important, one of the things we said is we'll see a recovery of that. There's some one-off costs that were in Q3. They were benefiting us or one-off benefits, I should say. There's one-off costs in Q4. But when you look into Q1, you get to see an EBITDA performance that is substantially up relative to what you would have previously maybe anticipated. Q1 tends to be one of our lower EBITDA quarters. But you can see that we're stepping it up unadjusted $19 million to $39 million. So it gives you a sense of meaningful step-up in the quarter, and that includes absorbing $10 million -- net $10 million that I would refer to as seasonal costs. And then as you look through the tail end or through the next 3 quarters, typically, you'd see -- typically what you'd see in how we're modeling it is, our EBITDA margins would continue to increase throughout the year. And then you sort of take that thinking on a lot of what Charles has said, and then you sort of translate that into our AFFO. Again, one of the things we said, if you look at it in total, AFFO is growing nicely. When you look at it at the share level, it's growing 8% to 10%. So the fact of the matter is, if you back out integration costs, which are, again, they're specific to -- generally to the acquisition of Bell Canada, you're going to see our AFFO per share grow about 10% to 12% this coming year. So there's a lot of value coming into the business. There's a lot of value coming from xScale. But there's still the potential of much more to come if we execute against our strategy. And as I said in at least in my prepared remarks, there is a tremendous amount of activity that we will be embarking upon through this year with xScale. And we're optimistic that, that will continue to drive more value to not only the margin line, but also to our core metric, which is AFFO per share. Charles Meyers : And I guess the additional color I might add, Sami, is just -- I do think that we -- we're generating operating leverage. And as I've said in past years -- last year, I guess, that we just are more than offsetting that operating leverage by investments in this case and this year into the product team and into xScale as well as into our, what we call Project Horizon, which is an effort to really simplify and automate elements of the business, and I referred to some of those in my prepared remarks, and I think those are areas that we do need to bend the cost curve in the business. And I think that expanded operating margins are and -- are still a priority for us going forward. And again, I think we -- rather than try to squeeze it too tight and not make enough room to open up the longer-term opportunity, we made a decision to make those investments this year, and we think that's the right one. Over -- but I think we also need to make sure that we're seeing those investments translate into operating leverage over time. So we continue to believe that we can, over a multiyear basis, expand operating margins and see additional leverage. Operator : Our next question is from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Market. Jordan Sadler : So I just wanted to touch base on the Americas cabs billing during the quarter. It was -- it rebounded, but yet still seems a little bit below historical levels even after last quarter's churn event. You pointed to in your prepared remarks a large step-up coming in cabs billing, I think, in the Americas in the first half. Can you point to the drivers there? And did the fourth quarter come all the way around relative to what your expectations were? Charles Meyers : Keith why don't you grab that and I'll come back. Keith Taylor : Sure. So again, a lot like what Charles said on in his prior remarks, there was still a little higher churn than we originally anticipated in the fourth quarter. Part of it was in Europe, in reference to a managed services provider, but there was some in the U.S. We're at a point now where we believe that we've made the turn. And then as I said, first quarter, you're going to feel in the guide that we give you, goes a little bit soft, but predominantly soft in the sense that I would expect more of -- we're taking about $20 million out of the non-recurring line in the first quarter. And so what you're really seeing is the momentum pick up from the installed cabs -- pardon me, the backlog to be installed cabinets in Q1 and then in Q2. And so there are deals that we've signed, effectively, they're booked, just not installed. And so we are going to see that momentum. And that's why we have the confidence not only in where we think the revenues will go but also the momentum that we will see through the rest of the year. Charles Meyers : Yes. Just the only other thing I might add is that we continue to also be very focused on delivering not only cabs, but delivering the yield that we're going to get from those cabs. And that's really a matter of continuing to be disciplined on the workloads and the opportunities that we're pursuing. And I think we're seeing good success there in terms of preserving very high sort of yields per cab. And I think over time, our product portfolio is going to allow us to continue to expand yield effectively as well or at least sustain at the very high levels that we have today. That, combined with the backlog sort of translation, I think, are good signs for the Americas business. Q - Jordan Sadler : Along those lines, Charles, can you speak to what you're seeing in terms of pricing in the colo business, particularly U.S. colo business? I know MRR has sort of held up and been a driver, but there's a lot going into that item. But it seems that given the overall dynamic that there might be greater pressure out there on colo. And I'm just curious for your comments. Charles Meyers : Yes. If you're talking about, I think, the broader U.S. colo market beyond our U. S. and Americas colo market, I do think there is -- the dynamics may create pressure on that market and which is why I think we need to continue to distinguish ourselves and focus our -- be very disciplined about our targeting and how we're prosecuting the business. I think there's always a continuum in terms of the strength of the value proposition and therefore, how differentiated you can be on pricing. But again, I would point to the fact that we, across our regions are quarter-over-quarter demonstrating positive -- net positive pricing actions, meaning that when we do have a reprice, for example, those are generally being offset by our ability to sustain pricing increases in our contracts, which I think is a really good sign for the business in terms of our ability to do that. So I think undifferentiated colo is going to continue to struggle to maintain price points. And people are either -- are looking for either lowering price and/or looking for new ways or new markets, a lot of them tilting towards hyperscale, which they're certainly not going to find a lot of relief on pricing there. And so I do think the broader market has a translation or a challenge there. But I think we've -- we're not immune from that, but I think we're substantially more insulated, and I think our metrics really demonstrate that. Operator : The next question is from Colby Synesael with Cowen. Colby Synesael : Two modeling questions, if I may. You raised almost $2 billion in equity in 2020. I'm just curious what your thoughts are around the need for equity as it relates to your balance sheet and leverage in 2021? And I guess, offsetting that would be the opportunity to refinance and you noted about $50 million in potential annualized savings. Is the goal ultimately to maintain 8% to 10% AFFO per share growth, one way or the other? And then secondly, just real quickly, what are the assumptions for stabilized growth in 2021? We saw a step down to, I think, 3% in the fourth quarter. Charles Meyers : Do you want to start on that, bud? Keith Taylor : Sure. So specifically, as it relates to our capital market activity, again, we're very specific about we didn't want to include anything in the guidance. So again, if you take out integration cost, AFFO per share will grow 10% to 12%. So we feel really good about where we are. And as you will -- I think many of you will recall, based on the June 2018 Analyst Day, we thought anywhere from 8% to 12% was a reasonable growth rate for AFFO, and we're tracking well against those models that we developed back in 2018. That all said, when you look at what we plan to do this year, we have a very large capital build. The thing I think of the most is how do we go to our lowest cost of capital, which is basically incremental debt. And so what you're going to see is we're going to refinance out of the debt as appropriate. We'll pick our timing accordingly. We'll get over some period of time the annualized benefit of $50 million plus. And then to the extent that we can or we have capacity, we theoretically could raise a little bit more debt because, again, that would be our cheapest source of capital.  As you're also aware, we do have our ATM program. Last year, we announced a $1.5 billion program, but we'll use that appropriate. As market conditions allow, we would walk through the door. To the extent they don't, then we would preserve that capital for a later date. But again, we're always going to bring a little bit of balance to our capital structure. We're going to make sure that we have liquidity on our balance sheet. We have the cash right now, as we announced in our prepared remarks, $1.6 billion plus $2 billion of incremental liquidity from our line. And I'm just -- I remain very optimistic about the amount of cash that we generate in the business as well as the return of capital from the JV as we continue to invest in building out some of these assets, we'll get some more incremental capital from our JV partners as we scale the business. So again, Colby, I think it's a great question. 8% to 10% is sort of a very comfortable range and where we feel we can deliver in \u201820 -- in through 2021. And we'll update you further on -- I think we're going to do the June analyst -- at the June Analyst Day, we'll update you a little bit further on our longer-term view of what we think we can accomplish as a company. Charles Meyers : And then, Colby, on the stabilized assets, we've been saying 3% to 5% on that, and we're kind of right in the middle of that range. And so I think that's probably -- we expect to sort of continue to operate in that range. Operator : The next question is from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Jonathan Atkin : I had a question on product. I suppose it relates a little bit to Charles, your commentary on kind of yield per cabinet. But can you talk about Equinix Fabric, Equinix Metal, how you're either expanding those product capabilities or expanding the distribution reach? Anything to kind of call out on that front? And then it's been a number of years I think since you've commented on the Federal vertical, but I wondered in the context of some of the Americas questions earlier on the call, what's happening, anything different to call out in that segment? Charles Meyers : Sure. Thanks, Jonathan. Yes, we continue to invest in Equinix Fabric and the feature set thereof. I talked a little bit about the recent capability we developed, which allows customers to more easily interconnect to any other Equinix customer on the Fabric. Metal, obviously, has been a significant area of investment, and we're excited to expand the capabilities there in terms of -- or expand the reach of that out now to 18 markets will get to early in '21. We're also investing in the go-to-market motion to continue to adapt that. We're currently executing with an overlay and continuing to refine our thinking on how best to scale that market, but accelerating our overall digital services portfolio, which would include Fabric and Metal and Network Edge and others is a clear priority for us in the year ahead, as I said in our prepared remarks. So we're really excited we believe because you did put that in the context of -- we think that, that can continue to drive yields. We think return on invested capital for those offerings is going to be very attractive over time. And we think, importantly, they're really responsive to the needs of our customers as they think about how digital transformation -- what their digital transformation journey looks like. So you'll hear a lot more from us on what the multiyear view is for those products as we move towards Analyst Day. And then Fed, look, we actually -- we're bullish. We think that there's more opportunity we -- and I think it's something that we're putting a little bit of energy behind. And I can't speak in significant depth on. I know Karl is excited about the opportunities that exist there, and it's something that we're going to continue to be active in trying to pursue the right kinds of opportunities that fit the Equinix value prop. Operator : And our last question will come from David Guarino with Green Street. David Guarino : I just wanted to go back to the sequential step down in colocation revenue in the EMA region. Was that entirely due to this one managed service customer? And are there any more tenants like that inside of your global portfolio? Charles Meyers : Keith, do you want to take that? Keith Taylor : Yes, I'll take that. David, and in fact, that was referred to the one-off -- I'm referring to the one-off adjustment in my prepared remarks. So basically, it was an accounting adjustment that we made in the fourth quarter that saw the step down in colocation revenues between the 2 quarters. So we saw a step-up in Q3 and then a step down in Q4. David Guarino : Okay. Got it. And then on the xScale... Keith Taylor : Managed -- pardon me, managed service providers go through our MIS line. Just so you know. David Guarino : Okay. Helpful. And then the last one, just really quick. On your xScale projects for '21, could you just remind us of what the day 1 stabilized yield on those projects are? And it'd be helpful not just to get Equinix's JV share with all the fees, but just on the project level, what kind of returns you expect to achieve? Charles Meyers : Yes. I mean, we had talked about -- at Analyst Day, we talked about yields or cash-on-cash yields in the low double-digits -- low to mid-double digits. I've said on a couple of occasions that I think there's been more pressure on those returns and on cash-on-cash yields in the hyperscale space just because of overall supply demand dynamics and a lot of people sort of shooting at that target. And so I think you're looking more at the lower end of that. And I think still seeing either very high single-digit or low double-digit cash-on-cash yields. But I think when you look at it from our standpoint and with both fee structure that exists there and then leverage that exists, I think you're able to get substantially more attractive project returns that are going to be into that double-digit range. Katrina Rymill : That concludes our Q4 call. Thanks, everyone, for joining. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",

Charles Meyers : Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We had a great start to the year delivering one of the strongest net bookings quarters in our history, fueled by strong demand across our platform, our lowest churn quarter in many years, and continued momentum in our Americas business. With the addition of the Bell Canada assets, we are now the market leader in 19 of the 26 countries in which we operate. And we are delighted to now be the market leader in retail colocation across all three regions of the world, taking the number one spot in Asia Pacific for the first time this quarter. Our bookings performance continues to highlight the consistency and scale of our go-to-market engine, executing 4,300 deals with more than 3,200 customers. We have a robust build pipeline to support this demand, including 36 major projects underway across 28 markets in 19 countries, one of our most active build years ever. We fully recognize that COVID remains a very acute issue with continued tragic impacts in key markets around the world, including India and Brazil. Our hearts go out to our colleagues and customers in those markets, and we are actively taking steps to support those communities. But as we navigate toward a post pandemic world, we believe Equinix remains uniquely well positioned. Digital Transformation continues to accelerate, and businesses across a broad range of verticals are recognizing that their infrastructure can be a key source of competitive advantage in an increasingly digital world. Demand is as strong as ever. With global IT spend expected to rebound above pre pandemic levels as enterprises increase hybrid cloud spending, and service providers build out their delivery platforms to tap into this demand. Against this backdrop, we remain focused on the clear set of priorities I outlined at the start of the year, investing in our people and culture, simplifying and scaling our business, accelerating our digital services, and expanding our global reach both through our retail footprint and our rapidly growing xScale business. While we're delighted with our business results, were also highly attuned to our responsibilities as a market leader and continue to advance a bold sustainability agenda across all dimensions of ESG. Supporting our people and strengthening our culture continue to be foundational to our strategy. And in a time where it matters more than ever, our vision remains clear. For Equinix to be a place where every employee every day can confidently say I'm safe. I belong and I matter. And for our workforce at all levels to better reflect and represent the communities in which we operate. In early April, we hosted our second annual days of understanding where 1000s of our employees around the world attended workshops to listen, learn and promote a culture of mutual understanding and inclusion as we continue to build and foster an engaged diverse workforce. Our people show up every day inspired by our purpose, to be the platform where the world comes together, enabling the innovations that enrich our work, life and planet. As we pursue this purpose, we are also deeply committed to our role as an important component in creating digital infrastructure. We recently published our 2020 corporate sustainability highlights and I am proud that Equinix once again achieved more than 90% renewable energy coverage for our global data center footprint and received an A minus score for our CDP climate change survey, a leading environmental rating system focused on climate related transparency and action. In January, we announced alongside other providers the formation of the European Climate Neutral data center pact, committed to ensuring data centers in Europe are carbon neutral by 2030. We continue to invest significant resources in our ESG leadership, and will roll out additional global ambitions over the coming quarters in both our environmental and social initiatives. Now turning to our results, as depicted on slide 3, revenues for Q1 were $1.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA was up 10% year-over-year, and AFFO was meaningfully ahead of our expectations. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our leading interconnection franchise continues to perform well with revenues substantially outpacing colocation, growing 13% year-over-year, driven by the continued strength of Equinix Fabric. We now have over 398,000 interconnections and added more organic interconnections year-over-year than the next 10 competitors combined.  In Q1, we added an incremental 6,700 interconnections fueled by hyperscaler build outs and strong enterprise demand, offset by a slight seasonal increase in network grooming activity. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 9% quarter-over-quarter and 28% year-over-year, driven by the cloud and network segments. Equinix Fabric also saw strong growth driven by expanded use of our inter metro offering and continued diversification of n destinations. More than 2,500 customers are now on Fabric and we remain focused on driving higher attach rates for this product across our platform. We're also seeing strong customer interest in our Equinix metal offering and continue to deliver on our commitment to expand the availability and feature set of this offering enabling as a service consumption of our value proposition across 18 Global metros. On the xScale side of our business, we're accelerating our pace and continue to make meaningful progress on our ambitious plans for 2021 as rapid growth in the digital economy, drives increased demand for global cloud connectivity. With our xScale facilities hyperscale companies can add large footprint core deployments to their existing network and onramp footprints at Equinix. Enabling faster time to market and offering direct interconnection to a vibrant ecosystem with their customers and strategic partners. Our more than $3 billion program finance with the support of our JV partners will develop over 290 megawatts across our first two JVs with several more already in the works. We are broadening our reach with the first building of our Dublin five campus which is JV ready, and already 100% pre-leased to a major hyper scalar. Additionally, after quarter end, we pre-leased our entire London 11 asset. These two deals alone represent nearly 40 megawatts of capacity fully committed in advance of delivery. Now, let me cover highlights from our verticals. Please note that we updated our customer segmentation approach to better reflect industry classifications and use cases as well as combined our financial services and enterprise segments to reflect the true scale and momentum of the enterprise opportunity. Going forward, we'll report under these four key verticals. Our network vertical saw strong bookings led by the previously mentioned strength in the Americas as firms expand their capabilities and capacity for digital business and momentum begins to build for industrial 5G applications. A meaningful part of our network vertical is resale, an indication of the momentum of our channel efforts as we work with partners to deliver more complete solutions to support enterprise digital transformation. Expansions this quarter include British Telecom, a leading telecommunications provider, optimizing network and connecting to multi cloud for their global enterprise and customers. And Elextra, one of the first Mexican cloud service providers leveraging Equinix Fabric to provide a multi-cloud product offering and SUB.CO, a leading subsea cable system development firm deploying a cable node to establish the first route between Oman and Australia. Content and digital media achieved solid bookings as indoor entertainment continues to drive activity in the social media, gaming and streaming platforms. Expansions included marquee wins like Roblox expanding across platform Equinix to support the rapidly growing user base and big data requirements, as well as a global edge cloud provider expanding capacity and deploying network nodes to support accelerating demand for video content. Our cloud and IT vertical delivered strong bookings led by hyperscalers, continuing their global growth, and is worth noting that these bookings results do not include the previously referenced xScale wins, which are additive to this strong retail performance. Q1 was also an exceptional quarter in terms of cloud on ramp additions, with 21 new on ramp wins in the quarter, roughly equivalent to our cumulative volume over the prior four quarters and representing a 75% share of on ramps launched in our metros. As a result, Equinix customers can now enjoy low latency access to multiple clouds in 31 metros across the globe, including eight of the world's top 10 metros by GDP. Expansion this quarter included a fortune 30 software provider deploying infrastructure to support digital transformation and IT initiatives and Everest and Australian cloud services provider specializing in healthcare, expanding to meet country specific data compliance requirements and improve user experience. Our enterprise vertical continued to be a major contributor to overall booking performance, driven by strength in the retail and financial services sub segments, as enterprises shift from pandemic initiatives such as work from home and collaboration to a broader focus on digital transformation. Expansions included CME Group, a top global financial derivatives exchange, expanding their footprint to support growing demand of matching engines resulting from a new platform launch, as well as a leading global airline re-architecting to connect to their preferred network and cloud partners and tap into our growing transportation ecosystem. And our channel program continues to deliver exceptional results, contributing more than 30% of our bookings and accounting for over 60% of our new logos. We had great wins with resellers and our alliance partners including AT&T, Dell and IBM across a wide range of industry segments focused on digital transformation efforts and COVID-19 response. Partner wins included working with Verizon, utilizing their network as a service strategy to help a large US healthcare provider modernize their mission critical contact center, and leverage a new cloud architecture supporting 12 million members across the US, as well as a win with a global Canadian manufacturer deploying in Canada and Germany for WAN optimization and cloud access, utilizing Cisco's SD-WAN solution interconnected to Equinix Fabric. Now let me turn the call over Keith and cover the results for the quarter. Keith Taylor : Thanks, Charles. And good afternoon to everyone. On the heels of our record end to 2020 we delivered a great Q1 with strong gross bookings. In fact, our best Q1 ever and our second best net bookings quarter ever with solid performance across virtually all of our key metrics. Our platform continues to shine with strong inter and inter region activity with a high interest in our expanded product and service capabilities, further separating us from our peers. Interconnection revenues now represent 19% of our recurring revenues reflecting our continued interconnection momentum. With a great start to 2021 and increased visibility over the rest of the year, we're raising our guidance substantially across revenues, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share on a constant currency basis. Now let me cover the highlights for the quarter, note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on slide 4, the global Q1 revenues were $1.596 billion, up 7% over the same quarter last year, our 73rd quarter of top line revenue growth due to strong business performance led by the Americas. As expected, nonrecurring revenue decreased quarter-over-quarter to 5% of revenues. But as noted on our last earnings call, we anticipate a meaningful rebound in Q2 MRR due to forecasted custom installation work across a number of markets highlighting the inherent lumpiness of this revenue source. Q1 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $6 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $773 million, up 48% of revenues, up 10% of the same quarter last year, significantly outperforming our expectations due to strong operating performance and net utility costs. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance net of our FX hedges included a $3 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates, and $4 million of integration costs. Global Q1 AFFO was $627 million meaningfully above our expectations due to strong operating performance and more seasonal recurring capital expenditures. Q1 global MRR churn was 2%, a meaningful step down with lower short across all three regions. This improved churn is a reflection of our continued disciplined strategy of selling the platform to the right customer with the right application and into the right footprint. For 2021, we continue to expect MRR churn to average between 2% and 2.5% per quarter. Turning to our regional highlights whose full results are covered on slides 5 through 7. APAC and EMEA were the fastest MRR growing regions on a year-over-year normalized basis at 10% and 9%, respectively, followed by the Americas region at 4%. The Americas region saw continued momentum with record price adjusted gross and net bookings through pricing, and a large step up in cabinets billing. We're seeing good momentum across many markets in the region with particular spans in Dallas, New York and the smaller metros of Denver and Mexico City. We have a strong booked but un-built backlog and continue to expect a large step up in billing cabinet through the first half of 2021 as partially experienced in Q1 and with more to follow in Q2. Based on this momentum, we expect the Americas normalized quarterly revenue growth rate for the remainder of the year to be at or near 6% or better. Also, our prior hedging strategy minimizes the impact our business from the utility price spikes in Texas during extreme weather situation in February. Our power hedging program along with a world class operational management ensured we also protected our customers from these price spikes as well. There is no incremental revenue due to this unexpected weather situation. Definitely our Texas and Oklahoma wind farm settlements trended positively during this quarter. Our EMEA region saw strong bookings in the quarter, including healthy exports and record intra region activity. Although our flat markets remain core to the region's booking engine, we're also seeing increased customer interest in our edge metros with strong momentum in Dublin, Madrid, and Stockholm and our new market of Muscat and our soon to be open Bordeaux facility. Revenue growth remained strong, although moderated from previous levels as expected. As we lap past for successful cross connect repricing initiative. Interconnection revenue stepped up to 13% of recurring revenues, showing continued momentum. And finally, the Asia Pacific region has solid net bookings with good pricing and strong enterprise and cloud growth led by our Singapore and Japan businesses. Utilization rates continue to remain high, but with open capacity in key markets this quarter and will add additional capacity through 2021 to ease potential inventory constraints. And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to slide 8. We ended the quarter with cash of approximately $1.8 billion, an increase over the prior quarter, largely due to our inaugural euro denominated green bond refinancing, which raised EUR 1.1 billion and a weighted average interest rate of 66 basis points. As a result, Equinix now has the lowest weighted average cost of debt capital and the longest weighted average maturity of any publicly traded debt data center company. We also expect to refinance our remaining US or high yield bond over the near term. Further driving down our average cost of debt. Our net debt levels remain low relative to our peers at 3.7x at Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA. We continue to work alongside our credit rating agencies and are pleased to announced that earlier today, S&P upgraded Equinix to BBB flat and widened our leverage tolerance to five times. One, we're very appreciative of the continued support we get from S&P and importantly, we're delighted with this increased financial flexibility. Looking forward as stated previously, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to funding our growth opportunities while creating long-term value for our shareholders. Turning to slide 9 for the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $564 million including recurring CapEx of $20 million. We opened eight new retail projects this quarter adding 7,400 cabinets including a new IBX in Milan. On the xScale side of the business, we opened three new facilities in London, Paris and Tokyo adding an initial 28 megawatts of capacity in our JVs. All this hyperscale capacity has been pre sold. We also purchased land and buildings for development in Montreal and Mexico City. Revenues from owned assets represent 56% of our total revenues now. Our capital investments deliver strong returns as shown on slide 10. Our now 154 stabilize assets increase recurring revenues by 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Also consistent with prior years during Q1 we completed the annual refresh of our IBX categorization exercise. Our stabilized asset count increased by net seven IBXs. These stabilize assets are collectively 85% utilized and generate 27% cash on cash return on the gross PPE 0 :20:14.6invested. Now, please refer to slide 11 through 15 for update and summary 2021 guidance and bridges. Do note our 2021 guidance does not include any financial results related to the pending APAC - and acquisition, which is expected to close in Q2, or any future capital market activities. For the full year 2021, we're raising our underlying revenues guidance by $40 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance by $33 million, primarily due to strong operating performance and favorable net utility costs. This guidance implies a normalizing constant currency growth rate of 7% to 8% year-over-year, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 47%. And given the operating momentum of the business, we're raising our 2021 AFFO by $26 million to grow between 10% and 12% on a normalized and constant currency basis, compared to the previous year. We're also raising our 2021 AFFO per share to range to now grow between 9% and 11% on a normalized and constant currency basis. 2021 CapEx is now expected to range between $2.725 billion and $2.975 billion, including approximately $180 million of recurrent CapEx spend, which represents about 3% of revenues. This guidance also includes an incremental $200 million of balance sheet xScale project, funds that we expect to recover, after contributing these investments into our current and our future jayvees. So let me start here, I'll turn the call back to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Keith. In closing, we had a terrific start to the year. As evidenced by our results, the demand backdrop for digital transformation remains strong. And I'm very pleased with our Q1 execution and the continued progress against our key areas of focus. As the world's digital infrastructure company, we are supporting service providers of every size and shape to build out their infrastructure of the digital edge, infrastructure that is more global, more distributed and more cloud connected than ever before. And together, we're leveraging the power of our platform to cultivate scaled digital ecosystems, enabling our enterprise customers to access all the right places, all the right partners and all the right possibilities, as they transform their businesses and seek to accelerate their digital advantage. On behalf of the 13,000 plus dedicated members of the Equinix family around the world, I want to say thank you to our 10,000 customers for the trust they place in Equinix. Finally, we look forward to our Analysts Day in June, where we'll continue to the discussion of our highly differentiated business model, outlined the enormous opportunity ahead and discuss the actions we are taking and the investments we are making to drive sustained, long-term value creation for our investors and our customers. So let me stop there and open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. AriKlein: Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about the lower churn in the quarter? What specifically is driving that and whether or not maybe longer term, you see a path to maybe coming down from that 8% to 10% range that you typically see. CharlesMeyers: Sure, Ari. Yes, obviously a great quarter on churn, really, as you said in the script, one of the best we've had in a number of years. And, probably a little bit of timing there. We were - we had some kind of pull forward. And we probably pushed a little bit out, but I would say that I think that we are, we continue to believe and as we've talked about this many times that the best, our best way of managing churn is to continue to be really disciplined in our targeting and our execution of the go-to- market engine. And I think that we're seeing that. The mix of business continues to be right on the money for what we want, I think we're selling a lot of business into that the sweet spot of sort of small to mid-size, interconnection heavy applications and use cases. And again, I think that's going to bode well for us over time. So I mentioned this in several other forums, which is we have been the last two quarters up towards the high end of the range, and even slightly over run in q4. But now down right at the bottom of the range. And I think we're really seeing positive trending on the churn. So and we have efforts underway to really identify all of the really project out and look at churn, churn risk in the business in a very sophisticated way, identify and get ahead of it. And I think we're seeing real dividends from that. AriKlein: Got it, thanks. And then just maybe quickly on the new customer additions, it seems like you're a little bit off the recent pace, there is obviously a lot of activity and you're investing in the go-to-market, is that an area we should expect to see an uptick over the next few quarters? CharlesMeyers: Yes, I mean, I think that we're - our new logo additions continue to be strong, we had good momentum in new logos through the course of 2020. Q1 is a little bit of a seasonally soft quarter for new logo additions, typically, but we saw good results, I think enterprise demand continues to be very strong, our aggregate customer count is not going up as fast as our new logos, due to a variety of factors, including the fact that we are seeing some consolidation activity at the parent account level, we see some other movement in terms of people leaving the system either due to smaller, some smaller customers that might be leaving the system due to financial constraints or other things. But I would say overall we were seeing good, healthy new logo ads. And I think we're - we expect continuing to see the new customer count grow. Operator : The next question comes from Jon Atkin with RBC. JonathanAtkin: Thanks. Question about slide 19 on xScale, and then slide 23 on kind of the lease renewal. So, xScale, I'm just wondering, if outlines stuff it's opened up, so it's kind of in the pipeline? Is that the right kind of cadence to think about going forward? Or could that potentially accelerate. And if you could remind us how that translates into fee income, there's like four different ways you get paid, but some of that may be more front loaded than others before, where you would get the revenue before or recognize revenues before the customer actually moves in. And then on slide 23, just on the lease renewals, I'm wondering, what would be a realistic remaining pipeline to think about that would enable you to convert these properties to own properties? Or is it mainly a matter of managing your renewals going forward? Thanks. CharlesMeyers: Sure. Jonathan, why don't I start with a little bit of color on xScale at a macro level? And then Keith, if you want to jump in and share a little bit more on the fee streams and their impact in flow through into the business, that'd be great. And then we'll pick up the second question. But look, we're delighted with and the efforts of Krupal, and the xScale team and in the group of people supporting them from within the core Equinix, as well as the support we're getting from our partner at GIC, is things are really humming in terms of the xScale business. Obviously, we talked about the fact that we've had great pre-leasing activity on the facilities that we put out there, I think there is an opportunity for us to increase the pace, and we're going to come back to the Analyst Day, and really talk about kind of what we would see as the scope of opportunity for xScale going forward. As you'll recall, we talked about that in 2018, at the Analyst Day. And I think that we were - we certainly, I've said in a number of other forums, that we're trending more towards the high end of that. And I think we'll give more clarity on what's possible, we think in the xScale, business, but we're targeting the pieces of the pie out there that we think are really strategically important and add to the overall platform value. And again, we're seeing really good momentum in the business right now. I do think there's an opportunity for us to continue to pick up the pace. So Keith why don't you comment on the fee streams and impact in the fall through. KeithTaylor: Sure. So Jon, as always, the fees, there's four fee streams, two are recurring in nature and two are nonrecurring. And then the fifth, if you will, stream of value that comes in is global line through income, equity to affiliated entities. So basically, that's our equity ownership in the business. Now, having said all of that, you are starting to see the momentum picked up, as we announced in our prepared remarks, we introduced three new assets in this quarter, and all of them are pre sold. And so it gives you a sense that the momentum is picking, is picking up quite substantially with a fairly robust opportunity in front of us. So what you're going to start to see in the coming quarters is some nonrecurring aspects of the fee income, but you're really going to start to see a ramp up of the recurring fee stream as well. And, again, we'll talk more about it on in the June Analyst Day, but suffice it to say it is exciting to see the momentum coming from that team. Yes, so let me just leave it there. I think we answered your question. CharlesMeyers: Keith, why don't you pick up the lease renewals as well, and just what the opportunity might be for us to continue to increase ownership. KeithTaylor: Sure. And then the second one, as you're talking about Jon about the lease properties, there's a number of transactions that we are currently in the middle of, they are - we have negotiated the purchase price, the purchase of those acquisitions is built into our forward guide, no surprise to you both as relates to cash, but also the anticipated consumption of those lease arrangements inside our financials. So we are continuing to acquire, where we can, there are some that are that clearly are more important than others. And so where we can, we will focus on those that are the most important. Yet at the same time, as we think about our future growth. I think if my memory serves roughly 75%, of all of our future growth right now is on property that is owned or we have a long-term arrangement with our grand lease, and it's 75% is going into major metros, notwithstanding the fact that we still have 30 plus over 35 projects underway across the world in many, many metros in many, many countries. So all that said is you'll start to see that continue to go up, it takes time. And then we'll, I should say, we will answer when we're closer, but suffice it to say there are some transactions that we are anticipating to announce over the not-too-distant future. JonathanAtkin: Understood. And then just lastly, if I could squeeze this in, the Americas margins came in a lot higher, at least than we were expecting any kind of drivers of that or color you can provide. KeithTaylor: I think prepared remarks that I had, and like, first and foremost, the business is performing exceedingly well, the Americas business. One of the things when we report there's two aspects to it and there's the, if you will, the fundamental business that will compare apple-to-apple versus the APAC region, the EMEA region, and then there's the corporate overlay. So if I tell you more specifically the Americas region in and of itself, without the corporate overlay, margins are continuing to improve largely because we have very strong interconnection activity, where we continue to grow our customer base and our scale, and we're driving more profitability into the business. So that's the, if you will, the easy response. The second part is that just as timing of expenses, as you know, between Q3, Q4 and then this quarter, there's been some movement of costs around different quarters. And as a result we started to see the benefit of those of that movement in Q and Q4. Specifically, as a relates to Q1 though, again one of the comments we made was that we have a very strong utility costs for power hedging program, our operational team operate our businesses very, very effectively the assets, particularly in the Americas, and in this particular case, Texas. And so we have a strong hedging program that protected us against those spikes in price. But we also have a wind farm arrangement, where both in Texas, and in Oklahoma, we have wind farms. And so we had some benefits attached to that. And then there's some seasonality around a repairs and maintenance expense. But overall, you're seeing fundamentally a US business, our Americas business it is performing exceedingly well and continue to drive margin into its financials offset by the corporate investments that we've been making. CharlesMeyers: And mix a business was really good in the quarter two in terms of strong MRR performance, which always helps the margin. So, yes, really good quarter, we are continuing to invest. We're being disciplined about the pace of that. But and we obviously were pleased with the margin performance, and we do have an eye on margin expansion as a priority for us over time. Operator : The next question is from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. SamiBadri: Hi, thank you. My first question is to do to visit back on xScale. I know you guys have laid out quite a bit of information on that recently. But the one thing I think that would be very helpful is when we look at the originally published returns that you guys were targeting between 13% and 17%. I believe in the 2018 Analyst Day, did that include all the various forms of income that you're going to be generating from the xScale venture. And is also that the same yield range we should be thinking about for the xScale business. CharlesMeyers: Keith, do you want to take that? KeithTaylor: Sure. We're driving Charles direct traffic since we're in two different places. So pardon the pause. So as it relates xScale, look, number one is going to be very market dependent, right. Some markets are more competitive than other markets and you're looking at unlevered anywhere from sort of unlevered returns of 8% to 12% at the project level, we get a p stream on top of that. And then of course, we put - we some debt on the business. So as a result, when you look at hopefully Equinix position our return profile is as good if not better than what we've shared. Now, having said all of that, if you ask me on a specific project, there'll be some variation. But the team under Krupal's leadership is working really, really well. Not only with our construction team, but with our JV partners, to make sure that we get the right returns and we're negotiating appropriate with the various hyperscalers to get a good long-term contract. So overall, again, I'll just say that there's no material variance from what we said the bending is a little bit better. And as Charles made in his prior comments, in fact, there's probably a broader or bigger appetite over the coming quarters and years, though, given the momentum that we're seeing that you'd see maybe us do more than we originally anticipated, from the June 2018 Analyst Day. SamiBadri: Got it. Thank you. And then just one quick follow up for you, Keith, is I know that guide does not include any further capital markets activity, and you did mention that you're looking to retire the high yield debt that you have, are you going to reissue that as green debt or in another region? Are you targeting, do you have something in mind for when you do revisit that? KeithTaylor: Yes, Sami, no surprise to you, there'll be an element of green attached to any transaction that we do, we do anticipate that we will retard over the newer term, as I said, there's a relatively strong positive impact associated with that. And, again, I'll let everybody do the math. And what that is but there will be a blend of perhaps 5, 7, 10 maybe even 30-year terms that make sense that we go out that far, some of them will be green, that would be that tend to be on the shorter end of the curve. And then the only other thing I would say is to extent that we can, we will take advantage of those - the opportunity to make sure that we can retire some of our foreign debt, where possible and arbitrage over a favorable sort of interest rate environment. And the last thing I just want to say is again, we're delighted with the work that our Treasury team has been doing under Melanie's leadership, to negotiate with S&P and get a favorable upgrade. But what was really important here is more financial flexibility. And as many of you have asked over, both in our private sessions, but also on some of the calls, we've always wanted to have more financial flexibility as it relates to debt. And no surprise to everybody debts are cheapest source of capital. And as a result, you will see us continue to focus on refinancing the debt and then also using debt where appropriate, with some balance to equity, to make sure that we create this long-term investment portfolio that we've announced, from our perspective, I just think it was the best of all situations today that not only getting that upgrade, but also having the flexibility to drive down our cost of capital. Operator : And the next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. MichaelRollins: Thanks and good afternoon. First, I was just curious if you can just unpack a little bit more of the organic increase in the annual revenue guidance. I think that was up $40 million. And when you consider the size of that change on $6 billion of revenue last year, how does that fit into the organic, constant currency revenue growth guidance range of 7% to 8% for 2021 that was unchanged from when you provided that in the fourth quarter. And then just secondly, just a follow up on xScale. So it seems that for some of the projects, before they enter into the joint venture, you're taking some of this on balance sheet, you're running some of this on balance sheet from just a high-level perspective. Can you just help frame how we should think about the financial impacts? If that's happening relative to what's the core operating business and strategy. Thanks. CharlesMeyers: Sure. Well, Keith, why don't you go ahead and grab the revenue guide, and we can a pair up on the XScale follow up? KeithTaylor: Yes, So Michael, I think there are a couple things. One, when we do the charts, the charts that we've shared in the earnings deck with everybody, we really try to simplify it. There are two aspects to it. One is what is - how are the underlying business performance and its $40 million and uplift. The second part is what currency and based on the forecast rates that we're using it's 61 million down graph. But frankly, if I took the spot rates from today, which we don't do the day off, we also we have forecast rates, that $61 million would more would be cut in half, if not by more, just to give you a perspective. Having said all that, when you look at the fundamental underlying business, it's all about the rounding again, what we've done is we've taken a step up, added $40 million of revenue on $6 billion business. And now you're starting to see us move up into the range in the 7% to 8% range. So before the bottom end of the range, it was slightly below 7%. Now, you're basically you're in - you're well into the range on the 7% to 8%. Again, this is the first step that we've made since the Q4 earnings call, again, there's momentum in the business, and we're just delighted by the ability to be able to raise $40 million on the underlying business. MichaelRollins: And where's that $40 million coming from? Regionally or activity supplies? KeithTaylor: Yes, I mean, as it relates to our sort of our comments around the Americas business. I'm sure it wasn't lost and you was right to look at our comment that the Americas business for the next three quarters, it's going to be at our 6%, if not better, and so it gives you a sense of the Americas business, it had a record, not only a record bookings quarter, certainly on the net basis, the churn is moderate. And as a result, you're getting in Americas business continuing to perform. And so that's one aspect of it. And then the other two regions sort of down the middle there some aspect due to our prior pricing uplift in Europe sort of having the lappy through, if you will, those price increases, and some of the accounting adjustments we made last year. But the reality is that overall; the business is performing well across our platform. And that's what excites us most, that if I was to say one specific thing it\u2019s the Americas business, we're just delighted by the momentum that we're seeing. Charles made the comment in his prepared remarks, and there\u2019s over 4,000 transactions with over 3,000 customers in the quarter. We are operating at a scale that is just so substantial. And by the way, our pipeline is exceedingly strong. And so as a combination of all that, that has given us the confidence and the visibility to raise our guidance at this juncture. And we still have three quarters to go. And by the way an Analyst Day. CharlesMeyers: Yes, and then on the XScale piece, Mike, yes, we are kind of leaning in, and moving projects forward, even advance of those being into the JV structure, because we think the market opportunity kind of is there to grab. And, as Keith said in his script that there's a couple 100 million dollars there, we would expect to come out of that and sort of macro guide he gave overall, which would come in the form of reimbursement once those facilities move into the JV. And so that's something that we -- and but I would say that we our preference obviously, is for projects to be into the JV from the beginning. And I think we're now at a point where many of the projects will be able to do that with, but especially in markets where we are looking to either form new JVs or due to other circumstances, we are leaning in taking advantage of the strength of our balance sheet to move those things forward. But then looking to get, obviously, those things get reimbursed and come back to us, given that we're, again, our capital commitment into those projects is basically, one year that sort of a 10 to 1 ratio, since we're 20% owners, and we expect leverage on those projects. KeithTaylor: And if I can just add on to what Charles said there, I think the most important part is to recognize so when we do an uplift, like we said in this particular case of our CapEx spend, unfortunately, when you look at our financials, it looks like our CapEx has been elevated, but ultimately, when we get that reimbursement from the joint venture, it comes to a different line. And so it will be the sale or disposition of that construction and progress into the JV. And so basically, it's a gross up, if you will. And so that's how it gets represented, but going forward as Charles said, our objective is to do most of this work inside the JV instead of on our balance sheet. And we're working really hard and we'll probably spend some more. I anticipate we'll spend much more energy talking about this at the Analyst Day, because I think there's a really good story around that particular topic. Operator : The next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya from Mizuho. OmotayoOkusanya: Yes. Good evening. Congrats on the solid quarter. My question has to do more around some of the effects, or the FX impact. When I take a look at the new guidance assumption, just around the Singapore dollar or the Euro or the pound, it seems like there's an assumption here that those currencies are going to get, that the dollar is going to get stronger against those currencies. But all, we're really seeing the dollar getting weaker. So I guess I'm struggling a little bit with why the new FX assumptions are assuming the strength in the dollar, which is kind of causing this FX drag on to kind of otherwise, kind of stellar quarter and outlook. KeithTaylor: Sure. Do you want me to take that, Charles or - CharlesMeyers: You bet, yes, all yours. KeithTaylor: Okay, thank you for the question. And sort of thanks for raising it. I think if you were to step back and say what is the overall bias to the US dollar, it's for the US dollar to get weaker. And that is something that we anticipate. Having said all of that, when we go through our exercises to forecast and reforecast like every quarter, we have to look at the prevailing rates, irrespective of what they might be in the future. And so as a company, when we on the Q4 for call, if you recall, we took on 100. And there's $106 million, if you will, when that are back from the weakening of the US dollar versus the basket of currencies that we operate in. This quarter that actually reverse when we analyze the impact avails it was $61 million headwind. But as I said in one of my other responses, that's based on our forecast rate, so we use when we read it reforecast of the year, and we've given you the guidance, how you use the spot rates of today, there basically is that $61 million would drop, actually by $45 million. So it tells you that the US Dollar weakened again. So again, we try and bring a lot of discipline to how we message. It's at the point in time, if you do the forecast; we are not projecting forward on what might happen. If it does happen, then you'll see a benefit. And you'll see that benefit primarily because roughly 60% of our revenues are earned in currencies other than the US dollar. And so when the US dollar weakens, again, recognize we do have some hedges, and they take time to burn off, then you will see uplift in revenue accordingly. So hopefully that answers your question. And let me stop there and just see if I did answer your question. OmotayoOkusanya: Yes, that's actually very helpful. Now, I kind of understand some of the nuances around that. But if you can just indulge me with one more. I mean, when you were at the beginning of the year, it was a lot of concern, just around expansion of sales cycles whether it was in the hyperscale side, or whether it was on the enterprise side. Could you just talk a little bit about again, it seems like given your stellar quarter and some of the comments you've made about your verticals that really isn't a concern anymore. Is that a fair statement? CharlesMeyers: Yes, we I mean, honestly, we hadn't really experienced that other than I think in the very acute periods of COVID, where people were trying to sort of just figure out how to make the transition to work from home and really dealing with matters of survival. We did not see any sort of extension significant extension of the selling cycle, in fact, I would say that, I think what we're finding is that we're improving our skill set and capability of delivering the sort of the digital transformation-oriented messaging to our enterprise prospects and seeing good momentum in terms of bringing those sales cycle down. And so, yes, we haven't seen that hyperscale sales cycles are a little longer, but I wouldn't say they have protracted, in fact, I think we've made really good progress with several of our key hyperscale customers, trying to define more repeatable terms that we can do business under, which is compressing the timeframe in which we can get deals done. And it's been - that's been an important priority for us and one that we have really put a lot of energy into late and it's really important to our partners and customers. So I would say no, I feel good about sales cycle right now. In fact, I think when we're looking at our funnel, we are seeing a very deep funnel and we're feeling like conversion rates and conversion timing, support optimism about the remainder of the year, which is all kind of reflected in our guidance. Operator : The next question comes from Colby Synesael from Cowen. ColbySynesael: Great, thank you. Few questions. So on the - 2Q - yes on Q2 guidance. You mentioned you're using a wider range just given what could be some; I guess volatility within the nonrecurring portion. I was wondering if you could just give us some sense of what you're thinking MRR might look like and could we step back up to the levels we saw in the fourth quarter? And is that a better assumption going forward? And then secondly, just a point of clarification on your CapEx guidance, you maintain the guidance at $2.125 to $2.315 for the nonrecurring portion, but is that including the 425 to 475 for xScale, it felt like you were saying in your prepared remarks that it is included, but the way at least the press release looks like reads, at least reads to me like it's excluded. So I just want to get clarification there. And then just real quickly as relates to the Analyst Day, obviously, xScale is going to be a big focus. It's been a big focus of questions this evening. What else are you planning? Like what is the big focus? I mean, where do you think that investors are maybe a little bit off in terms of their thinking that companies really want to make sure you're going to be hitting home on. Thank you. CharlesMeyers: Keith why don't you talk about the Q2 revenue range, and MRR and then the xScale CapEx? And I'll pick up that last piece on the Analyst Day focus. KeithTaylor: Sure. Yes, Colby, as it relates to the nonrecurring, I think what you could see is that means they step up to if you think about Q4 of '20, you're at - you're starting to get to a percentage of nonrecurring revenue that could look something like that. As we said in the prepared remarks, and again, I know this quite well, because of some of the work that we're doing. And I made a reference a couple quarters back, that there are some large installations that were taking place in the first half of the year, it looks like that those will close and install in Q2, as a result, you'll see a step up, again, look, be more reflective of what you - the percent of revenue coming from nonrecurring that we saw in Q4. And then it moderate back down higher than Q1, but moderate back down more - to a more reasonable level for Q3 and Q4. So hopefully, is that helpful? I want to make sure - ColbySynesael: Yes, it's perfect. Thank you. CharlesMeyers: And then on the xScale, CapEx, Keith. KeithTaylor: Yes, I'm sorry, pardon me, as it relates the xScale CapEx that is included number. ColbySynesael: And then relative to Analyst Day, there'll be a number of things, yes; we will definitely talk about the momentum in the xScale business. Again, it will start flowing through and at least in positively impacting the overall business. But again, since we don't consolidate revenue there it's not going to be a major driver there other than some very positive flow through on the fee streams, and, of course, the continued strategic importance of that to our platform, overall. But I think our focus is going to be speaking about the overall opportunity giving some additional color on our views on the addressable market, and how it's expanding and how our relevance to digital transformation continues to increase in the eyes of our customers, we'll talk about what we're doing to continue to evolve our go-to-market engine to respond to that, including how we're, what we're doing on the channel side of things. We'll also talk about our roadmap for digital services, and how we're adding to and scaling capabilities like network edge and Equinix metal, and maybe what we have on the horizon in terms of how those digital services are really going to be responsive to how our customers are thinking about consuming and adapting their digital infrastructure for the world ahead. And I think that we're now we're continuing to see great momentum, great response from our customers, and we're eager to hear and share those things coming in June. Operator : And the next question comes from David Guarino with Green Street. DavidGuarino: Hey, thanks. Last quarter you guys mentioned the development yields for xScale have declined since you initially entered the hyperscale space. Can you just maybe talk about what's happened to hyperscale cap rates over that same timeframe and what that might mean for Equinix and their ability to achieve better pricing on JV than the initial ones that were done in GIC? CharlesMeyers: Yes, I mean, I would say that we did mention that and as Keith said, I think that our overall return profile continues to look very attractive in terms of what we think post fees and post leverage the kinds of returns that we're going to be getting on those projects. Although, as he also said, it is a wide range depending on individual projects and individual sort of market circumstances, because I do think there are markets where we've seen that, because I think Keith quoted 8 to 12 is the sort of yields that we're looking at in terms of a range, and there are markets that are certainly at the low end of that, where due to a variety of circumstances, and just the overall competitive nature of the market. But I think in terms of, I think we we're very pleased with the nature of our relationship with GIC, we think that we can continue to extend that and have other JVs of similar ilk around the world, under very favorable set of terms, we find ourselves to be very attractive partner, and based on the engagement that we've had, as we've looked at these JVs. And so we expect, we're going to be able to get very favorable terms for those partnerships, and having them be very much a win-win. So, Keith, I don't know if you want to add anything on that last topic relative to the cap rates. KeithTaylor: No. I think that was reflected in the comments. Again, it will be specific to the market, again, when we look at the project level, and then there's a p stream for Equinix. And then the leverage that we put on the business, and overall, we're pleased with the business. And, again, we're going to spend a lot more energy talking about this in the June Analyst Day, and we will be able to break out and give you a little bit more color. I think that will make you probably more satisfied with the overall project, Dave. DavidGuarino: Okay, no, that's helpful. And then maybe one more question. We haven't really talked about this topic in a while. But could you share your thoughts on public-to-public M&A for the data center REIT sector, and if Equinix could be a potential player in that? CharlesMeyers: Sure, I'll comment and Keith if you want to add, feel free. We again, we have always believed and we've been quite successful using M&A as a tool in terms of thinking about how to expand our business and create value for our customers and for our shareholders. That hasn't changed; we continue to believe that there are opportunities out there. I would say that probably more of them are aligned around in the private markets. And we've clearly been active in that regard filling out our platform geographically, and adding key scale in locations in some of our markets around the world. But we're not going to be if we felt like there were transactions that we think were highly strategic, and we're the right economics in terms of how they deal with flow through an accretion basis that we're going to be open to those things. But I'd say there's probably a little bias we're in right now more towards private opportunities and greater opportunities in the private markets, but we're going to always be have our eyes wide open. Operator : And the last question comes from Erik Rasmussen from Stifel. ErikRasmussen: Yes, thanks. Maybe just back on xScale, you really have been leaning into that initiative over the past few quarters. Can you just maybe comment on the environment as relates to the hyperscalars? Is this more concentrated with a few of the leaders? Or is it more broad based? CharlesMeyers: Yes, I mean, when we formulated the xScale entity and approach, we talked about a range of players there that would be that we would pursue relationships with and pursue business with. It is to some degree concentrated, I think that's just that's the nature of the hyperscaler community today, is that they the largest end of that is taking up more of the overall demand, or providing more of the overall demand. So it's concentrated at some level, but we have had significant success beyond sort of the three or four that would pop to mind for people right off the top of their head. And so, I think we're going to continue to evaluate those opportunities. But I and I would say that we're really continuing to build on a strong relationship we've had with that full hyperscale community for a very long time, because as I talked about with our - when I characterize our hyperscale relationships at the Analyst Day in 2018, we - they are amongst our largest customers, many of them, and that is a lot of it on the backs of really the important role that we play in terms of their network nodes, their on ramps, and other elements of their infrastructure, outside of sort of availability zones, and really large core deployments that might be more of the focus for xScale. So it's a very multifaceted relationship that we have with them. They're critical, we believe that as people drop adopt hybrid in multi cloud as the architecture of choice, we think doing that at Equinix is really going to be a priority for them in terms of both superior economics and performance. And so their relationships that we have with the xScale, with the hyper scalars are very important to us, and certainly too some degree concentrated from a demand basis, but we're continuing to strive to extend that to larger portfolio customers. ErikRasmussen: Great, maybe just my last, my follow up then any change in a competitive environment in Europe, around DLR and Interaction year after that deal is closed especially as it also appears that investment activity has picked up and demand still seems to be pretty robust there. CharlesMeyers: Yes, I would say no, not really. I mean, I think we continue to feel very good about our overall competitive position in Europe, as I said Interaction is, has always been a very critical, credible pan European player there and I think that continues to be the case. But we have, what we think is a much stronger global story. And I've had great success in the market and am going to continue to build on that success and we feel good about our position there. Katrina Rymill : Thank you. That concludes our Q1 call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. And thank you for participating.

In the interest of wrapping this call within an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to just one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Kate. Good afternoon, everybody and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As reflected in our results we are seeing significant momentum in our business as digital transformation outpaces previous expectations. Technology span is accelerating and Equinix remains uniquely positioned as traditional technology markets continue to shift as a service consumption models and hybrid multi-cloud is widely adopted as the architecture of choice. The pandemic is highlighted divisional infrastructure is not just a business enabler, but a primary source of competitive advantage for digital leaders across all industries. And we continue to see a multitude of trends driving infrastructure that is more distributed or on demand and more ecosystem connected than ever before, playing to our distinctive strengths. Our results reflect strong performance across our geographies, tremendous momentum in our market leading interconnection franchise and deep customer demand across our expanding portfolio of services. Against this robust demand backdrop, we had a great second quarter, delivering record bookings, fueled by continued momentum in our Americas business and strong quarter of Equinix metal. We processed more than 4600 deals in the quarter across more than 3200 customers, demonstrating both the scale and the consistency of our go-to-market machine. We achieved our 74th consecutive quarter of top-line growth and are pleased to have been recently been included in the Fortune 500, an exciting milestone made possible by the confidence our customers place on Equinix, and by the incredible commitment and passion of our 10,000 plus employees around the world. And we continue to expand our global platform with 35 projects underway across 25 markets in 19 countries, with Q2 openings in Bordeaux, Helsinki in Silicon Valley. Aligned with our values and our purpose, we're also proud to share further enhancements to our old commitments on sustainability, leading in across all elements of ESG. In early June, we became the first in the data center industry to commit to being Climate Neutral by 2030, backed by science-based targets an aggressive green financing plan and a comprehensive sustainability agenda. Aligned with the Paris Climate Agreement, this commitment is a critical step to ensuring Equinix continues to advance investments and innovations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and greening our customers digital supply chains. Additionally, as part of our ongoing focus on diversity, inclusion and belonging and our commitment to wellbeing we recently hosted our second annual WeConnect event, a 24-hour virtual gathering led by our employees, our employee connection networks and our VIV [ph] and wellbeing teams. This event celebrates quality, diversity and connection and offers our employees an opportunity to listen to learn and to engage in courageous conversations as we build a culture and a community, that can have a meaningful sustainable impact on the future of our world. Turning to our results as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q2 were $1.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 7% year-over-year and FFO was again meaningfully ahead of our expectations. Interconnection revenues grew 12% year-over-year, the solid unit ads and healthy pricing. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our global interconnection franchise continues to perform well. We now have over 406,000 total interconnections on our industry leading platform. In Q2, we added an incremental 7800 interconnections and now has 15 macros with more than 10,000 total interconnections. A reflection of the scale digital ecosystems that drive our differentiated value proposition. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 31% year-over-year, and we're seeing IBX diversify as largescale period expands to a broader base of enterprise customers. Equinix Fabric saw excellent growth across all three regions, driven by healthy unit growth and increasing yields as customers expand usage of higher bandwidth connections to interconnect regional and global footprints. More than 2600 customers are now on Fabric, and we continue to see strong attach rates as businesses diversify their end destinations and evolve their connectivity needs in support of highly distributed infrastructure and the adoption of hybrid multi-cloud. Turning to digital infrastructure services, customers are responding very positively as we augment our portfolio to enable physical infrastructure delivered at software speed. We have strong bookings of Equinix metal this quarter, including our largest link today with our channel partner Alarm [ph] for a blockchain company building a network of validation nodes across eight markets. Our network edge offering shows meaningful acceleration, with average deal size increasing nicely as enterprise customers are deploying a diverse set of virtualized network functions from our marketplace of vendors. Importantly, and as expected, digital infrastructure services are also driving strong cross-selling activity and interconnection pull through, with nearly 1000 virtual connections already provisioned to support these deployments. Shifting to our xScale initiative, we continue to expand our plans in light of robust market demand and positive customer feedback. Late in the quarter, we announced agreements for additional joint ventures in the GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund. When closed and fully built out the total investment between Equinix and GIC and our xScale datacenter portfolio will be nearly $7 billion across 32 facilities globally with more than 600 megawatts of power capacity. We currently have 7 xScale builds under development across all three regions, we prelease our entire Frankfurt nine asset in Q2, representing 18 megawatts of capacity fully committed in advance of delivery. With this field, we now have leased more than 100 megawatts of xScale capacity and 100% of our open capacity at lease. We're actively engaged with partners to develop entry plans and other expansion markets globally, including Australia. Now I'll cover highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical delivered strong bookings across all three regions, with particular strength and APAC as traditional carriers continue to invest in specialty telecom firms evolve their portfolios to address demand for cloud, mobile IP services and over the top delivery. New wins and expansions this quarter included [Indiscernible], a local telecom service provider, leveraging interconnection to better serve low latency financial customers. Crosslake Fibre a leading provider of network services deploying in our London for compared to 7 IBXs is to support the first new subsea cable laid across the English Channel in nearly 20 years. And a global telecommunications provider expanding their presence to new locations including Milan and Bordeaux. Our cloud and IT vertical saw continued momentum over indexing in Europe as organizations accelerate hybrid multi-cloud adoption. Expansion this quarter includes Zoom, leading video communications platform, expanding coverage and scale to support market demand. And a cloud delivered enterprise network security provider deploying infrastructure to support offerings in new locations. Our enterprise vertical achieved record bookings, with broad global strength punctuated by an exceptionally strong quarter in the Americas across several sub-segments, including healthcare, consumer services, business and professional services and retail. New wins and expansions including Redbull, a major sports energy drink manufacturer deploying infrastructure across all three regions to take advantage of Equinix's cloud ecosystem. A leading global cosmetics retailer deploying digital infrastructure to optimize their network, move out of legacy data centers and locate private infrastructure adjacent to their cloud providers. And a Fortune 500 Global insurance provider optimizing their infrastructure to support multi-cloud. Content and digital media also achieve solid bookings led by growth and CDN, publishing and digital media and gaming, as digital transformation continued to shape this vertical. Expansions include StackPath, a leading edge computing and services provider deploying infrastructure across multiple edge locations, Ernest Research a leading data analytics company is transforming network topology and interconnect into multiple files across platform Equinix, and i3d.net, a leading provider of application hosting and infrastructure services deployed on platform Equinix to enable a consistent high performance gaming experience globally. And our channel program continues to outperform, delivering a record quarter and accounting for over 35% of bookings. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals, and use cases including multiple Equinix metal and network edge deals. As the channel embraces our digital infrastructure services. We saw continued strength from Alliance partners like AWS, Cisco, Dell, Google, IBM, and Microsoft. And we also had success with key retailers around the world, including a win with HPE, the Rollers Group, a leading Australian retailer to modernize and scale their payments platform, which processes over 30 million transactions per day. So now let me turn the call over to Keith and cover results report. Keith Taylor : Thanks, Charles. And good afternoon to everyone. I hope you and your families are well and enjoying summer months. So let me start by saying it was great to spend time with many of you albeit virtually, at our June Analyst Day state. No surprise, we were eager to share our plans on how we intend to scale, extend and innovate the business over the coming years to drive long-term shareholder value, meaning more revenues, higher margins and more cash flows. With respect to the quarter the business continues to perform exceedingly well. At the macro environment, digital infrastructure continues to drive favorable demand. In fact, we exceeded our expectations. There are many highlights to share with you from the quarter. To start, we had record bookings activity at both the company and the American regional level. We enjoyed robust channel activity along with planned shared. Interconnection additions were solid with physically and virtually. And our digital infrastructure service lines which include edge and metal are gaining momentum. Simply put, we're continuing to execute against the goals highlighted at the Analysts Day. Given our performance, we're raising our guidance across each of revenues, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share for the year. Now let me cover the results for the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalizing constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q2 revenues were $1.658 billion up 8% over the same quarter last year, due to strong business performance across our platform led by the Americas region. And as expected non-recurring revenues increased quarter over quarter to 7% of revenues due to a meaningful step up an xScale joint venture fees in APAC and EMEA and custom installation work across all three regions. As you can appreciate, non-recurring revenues are inherently lumpy. And therefore, as a result, we expect the Q3 non-recurring revenues to decrease by $8 million compared to Q2. Our backlog of books, but yet to be built cabinets have increased slightly, despite the 4200 increase in building cabinets in the quarter. Q2 revenues, net of our FX searches included an $11 million benefits compared to our prior guidance rates. Total Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $797 million or 48% of revenues, up 7% over the same quarter last year, meaningfully outperforming our expectations due to strong operating performance and timing of spend. Q2 included a planned rebound of repairs and maintenance spending and higher utility costs relative to Q1. Q2 adjusted EBITDA net of our FX hedges includes a $6 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates and $4 million of integration costs. Total Q2 FFO was $632 million, including a $25 million recurring CapEx increase compared to the prior quarter above our expectations due to strong operating performance and more integration costs. Turning to our regional highlights, with full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC has the highest year-over-year revenue growth of 11% followed by the Americas and EEMA region both at 8%. EMEA revenue growth rate reflects the lapping of the significant interconnection price increases and other one-off positive adjustments from last year. We expect the EMEA growth rates return to normalize levels in Q4. The Americas region saw continued strength of our second consecutive quarter of record bookings at six of our seven largest markets improved over the prior year. Also, we're enjoying health, healthy booking activity across our smaller markets to including Atlanta, Austin, Denver and Seattle. Deals were focused on retail interconnected deployments with healthy pricing. And the Americas region also benefited from strong imports from the other two regions a reflection of our continued focus on platform sell. Our EMEA region have a strong quarter led by Dublin and Stockholm and our newly opened Bordeaux market, as well as high exports to the other two regions. Enterprises contributed approximately one third of the region's bookings, up significantly over the prior year. We're also seeing good momentum across our flat markets. And the EMEA region benefited from non-recurring revenues related to xScale fees earned from the prelease of our entire Frankfurt 9 and London 11 buildings, 37 megawatts of demand. And finally, the Asia-Pacific region had a solid quarter led by Singapore and Japan with strong regional bookings. Pricing for small and medium sized deals remain strong and we're seeing good traction with Equinix metal. APAC regions quarterly AMR growth was partially constrained due to COVID-related capacity delays in Singapore, a political uncertainty in our Hong Kong markets. And now looking at capital structure, please refer to Slide 8 and 9. We ended the quarter with cash of about $1.8 billion and our net debt leverage ratio is 3.8 times of Q2 annualized EBITDA, highlighting the financial flexibility and strategic advantage we have relative to anyone else in our space. In May we raised $2.6 billion, including in an incremental $1 billion in green notes. Biz Equinix is an overall investment grade issuance in late-2019, we've reduced our annualized interest expense by approximately $196 million, offset in part by the incremental debt capital raised. Our blended cost growth is now the lowest in the industry at approximately 1.7% and our weighted average maturity is nearly 10 years. We also raised $100 million of ATM equity in the quarter. We continue to expect to use both debt and equity to fund our future business needs with an increased lean towards debt capital. Turning to Slide 10 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $692 million, including recurring CapEx of $45 billion. We opened three new retail projects this quarter, including new IBXs in Bordeaux and Silicon Valley. We also purchased land for development in Frankfurt and Helsinki. Revenues from owned assets now represents 58% of our total revenue through the acquisition of our Singapore 3 IBX. On the xScale side of the business, after quarter end, we contributed a Dublin 5 asset to the EMEA joint venture and in return for net proceeds after our 20% equity contribution of $49 million. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 11. Our 153 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 86% utilized and generate a 27% cash on cash return on the gross PPE invested. Looking forward, we expect to exit the year closer to the top-end over our stabilized asset growth rate in part due to strong America's revenue growth. Please refer to Slides 12 through 16 for updated summary of 2021 guidance and bridges. Do note our 2021 guidance does not include any financial results related to the pending GPX India acquisition, which is expected to close in Q3. For the full year 2021, we're raising our revenue guidance by $50 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance by $27 million, primarily due to strong operating performance and favorable FX rates. Although slightly offset due to the timing of standards, we proactively pull forward expenditures to mitigate supply chain risks. This guidance implies a normalizing constant currency revenue growth rate of approximately 8% and midpoint compared to the prior year, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of greater than 47%. And given the operating momentum in the business, we're raising our 2021 AFFO guidance by $15 million going 10% to 12% on a normalizing constant currency basis, compared to the previous year, while also increasing our AFFO per share range. 2021 CapEx is now expected to range between $2.7 billion and $3 billion including an approximate $450 million of on balance sheet, xScale CapEx. A significant portion of which is expected to be reimbursed by either the current or future JVs and $193 million of recurring CapEx spend, a slight increase over the prior quarter due to timing of spend as we mitigate supply chain risks. So let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Keith. The momentum behind digital transformation is as robust as ever, and shows no signs of letting up. As the world's digital infrastructure company, Equinix plays a unique role in this evolving story and is positioned to be both a catalyst and a key beneficiary as we partner with customers to unlock the enormous promise of digital both economically and socially. As we discussed in our latest Analyst Day, say we are focused on three strategic levers as we execute on this transformational opportunity. First, we will continue to scale, doubling down on the strength of our core business, investing further scale our go-to-market machines to win new customers, putting our capital to work to add capacity in existing markets, and executing on targeted operations whether it's standardized simplified and automate. Driving expanded operating margins and providing a better experience for customers and partners. Second, we will extend the reach of our platform and accelerate our aspirations in xScale. By the end of this year, we'll be in 66 markets around the world and see continued opportunities for expansion and growth across the retail and xScale. And third, we will continue to innovate across our portfolio, scoring scalability, self-service and energy efficiency across our space [ph], delivering advanced features to sustain momentum in our market leading interconnection franchise and driving adoption of our digital infrastructure services to deepen our relevance to customers. Our ability to scale expand and innovate starts with our people. And with our commitment to building a diverse and inclusive workplace for every person, every day, you can confidently say I'm safe, I belong and I matter. We show up every day with an in service to mindset, starting by being in service to each other, which enables us in turn to be in service to our customers, to our communities, and to you, our shareholders. Purpose creates passion. And we are inspired by ours. To be the platform where the world comes together, serving as an enabling force for our customers in unlocking their incredible potential to deliver the innovations that enrich our work, our life and our planet. So let me stop there and open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open. Jordan Sadler : Thank you, good afternoon. So during the Investor Day last month, you guys outline the 7% to 10% annual AFFO per share growth through 2025. But you also suggested that next year could come in in the lower half of the range. I think efficiency initiatives took some time to ramp and you didn't have as much benefit from refinancing opportunities that have taken place. Given the acceleration you're still seeing in this quarter and the bump you've seen here, can you can you speak to what the trajectory looks like heading into next year? And then certainly as a follow up and just curious about the ATM in the quarter. I think Keith, you talked about significant incremental debt capacity, given sort of leeway offered by the agencies. And so we expect to see the equity raise in the quarter? Thanks. Keith Taylor : Okay, great. Thank you for the questions. Let me take the first one, let me take the first question. First and foremost, when we came up at the Analyst Day, one of the questions we spent a lot of energy talking about was the AFFO per share growth rate in 2022 relative to the broader guide. The reason I said it was going to be in the bottom half of the range instead of the top half of the range was, one that was a reflection of all the investments we're making across our portfolio this year. Not only as it relates to xScale, but also our digital infrastructure services and then all the efficiency initiatives. So we were absorbing the full annualized impact of those costs in in 2022. As a result, it tends to cause us to be a little bit more dilutive on the per share metric relative to the broader guide. In addition, of course, we've got a very strong guide for this year as well. So we've had the benefit of refinancing out of the majority of our high yield debt. And so you've got a little bit of wind at your back and you won't have that wind to get back next year. So that's the primary reason. Relative to the comments we made about this year and raising our guide, probably not a big surprise to many of you, as we saw a lot of this coming in is reflected in their long-term model. That all said, we saw the ability to move our numbers up. But it's a five-year plan as you can appreciate. And so I wouldn't say that we're changing the trajectory on the guide for Analyst Day, just because we had one good quarter. That doesn't feel like the right thing to do. Secondly, as it relates to ATM. Like anything, we are going to use a little bit of debt and equity. This was really commensurate with our commitment to our rating agencies to tap periodically at ATM facility. But we've dramatically reduced what we anticipate that we would otherwise use. And as a result, you saw $100 million. But the message that I had in the prepared remarks was really the lean is towards debt capital on a go forward basis, for obvious reasons when the cost of bad debt capital and even over the last few weeks has continued to trend downwards. And so that will be a lien on a go forward basis. So there is always going to be a little bit of land. But again, I want to want to make sure that everybody fully appreciates. We want to use the debt capacity that we have on our balance sheet to its fullest advantage, but also at the same time maintaining a very positive relationship with a rating agencies. Charles Meyers : Yeah, I might augment this bit in terms of Jordan in terms of just saying, I think in the environment as attractive as I believe we're operating in now in terms of seeing so much growth opportunity for the business. I think the ability to continue to ensure that we have the ability to respond to that and the balance sheet to do so. It's just something is top of mind for us, as Keith said and the lien is definitely towards debt for the obvious reasons. But I think it probably makes sense for us to I think have some level of ATM, just to continue to have optionality in the business. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from David Guarino with Green Street. Your line is open, sir. David Guarino : Hey, thanks, guys. I want to ask you regarding the 3%, stabilized revenue growth in the quarter and your comments on the acceleration of that, through the rest of the year. Was actually due to the timing of when the Americas bookings hit during the quarter. So it would be a little bit higher? And could you just remind us of the top end of your stabilized growth rate? Keith Taylor : Sure, David, yeah, we've typically guide three to five. So we're kind of at the bottom lower end of that range this quarter. I think there are some timing effects in there and there's also some onetime items, I think that are flowing through. But as we really unpacked that and looked at what we expected, towards the back half of the year, I think we feel good about as sort of moving more towards the top end. And I think that's partially due to just really, obviously really strong continued momentum in the Americas business and out of the full portfolio of assets there. So, 8% percent quarter there, obviously some strong NRR in there. But even on the NRR side, 6% growth really strong quarter. And so I think towards the back half of the year, we're feeling really good about the trajectory there on the stabilized assets same store number. David Guarino : Okay. And then switching gears, you noted strong bookings in the Atlanta market. Could you comment on which data centers in that market saw the strong demand? And specifically, I guess could you come in if your 180 Peachtree datacenter is gaining any traction versus other properties in that market? Keith Taylor : Yeah, I mean, that's where our focus is. I believe the 51 and putting the energy in there and continuing to build that ecosystem, which we believe has the critical mass of interconnection and ecosystem depth that is really necessary to scale our market effectively. So yeah, we're seeing good success there and again, the emphasis is on that Peachtree location in Q1. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you for the question. Charles, I have a question for you. And this is kind of going back a couple of quarters. I believe in the back half of 2020, you discussed that there was going to be an enterprise acceleration. And I know that dynamics now are actually picking up across the majority of the tech sector and we've seen some large-cap tech results that have reflect this, including your results. But, how would you describe your expectations in the back half of 2020? So what you're seeing right now? Is this coming in line or this coming ahead of what you were expecting in the back half of 2020? Charles Meyers : Yeah. As you indicated here, we were pretty optimistic and bullish about the momentum we were seeing with the enterprise customer, even during the more peak levels of the pandemic et cetera. And so we're seeing people, despite that saying, hey, we've got to be investing in digital. And so it will be showing up in terms of our pipeline build and, in our bookings, and just qualitatively in the conversations, we were having with customers. And so that's why we were kind of signaling that optimism. I think that is definitely translated how we expected it. And I would say that this quarter was even stronger than I think we would have thought it was going to be. And that's as reflected in our results and therefore, in the adaptation and our guide. And so I think the business, just a really strong quarter from enterprise perspective. As I said in the script, across all three regions across a variety of sectors, enterprise bookings, were very strong. [Indiscernible] channels a big part of that working not only in terms of pursuing hybrid cloud opportunities with our key alliance partners, and the cloud players, but also with our retailer portfolio partners. And so, yeah, I think we're seeing it in line or better than we had thought. And I think we expect to continue to see sustained output and growth from the enterprise segment and probably over indexing. Again, cloud and IT and enterprise have been over indexing for a very long time now. An enterprise just seems to be just on a tear in terms of its growth right now. Sami Badri : Thank you for giving us color on that. One quick follow up. And I want to ask you this, because this is the question a lot about investors actually asked me. And where do you think enterprises are in their kind of IT modernization cycle? Are enterprises 20% there, 40% there 60%? Where would you put them as far as a cycle in terms of where they are in their upgrades and modernization efforts? Keith Taylor : Yeah. I mean, it's obviously really hard to pinpoint that with any precision. But what I would say is, I do think it's still relatively early in terms of people whether they want to use a baseball analogy or whatever. I think it's early innings. We haven't past the midpoint here. And so I think there's a long way to go in terms of people who still have a lot of legacy IT architecture, that they're looking to adapt to that sort of hybrid multi-cloud world. And then the other comment I would make is that the pace of change itself is just continuing to accelerate. And so, I think that the technology life cycles and refresh cycles are shortening. I think people are thinking differently about how that idea, as I said, in my comments, a number of very large technology markets are dislocating as they shift to as a service. And as we talked about at Analyst Day, that provides an upside opportunity for us to get a bit more wallet share, as those things are delivered as a service with Equinix as a point of nexus for consuming those services. Because we're getting both the underlying service providers themselves locating infrastructure at Equinix. And then we're often able to deliver those services on the platform aligned with things like fabric and metal and other things that are allowing us more wallet share. And so I think it's still early days. I think there is a long period of IT architecture and digital transformation investment in front of us for the foreseeable future. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simon Flannery : Great, thank you very much. Good evening. Just on the normalization point again. Can you just talk about the supply chain side of things? And are there any challenges that you see both in terms of availability, basically as you get into more of the infrastructure businesses and then just inflation which some of the others in the food chain have been talking about with freight costs, et cetera? And you mentioned some of the challenges with COVID and some of the Asian markets like Singapore. I think we've also heard more stories about limitations on power and water and some municipalities kind of looking at datacenters in a slightly different lens. You obviously highlighted your ESG initiatives, but any color around you see that evolving and how the Equinix is positioned for that would be great? Keith Taylor : Thanks. Thanks for the question. I'll take the one around supply chain. Suffice it to say, we've been investing quite heavily. You've heard us speak about in our procurement and strategic sourcing initiatives under a very strong leadership. And as a result, we are getting ahead of some of the perceived constraints in the marketplace. And we're just normally managing our access into the production cycles for this year, but it's also contemplating our consumption needs for next year, that marries up nicely with also the inflationary exposure that one might otherwise have, by entering into broader commitments, you can mitigate some of that inflationary pressure as well. But that all said, I think we're making some great for having great successes and working with our partners or vendors and our suppliers. And then I would also go on to say that inherent in our contracts is a lot of inflationary protection. So there's the aspect of supply and demand and then there's the aspect of pricing. And again, we're very confident that our contracts will appropriately contemplate the exposure to the extent that you brought up your higher inflationary environment over the coming years. And so from both perspectives, we want to speed up and in both to make sure that we protect our industries and revenue, but we also have access to deliver the management support the cost model. I think we're doing a good job of that as a company. Charles, do you want to talk about the Singapore? Charles Meyers : Yeah, a little bit there in terms of - I think the question of - specifically as it relates to Singapore. I think there was a COVID related delay in terms of the timing of that facility, that created a little bit of revenue headwind, relative to the timing. Because demand for that is so strong for us, that we had planned on that coming online a little bit earlier. And so we're seeing a little bit less, despite that delivered a really strong quarter. And I do think there is a broader phenomenon, as you described in terms of markets thinking about how they're going to allocate capacity and deal with the demand for datacenters and the environmental impacts. What I would say is that, that's exactly why we're making the level of commitment into ESG and in particular, the environmental side that we are. I think, we're really positioned to tell a story there as now the leader going out and saying, we're going to be Climate Neutral by 2030. And then we're going to be in a position to really partner with municipalities to say, hey look, there's a tonne of economic and social benefit being driven by digital. I talked about that in the Analyst Day, to the tune of $100 trillion. And people want to tap into that, but they want to do so responsibly. And I think our ability to make the investments in ESG is going to continue to be something that really differentiates us. And that's not true only in Asia by any means. There's a number of markets around the world facing those same things. And honestly, I think that's going to be the thing one of the areas where we continue to separate ourselves from packs. One of the added piece of color on the prior question to on the supply chain sort of constraints issues. Now, as I've talked to some people about it. There's really kind of three areas in our business where you think about it. The data centers build side of things. There --because of our size, our market leadership et cetera, I think we feel like we're in a very good position to gain access to the equipment, we need to continue to hit our delivery dates. And so feeling in a good position there, but obviously, continuing to monitor trends. And on the networking side of our business where maybe we're a little less positioned, but what we've done is really said, okay, we're going to go ahead and make investments to mitigate risks there. And in fact, that's an area where we've had real success. And again, that showed up a bit in the quarter and in our guide, as we think about pulling some costs in. And then as the third level of is really at the digital infrastructure services line with things like metal. And that's an area where it's a smaller business for us. And so, it will be less impactful, but we are looking there about how we can partner with a number of folks to mitigate supply chain impacts there, especially since we had just come off a very strong bookings quarter for metal. And so we want to make sure that we can continue to sustain that momentum. Simon Flannery : Good color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Your line is open Brendan Lynch : Great, thanks for taking my question. You recently put out a press release related to the channel. And it was clearly another strong quarter for the channel in 2Q. Maybe you could talk a little bit about your changing approach there and what type of investment you might need to make to bring the new structure to fruition? Keith Taylor : Yeah, it really incredibly strong performance from the channel. And it's been that way for every quarter for. As far as I can remember, we've just been really delivering well in that arena. I would say that there's a few things. One, the relationship that we have, with what we refer to as our alliance partner group, you mentioned several of them in the script, again, the usual suspects, AWS, Microsoft, Oracle, et cetera. Those are posts that we are partnering with as enterprises think through their demand for hybrid infrastructure. They are wanting to advance sales cycles for their public cloud services. And in order to do so they have to have a comprehensive answer for the customer in terms of the hybrid infrastructure story. And so together, that's very much a one in one equals three kind of story. And we can bring that to the customer, and have really been effective in winning business together. And so we're seeing real strength there. On the retailer side, people that are combining value in certain ways with Equinix value to solve customer problems, we're seeing a nice uptick there. And what I would say is, we're seeing more concentration in terms of a smaller number of our really well - highly capable retailers delivering more of the revenue. And I think that's a good general dynamic for us. And in terms of the investments we're making, the big area there is really to continue to upgrade our processes and systems. To be very honest, we're not designed channel ready from the beginning and continue to adapt those to be more channel-friendly. So that, quoting, ordering, customer support can all be done in ways that support a customer of customer or a customer by channel partner in this case. And so the adaptation of our systems is - that's a multiyear sort of trajectory. But that really is some of the key areas that we're making investments to really better serve channel partners. Brendan Lynch : Great, just one follow up on that. I believe you have a goal of getting to about 50% from channel sales. What is the timeframe for that? And also, what effect on margins will be increased channel sales have? Keith Taylor : Yeah, I see people have asked me that question. And I've answered that. So I think you're probably referring to statements I made in the past of that I see no reason why we couldn't be 50%. I don't know exactly when that will occur. I do think that success with our - as we're seeing channel partners embrace some of our newer services like metal and network edge. Network edge is almost inherently sort of a channel or service, because we're partnering both with people that are providing their virtualized network functions, and then with providers who are bringing that to market in tandem with other value. I think we're seeing a bias towards continued strength in the channel. But we also have a continued great success with our direct selling team, and so both are growing nicely. So I don't know, our channels been over indexing a bit. And so I think we will trend towards higher numbers. But it's hard to predict, I think exactly where we land. I think if the newer services really accelerate, I think that could bring us the higher channel percentages faster. And in terms of impact on margins, they're really not particularly meaningful in terms of - our current model is slightly higher cost in that we often are double copying on commissions, when we have our direct team partnering with channels. But when you look at the customer lifetime value of these contracts, the implication of that to margins is actually quite small. And, given there is very attractive profile, in terms of return on capital and margin of some of these newer services, I don't feel like that's going to be a significant drag on margins. In fact, I think our other areas of margin expansion are going to overpower those. Brendan Lynch : Great, thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ari Klein : Thanks. And just maybe in the Americas, the cabinet additions have picked up which I think you've been alluding to over the last couple of quarters in the backlog. And now you mentioned that at least overall, committed backlog exceeded the build backlog. So how should we think about utilization rates I guess moving forward, it's around 73% now? A little bit lower than it's been historically. What kind of rate would you like to get to? Keith Taylor : I'll take that one. Clearly, you're right, the, we had a really good quarter something that we foreshadow for the last two quarters, particularly around the West Coast of the U.S. And so great success in particular with the cable landing station. That I'll say we've introduced some new capacity or the Silicon Valley 11 asset has come online. And so when you look at the overall utilization rate, it's still in the mid to low-70s. That said, we're going to continue to have success in the Americas. Charles alluded to and I've mentioned that. And so I would assume that utilization level is going to continue to move up as we consume the inventory of the assets were built. I'd also add just on that basis, I made the comment in my prepared remarks. The amount of booked but yet to be built inventory is up slightly, despite all of the inventory that we've got all of the inventory that moved into the billing queues. And so that's a real positive. So it gives you a sense that there has been substantial bookings already that will consume that inventory. The other thing I think is really worthy of note is quarter and for that matter, through the rest of the year. We anticipate it will continue to be selling into what was historically known as horizon assets. We've seen a real nice move up in as we said, six of the seven markets plus some of the smaller markets in the U.S. And that includes much of the capacity related to the formerly known as Verizon assets. So we're excited about the momentum. I think you're going to see the Americas region continue to perform well. As we said, last quarter and we're going to tell you this quarter through the rest of the year, and we'll update you on '22 when we get there. But overall, we're just delighted by the success we've seen on the heels of all this opportunity. Ari Klein : Thanks. Maybe just a follow up on the America's, AMR per cabinet came down slightly in the quarter. Was that just timing, given the cabinet additions? Keith Taylor : It is timing. And again, it goes back to large, as I referred to a large cable landing station deployment, it came at a different price point. And so you've got the timing impact, as well as a very large deployment on the West Coast. But overall, from a pricing perspective, we have seen great success. Charles alluded to it in his prepared remarks, just the number of deals that we're doing across a number of customers, the volume of activity and mainly small to medium sized deals with high focus on pricing on the pricing environment is playing out perfectly for the company. And as a result, despite timing, there's really nothing that is abnormal as it relates to our pricing environment. Charles Meyers : Yeah, I think that's just a better area where the healthy pricing and the business mix that is being reflected in the - across the board. It's just continue to be really strong, and we're hitting that sweet spot in the market, pricing is firm, and then interconnection activity is high. And all that comes together into a really an awesome story relative to yields. And so it's been years now, because people are always saying, can they - can the Americans get better. And here's a guy I was always like, okay, that's pretty darn good and yet it continues to rise. So it's been - it's really been a good story. Ari Klein : Great, thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi. Your line is open. Michael Rollins : Thanks. And good afternoon. Just a couple of follow ups. So first, there was a mention that the cabinet backlog increased in the quarter. And I was curious if that's relative to the 11,000, that was disclosed at the Analyst meeting in June, and how that might compare to historical levels of backlog? And then secondly, the gross new global customers added in the quarter increased to 270. And curious if you could unpack how the increase in this metric could influence your future results and where this increase may be coming from. Charles Meyers : If I take the backlog question, I'll take. Keith Taylor : So on the backlog Mike, we did disclose 1000. Over the last three quarters, we have seen an increase to this level. I'll refer to this as an elevated level of backlog. So it did increase slightly over the prior quarter. And as a result - again, it's a reflection of the momentum in the business, also, to some degree, the tightening of our booking activity very, very strong June. And because of the strong June, of course, that goes into booked but yet to be build. But overall, into momentum that we're seeing not only in the activity of the booking activity, what it means for the backlog, but even more importantly, the depth and scale of our pipeline as we look forward. And that's really about revenue. In all three cases, that seems to be enough up into the right movement. Charles Meyers : On the new customers, I'd say we continue to feel really good about our new logo capture capabilities both direct and via channel. And interestingly via channel isn't necessarily showing up in customer account. Because oftentimes, those are the customer record is the channel partner. And so it's actually there's even more strength than sort of appear on the face of the results overall. And in terms of where they're coming from, I think we're having pretty uniform success geographically. So there's no one region that is significantly outpacing the others. Obviously, we have really strong quarter for the Americas. And that selling team, I think, has been doing an exceptional job. But we're also seeing good new logo capture across the other regions as well. And in terms of how it translates into business, you do see that new logos over index on a growth rate perspective from vis-\u00e0-vis existing customers. And so I think they have the opportunity to as we can continue to do that. That's really why when we talk about this three-legged strategy of scale, expand, innovate. Scale is with the customers are buying. And so let's continue to get new customers and add capacity in existing markets to serve them. Then expanding in terms of new geographies to increase wallet share. And then the innovation side, which is really bringing in new services and the ability to capture more wallet over time in terms of the service types. And so I think it gives us a really a multi-dimensional growth opportunity that's really showing up. So new customer, definitely, look we still get the bulk of our bookings from existing customers. And that sort of always good news and that our customers are expanding. There's less friction and that. There's lower cost to acquire. Customer lifetime value is continuing to go up. But new customers are definitely the lifeblood for the business as well. And so we're having focus there and real success there. But it's fairly uniform both across geos and across our products. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Colby Synesael with Cowen. Your line is open. Colby Synesael : Great. Two modelling questions, if I may. One in the AFFO calculation, there was an adjustment for impairment charges of $33.6 million, and just curious what that is? And then secondly, you've done just over, I think 40% margin in the first half. You're getting to just over 47% for the year. So obviously an implied downtick in the back half. Where are we most likely going to see that as at COGS, sales and marketing or is it G&A? Thanks. Keith Taylor : So let me just take the impairment charge first. And Charles and I will respond to the other one. There were some federal tax adjustments associated with the causing of some matters in the quarter. And as a result, because to the tax - and you have to keep pure. And you'll see that there's basically a substantial decrease in tax. It was primarily in relation to a transaction we did in Australia, vis-\u00e0-vis Metronode where we're indemnified by the other party. And as a result, you've got the benefit on the tax line, that you impaired your assets on the other way. And so net-net, it has no meaningful impact on the P&L, but it gets disclosed separately and it's grossed up. And so itself shows itself independent in the other income and expense line. So that's what happened there? But again, as it relates to AFFO there is no meaningful move, because it was embedded in the other lines. Then as it relates to the margin question. Yes, we've done very well in the first two quarters of the year. As we continue to say, we want to guide you to what we think will happen for the year, no surprise. And although for the year, we're saying greater than 47%. We are making a relatively meaningful investment. Q2, we added net roughly 250 heads to the organization, Q3 and Q4, we're going to add another 700-800 heads to the organization. And as a result, you're observing the human capital that we're - that we need to invest in our growth. And so that's one aspect of it. Two you've got the seasonal impact of utilities in the Americas that's coming through. And then three, because Q1 and Q2, we've had the benefit of a number of non-recurring revenue items that don't carry a lot of cross with them. So the JV fees when we sell an asset, and we get a sales fee, or we get a development fee. As you know and as you can see in our results, it comes through the revenue line, but there's very low drag to the bottom line. And so it can be inherently lumpy. And we just don't see a lot of that through the second half of the year. If anything, as I mentioned, non-recurring revenue will go down Q3 over Q2, but then it's going to flatline in Q4, and there will be another one-off fee that likely gets recorded in the fourth quarter. The bottom line - Colby Synesael : But even with that fee that you just mentioned, you think that NRR is flat in 4Q versus the 3Q number? Keith Taylor : Yeah, it is. That's correct. Colby Synesael : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Tim Horan : Thank you. We've seen some pretty transformational outsourcing by the carriers, the hyperscalars. Do you guys think it will be an important partner there? And will that just also attract your new enterprise customers fewer locations? Thanks. Charles Meyers : If I understand that, you're asking if the carriers themselves will be attractive partners for us to attract enterprise customers. Tim Horan : Well, AT&T is outsourcing their core network to Azure. And we've seen this announce something, but AWS. Do you think, will you be an important part about outsourcing, helping to hyperscalars and AT&T and other carriers are looking to do the same thing globally? Charles Meyers : Yeah, I think so. I think that we definitely have an opportunity there. I think that overall supply chain is definitely showing sort of signs of reshaping a bit. But as you know, carriers are really important set of partners for us as it is. In fact, it's our enterprise success, it's actually more than what is reflected in some of our results that we report to you in this earnings deck for example. Because some of the revenues on the enterprise - on the network side are really carrier selling enterprises. And I think when you have this dynamic of carriers, working with other providers that are, that are really taking a different and more non-traditional approach to building their infrastructure. And Dish is a great example there. I think we have absolutely had an opportunity to continue to play. And our points of interconnection and really act as key points of nexus in in some of these architectures, that I think are going to be important pieces of the puzzle. So yes, absolutely. In fact, our business development team is really quite active in really thinking through edge opportunities and some of these more emerging infrastructure areas where people making new significant investments, unlike what you're seeing from Dish. Tim Horan : And just a follow up to that, do you think qualitatively the hyperscalars are more likely to outsource infrastructure or the insourcing more? What do you think the trend is heading there? Charles Meyers : As we do see some a greater level of appetite from some of the hyperscalars to self-provision. But I think that the demand is just so robust, that there's going to continue to be a huge amount of that, that is going to need to come from third-parties. And so - and as we've already said, our xScale aspirations aren't to sort of go, capture share in in huge buckets. That is really to grow that business by targeting attract have been strategically important locations and deployments that we think play to the overall benefit of Equinix and deliver outstanding returns to the JV and for our JV partner. And I think we're really executing very well on that strategy. So I think there's plenty of opportunity out there. But there is some, I think some of the hyperscalars are seeing desire to self-provision in certain markets. Tim Horan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our last question will come from Jon Atkin with RBC. Your line is open. Jon Atkin : Thanks very much. So a question on hyperscale, Slide 20 xScale looks like you did 37 megawatts of leasing, you've got 140 megawatts of capacity. And if I'm interpreting the lower right numbers correctly, 31 megawatts available to sell? So I guess my question is, what's the type of wage that we should expect annually quarterly in terms of at least a number? And at what rate to that 140 grow kind of on a quarterly one-rates? Keith Taylor : Yeah. I would say one of the comments we made was, we have seen a lot of success. And Charles made the comment previously, virtually everything was built was now sold out. And so we're going to continue to ramp up dramatically. One of the things that is critically important in the xScale initiative is for plan. And quite openly, we've had more momentum in the business than we originally anticipated. So the teams are working exceedingly hard to procure - secure future inventory. And it's probably a little bit early to tell you exactly how that will present itself. But suffice it to say, we'll continue to provide a really detailed and detailed summary of all the different builds that are going on across the three regions of the world. And again, we anticipate that xScale will be in all three regions of the world now. And as we said, with the GIC initiative, about $7 billion of capital over 32 buildings and 600 megawatts, that is through time period in 2025 will take us to 2025 and beyond. But that doesn't take into consideration some of the other initiatives that we're working on, including another joint venture with a different party. And so as we continue to progress, we'll just update you and the rest of the community. But we are seeing great success, if I can summaries this. So that diversity, everything that we have built and we're continuing to procure and secure more land and capacity to build up for the future. Charles Meyers : Yes, it's not 00 certainly not precise. I realized, but I can tell you that the next 140 to come a lot faster than the first 100 employees. And because, we're definitely accelerating putting capital to work and seeing, seeing the success. Jon Atkin : Great. And then lastly, the balance sheet is showing $227 million in assets held for sale. Can you remind us what is it you're selling? Keith Taylor : Those assets typically, so Dublin was the first example of that. Our Dublin 5 asset moved to the joint venture on July 7. And so that's an asset that is available for sale. We have some other assets. Again we're investing the capital on our balance sheet, and then we're going to transition or contribute it to the joint ventures and move and thereby get a recovery of those investments that have equity or ownership. So those are just the assets that are sort of queuing up to be delivered to the joint ventures. Jon Atkin : Thank you. Katrina Rymill : Great. That concludes our Q2 call. Thank you for joining us.

In the interest of wrapping this call up in an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to just one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Kat. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We had a great quarter, achieving our 75th consecutive quarter of top line revenue growth and a record Q3. A clear signal of strong market demand. Our results were fueled by continued strength in our Americas business and robust performance for our channel program globally as key partners continue to see Platform Equinix as a point of nexus for digital transformations solutions. The pandemic has triggered and accelerated need to digitize business models in virtually every segment of the economy. And our strong results reflect its increasing demand for digital infrastructure and Equinix remains uniquely positioned to help customers as they shift towards distributed, hybrid, and multi-cloud as clear architecture of choice. As we continue to strengthen our position as the world digital infrastructure Company, our focus remains on creating distinctive and durable value for our customers and our shareholders, driving growth in scale and our market-leading colocation franchise, expanding our relevance in Cloud ecosystem through xScale, and tapping into massive sources of incremental demand by adapting to evolving customer needs with our rapidly growing digital services business. Turning to our results as depicted on Slide 3. Revenues for Q3 were $1.7 million, up 8% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA was up 4% year-over-year, and the AFFO was in line with our expectations. Interconnection revenues continued to outpace colocation revenues, growing 11% year-over-year, driven by solid fiscal cross connect growth and broad adoption of Equinix power. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. We process more than 4,200 yields in the quarter across more than 3,100 customers highlighting the reach, scale and predictability of our booking digits. We have a solid demand pipeline as we look in the final quarter of the year, and we continue to add capacity in services demand with 11 major projects delivered this quarter in key markets like Frankfurt, New York, and Singapore, and 31 more major projects underway across 23 markets in 16 countries. Our global interconnection franchise continues to thrive with over 414,000 total interconnections on our industry-leading platform. In Q3, we added an incremental 7,800 interconnections now have at least 1 major cloud on-ramping, 42 metros around the world, 2 times more than the nearest competitor. A clear indication that Equinix is the home of the interconnected cloud. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 6% quarter-over-quarter, and 30% year-over-year to over 21 terabits per second, as traffic growth remains robust. Equinix Fabric saw excellent growth continuing significantly over index within the broader interconnection portfolio. More than 2,800 customers are now on Fabric, attach rates moving up into the right as businesses diversify their end destinations and service providers integrate Fabric into their own solutions. In September, we extended Platform Equinix into our 27th country, with the close of our GPX acquisition, entering the strategic Indian market. Our 2 data centers in Mumbai form a network-dense campus with more than 350 international and local companies, including 6 on-ramps to the world's leading Cloud service providers and a robust network ecosystem. GPX represents an ideal entry point into this top 10 GDP country, and we expect to expand our operations significantly in India over the coming years as we tap into this rapidly growing market. In parallel with our tremendous retail success, we continue to expand our xScale business. In October, we announced plans to expand in Australia with an agreement to establish a $575 million in joint venture with PGIM real estate to develop two data centers in Sydney, which will provide more than 55 megawatts of capacity when fully built. Also, during the quarter, we closed the first phase of our previous slide-outs to [Indiscernible] joint venture with GIC and signed 2 megawatts with the hyperscalers in Frankfurt. We currently have 8 xScale built under development, including our newly announced [Indiscernible] 3, Mexico C3 and Sydney 9 assets, which will collectively added 25 megawatts capacity when they open in the first half of 2022. The total investment of our various hyper-scale joint ventures when closed and fully built-out, is now expected to be more than $7.5 billion across 34 facilities globally with more than 675 megawatts of power fast. Turning our [Indiscernible] recharge services, our Equinix 's metal business saw strong revenue growth at Cloud-native and service provider customers continue to embrace the ability to deploy physical infrastructure at software speed. And network-edge is our robust growth as established customers purchase more virtual network functions across additional metrics. By year-end, we expect network-edge to be available in 25 metros around the world. So let me cover highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical continues to be a foundation for the business. With strength in the quarter in cable and satellite sub-segments and continued momentum in joint go-to-market with our top net with partners across the globe. Expansions this quarter included Zayo Group, a global communications infrastructure Company adding interconnection and colocation capacity to support demand, Vocus, Australia's leading specialist fiber and network solutions provider, building infrastructure in both Sydney and Melbourne to offer network services, and Hurricane Electric, a global network service provider, utilizing Equinix Fabric to allow Enterprise customers to access their IP transit products at scale and in real-time. Our enterprise vertical saw another strong quarter led by manufacturing in FinTech and record channel activity. New wins and expansions included a Fortune 100 -named manufacturing Company, deploying global network hubs to enable their stats analytics offering, a leading technology manufacturer deploying a custom-liquid cooled environment and solution center to support the next-generation of high performance compute, and a Fortune 250 online retailer and e-commerce platform, deploying across Platform Equinix with low latency, cloud-adjacent network hubs to support their retail branded sites. Our cloud and IT verticals saw particular strength in the Americas, as industry-specific cloud solutions continue to be a catalyst for innovation and new growth. Expansion this quarter included Adobe, a leading cloud software provider, deploying infrastructures towards platforms and optimize sustainable participation in key digital markets and ecosystems. Wasabi, a U.S. based object storage Company expanding their offering on Equinix Fabric into APAC and EMEA, enabling customers to easily connect their bare metal workflows posted on Equinix Metal, and a top 5 global software provider deploying core metals to support their growing user base in demand in both Mexico City and Sao Paulo. Content and digital media had a great bookings quarter with resurgence in this vertical being led by APAC and broad-based strength in the gaming and streaming sub-segments as consumer demand for at-home digital services remains strong. Expansion this quarter included Netflix, a global streaming services spanning across Platform Equinix to new and existing markets to support OTT delivery, Kingsoft, a Chinese cloud provider expanding into sand port to support rapid sales growth, and a top 3 content distributor extending coverage and scale for its growing platform in the delivery of new and existing security solutions. And our channel program continues to shine, delivering another robust quarter. This important go-to-market notion accounted for over 35% of total bookings, nearly half of our enterprise bookings in more than 60% of our new logos in the quarter. We are benefiting from tremendous momentum in hybrid cloud adoption and seeing particular strength from joint enterprise pursuits with our key alliance partners such as AT&T, AWS, Dell, HPE, and Microsoft. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and included a marquee win with NVIDIA, IBM, and SBA for Continental Group, a worldwide automotive parts supplier billion - interconnected global network to optimize workloads and speed up AI training for their advanced driver assistance systems. So now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Keith Taylor : Great. Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to all. Well, let me start by saying the Equinix business continues to hum, and once again, we met our expectations are better. We had a very solid quarter. The macro-environment for digital infrastructure continues to drive expanding market opportunities, as demonstrated by another outstanding bookings quarter, both at the gross and the net level from our industry leading go-to-market engine. Our bookings backlog remains both significant and elevated as we work to install the substantial volume of business close through the past few quarters. And our forward-looking pipeline is extremely healthy in all our regions. Our channel sales activity was the best in our history and our global platform delivered healthy, inter and inter-region activity. We have firm MRR per cabinet yields with yet again, net positive pricing actions, a validation of our differentiated operating model compared to others in our space. On a year-to-date basis, our global design and construction and OPS teams have delivered more than 18,000 cabinets of retail capacity, and 40 megawatts of xScale inventory while also rolling out critical network infrastructure assets across our targeted markets with support of our Fabric, network edge, and metal service offerings. We've seen no major delays today with delivering new capacity despite general market concerns related to supply chain challenges. A reflection of the efforts put forth by our best-in-class procurement as strategic sourcing teams. Now, let me cover the results for the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalizing constant currency basis. As depicted on the Slide 4, global Q3 revenues were $1.675 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year due to strong business performance across our platform led by the Americas region. Non-recurring revenue represented about 7% of revenues due to an increase in custom installation work and EMEA xScale joint venture fees. For Q4, we expect MRR to trend downward, decreasing sequentially by approximately $12 million due to lower xScale fees and the timing of large customer installations. Q3 revenues, net of our FX hedges included a $6 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Total Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $786 million or 47% of revenues at the high end of our guidance expectations due to timing of spend and low integration costs. Q3 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges included a $3 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates at $3 million of integration costs. Total Q3 AFFO was $628 million, the result of strong operating performance, consistent with our expectations. Similar to prior years, we expect seasonally higher levels of recurring capex in Q4 as our operating teams work to complete the 2021 projects. Total Q3 MRR term was 2.1%. We continue to expect MRR turn for the full year to be at a lower end of our targeted quarterly range, up 2 to 2.5%. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC region's revenue grew 11% year-over-year, followed by the Americas at 7% and EMEA at 6%. As previously discussed, we expect the EMEA growth rate to return to normalized levels in Q4 as we lap interconnection price increases, and the other one-off positive adjustments from last year. The Americas region saw continued strength with our third consecutive quarter of record bookings with a broad distribution across metros, including some of our smaller markets such as Boston, Denver, Mexico City, Seattle, and Toronto. The America sales teams continue to sell the global platform within notable increase in activity coming from our Canadian team, a benefit derived from the transaction with Bell Canada, which is outperforming our expectations. Our EMEA region had a solid quarter with strength coming from our Amsterdam, Frankfurt, and Madrid markets as enterprise customers and the channel drive bookings. And as we aim to meet high sustainability and efficiency standards while progressing towards our 2030 science-based targets, new builds like our recently opened Frankfurt IBX service a model to blended of positively contributing to the local microclimate. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a solid quarter with momentum across all of our metros led by Singapore. New deal activity focused on small to medium-sized deployments with firm pricing and continued strength in our cross-border zone. Our Hong Kong markets saw a nice rebound in bookings performance, although continues to feel constrained given the market uncertainty. And now looking our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. We ended the quarter with cash of about $1.4 billion and our net debt leverage ratio remains low, particularly relative to our industry peers. Our balance sheet remains highly flexible in liquid and we have our low AFFO cash payout ratio. With regards to our outstanding debt, we have minimal near-term exposure to potentially rising interest rates with 95% of our debt fixed at a weighted average maturity of over 9 years. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $678 million, including recurring CapEx of $48 million. We opened 11 new projects this quarter, including new [Indiscernible] in Frankfurt, Osaka and Singapore, and purchased land for development in Barcelona, Frankfurt and Helsinki. On the Zale side of the business, we opened our Sao Paulo 5 and Frankfurt 9 assets. We also closed the first phase of our media 2 joint venture with GIC for net cash proceeds after 20% equity contribution of approximately $140 million, including 30 more $4 million coming from the contribution of our Sao Paulo 5 asset into the joint venture after quarter ends. On a separate note, we continue to actively manage our practices, suppliers and have built up an appropriate inventory of parts and components, as we hedge against supply chain challenges in support of our business needs. Finally, total recurring revenues for more asset stepped up 59% due to the acquisition of our Sydney 1 and Sydney 2 IBXes. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our 153 stabilized assets increased recurring revenue by 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 86% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. We expect to exit the year closer to the top end of our stabilized asset growth range, and part due to strong Americas revenue growth. And please refer to Slides 11 to 50 for our updated summary of 2021 guidance and bridges. Do note, our guidance now includes the anticipated results from the GPX India acquisition, which closed in September. For the full-year 2021, we expect revenues to grow approximately 8% on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our updated revenue guidance implies our largest ever quarterly step-up in recurring revenues on a normalized basis. A reflection of our continued strong execution. Revenues include about $5 million from the GPX acquisition and reflect updated FX rates. We expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA margins, before integration costs to be greater than 47% and now include about $3 million from GPX Acquisition and reflect updated FX rates. We expect to spend $80 million of integration costs in 2021. And we expect 2021 AFFO to grow 10% to 11% on a normalized and constant currency basis compared to the prior year and to deliver AFFO per share growth of 9% to 10%. Our AFFO guidance includes some AFFO impacting accelerated spend, including recurring CapEx, an elevated cash commissions associated with our strong bookings performance. 2021 CapEx is expected to range between $2.7 billion and $3 billion including about $450 million of on-balance sheet xScale CapEx, a significant portion of which has been or will be reimbursed by the JVs, and $193 million of recurring CapEx spend at the midpoint. So let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Keith. Our business continues to perform exceptionally well delivering strong and consistent results throughout the changing times. The pandemic has been a driving force for digital transformation and as businesses seek to respond to this imperative, the infrastructure underpinning these services must keep pace. We continue to prosecute multiple compelling growth factors, expanding our platform geographically, scaling our go-to-market engine to capture new customers, and bringing new services to bear that will expand our addressable market. We're evolving the way we design, create, and deliver our products and services to fuel our growth and meet the changing needs of our customers. To that end, I'd also like to welcome Ron Guerrier to our Board of Directors. As a veteran CIO to Fortune 500 corporations and government, Ron brings a unique perspective to the Equinix board as we continue to innovate our digital infrastructure offerings for the digital leaders of today and tomorrow. I'd like to close by expressing my gratitude to our more than 10,000 employees, whose commitment to keep our customers at the center of everything we do continues to drive our market leadership. They embody our commitment to show up every day with an in-service to mindset, starting by being in service to each other, which in turn allows us to be in service to our customers, to our communities, and to you, our shareholders. So let me stop there and open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We would now like to open the phone lines for question. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ari Klein from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ari Klein : Thanks. It sounds like new customer net adds have been up a fair bit this year and the channel partnerships are doing really well. Can you provide some additional color on what you're seeing there, maybe where you're seeing the most traction from new customers, and also in the channel from a regional standpoint. Charles Meyers : Sure, yes, I mean,-- I think we're seeing strength across the board, but really the enterprise side of the business, I think is where a lot of the new customer ads are coming from. And most of those, about 60% are coming through channel, as we talked about in the script. So we're seeing a big uptick that said more than 35% percent of the bookings coming through the channel. And I think it's been really encouraging, We're really seeing strength with our top channel partners and really our top alliance partners in particular, who are really engaged in joint enterprise pursuit with us. In terms of pursuing hybrid multi-cloud opportunities and people implementing hybrid architectures. And so -- in fact, I'll give you a start. We had our top 4 alliance partners in this quarter accounted for 10% of the total bookings. And that's not 10% of the channel book, is that 10% of the total bookings. So really strong momentum with the channel partners and it's across a number of verticals and it's across a number of use cases, but real strength in terms of how people are thinking about using corporate data to draw insights, how they, therefore, want to store that data centrally, act on it from a variety of cloud resources, and then, also AI as a key driver. In fact, we had a big win -- big joint win with NVIDIA on that front as we talked about in the script, and so really great progress there, and I think the range of use cases is really strong. We had -- in fact we had an event today that we call Connects (ph) that was -- we had I think about 500 registrations for that event -- for enterprises talking about a variety of use cases implemented on Fabric and so we're seeing some really good momentum. Ari Klein : Thanks. And then just on churn, it's tracking well below where it's been in historically. What's driving that and how sustainable do you think that is moving forward? Charles Meyers : Again, I do think that that's a durable trend. I would always comment that there's some potential lumpiness in churn at times. But I think if you look at the trend line on that, it's been the line of best fit is clearly downward there. And so we've had a good year. And as we said, we expect our full-year churn to be toward the bottom end of the range that we talked about, %2 to %2.5. And I think the big driver of that is really mix of business. We're getting the right time deployments, right kinds of customers, right kind of use cases. And I think that's a lot of credit to our sales and marketing team in terms of what they're doing from a targeting perspective, and to our commercial teams in terms of how we're really sort of focusing the business. I do think it's durable and I think that's going to be a -- continue to be a key driver in the business going forward. Ari Klein : Thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Thanks. Wanted touch base on some of the inflationary pressures that have been affecting folks. First, just maybe you could talk about the impact, if any, rising power costs may have had in the quarter on your full-year guide. And maybe elaborate if you could, your hedging protocol by region. Charles Meyers : Sure. I'll start and then Keith can jump in if he wants to add anything, but I'd say this, other than some small 1-time items on the power side that had a slight impact on our Q4 guide, we're seeing power cuts pretty much come in where we expected for the remainder of the year and into early next year, I think there's more going to be the longer-term volatility into 2022 that we're really looking at. But as you said, similar to currency we've got a pretty extensive hedging program that really feathers in our hedges over a multiyear period. And we're about 85% hedged in the unregulated markets which represent most of our largest markets. And so our contracts do allow for us to adjust pricing based on underlying costs. And we're actively working to implement adjustments where we think that's appropriate. But, again, you guys, I think recognize our businesses is different in they were more heavily circuit based on our power mix. So whereas it's a little more seamless and pass through those costs in immediate power environment, takes a little more finesse to do that in the circa base power environment. But I would say that we act -- as I've said, we're actively working that in terms of how to do it. And I'd say that our experience in Europe with the cross-connect pricing increases over the last couple of years, really give us some confidence that we'll be able to go get that done effectively. So no doubt there's more volatility in the energy markets. So we're watching those closely, and we're going to continue to adapt our strategies accordingly. Jordan Sadler : And just I guess as a follow-up, just one, what would the presenting the portfolio is sort of circuit billing oriented. And then when you factor in some of the ability to pass some of this through, what's sort of the benefit that you may be layered in there in terms of top-line? Charles Meyers : About 80% of the -- about 80% of the portfolio is circuit based. And again, that's been a key to our -- that's part of our overall return story. We've been very effective in terms of driving sort of aggregate returns across space and power because of that circuit based power component of the business, and so in terms of its really more a matter of how effective can we be in terms of passing through price increases, underlying costs increase increases in the form of price to the circuit based power environment. So again, we have the contractual ability to do that, and it's just a matter of whether we -- I do think it won't be like circuit power we're going to where we are going to get every bit of that path. So but I think that we'll look at that market-by-market and assess what the rate approaches. Jordan Sadler : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jon Atkin : Thanks. I was interested in xScale, and if you can maybe highlight any major differences with PGI and compared to GIC. And then more broadly as we sort of think about 2022 growth drivers for revenue -- revenue's margins CapEx, as well as AFFO, perhaps coming from xScale. But anything to keep in mind -- I know you're not going to give guidance on this call, but from a qualitative perspective, tailwinds and headwinds to keep in mind for next year. Thanks. Keith Taylor : Why don't I take the first one? And then, I think, Charles might take the second one. As it relates to -- the deal structuring between PGIM and GIC is very similar. In many ways the construct was developed off of contracting structure with the GIC while we work ed with PGIM. Again, delighted to have another partner in a different market in support of our Australian business. As it relates to our ability -- to the performance this quarter, again, as you've heard from some of our prior calls we basically sold out most of the capacity that we've delivered to market. And so we're very eager to continue our builds. We have eight builds currently underway in xScale, and the team is working very hard to identify customer appropriate customers for that capacity plus more. So I'll just leave you with is an exciting time for us in the xScale space. We're putting the money, the work, and as Charles alluded to in his prepared remarks and was $7.5 billion of capital is going to be deployed across 34 assets. And it's -- we still have more to talk about. So why don't I leave it there and just recognize that xScale in of itself right now is not a big component of our revenues or AFFO. But it does create some lumpiness that you've seen in the non-recurring line, which we highlighted in our prepared remarks Q4, we just don't expect as much of that non-recurring revenue as we've seen before. But certainly as we look into '22 and beyond, those start to see that step-up again from a non-recurring perspective. Then you also see more of the recurring piece come into play for xScale. Charles Meyers : Jon, on the other ones, I say want. Look, I haven't been -- I'm an optimist because I have never been, I guess on the business, how it's performing, what the magnitude of the opportunity ahead is. A little bit of noise in the quarter here, but I think that we had a -- we continue -- the business continues to perform. The fundamentals are very strong. 8,000 [Indiscernible] been added to add in the quarter, 3,000 billable cab ads, record bookings really for the past 3 quarters, at least seasonally adjusted in terms of this is our best Q3 ever. This quarter great degree predictability turn, as I said, at the low-end firm pricing, we added another quarter of positive pricing adjustments that Keith talked about in the script and continue to see good momentum on our new markets. And if you look at big markets that we're relatively earlier entering in in terms of -- think places like Mexico and now India. Huge opportunities in front of us there to over-indexing growth in those markets. And then digital services is really -- Our customers are responding really well to those products even though they're at an earlier stage growth. So I think as I look into 2022 in terms of headwinds, tailwinds, etc, feel really good about the bookings momentum, feel really good about the pricing in our relevance to customers and therefore our ability to support firm price points. A churn looks good, good deal mix is going to continue to be absolutely key to maintaining that. As I said, I think the headwinds more on making sure that we continue to -- we talked a little bit about power as a potential headwind there in some areas. We talked about, I think continuing to drive operational efficiencies in the business is going to be a key focus for us to drive operating leverage. And then continuing to work backlog. I think we've got a big backlog partially because we've got some big deals that have gone into that. We got to continue to work through that backlog, certain deal types, tab slightly longer book-to-bill. And I think we're seeing that as part of the complexity of implementing these more multi-vendor, hybrid multi-cloud kind of deals. And so we're continuing to sort of hone our capabilities there. So if we can continue to drive those things, I think we will be able to really take advantage of the bookings momentum that's there. And obviously, we'll give you a color on all of that as we go into the 2022 guide. Jon Atkin : And then if I could throw 1 in on M&A, whether it's networking-related or software consolidation within the bare metal space, but anything kind of non-core to the classic data center business from an M&A tuck-in perspective, what --to what degree do you regularly look at those sorts of opportunities? And is there anything that you feel would sort of augment the platform from that perspective? Charles Meyers : Yeah. A great question, Jon. I would say that we're continuing to learn in that area and we're accelerating our kind of investment of energy in the -- understanding that landscape. And at the same time we are -- we're still digesting and learning some of the business around digital services and how to adapt our approach and build capabilities both from -- evolved capabilities, both from a design and development perspective, as well as from a deployment and go-to-market perspective. And so we're continuing to honor our -- cut our teeth there and really learn those things in that market. But I do think there are real opportunities there. And so we'll be continue to be active in that area in terms of looking at potential opportunities, both to add talent and technology and capabilities, and really learning that landscape better over the course of this year and next year and beyond. Jon Atkin : Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan, please go ahead. Richard Choe : Hi, this is Richard for Phil. Just wanted to ask about the strength in the America. It went from kind of a modest growth to now it seems like a very strong growth environment. What are you seeing there, and how long can the bookings continue? Charles Meyers : Hey, Richard, but I hope that party continues for a while. I would tell you I think we feel pretty good about that business. Again, we certainly have -- we spend more quarters than I would like talking about when the Verizon term was going to abate. And so I'm loving talking about the other side of that now. We're really the scale of that business, tremendous sales execution in the region, both for bookings into the region as well as global bookings to the platform elsewhere. I would say we feel really good about the performance of the America's region right now and expect that growth rate is going to continue to persist at elevated levels. And then so we feel good about that fact. I think driving attach rates now to continue to increase the share of wallet with our very, very large customer base and bringing them some of our new services is some of the new area of focus and really leveraging our channel partners to do that. So anything to add Keith Keith Taylor : The other thing I would just say, Charles and Richard, remember this region's 75% utilized, so we have substantial amount of capacity that we have built and we continue to build in core markets. And the other thing I'd just -- as Charles alluded to, normally the focus that we have on the right customers, that our sales leadership team in the Americas and beyond are doing such a great job of selling the platform. And so the opportunity that we said -- that we talked about inter-region and intra -region is very real. So overall very optimistic about what we're seeing in the Americas region. Richard Choe : And a quick follow-up turning, you see an issue in the Americas, are you seeing that lower now or has that not changed as much. Charles Meyers : Well, I mean, I think it was -- I guess you'd have to obviously, you've been in the story for a long time, Richard has been, but I think there was a period of time when we had elevated churn associated with really honing our customer mix and our core competitive advantages and making sure that we were focused on those that would say that was back in the early days I was here in the 2011-12 time frame, when we really set about honing our sales process and driving greater deal commercial scrutiny, etc. And I think that -- so we had a little bit of elevated turn as we work through that process. And then we had a little bit during the period of time when we digested some of the Verizon assets. We talked about the fact that we're a few -- several quarters ago, where we had deals that candidly just we're outside of the traditional sweet spot that we would be focused on. And I think it's the right long-term value creating decision for us to let those kind of things go and use that space and net capacity for advancing the strategy that we're really focused on. And so now, you're seeing that, and as I've always said, the most -- the best -- the best way to avoid losing a deal is to get the right deal in the door to begin with, and so that's what our focus is. I think our sales teams are really doing an exceptional job on that. Our new sales leader [Indiscernible] in the U.S. is just a dynamite sales leader doing an incredible job, and he's got a great leadership team across the board there. And so I got to give some credit [Indiscernible] to our [Indiscernible] in America. It's just a great team really driving that thing. Richard Choe : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Guarino from Green Street. Please go ahead. David Guarino : Thanks. Hey, Charles. Can you elaborate on your comments about pricing being firm? What exactly does firm mean and maybe specifically, if that's renewals or new leases? And then also, maybe just helpful would be if you could put some data behind it on the MRR per cabinet in the U.S. Could you tell us what that was, excluding the large footprint deployments this quarter? Charles Meyers : Sure. I mean, when we say firm pricing, one of the big things we've talked about it is when we had net positive pricing actions in the quarter. So we essentially take what we're getting in terms of uplifts on our pricing accelerators if you will increase -- price increases that are contractually built in. We offset that against any potential downward movement that might occur on a release. Our business tends to move it a little bit of a saucy within that. It's -- we'll see these price escalators over kind of 3 to 5-year contract. We'll get a renewal that might have some summary rates. And then, we will kind of go through that cycle again. But in any given quarter, we're seeing those positive pricing -- overall positive pricing adjustments. And that's just, I think, a reflection of our ability to sustain those higher price points. As you can see in the Americas, actually in all of the world, we've been sort of moving MRR per cab up into the right for a long period of time. We've seen some really strong moving in EMEA over the last couple of years because of the interconnection price increasing. I think we were slightly down in the U.S. on a constant currency basis, but that often and depend on the timing of installs and those kind of things, and so -- I mean, 23.93 per cab is just an exceptional number. And so I think if you look at that relative to the rest of the industry, I think you would find it to be sort of far, far away, but the best kind of yield in the industry itself. And so in terms of normalizing that for large footprint, we really aren't doing any really large footprint in the U.S. We occasionally will do an anchor deal in a facility, but we're not really active in the hyperscale or xScale space in the U.S. And we've talked about why that is in the past. And if you look at -- even in the other markets, we're doing that now almost strictly through the xScale business and through the joint venture. And so, that's not rolling in to the results that you see here, that really only rolls into our core financials in the form of fees and other things that we think are quite creative to the overall financial picture. So that's kind of picture on pricing. Pricing, I think on xScale continues to be competitive certainly, which is why returns in that business are a little lower but that's also why we decided to go do this through joint ventures where 80% of that capital is through a financial partner. David Guarino : Okay. And then maybe just one clarification too on the stabilized revenue growth at the low-end factory of 5% range and I know Keith said it's going to step up again next quarter, but would the drag this quarter just due to a timing of commencement on leases? Keith Taylor : Could you repeat that? Is a drag, the timing of what? David Guarino : Of commencements on leases was it just certain leases got push into next quarter? I guess if we're going to get to the high-end of the guidance rates. I would assume you have a pretty big step-up in near revenue growth. So I was wondering if there was something driving it or just a lease has got pushed into Q4 in terms of when you will start realizing revenue? Keith Taylor : Well, first and foremost, as Charles alluded to in the end, we will -- just an outstanding quarter again from a bookings perspective. And more particularly in the Americas region. And as we just sort of talked about, the Americas enjoy the highest pricing environment. So there's a number of things that are going on. Part of it is sure timing, but it is also the conversion of our backlog into a billable cabinet that will make a big difference here. And so, there's nothing that I would say overly extraordinary other than we're just seeing overall momentum of the business continues to scale. Churn starting as abated or is abating, and then you've got a good price point with your inventory. This way we could be booked, sorry, netbook. Go from backlog into a billing item. David Guarino : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great, good evening. thanks a lot. just coming back to the inflation and supply chain commentary. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the construction and the development side of things, availability of labor, raw materials? What's going on in the various markets around the world at both in terms of costs and your ability to pass that along as well as any impacts on timelines for development, and then you've been very active on the xScale, but in terms of other M&A, how are you thinking about the landscape out there or is this going to be more focused on sort of small tuck-ins from here, Thank you. Charles Meyers : Sure. So I'd start by saying that generally, I think our team has done a just an exceptional job navigating the current realities as it relates to supply chain around the world that our bottom-line message has been and continues to be that we really aren't seeing any meaningful negative impacts to our business. But that doesn't just magically happen. It happens by our team doing really great work to go and make sure that we are mitigating the risks that are out there. The way I -- Chuck, we talked about it internally is really 4 kind of levels to the supply chain potential risks. The first one is really facility level or in other words, are there -- are those constraints out there impacting our ability to deliver projects on time and on budget? And while we've seen some modest level of delays on a few projects, those are typically actually more associated with COVID delays and they are supply-chain candidly. As Keith noted in his script, we've actually taken on some inventory or contractual forward commits to the tune of about a $100 million, that is giving us the confidence to be able to make sure that we can deliver our projects on time. That combined with the fact that we've got a huge number of projects underway. And they are all over the world and we can move separate around. Typically, it's fundable between sort of projects. And so the team, the construction team, the procurement team, the sourcing team have just done a phenomenal job in terms of mitigating that, in terms of IBX availability and the delivery timelines. The next level on -- is really at the services level. In other words, our underlying services check there. Our network-related services like Fabric, Connect, etc. and Metal are we -- do we have the capacity to support the forecast there? And what we've done there is we've just forward purchased several quarters of capacity to give us the confidence that we can support that. And so feeling good about that as well. The third level is really deployment level. In other words, cage materials and other things that are needed as people build out their cages. We've also stockpiled there. Occasionally, there are circumstances where people have non-standard items that caused delays. But if they're sticking within the middle of the bell curve in terms of what their needs are, we're not seeing delays there. And then customer level delays is sort of the last level, which is our customers delayed in terms of getting their IT equipment to loan into deployments. And if not, are they delaying or asking for delays for commencement and those kind of things? And again, while we've seen a few of those things, they just -- in the grand seal -- scope of things and in the scale of our business are just not particularly meaningful. So there's some, there's probably a little bit of pressure on costs in some areas. We've been able to take advantage of our scale and I think to mitigate that, we're continuing to -- people often asked the question as to whether cost to build as inflationary or not, I would tell you that I think we've been able to keep up with it from a design standpoint and continuing to optimize our designs faster than costs are going up, so we're trying to keep ahead of the game there, but I think our team has done a really terrific job of managing those things. And I do think that we're -- we expect that things will start to stabilize over the course of 2022 from a supply chain perspective. So long answer there, but hopefully that gives you some perspective. Simon Flannery : Great color. And the M&A? Charles Meyers : I'm sorry, from an M&A perspective, I would say we are -- we continue to think there's opportunity out there, I mean, we talked -- I think John asked question about M&A in the -- in sort of the digital services side on the business. But there's also, we think continued opportunity in terms of extending our reach and looking for critical assets in the market that might be accretive to our strategy. And so, and we've got the balance sheet, the firepower to go after those kinds of things. And so we will continue to be active as appropriate. They're always with a high degree of certainty on getting the right deals. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good afternoon. Curious for 2 questions. The first one is when you look at what's happening on the network side for network customers, are you seeing an increasing amount of telecom and wireless companies place their core network infrastructure in your facilities, rather than having their own mobile switching offices that it might have had it in the more legacy years of the telecom landscape? And what kind of opportunity that is for you as you -- if you look at wireless and 5G trying to take more services to the edge? And then, the second question is, what do you make of the tower companies investing in datacenter assets? And do you believe that your datacenter business, as well as power portfolios are destined to be partners, or maybe someday fall under the same ownership structure as you look out into the future. Charles Meyers : Great questions by for sure, I would say on the network side, I'd say it's a mixed bag. I think that there is a movement towards people viewing third-party facilities, particularly facilities like Equinix, where there's large degrees of aggregation as logical places to put portions of their core infrastructure. That said, I think these companies are also have a long history of building on in their own facilities and I think that is -- and there are still a lot of forces within those companies that want that to continue. And so I think we've been very active on the business development front and we have seen some success there. And in terms of how they think about putting certain portions of their core 5G infrastructure, for example, into our facilities. And we have the Dallas approved concept center there that we've been actively working with both equipment providers as well as service providers on sort of proving out some of those potential value propositions. So I think we're still -- that will happen over a lot of long core stem. I do think we're more successful with people who are coming into those markets as disruptors because they think differently about it. And so -- and I do think there are some pretty interesting opportunities there. And we're working with a few -- I wanted -- I want to say the names right now, but I'm not sure that they are public, yeah that I can't, so I won't. But there are some interesting things going on there. As to the tower side, we've been -- we believe there is some synergy between sort of companies that have broad-based real estate assets that are proximate to communications infrastructure, which is sort of the definition of tower companies, and I can see why and understand why they may have an interest in data center assets and how they fit in potentially to their portfolio. But I would tell you that for the most part, we see a strong demand for traffic at the edge there too. A very significant majority of that traffic could go back to the aggregated edge. And that's really our sweet spot. That's where our differentiation is. Definitely there are use cases that were mobile edge compute, out further. Things like shop for automation and those kind of things. I think they are real use cases that 5G is going to be able to accelerate and we're certainly keeping our eyes on that and the active there from a business development standpoint. But I do think that -- I think it's more likely that we would partner in some way with those folks over time. It's not necessarily obvious to me that those have to live under the same ownership structure. But I think we will just have to continue to see how the markets play out. Keith, I don't know if you have a different view on that? Keith Taylor : [Indiscernible] Well said. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Erik Rasmussen from Stifel. Please go ahead. Erik Rasmussen : Thanks for the questions. So getting back to xScale, you've obviously made a lot of progress in Europe and APAC thus far. And recently announcing another JV partner in Australia. But I guess circling back at what point the Americas become more interesting. As you look to expand the xScale, are you seeing any characteristics that are starting to get more exciting about this market than what you're seeing elsewhere or recent in the same scenario? Charles Meyers : Well, I think that when people start cutting each others throats on pricing. It will be real hard. It's not -- I mean, it's still a very competitive market, I think. And so I think that's different in terms of if you look at the broad Americas because I think there is opportunities in last and for us. Obviously, we already announced projects in Brazil I think we bring certain different, some very distinctive advantages there. I do think there is a ton of demand and as we've always said, we're not, we're not going to say we're religiously out of the business of doing that, but I think it would have to be under a special set of circumstances in terms of why we think that fits with the strategy. Because we're -- a strategy as you'll recall, is that we wanted to use those as opportunities to further our position in the cloud ecosystem, continue to invest in the relationship with the major cloud service providers, and broader set of hyperscalers and use that to create this advantage overall position in cloud ecosystem. We feel very good about our position, particularly in the U.S., and whether or not the xScale would be particularly accretive to that, I think is an open question. But we're not -- we're definitely not -- it's not out of the question that we would do that. I just think it's -- I think right now there are a lot of opportunities for us in other markets that we think are more attractive. Erik Rasmussen : Okay. and maybe just my follow-up, the Americas was strong once again, this quarter, would you characterize that most of the strength is coming maybe from Bell Canada or is it other factors that you can comment on as it relates to the strength in that region. Keith Taylor : Well, there was a reference in the prepared remarks just to talk about Canadian business is better than our -- it's doing better than we originally anticipating. Good on the team, and they're also selling global platform out of Canada into our other assets around the world. As it specifically relates to the Americas business, I think it's very good back to some of the fundamentals that Charles alluded to. We're targeting the right customers with the right applications and putting in the right places. And at the same, by the same token, we've got an inventory set that they really caters to a diverse set of customers across, across the U.S. or the Americas as a whole. And so between the assets we serve, the customers we target, and the delivery of services that are additive to co-location interconnection, I just think we're in a much better space. Our position and as a result, we are going to win more than our fair share of the businesses out there. Erik Rasmussen : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Colby Synesael from Cowen. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael : Charles, in response to Jon Atkin 's question regarding your outlook on 2022, my take from your response was the top-line next sign that you're concerned is around margins, whether it's operational efficiencies or in particular power costs. And as it relates to the question around power costs, I feel you may have created more questions than answers so far in this call. And I'd love to get a little bit more detail. Specifically, you guys, I think had talked about your Analyst Day in June, seeing margins go up just modestly in 2022. I'm curious if you still think that that's possible. Secondly, you mentioned that you hedge an unregulated markets around 85%. How far out are those hedges? Does it seems like you're suggesting that you're okay with power costs going into 2022, but not necessarily for the full year. And then as it relates to the potential impact of power, do you think at the end of the day this could be up 25 basis point impact, 50 basis point impact, hundreds of basis point impact, just anything that gives us a better sense because my concern personally, is that we could now be in a situation where margins go down in 2022. And then just lastly, as it relates to AFFO, it looks like AFFO guidance implies a pretty meaningful step-down in the fourth quarter. Is that just the maintenance CapEx components that you talked about, Keith? Or is there something else there? And what's the better jump off point as we look to go to in 2022? Is it the third quarter? Or is it the fourth-quarter? Thank you. Charles Meyers : Good questions Colby. We will be able to give you all the answers there, but I would say and obviously we're not going to kind of give you a 2022 guys. But I would say that you're -- generally I would say we continue to feel good about the momentum in the business from a bookings and demand perspective, I think that we did talk about driving efficiencies and I think the pursuit of the 50% margin target is something we continue to be focused on and that's an area where we continue to have worked -- knew exactly at what pace we can do that, and what that implies for the 2022 margin. I don't know. And I do think it will require us to dig in deeper on power. And I don't think we're yet in a position where we can quantify any of that for you other than -- in terms of the hedging that we -- I mean, they are multiyear hedges, but they're feathered in. And so obviously do become less impactful as you look further out. And so I do think that there's more risk as you go out, but I think the good part of that is that it gives us time to determine what our approach is going to be to passing those costs through and assessing how to do that and to what degree. That is how much of a recovery we can see there, and we don't know the answers to all those things, and so I think we're going to track those, we're going to look at the markets where there's volatility. And I think that's something where unfortunately I think we'll just have to come back to you when we look into -- as we look into 2022 guide, and give you more perspective about that. Keith Taylor : And so Colby I just wanted to go back to again a couple of other questions. So there's 2 things that I felt I heard you ask.1. is what's happening quarter-over-quarter. What's going on in Q4? And there was a reference that we made and that we accelerated some costs into this year, so that's number one both from our recurring CapEx perspective and some operating spend. And we did that for a number of reasons, and part of it is supply chain specific. The other part is we alluded to in the prepared remarks. When you look at AFFO in and of itself, Q4 is historically one of our lower performing AFFO quarters. That's why we don't guide on a quarterly basis, we gave you the annual number and say, this is what we will do, and we recognize things will move around, but the reality is Q4 always tends to be a higher recurring CapEx quarter, and that's what you're seeing in the guide that we've delivered at a $193 million at midpoint. So it gives you a real sense. It's a big step-up in our recurring CapEx for Q4. The other thing is, as we have said, that we have had a lot of success in the business and as a result, the cash payout attributed to commissions that is more substantial than we originally anticipated in Q4, and that's reflected in the guidance. And that's AFFO impacting on EBITDA impacting it, so there's a lot of nuances. But overall, when you look at the fundamental business, it's performed better than we anticipated. For every single quarter of the year, we're delivering against the expectations we have set. And as you -- I think, you know well that we based our guide both on revenue EBITDA and AFFO throughout the year. And we're at a point now where we feel comfortable and now we're focusing on 2022. And that's where the energy of the business is again focused on. Colby Synesael : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from Frank Loutsan from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Louthan : About the [Indiscernible]America has been a tougher market last year. What sort of changed there, and how long do you think you can continue to see some better results out of those markets? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Hey, Frank. Yes, as I said earlier, I think that business has a strong trajectory. I think we expect that to continue, we don't see this as a temporary improvement. I think we're as a business, moving in a very solid direction. Strong demand from customers, good sales execution, and again we don't expect that -- and again, churn mitigating, getting the right customers right deals. I think that will continue to drive strong performance from that region. Which, obviously, is a pretty major driver of our overall performance. Frank Louthan : Given, it can -- we expect this to be a little bit of a new baseline and kind of continue to grow from here, or how should we think about the current trend. Charles Meyers : Yeah, I think as to whether it really accelerates, I think we have to continue to look at our success in driving new services revenues and what the rate of new customer capture and attaches and those kind of things. But again, I think we feel really good about where the business is right now and feel like that's a sustainable growth rate for us. Frank Louthan : Right. Great. Thank you very much. Katrina Rymill : That concludes our Q3 call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect your line and enjoy the rest of your day.",

Also today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Katrina Rymill, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance and Sustainability. You may begin. Katrina Rymill : Good afternoon, and welcome to today's conference call. Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that some of the statements we're making today are forward-looking in nature and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those statements and may be affected by the risks we identified in today's press release and those identified in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 19, 2021, and 10-Q filed on November 4, 2021. Equinix assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or comment on forward-looking statements made on this call. In addition, in light of regulation for our disclosure, is Equinix's policy not to comment on the financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. In addition, we will provide non-GAAP measures on today's conference call. We provide a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a list of the reasons why the company uses these measures in today's press release on the Equinix IR page at www.equinix.com. We have made available on the IR page of our website a presentation designed to accompany this discussion, along with certain supplemental financial information and other data. We would also like to remind you that we post important information on Equinix in the IR page from time to time and encourage you to check our website regularly for the most current available information. With us today are Charles Meyers, Equinix' CEO and President; and Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up in an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any following questions to just one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Katrina. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. We had a great finish to the year with our best booking performance ever driven by an exceptional demand backdrop for our business with continued strength across our platform, but more specifically in the Americas low churn and continued momentum in our digital services portfolio. For the full-year, we achieved over $6.6 billion of revenue, marking our 76 consecutive quarter top line increases and amazing 19 years of continuous revenue growth while driving attractive AFFO per share to the bottom line. Amidst the dynamic and complex global landscape, we continue to deliver against our vision and our fiscal year results demonstrate both the increasing relevance of our platform and our uniquely differentiated value proposition. Businesses globally continue to prioritize digital transformation as a foundational source of competitive advantage and the secular drivers for our business have never been stronger, as digital leaders demand infrastructure that is more distributed, more ecosystem powered, more flexible, more sustainable and more interconnected than ever before. Increasingly, Equinix represents a critical point of Nexus customers implement hybrid and multi cloud as a clear architecture of choice. And as a global market leader, we continue to innovate and expand our portfolio to respond to these evolving customer demands, and capture the enormous opportunity ahead. As we look to 2022, the trajectory and underlying momentum in our business is exceptionally strong, with a solid demand pipeline, stable churn and a rising price trend, resulting in a revenue outlook for the year that is at or above the high end of our long-term guidance range. And an AFFO per share outlook is still within our long-term guidance range, despite pressure at the gross margin line associated with power price volatility in Singapore. Absent these specific dynamics our underlying business performance will be producing AFFO per share growth towards the high-end of our Analyst Day guidance well ahead of our expectations. We have a robust global power hedging program [indiscernible] and we expect will continue to be highly effective in smoothing utility price volatility over the years, providing predictability and value across markets for Equinix and our customers. We believe the current dislocation in Singapore is transitory with higher prices showing signs of moderating in the second half of the year. Bottom line, the business is performing very well. And we remain on track to meeting or exceeding our Analyst Day objectives for both top line revenue and AFFO per share growth and as we see the temporary headwinds moderate, and continue to realize efficiency gains from prior-year investments, we have a strong resolve and continued confidence in our ability to scale adjusted EBITDA margins to 50% by 2025. Turning to our results as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for the full-year were $6.6 billion up 8% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA was also up 8% year-over-year, and AFFO per share grew 9% year-over-year. Interconnection revenues for the current quarter grew 12% year-over-year with solid unit ads reflecting strong momentum with Equinix Fabric as expanding use cases drive connections to more locations and more counterparties. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our global reach remains as important as ever. IDC predicts that by 2025, more than 50% of enterprise data will be generated at the edge, and customers continue to see Equinix as the best manifestation of the digital edge. This competitive differentiation continues to drive our business, with revenues from multi-region customers increasing 1% quarter-over-quarter to an impressive 75%. In December, we announced our long awaited entry into Africa with our intended acquisition of MainOne, a leading West African data center and connectivity solutions provider with a presence in Nigeria, Ghana and the Ivory Coast, set to close in early Q2. , : Jon has delivered extraordinary results as the President of our Americas business and is a great choice to implement our strategy and extend our global market leadership and interconnected colocation. To that end, we continue to expand on our global footprint with 41 major projects underway across 28 metros in 19 countries, representing over 20,000 cabinets of retail, and over 80 megawatts of xScale capacity. We remain focused on simplifying, automating and digitizing our services, allowing us to scale our business and enhance operating leverage. And we're already seeing the results of these efforts. For example, we recently launched our new Secure Cab Express product, leveraging pre-deployed capacity to dramatically reduce cycle times and enable online quoting and ordering for our most commonly requested configurations. We expect to roll this new service out to customers in the coming quarters, driving increased customer responsiveness while simultaneously enhancing margins. Our global interconnection franchise continues to perform well and we now have over 419,000 interconnections on our industry leading platform. In Q4, we added an incremental 7,500 organic interconnections as enterprises drive growth and further enhance our ecosystem density. Internet exchange saw peak traffic of 6% quarter-over-quarter and 27% year-over-year, with peak traffic in APAC surpassing 10 terabits per second, for the first time as service providers increasingly look to IX to improve Internet traffic delivery. Turning to digital infrastructure services, cloud computing has permanently reshaped customer expectations for speed and simplicity. Customers want to deploy infrastructure where they want it, when they want it seamlessly integrating cloud based workloads and private infrastructure and enabling agility and performance between the two. As a result, customers are embracing a broader set of our services, combining fabric, metal and network edge to build virtual points of presence. And our plan expansions will fully enable this capability across 30 markets by the end of 2022. For the quarter, Equinix Fabric saw excellent growth eclipsing $150 million in revenue run rate with a third of our customers now using Fabric for a variety of use cases across a broad set of destinations. Our Equinix Metal business delivered strong results with a great mix of wins and new logos across verticals at a healthy backlog. And network edge saw continued traction with growth from new and existing customers, as they use the service to implement WAN optimization and cloud-to-cloud routing. Shifting to xScale, in January we announced plans to expand xScale into South Korea with an agreement to establish a $525 million joint venture with GIC to develop two data centers installed. Total investment in our various hyperscale joint ventures when closed and fully built out is now expected to be more than $8 billion across 36 facilities globally, with more than 720 megawatts of power capacity. We currently have nine xScale bills under development and during the quarter, we fully leased the first phase of our Frankfurt 11 asset and the first and second phases of our Sao Paulo 5 assets representing approximately 20 megawatts of capacity. So xScale leasing is now over 130 megawatts and our initial JV at EMEA is over 80% leased. Now let me cover some of the highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical had solid bookings quarter with healthy new logo activity led by the Americas as companies expand and optimize digital capabilities to support the delivery and consumption of data at the edge. New wins and expansions included a Fortune 200 telecom company deploying infrastructure to support the U.S. first cloud native Open RAN-based 5G network. Inligo Networks, an Australian cable systems operator deploying digital infrastructure to support a new subsea cable across Southeast Asia, Australia and the U.S. and an African local telco, deploying a network hub in Lisbon to improve pairing and performance. Our enterprise virtual saw another quarter of record bookings, as IDC predicts almost half of the global economy will be based on or influenced by digital in 2022, fueling strong demand for hybrid infrastructure. Q4 had particular strength in FinTech, industrial services and energy sub segments with wins and expansions, including NASDAQ, a Fortune 500 technology company, scaling its cloud enabled infrastructure to deliver ultra low latency Edge compute capabilities from our NY11 data center in Carteret. Avaya, cloud communications and workstream collaboration company implementing an Edge data center strategy on platform Equinix to streamline private connectivity for its customers and ADT, U.S. leading smart home security provider embracing the cloud with an infrastructure modernization effort spanning multiple geographies. Our cloud and IT services vertical offset solid bookings this quarter led by the software and infrastructure sub segments, with good momentum in EMEA and APAC. The expansions included Zscaler, a leading Global 2000 Security cloud provider, upgrading capacity for sustainable enterprise cloud transformation, and growing network traffic at the Edge. Wiz Technologies, a Singaporean full-suite IT service provider, deploying on Equinix Metal and upgrading Fabric services to support quick and seamless business expansion. And Oracle, a top five global software provider deploying FastConnect Cloud on-ramps to support new regions in Singapore, Milan and Stockholm, bringing their total number of on-ramps available at Equinix to 24 more than any of their other partners. Our content digital media vertical has strong wins led by the publishing and digital media sub segments and record channel activity. Expansions included Cloudflare, the U.S. based global web infrastructure and security company upgrading and expanding their footprint in over 40 markets. Index Exchange, global ad tech marketplace, expanding compute nodes in APAC demanded traffic growth, and a top three global credit agency deploying regional network in cloud hubs in APAC to support its operations. Our channel program delivered a record quarter to close the year accounting for 40% of bookings and nearly 60% of new logos. And we have line of sight for channels to grow to 50% of our bookings in the coming years as we enhance our systems and processes, and leverage our diverse set of partners to scale our reach. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals, and use cases with continued strength from strategic partners like Microsoft, Dell, Cisco, Google and BT, including a significant win with Wipro and AT&T, helping a utility company modernize its IT infrastructure, Europe and the U.S. So now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. , : Jon has delivered extraordinary results as the President of our Americas business and is a great choice to implement our strategy and extend our global market leadership and interconnected colocation.

Keith Taylor : Thanks, Charles. Good afternoon to everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks by saying our business is performing extremely well. Frankly, better than our expectations for both the quarter and year. And we're bringing our momentum into 2022. We had a great end for the year delivering record gross and net bookings with very strong channel activity, while recording our highest ever recurring revenue step up in a quarter. For the year without any major acquisitions revenues were up over $600 million. [Indiscernible] over 17,500 deals in 2021, highlighting the tremendous scale and reach of our business, the philosophy of our go-to-market engine. The Americas region continues to pick up stream growing 10% over the prior year effective double the rate approval from last year benefiting from strong leadership and is distributed portfolio of highly interconnected IBX assets resulting in record bookings and lower churn. For the company, our churn settled at the lower end of our guidance range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter, or an average of 2.1% per quarter for the year. Our lowest level since 2016, which is highly reflective of our strategy to put the right customer with the right applications into the right IBX. Quite simply, the decisions we're making are stressing and extending our leadership position as the world's digital infrastructure company. Now, as previously discussed perhaps top of mind for you, there are a number of macro-economic factors that we continue to proactively manage, such as supply chain, power costs, interest rates, and inflation. As it relates to power costs, we're seeing approximately 130 basis points in your margin pressure, due to the temporarily inflated power rates in Singapore, and the lapping of the favorable vPPA settlements from Texas last February. For 2022, we're predominantly hedged to meet our global parties, but intends to continue to layer in additional hedges for the remaining '22 exposure, and to meet the demand for future periods as we navigate past is unusually volatile period. As Charles noted, we expect the market dislocation in Singapore to be transitory, largely given the current prices are significantly higher than any other markets that we operate in, and the spot market rates appear to be trending down, although they do remain volatile. As reflected in our guidance, we expect second half margin to improve over the first half and we remain on our path to deliver against our Analyst Day adjusted EBITDA and AFSL margin expectations. As it relates to the rising interest rate environment, our balance sheet is very well positioned. We have minimal near-term exposure to raise the interest rates with 95% of our debt fixed across a weighted average maturity period of over nine years. And despite the recent increase in interest rates, the cost of oil remains at historically low levels, while we enjoy returns substantially higher than our multiples of cost to borrow and whack. Our financial strength continues to feel significant. And our balance sheet, fueled by our strong cash generation capabilities has great flexibility. Lastly, with regards to supply chain and the inflationary pressures in the marketplace, we've invested heavily in a sophisticated and forward leaning procurement and strategic sourcing organization. Allowing us to execute against a robust development pipeline across our platform, but continuing to deliver against our return expectations. This is not to say there isn't congestion in the supply chain. But we feel very well placed with our partners and suppliers resulting in limited delays against our expectations. To highlight that point, in the fourth quarter alone, we added 17 new projects to our IBX and xScale build program across 14 separate markets, while we completed seven projects across six markets. Now let me cover the highlights for the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q4 revenues were 1.706 billion up 10% over the same quarter last year and above the top end of our guidance range due to strong business performance led by the Americas. Consistent with our expectation, non-recurring revenue stepped down to 6% of total revenues in the quarter due to tiny and large customer installations. Interconnection revenues were 19% of recurring revenues with strong growth across all three regions, reflecting the continued benefit of our global platform and diversified product portfolio. Q4 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $5 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance range. Global Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $788 million, or 46% of revenues, up 11% over the same quarter last year and above the top end of our guidance range due to strong operating performance and timing of spend. Q4 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges included a $3 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and $5 million of integration costs. Global Q4 AFFO was $564 million in line with our expectations, while absorbing the anticipated and seasonally higher recurring capex investments similar to prior years. Q4 globally MRR churn was 2% at the bottom end of our targeted 2% to 2.5% range. Turning to our regional highlights, Q4 results were covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC and the Americas were the fastest MRR growing regions on a year-over-year normalized basis at 11% and 10% respectively. Followed by the EMEA region which stepped back up to 9% year-over-year growth as expected. The Americas region had another outstanding quarter delivering record bookings with robust channel activity, strong net positive pricing action and lower churn. The Americas momentum is broad based with 24/27 metros increasing gross bookings year-over-year, led by out Boston Denver, Mexico City, Los Angeles and in Toronto market. The Former Bell Canada assets continue to perform better than expected, in part due to increasing carrier and cloud deployments in a key Canadian markets. Our EMEA region had a solid quarter with strong retail bookings, like our U.K., Dutch and German businesses. Interestingly, we're seeing growing customer interest in this region given our sustainability efforts, including the recently signed DPPA with a wind farm developer in Finland to cover over 30 megawatts of capacity. And finally, the Asia-Pacific region had a solid quarter with strong pricing a new local activity. We're experiencing good momentum in India with a GPX is performing well above planning. Although Singapore remains capacity constrained, we welcome the government's recent decision to lift the moratorium on new data center business. Going forward new construction will need to deliver strategic value and international connectivity for Singapore's digital economy, but also needs to be at the forefront of sustainability. We feel extremely well positioned to deliver against the government's criteria. Now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. At the year end with unrestricted cash of approximately $1.5 billion a step up from last quarter due to strong operating cash flow, and approximately $400 million in ATM funding offset by our investments and the dividend payment. In early January, we renegotiated our line of credit providing us access to $4 billion of additional liquidity, while also increasing our financial flexibility on revenue revised covenant package. Looking forward, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to funding our growth consistent with our investment grade rating, while staying focused on creating long-term value for our shareholders. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $817 million including a recurring capex of $86 million. Our meaningful increase over the prior quarter as expected. We opened seven major projects since our last call including new IX in Genoa, Munich and Perth and a new eight xScale asset in Osaka. We also purchased land for development in Dublin and Istanbul. Revenues from own assets represent 59% of our recurring revenues. Our capital investments deliver strong returns as shown in Slide 10. Our now 158 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. The top end of our growth range as expected due to strong Americas growth. These stabilized assets are collectively 86% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PPD invested. And please refer to Slides 11 through 16 for updated summary of 2022 guidance and bridges. Who knows all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. And our guidance does not include the anticipated results from the pending close. The main one acquisition or any potential future capital market activities. Starting with revenues, for 2022 we expect top-line growth of 9% to 10% above the top end of our long-term rate, reflecting the continued momentum in the business. MRR churn is expected to remain within our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter. We expect 2022 adjusted EBITDA margins of across the 46% excluding integration costs. The result of strong operating leverage and efficiency initiatives in the business temporarily muted by the higher utility expenses. We expect to incur $20 million of integration costs in 2022 for our various acquisitions. 2022 AFFO is expected to grow 8% to 10% compared to previous year. And AFFO per share is expected growth 7% to 8%. 2022 capex is expected to be approximately $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion, including approximately $100 million of on balance sheet xScale spend which we expect to be reimbursed as we transfer these assets into the JV. And about $160 million of recurring capex spend. And finally, we expect our 2022 cash dividends increased to slightly greater than $1.1 billion, 10% increase over the prior year, or an 8% increase on a per share basis. So I'll stop here. And let me turn the call back to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks Keith. In closing, we're immensely pleased with the underlying performance of our business and are as optimistic as ever about the opportunity in front of us. Although the transitory effects from power pricing impact elements of our 2022 guidance, our normalized results would indicate a business trajectory that puts us meaningfully ahead of our Analyst Day expectations. We continue to work hard to further mitigate the end year impacts of the Singapore car volatility. And in parallel, intend to continue to strengthen our market leading position as the world digital infrastructure company by scaling and transforming our data center business, while also accelerating our digital services business to deliver on the promise of physical infrastructure at software speed. And we intend to continue to advance a bold ESG agenda, addressing the urgency of climate change with a commitment to climate neutrality by 2030. And fostering a culture in workplace where every person every day can confidently say I'm safe, I belong and I matter.

We will continue to show up every day remaining in service to our stakeholders. To each other, to our customers, to our communities, and to you, our shareholders. And let me stop there and open it up for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from Jordan Sadler, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jordan Sadler : Thank you. And good afternoon, first I would like to just touch on maybe some of the macro factors that you identified Keith, in your prepared remarks, first, just maybe on the margin impact related to the power costs that you're seeing in Singapore, I think you said it was 130 basis points impact year-over-year, but what specifically was the impact that you're seeing within the 46% margin related to Singapore? And then separately, can you maybe discuss how you might be dealing with any other exposures for example, in Europe, and if you were able to push through price increases to customers there to offset some of the exposure you might have had? Charles Meyers : Sure, hey Jordan it's Charles. Let me step back and give you some additional color on the power pricing dynamics. And then keeping that in bolt-on that we can sort of tag discussion on the broader inflationary aspects of the business as well. There's aspects of the power dynamics that are quite complex, but the net of it all is pretty easy to summarize. So other than Singapore, which I'll talk about, we continue to be really wellheads around the world. And our bridges show, you'll see there the impact of really the 130 bps which I'll touch on here in a minute. Other than that, we're really seeing limited margin impact from that in markets with higher volatility, we've really been able to offset the increased rates through a combination of some targeted price increases, which as we've talked about in the past, we have the contractual ability to pass through and offset a part also by strong operating leverage in the business, which we're very pleased about how that's materializing. But Singapore is clearly an outlier. Last Fall, as we looked at the historical trends in that market and other factors, we, alongside our power advisors, decided that we were going to defer on locking in Singapore. And we were pressing one, given the rates where the rates were at that time, and two given an ongoing negotiation of trying to get to a multi-year sort of hedge or locked position. Then really the fundamentals of the Singapore power market just dislocated, really driving an unprecedented level of volatility. And so counterparties weren't really able to offer rate lock, exposed temporarily to the spot rates and leaves us a bit out of sync with what customers are experiencing in the market. So that's where that exposure through the course of the year is what we're estimating at about 100 bps, then there's an additional 30 bps that on a year-over-year compare basis an impact of favorable dynamics from our Texas VPPA last year, and so the combination of those factors account for about the 130 bps on margin. So again, absent that, you'd be talking about a margin guide that 47 and change. And I think in the broader context, would really reflect a tremendous health of the business. So, that's where we are on the margin issue. And across the Rest of Europe, yes, there's volatility. As I said, we've sort of managed that through increasing, targeted price increases, in some cases, those price increases, we're going to phase them over a couple of years, because we feel like they're just too big to roll through and one plug, but again the pressure that we -- any pressure that we are seeing from that is being offset by nice operating leverage in the business. Keith, maybe you can comment on broader inflationary sort of factors in Europe and elsewhere? Keith Taylor : Yes, Jordan, when it comes to the inflation aspect, I just said, we've really invested heavily over the last couple of years in as I said, procurement and strategic sourcing team and work getting ahead of many of the inflationary issues. In some cases, we've bought substantial inventory that we're hosting, at the supplier of the partners location, and then we draw down on that over time.  So by locking in that commitment, we've been able to mitigate some of the inflationary risks that others might be experiencing. But to mention that we've got the supply available, where in some cases, others will not have the supply available, I think we've got a real good job locking it in, we're working on an extended basis over many years, we look forward with what our buying commitments are going to be over that time period. And that's another aspect of again, our increased sophistication around what we're doing, when and where and what we need when and where, and so the team is doing a good job of sourcing the larger material items for that. I'm going to say though, the other area that is probably a little bit more difficult to just the human capital side. And that's one of the greatest risks that you see all across the world and just sourcing humans not only to do the construction, but all the manufacturing. And so getting ahead all of that just means that you have to commit earlier than you might otherwise have done before so that you can get yourself in the appropriate queue in the manufacturing cycles. All that to say is I think we are in really good spot, we have seen limited delays thus far. Certainly prices have gone up in times in different sets of circumstances that Charles sort of alluded to, on his prior comment that we're putting through appropriate price increases into the marketplace, and it would depend solely on the market, but we're putting appropriate price increases into the market accordingly. And one of the things you've heard us say and I maybe I didn't, just to repeat it. This quarter again, we had meaningful net price positive pricing action, and I can't even think of the last time we talked about flat to negative pricing increases, so as an organization our pricing increases are more than offsetting our price decreases which has served us very well in our operating plan. Jordan Sadler : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rollins. Your line is open. Charles Meyers : Mike, are you there? Operator : We may have lost, Michael. Charles Meyers : Let us go to the next person in the queue, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Barden, Bank of America. Your line is open. David Barden : Hey guys, thanks so much for taking the questions. Appreciate it. I guess two if I could. The first one maybe Charles, or Keith, you kind of highlighted some of the vertical strengths that we're seeing across different markets. I think what we're trying to get our arms around is, as we kind of come out post-pandemic and you've got this kind of global vision of where people who are still mired in COVID, are doing one thing, and maybe other economies are doing a new thing. Could you kind of elaborate a little bit on how we're watching the vertical demand evolve? What's going up? What's going down? And I guess the second question is now that we've got the Singapore Moratorium lifted, it did kind of put a spotlight on this progression towards kind of green power. Could you kind of comment on what, if any other geographies you see are kind of concerned about this issue. And obviously, you've been a leader on this, but I'd be interested to see what that leadership might be getting you from a demand standpoint? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Sure. David, I will take the first one, and then I think Keith, and maybe Kat can weigh in on the sustainability side as well, given she's so close to that, I will tell you that we're seeing just tremendous strength across the board really, in our verticals, essentially, because as I've looked at the last few scripts, it seems like every time we say we have strength somewhere else, so it's not like we're saying it. And as it relates to, and I think that's really driven by this, this really strong movement towards digital transformation, and people saying, hey, that is a critical source of competitive advantage, or at least keeping up. And they're making investments accordingly, and how they think about their infrastructure, how they think about their mix between cloud based workloads and private infrastructure, I think is really moving in ways that the wind is at our back. And I think the team has done a great job of articulating our relevance to those buyers. And, frankly, sales execution has been super strong. As it relates to COVID, I would tell you that we're not really it is, obviously, as you've seen, we are having ups and downs, and they're operationally challenging, so we are constantly dealing with sort of different mandates and mask mandates, and when we have to be doing sort of testing people, and when we're in the facilities, when we get an exposure dealing with that, et cetera. But the team has just done an amazing job on that. And I wouldn't say that I think we're seeing anywhere around the world that says, oh, they're kind of stuck in a pause mode due to COVID. People seem to be powering through that and saying, we got to move forward, regardless. And so I think we've seen really broad strength, Keith do you want to take the Singapore Moratorium and sustainability questions? Katrina Rymill : Yes, I'll kick that off. I'll tell you, David, we're very excited to see the moratorium lifted over in Singapore. That is actually one of our strongest markets. And it is a chance to highlight our focus on sustainability, you're seeing us really try to get in front of this, we're actually the first data center to announce a commitment to climate neutrality, which by 2030, we rolled out science based targets. Now underlying that is a very deep green program, whether it's enhancing our renewable energy coverage includes looking at areas like energy efficiency, which I am certain our investors are going to love as well, because there's returns around those projects, as well as just broadening our commitments and talking with customers. We've seen a huge uptick in customer outreach around this, we used to talk to about 50 customers a year, we're now up to a run rate of 1,000 customers reaching out asking for all sorts of data to help them really green their supply chain. So well, it certainly is getting a lot of focus around the world. And you believe it's an opportunity. And there's markets whether particularly the European markets are heavily focused on this. And you're seeing us react to certain areas, like in Germany, Germany is if you go to any of our new German sites, they all have green facades on front of them, as well as implementing new renewable energy coverage. So I think you'll see us continue to lean in heavily around this. Charles Meyers : Yes, one more comment, interestingly is a big deal for talent as well. Talent wants to be working for companies that they believe are committed to sustainability and are doing the right things and so and I think maybe that's unique or particularly true in the end. But we're seeing that across the board. David Barden : Awesome, all right, thank you guys. Really appreciate it. Charles Meyers : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Can you hear me now? Charles Meyers : We can. Michael Rollins : Great, well, thanks for taking the questions, two if I could, first going back to the organic constant currency revenue guidance, I'm curious if you can just unpack some of the relative strength to the annual target, how much might be coming from some of the pricing actions, versus the pickup in demand for services or if there's any other areas of strength that we should be mindful of? And then the second question is for number of quarters now, you've been discussing the evolution in the contribution to logos and bookings from the indirect channel. And as you've had more experience with that channel, I'm curious, once the customers come in through that channel, how do they look relative to the customers that you get from your direct sales force? Are they adding services expanding or their different characteristics of their revenue lifecycle versus in indirect versus direct? Charles Meyers : Thanks, Mike. So on the organic constant currency guide, I would say, it's a combination factors, obviously there is a, we did say we're in a rising sort of price environment, but that's not a major factor, there's actually not a ton of that also, that is associated with price increases on the power front, there's some in there, but that's not a major factor. We are seeing obviously, digital services outpaced the broader business, but it's a small portion, right, I mean the broader and traditional core business is so big, that that's really the driving force. And so I point mostly to just momentum in the core business, I think we just continue to win, geographic expansion is going well, our acquisition assets are outperforming without exception. GPX is doing great, Bell is doing great, [indiscernible] is doing great. When we're building on that geographic advantage, we're selling into the hybrid and multicloud opportunity. And again, both customer demand is strong, and sales execution has been excellent, so I think it's driven mostly by I think the core, but we really are, but we're also excited about the trajectory and the momentum that we see. And in digital services, and how that's going to allow us to really respond to the evolving needs of the customer. In terms of channel, I would not say off the top my head a channel, channel acquired customer is meaningfully different, they often come in with a very solution oriented mindset, because typically, we're working with a channel partner who's already selling to that customer, something that he's done better at Equinix. And so they it's, I would say that the mix of business through the channel is quite good. So it's really in that sweet spot. And but they don't, I don't think they look meaningfully different. They all, I think they grow at newly acquired customers, writ large, grow faster. But that's true of both channel as well as non-channel customers. So I don't think they differ dramatically. But those we're going to continue to really look at that, in fact, it's one of the priorities for the year ahead is continuing to refine our segmentation, and make sure that we're delivering the right services to the right segments through the right channels and I think increased sort of sophistication on that front is going to continue to pay dividends both on the revenue line and the margin line. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Colby Synesael, Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Michael on for Colby. Two questions, if I may. First we've seen key interconnect assets in Africa, namely Telco, get acquired by one of your peers. And there's also another large global data center company that's reportedly for sale, given you still have that incremental turn of leverage that you can deploy opportunistically and just wanted to get your latest thoughts on how you're thinking about M&A. And then also the second question you did 10% year-over-year, Americas growth in the fourth quarter, real acceleration there, just wondering what you would expect to see from that business in 2022? Thank you. Charles Meyers : On the M&A front, I guess what I say is, we continue to believe M&A is a very appropriate and powerful tool in the kit. We've been very successful at it, we're going to continue to look at it as an opportunity to extend our reach, scale our business in key markets and bring in critical interconnection assets. And so yes, we're actively involved in those processes, we're going to maintain a level of discipline on that, as we always do. And that means we're probably not going to win every deal. But it's really important, I think, particularly in markets with multiples that you could argue are overheated in the private markets to maintain that discipline. And in terms of the leverage, yes, we have that turn of leverage available that a lot of balance sheet flexibility, it's not burning a hole in our pockets. So we're happy to continue to have it and use it to drive the best returns in the business. And that's our capital allocation strategy is always to put it, where we think we can generate the best return. So, but I do expect M&A will be a piece of that puzzle, and I'm sure you'll hear more from us over the course of the year on that front. And as to the Americas, we don't guide on a regional basis. But what an incredible sort of momentum from that business over the last five or six quarters. And as we said, John Lin and team, your sales team and our ops team, and really the entire team just really strong execution, super excited to take John's immense capabilities and apply them more broadly across the business. But I think you're going to see, I do think that, this digital transformation demand is following sort of a typical pattern, really strong demand in America, and then emerging in other areas across the world. And we see that profile. And so but as you look at it this quarter is pretty interesting in the 10% in the America, 11% in APAC, 9% in Europe. Pretty darn strong across the board and nice rebound in Europe. And we're beginning to lap some of the -- some of the prior year increases that we saw there. And so, I think that -- I think we're really seeing strong across the board. But I do expect continued momentum in the Americas. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Del Deo, MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Nick Del Deo : Hi, thanks for taking my question, guys. Two for you. Maybe one for Charles and one for Keith. First, as alluded to a moment ago, we've seen a few deals happen in Africa recently, most notably you buying main one and digital buying Teraco? I'm sure you looked at all of them, maybe some of that didn't even trade? Why was main one the best asset for Equinix? And is there a path for catching up with Teraco in South Africa over time? And then for Keith, on recurring capex? It seems like it's going to be at the very low end of your target range in 2022. And it's been towards the lower end for a few years now. Should we expect, that to pick up in coming years? Or is this kind of a new normal for recurring capex? Charles Meyers : Del let me take Africa and then I'll hand it over to Keith on the recurring capex side. Look at -- we continue to believe Africa's very attractive long-term market it is definitely more it is one that's going to evolve over many years. And we're active in that market, as you know, and I wouldn't drawn any -- draw any specific comparisons between deals, because I think they provide different value. But we're -- I'll say we're very excited about main one. And we think it's a great sort of Cornerstone to build from. Teraco is a great asset. It's a great team and a good business. And we're going to continue -- and South Africa is an important market. And so that one didn't go our way. And we're going to -- we're going to find in what we're going to continue to be we're committed to competing that market is South Africa has to be a part of any thoughtful African strategy. And there's a variety of other paths for us in that market. And we're hard at work ethic. And then Keith will take the recurring cap return. Keith Taylor : And so it\u2019s another recurring capex. We are -- as we tend to we are the sort of lower end of the range for fiscal year '22. Quite a bit, just timing, Nick, and recognizing that you, depending on what we have coming into the portfolio, it's going to dictate so the timing of the capex. So that'd be one thing. And so there, you saw an elevated Q4 number of roughly 5%. Recurring capex relative to revenue and steps down of course, in Q1 and then as we look through the year, it is roughly somewhere between 2% and 3%. But I think the biggest thing is really about timing and the number of new assets that we're bringing into the portfolio and as a result, when you think about the level of recurring capex that has to be made, the newer the portfolio, the better position you have in the current campaign. I would continue to model 2% to 3%, it feels like a reasonable approach, and we'll continue to guide you accordingly. But in fairness to your long-term model, I think that that would be a fair point. Nick Del Deo : Okay, great. Thank you guys. Operator : Our next question comes from John Atkin, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. John Atkin : Yes, a couple of kind of EBITDA questions or related questions, and then one on xScale. So I was just interested in what are the churn expectations that are embedded in your 2022 guidance? And then noting the drop in Europe and EBITDA? What are some of the factors that drove that? And how can we think about the margin development by region? And what are those special items to kind of keep be mindful on? Keith Taylor : Well, I think as it relates to churn first and foremost, as I said, in the prepared remarks, churn for the business was 2.1%, on average per quarter for 2021. 2%, in the fourth quarter, which was great. In many ways, Charles sort of alluded to in his comments on revenue, part of the reason the revenues were so strong is, and I like to say, there's no pass through rates to our revenue dollar than these eliminating churn. And churn was a very, very low level. As we look into 2022, there's not going to be a meaningful shift. We've gotten used to that sort of the range of 2% to 2.5%, that's indicative of what we think will happen. I think the midpoint is probably a fair approach at this stage. And we'll continue to update you on it. But there's nothing meaningful that -- there's nothing meaningful, that will guide you differently at this point, John. As it relates to European EBITDA, there's a number of things that are going on in Q3 one example, is just the timing of costs more specifically, but if you look at the implications of Q4 relative to Q3, there's a German power rebates in the third quarter, until we -- you'll add that into the fourth quarter, and then you've got higher seasonal costs in q4, particularly with the winter months in Europe, you've got higher utility consumption. And so as a result, it has an impact on the margin, when you look at it more specifically. And then there was just some services and an increase hiring costs in the quarter, but there was nothing fundamentally different about your going on. And overall, our belief is the trajectory to our target of 50% EBITDA margins. We're still well on that path notwithstanding, the comments that Charles made related to Asian power, that's going to be very much a transitory matter. And we'll get the other side of that would probably by the second half of the year. John Atkin : And then, on xScale, just curious, any update on your kind of capex and growth assumptions, pricing assumptions as well, given the hyperscale demand that we've seen in the sector, as well as the high level of investment seen by a number of competing platforms? Just curious how you view hyper scale demand pricing, and then your level of participation in terms of CapEx? Charles Meyers : Yes, John, we've seen some increases in build costs, but we're striving to offset those one by just continuing to be accretive on the design front, and continuing to sort of design, try to get some of those out from a design perspective. And then also on the sourcing front, and really working on the strategic sourcing side. So we're, and I think we're seeing returns relatively stable. I think, pricing is aggressive, but stable. I think that there -- yes, there is plenty of supply in the market, but there's even more demand. So I would say, I think, supply demand is quite balanced in the xScale realm right now. It's very chunky and very market specific. And so it's a little bit different than our retail business. But as you've seen our uptake, in lease up has been super strong, thus far, I mean teams executed really well. And we feel good about that. And so there's a lot of megawatts coming down the road and a lot of customer demand. So it's an exciting time, I think for xScale, and we're pleased with the performance of that piece of the business. And that, I mean, it's important to just remind everybody that our exposure on the capital side is, we have gearing of 10 to one on that capex, right. So, because we're only 20% of it, and there's always leverage involved there. And so it really allows us to have a relatively modest overall exposure to that capital and so. So we're putting the bulk of our capital to work on the retail side with really stronger John. John Atkin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Simon Flannery, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. Good evening. I wonder if I could come back to the margin question. You talked a couple of times about margin trends improving the second half of '22, perhaps just to help us with what gives you the visibility into that? Is that mostly Singapore? And how much clarity you have there? And then you reiterated the 50% from by 2025? So given the move here on '22? Do we see it going up fairly linearly from '23 through to '25? Are there other puts and takes there, as we think about that goal long-term goal? Charles Meyers : Yes, well, what I would say yes, the big factor on the margin profile in 2022 is Singapore, as I said, 100 bps of that, and you have 30 bps associated with the year-over-year compared on the benefits we got from the vPPA last year. And so that's the bulk of it, I mean, you can see in the bridge, there's 1.4 there a margin in step down, 1.3 of that is explained between those two factors. And so there's not the rest is a series of puts and takes with some expenses and investments and really solid operating leverage in the business. And so I would say, it is mitigating the sandboard impact. It is operating the driving operating leverage in the business, which is going to be a key focus for John and the team, and it continues to drive the scale on the business. And then a strong pricing environment. So I think we're continuing to see a solid pricing environment, we've demonstrated our ability to deliver distinctive value our customers. And so as the prices were -- I mean, as some of the inflation goes, we're going to go ahead and offset that some degree on the pricing. So I think all those factors, sort of will lead us to some solid progression there from margin standpoint. And I wouldn't guide on where it goes from there and how linear it is or not. I think it's going to, we're going to make judgments in the business, as we always do about investments and how to maximize long-term value creation. But I think what you heard loud and clear is a level of confidence on our part about the 50% target. And again, as we really dug in hard, which is to some degree, the Singapore dynamic was a real catalyst for us to do. It gave us I think an increased level of confidence about how operating leverage is materializing. And that gives us confidence to sort of reiterate that 50% by 2025. Simon Flannery : Great, thank you. Charles Meyers : Thanks Simon. Operator : Our next question comes from Sami Badri, Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you very much for the question. I'm looking at your same-store growth. And that definitely came in a little bit above people's expectations. And I'm trying to take some of your prior comments where you talked about if there was no Singapore utility impact, you would probably grow or be able to comment adjusted EBITDA margins of 47% and change. And this is making me think about the long-term picture on the road to 50%. The same-store has to grow a 5% plus for you to get to 50% adjusted EBITDA margin long-term by 2025. Or can you just maybe unpack that growth rate or that vector for us? Charles Meyers : Sure. Yes. I don't think the short answer is no. We said, we've typically guided in 3% to 5% on the recurring revenue range. Obviously really pleased with 5% up into that range for the stabilized assets. They move around a little bit depending on a variety of factors, but I think overall, we're continuing as business, churns in those markets. We're replacing it with a strong, sort of sweet spot business, continuing to drive interconnection, continuing to expand fabric into more locations, that drives more interconnection. And so I think that's going to drive good results. But I don't think that's it, I don't think, it's incumbent on us to have that happen to get to the 50%. I think there's a variety of sources of operating leverage in our business as we examine our ability to simplify, automate, digitize our business that I think will give us the trajectory that we need on the -- to get to that 50%. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from Ari Klein, BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. AriKlein: Thank you. Charles, you mentioned some of the challenges in the hedging in Singapore, as you look at other markets, where energy prices are elevated, and hedges roll off. Are you hedging at these higher prices? And just you also mentioned passing on some of those costs? What has been the response on the customer side from that? Charles Meyers : Yes, look, I mean, undoubtedly, customers aren't excited about it. But it is, it is the reality that, and it's different. The reality is in deregulated markets, everybody's in the same boat. We're all exposed to the regulated rate. And if the rate rises more than a certain percentage, our contracts allow us to pass that through. And that's the baseline expectation of the customer. And so while they may not love it, they -- that's just an expectation. I think, in deregulated markets, it's a little more complex, we've have these multi-year hedges, which essentially allow you to dampen volatility, and adapt to in a rising rate environment more gradually. And so that's typically what we've seen. That's the way hedging works in a, you're either, you're kind of chasing it down or following it up, because your hedges work either a plus or minus around a range. And so I think we're going to be implementing it gradually over time, as hedges roll off, and sort of hedging into the new market rates, as we roll those hedges out into future years. So, and it's important to remember, we've been doing this for many, many years. And so it's not really a new dynamic, there are definitely some markets that were more volatile and more spiky. And then you have to make a judgement about if that if your rate increase and the potential price increase that if the price increase, you reflect something that doesn't feel right, from a long-term customer relationship standpoint, and we always take the long lens on our customer relationships, then we'll adjust accordingly. And that could mean that we have some pressure from that. But as you see in the bridges, we've been able to offset that with other operating leverage. And so we expect that to continue to be the case, this is an area where the scope and the scale of our business really helps us. And so yes, there are factors out there that we have to deal with, and we deal with them carefully and with the customer in mind. And I think as you can see, we feel confident that we'll be able to manage through it. AriKlein: Got it. And are those price increases permanent, so if I guess if pricing or energy costs normalized, can that turn into a tailwind from your standpoint? Charles Meyers : Yes, very good question. Here's what I'd say, there's different types of price increases, we're actually implementing some baseline sort of new pricing for new deals, because of a broader set of inflationary characteristics and a deep confidence in the value that we deliver to customers. Those I view as more structural. But then in other markets, there are more temporal pricing adjustments associated directly with the utility, volatility, and I wouldn't expect those to be permanent. If it retrenches, then we would want to give that back to the customer. So we are -- but we've been hedged, our hedging strategy allows us to really dampen that volatility out typically, we have definitely seen more volatility, so I wouldn't say we're going to just think regardless of what happens power prices in future. But I do think that for all those and I do think there is a level of them that are more -- level of those that are more structural in terms of new price points on new deals. AriKlein: Got it, thank you. Charles Meyers : You bet. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our Q4 call. Thank you for joining us.",

In the interest of wrapping this call up under an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Chip. Welcome to the call. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome also to all of you to our first quarter earnings call. We had a great start to 2022, delivering the best net booking performance in our history, fueled by strong demand across all three regions, robust net pricing actions and near-record low churn, resulting in our 77th consecutive quarter of top line growth, the longest such streak of any S&P 500 company. We executed more than 4,200 deals in the quarter across more than 3,100 customers, demonstrating both the scale and the consistency of our go-to-market machine. While there are a number of macroeconomic factors that we continue to proactively manage, including rising interest rates, inflation and geopolitical conflict, the business continues to perform exceptionally well. And underlying demand for digital infrastructure continues to rise as enterprises across the globe and in diverse sectors prioritize digital transformation and service providers continue to innovate, distribute and scale their infrastructure globally in response to that demand. Unfortunately, the war in Ukraine is still unfolding, and we continue to be part of the vigorous global response to that conflict. As stewards of key elements of the world's digital infrastructure, we're committed to doing our part in maintaining that infrastructure to support free and open communications and aid in humanitarian relief. While we do not have operations in Russia or Ukraine, our employees have shown incredible generosity supporting Ukrainian refugees, particularly our team in Poland. Looking more broadly at our responsibilities as a market leader, we continue to advance a bold future-first sustainability agenda that reflects our company's values across our environmental, social and governance initiatives. We recently published our 2021 corporate sustainability highlights, and I'm pleased to report continued progress, including a 3.6% increase in representation of women at leadership levels and a 20% increase in the number of employees, leveraging our well-being and our mental health benefits. We also continue to develop pathways and partnerships to enhance our diversity and create opportunities for historically underrepresented groups, both inside and outside of Equinix. As we work to address the urgency of climate change, I'm also proud, that Equinix is well on our way to meeting our science-based target commitments. In 2021, we achieved over 90% renewable energy coverage for our portfolio for the fourth consecutive year, while also improving the energy efficiency of our facilities by over 5% as measured by average annual power usage effectiveness, or PUE. A focus on sustainability continues to be top of mind for customers and partners, as they look to buy from and work with companies that have established ESG goals and commitments. As the world's digital infrastructure leader, we have a responsibility to harness the power of technology to create a more accessible, equitable and sustainable future, and we will continue to focus on the important issues that impact our stakeholders and our business. Now, turning to the results as depicted on slide three. Revenues for Q1 were $1.7 billion, up 10% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 5% year-over-year, and AFFO was better than our expectations, again due to strong operating performance. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our data center services portfolio continues to extend our differentiated scale and reach, with 43 projects underway across 29 metros in 20 countries, including new projects in Atlanta, Mumbai, Sydney, Tokyo and Washington, D.C., as customers embrace our interconnected edge as a point of nexus for their hybrid and multi-cloud architectures and leverage our scaled digital ecosystems to enable and drive their digital agenda. According to IDC, by 2024, 65% of the Global 2000 will embed some sort of edge-first data stewardship, security and network practices into their organization's digital business processes, and we're already seeing the impact with an amazing 89% of recurring revenues, now coming from customers deployed in more than one metro. In April, we closed our acquisition of MainOne, extending platform Equinix into Nigeria, Ghana and Ivory Coast, bringing our global coverage to 69 metros across 30 countries. Nigeria, in particular, is emerging as an innovative and dynamic player in the global digital economy, representing a significant opportunity for the expansion of digital services and a key first step in our long-term strategy to extend our carrier-neutral digital infrastructure platform across Africa. In the quarter, we also announced our upcoming expansion into Chile, through the planned acquisition of multiple data centers from Entel, a leading Chilean telecommunications provider. Chile is the fourth largest economy in South America with the highest GDP per capita in the region. And Santiago is emerging as a technology hub, serving both regional cloud and content demand, as well as local enterprises. This transaction is expected to close in Q2 and will further solidify Equinix as the leading provider of digital infrastructure in Latin America. Turning to interconnection. Our industry-leading portfolio continues to outpace the broader business, growing 12% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, driven by a healthy uptick in connections across our top ecosystem. We added an incremental 8,900 total interconnections in the quarter and now have over 428,000 total interconnections on the platform. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 7% quarter-over-quarter and 25% year-over-year to greater than 24 terabits per second. And we continue to see expanding customer demand and accelerated growth across our digital services portfolio.  Equinix Fabric saw its highest ever virtual connection ads as customers employ an increasingly diverse set of end destinations and utilize fabric for a variety of use cases across cloud networking and backbone connectivity. Equinix Metal and Network Edge also had strong quarters as enterprises leverage these services for a variety of virtual deployments, increasing agility and helping them to mitigate supply chain challenges. Metal has the most net customer adds to its service since its launch, with several key enterprise wins and a healthy backlog as our go-to-market partnerships with Dell, Pure Storage and Mirantis all gained momentum. Shifting to our xScale initiative. In March, we closed our Australian JV with PGIM, which is expected to provide more than 55 megawatts of capacity in the Sydney market when closed and fully built out. And in April, we closed our South Korea JV with GIC, which is expected to provide more than 45 megawatts to the rapidly growing Seoul market. We currently have 9 xScale builds under development with over 80 megawatts of incremental capacity, of which nearly two-thirds are already pre-leased. So now I'll cover some highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical had a great quarter with good momentum across all three regions and record channel activity with our key carrier partners. New wins and expansions included one of the largest ISPs in India, establishing network hubs in our Mumbai 1 and 2 IBS, a high-speed satellite broadband service for military and commercial markets, supporting its expansion into Australia; and Global Net, a specialty network expanding its footprint and upgrading connectivity to support its growing user.  And enterprise continues to be our fastest-growing vertical with a strong bookings quarter led by EMEA in the manufacturing and public sector subsegments. New wins and expansions included Technicolor, the creative services and technology company within the media and entertainment industry, establishing regional technology hubs utilizing the full suite of Equinix' digital infrastructure services.  The Global [indiscernible] choosing Equinix as their strategic partner, thanks to our robust digital offerings, connectivity to key financial institutions and our sustainability strategy, and [indiscernible], a global leader in the celebrations industry using network edges to enable cloud connectivity and allow private interconnection between sites as they continue with their digital transformation. We were also proud to work with a global money center bank who leveraged our advanced ecosystems to enable a critical connection to the National Bank of Ukraine, where the UNICEF could distribute funds to those in need, to those that need it most as part of their humanitarian efforts.  Our cloud and IT services vertical had solid bookings in the quarter, led by the infrastructure subset, while adding new cloud on-ramps in Dubai, Rio de Janeiro and Stockholm. New wins and expansions included Digital Edge, a rapidly scaling global cloud hosting provider, who is expanding its infrastructure footprint across multiple regions as they add customers and products. And a leading SaaS company, leveraging Equinix for its distributed data and cloud strategy and expanding service portfolio.  The broadcast and streaming subsegments anchored a solid quarter of content and digital media, including expansions of the Fortune 75 Media Conglomerates, expanding across Platform Equinix to support streaming services and content production. A multinational consumer credit reporting company, enabling direct connectivity via Equinix to their financial services customers and Fastly, a global CDM expanding capacity and deploying network nodes in support of their edge compute strategy.  And finally, our channel program again delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of record bookings, accounting for roughly 40% of bookings and 60% of new logos. Reseller and alliance partners accounted for over 75% of channel bookings, as our partners continue to demonstrate tremendous leadership in helping customers quickly adopt new digital business models. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and digital first use cases with hybrid multi-cloud featuring prominently as the architecture of choice. We saw continued strength with strategic partners like AWS, Microsoft, Dell and Telstra, including a significant win in France with AT&T, helping a security services company consolidate data centers and interconnect to their choice of cloud providers. We'd also like to recognize AT&T business as our partner of the year for 2021. Proud to have worked together to drive digital first outcomes on complex and transformational projects, including the Equinix and AT&T connected cloud initiatives, benefiting hundreds of customers across multiple industries. Now let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results for the quarter. Keith Taylor : Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. I do hope you're doing well. At Equinix, the team delivered another great quarter. We did better than anticipated. We experienced robust growth in the Americas and solid channel bookings, further expanding the universe of opportunity for our highly differentiated business and enjoyed meaningful inter and intra-region activity, a reflection of we're selling well across our ever-expanding footprint. Interconnection activity remains high both in the physical and the virtual level. Interconnection revenues represent 19% of our recurring revenues and are growing faster than the overall business. Our platform strategy continues to deliver outside its value, further separating us from others in our space. We had strong growth from our digital services products and continued momentum in the most recent acquisitions in Canada, India and Mexico. And our pipeline remains solid despite our record bookings. With a great start to 2022, we're raising our guidance across each of our core financial metrics. As we've said previously, we believe the diversity and scale of our business across sectors, markets and customers puts us in a highly favorable position to capitalize on all trends digital as well as manage the macro factors and volatility. We have no meaningful near-term exposure to rising interest rates. Our balance sheet strength continues to provide us with a strategic advantage, while allowing us to access the capital markets at times that are attractive to us. With regards to supply chain and inflation, we continue to deliver projects against our return expectations with limited delays given our ability to access and secure critical infrastructure components. And while the energy markets remain volatile, our hedging policies are helping us navigate this unusual period. These factors, when combined with the momentum we're seeing in our marketplace, enable us to remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver top line growth, strong and durable AFFO per share growth to our shareholders as well. Now let me cover the highlights for the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q1 revenues were $1.734 billion, up 10% over the same quarter last year and at the midpoint of our guidance due to better than expected MRR revenues, offset in part by the delayed timing of certain nonrecurring ex-scale fees. As we look forward, we expect a strong Q2 step-up in both recurring and non-recurring revenues. As we've noted before, non-recurring revenues attributed to customer installation work and xScale fee income are inherently lumpy and can move between quarters. Q1 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $2 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $800 million or 46% of revenues, up 5% over the same quarter last year at the high end of our guidance range due to strong operating performance and timing of spend, although it was impacted by the lower ex scale fees. Q1 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, included a $1 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and also includes $5 million of integration costs. Total Q1 AFFO was $653 million, above our expectations due to strong operating performance. Q1 global MRR churn was 1.8%, the lowest level of churn in recent history and a reflection of our disciplined strategy of selling the platform to the right customer with the right application into the right asset. For 2022, we now expect MRR churn to average at the lower end of our 2% to 2.5% per quarter range. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on slides five through seven. APAC was the fastest-growing region on a year-over-year normalized basis at 13%, followed by the Americas and EMEA regions at 10% and 9%, respectively. The Americas region had another great quarter with strong broad-based bookings led by our Chicago, Dallas, New York and Washington, D.C. markets. Enterprises represented over half the region's bookings that we announce and we saw record channel activity as businesses continue to leverage platform Equinix to maximize their digital infrastructures flexibility and agility in the hybrid multi-cloud world. The region also saw a robust interconnection activity, adding 4,000 total interconnections and significant Internet exchange capacity led by our Sao Paulo market. Our EMEA region delivered its highest net bookings performance in three years with strong pricing and a healthy mix of retail activity with solid exports led by our Dubai, Istanbul, London and Milan markets. In EMEA, sustainability is an ever-increasing focus for our customers and communities, and our local leadership team continues to work to position Equinix as the industry thought leader at both the local and regional levels. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a solid quarter led by Australia, Japan and Singapore businesses, with traction increasing across the region for our digital services. India had another great quarter, and we're investing behind our momentum in the market with our newly announced Mumbai 3 IBX project as well as purchasing land for development in Chennai. And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to slide 8. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 billion of cash, an increase over the prior quarter, largely due to strong operating cash flow, offset by growth CapEx and our cash dividend. Shortly after the quarter end, we completed our fourth green bond offering raising $1.2 billion to further our commitment to sustainability leadership. With this latest financing, Equinix has issued approximately $4.9 billion of green bonds, making our company the fourth largest global issuer in the investment-grade green bond market. In early April, we are also pleased to have Moody's upgrade Equinix to Baa2 in line with S&P and Fitch while expanding our leverage targets. We're very appreciative of the support we see from Moody's. And importantly, we're delighted with the increased financial flexibility we now have across all three rating agencies. Looking forward, as stated previously, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to funding our growth opportunities with both debt and equity, while creating long-term value for our shareholders. Turning to slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $413 million, including seasonally lower recurring CapEx of $24 million. Also in the quarter, we opened three new retail projects in two markets, Muscat and Singapore, have purchased land for development in Mexico City. Revenues from own assets increased to 60% of our total revenues. Our capital investments delivered strong returns, as shown on slide 10. Our now 164 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Consistent with prior years, in Q1, we completed our annual refresh of IBX categorization. Our stabilized asset count increased by net six IBXs. These stabilized assets are collectively 87% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And please refer to slides 11 through 15 for our updated summary of 2022 guidance and bridges. Do note our 2022 guidance includes the anticipated financial results from the MainOne acquisition, but does not include any results related to the pending Entel acquisition, which is expected to close in Q2. Starting with revenues for the full year 2022, we're very pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the organic business and excited to report that we now expect our revenues to increase on a normalized and constant currency basis by 10% over the prior year. Relative to our prior guidance, we're increasing our revenues by approximately $90 million, which includes our improved operating performance and $50 million of revenues from MainOne. We expect 2022 adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 46%, excluding integration costs, an increase of about $40 million compared to our prior guidance, which includes $20 million from MainOne. And we now expect to incur $25 million of integration costs in 2022. And given the operating momentum in the business, we're raising our underlying 2022 AFFO by $22 million to now grow between 8% and 10% on a normalized and constant currency basis compared to the previous year, offset by the increased debt financing costs from the MainOne and Entel acquisitions. Note the MainOne is expected to be immediately accretive, and we expect the Entel acquisition to be accretive when closed. 2022 AFFO per share is expected to grow between 7% and 8% on a normalized and constant currency basis. 2022 CapEx is now expected to range between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, including approximately $170 million of recurring CapEx spend and about $60 million of on-balance sheet xScale spend. So let me stop here. I'll turn the call back to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Keith. In closing, we had a tremendous start to the year. The demand backdrop for the business remains robust as enterprises across the globe continue to aggressively prioritize digital transformation and service providers expand their infrastructure globally in response to this demand. Data is being created, moved, manipulated, and stored at unprecedented levels. And the need to distribute infrastructure and position it in proximity to the broader digital ecosystem is fueling outsized demand for the distinctive value proposition and platform equities. Growth continues to outpace our Analyst Day expectations, thanks to strength across multiple simultaneous growth vectors for the business, expanding geographic reach, accelerating adoption of digital services, low churn, positive pricing trends and strong channel execution. We continue to leverage our market-leading scale and expansive balance sheet to deliver new capacity, even in an increasingly challenging macro environment. And our bold future-first sustainability agenda guides and rallies our team as we collectively pursue our shared purpose to be the platform where the world comes together to create the innovations that enrich our work, our life and our planet. We are delighted with the ongoing performance of the business, optimistic about the road ahead and remain keenly focused on delivering distinctive and durable value to our customers and to you, our shareholders. So let me stop there, and open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead. Simon Flannery : Okay. Good evening. Thanks so much. I think you've talked a couple of times about the macro environment. There's concerns about recession risk in Europe. Could you just talk to what you've seen in sort of March and April from ITs, CIOs, et cetera, in the European market specifically? And perhaps, we could also just -- on the power side, we've seen significant increases there. You talked about the hedges. And obviously, the guidance is good to see. But how should we think about the sort of the medium to longer term when those hedges need to get replaced? Thank you. Charles Meyers : Sure. Thanks, Simon. I'll start, and Keith can add on as you wish. It's -- we had a great quarter in Europe. So big kudos to the sales team there. Johan Arts, our sales leader, just pulled together a tremendous quarter. And I think -- we've asked him to continue to reshape that business as we've shifted our revenue mix there into really the sweet spot of sort of the small to midsized deals. We're seeing great momentum there. And again, we talked a few quarters ago about accelerating growth there back to sort of prior levels, and we've certainly delivered on that forecast this year or this quarter with that back at 9%. So -- and pipeline looks good. So I would say that the broader macro environment in terms of the prioritization of digital transformation and kind of what we're seeing from technology and IT buyers continues to look good, and I think a high degree of relevance in terms of how they're looking at us and the role that we play in that. So overall, I continue to feel very good about that part of the world. So -- from a power perspective, as we said previously, we're kind of pretty much entirely hedged where we can be in Europe. And so we have not seen substantial impacts there. We are seeing elevated rates in terms of -- so as our -- but we have a lot of runway as we look at our hedges and are continuing to build our hedge positions for 2023 and beyond. But the hedge -- the success of our hedging program, I think, gives us a lot of visibility and runway to figuring out when we need to pass those through and at what levels. And that's ongoing work. And we'll be, I think, in a good position going into 2023 to adjust to that. Simon Flannery : Thanks a lot. Operator : And our next question is from David Guarino with Green Street. You may go ahead. David Guarino : Hey thanks. I have a question on the same-store cash gross profit declining. I think this is the first time we've seen it turn negative since you guys started disclosing that data. Was a lot of that due to the power cost in Singapore or was something else driving that? Charles Meyers : Yes, I mean, the same-store, the revenue growth is strong, and we did see some contribution to that 6% from APAC and Singapore, in particular. And I think there probably is some contribution from the -- on the cash gross margin side there as well associated with that. But overall, we were actually very pleased with the same-store growth performance because, as I said, less than half of that gain to up to the 6% is really impacted by the power PIs. It's really -- it's impacted more by the addition of the new assets into the mix and strength in the Americas, which has an oversized influence on the stabilized assets. So Keith, anything further to add there? Keith Taylor : Just as we've noted and it's embedded in our guidance is the impact coming from the power cost in Singapore having a knock-on impact not only on the Asia Pac market, but the overall performance of the business on a gross margin basis. So again, nothing out of what we expected. As Charles alluded to, the fact of the matter is that stabilized assets are growing at 6% on a recurring revenue basis. We have great momentum in the business, and we've now absorbed effectively with the Q1 results, the impact of the Singapore business. And so that's the business on a go-forward basis there. David Guarino : All right. That's helpful. And then one another quick one. It looks like you guys are building two new phases at your AT1 facility in Atlanta. Are you seeing any shift from tenants who want to relocate away from other colocation data centers in the Atlanta market? Charles Meyers : Yeah. I mean the Atlanta market has been good. We continue to see demand there, and we've been making some of our own transition in terms of really attracting and motivating the network density into the AT1 facility on Peachtree. And so it's -- and again, you certainly see competitive wins in that market as well as just net new customers. So it's been a good market. We're continuing to invest there in terms of new capacity, as you noted, and we feel good about that market overall. David Guarino : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : And our next question is from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead. Jon Atkin : Thank you. I was interested on the energy topic. You're currently hedging presumably at elevated rates, and I just wondered what sorts of applications that might have down the road if energy prices were to normalize. Do you see any exposure in terms of pushback from customers? And then on the other end, just any more color around pricing actions. You mentioned about power related PIs, but anything else about just what's pricing renewal discussions, FastConnect and any color around how pricing is evolving? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Sure. Yeah. I mean, because where we're hedged now is in the rising rate environment as we have these feathered hedges over multiple years. We're hedged essentially below the prevailing market rate. And so -- and in a rising rate environment, what that provides is actually some protection to the customer against those market rates, because we'll be able to roll them in more gradually. And so that's our effect that we see. Again, as hedges roll-off and you've hedged at increasing rates, you are chasing that up. But again, it provides a net benefit there. And the customer will have an expectation as they see what the market rate is even in their own personal power consumption. There's generally a broader expectation that they're going to see some sort of a rise, and we can mitigate that to some degree. So I think the hedging and the success of our hedging, and that's the way it's worked for us in rising rate environments over time. And so we feel generally good about that. As I said, we're well-ahead of that planning cycle as we build our hedges for 2023 and beyond. So anything further to add there, Keith? And then on pricing, yeah, actually, we had -- continue to have strong pricing -- positive pricing actions. We have increased list pricing meaningfully. And I think that we're continuing to evaluate that in terms of -- and that's partially an implication of an artifact of increasing unit costs and other effects in the business beyond power like labor, for example. But that tends to work its way into the business slowly overtime as you see some of that. And we continue to see just a really strong response to the value proposition on a value basis. And so we have been increasing net pricing beyond power as well. Keith Taylor : Jon, if I might just add, I think, it's also important to note -- again, we didn't talk about it specifically, but the net pricing past pricing actions this quarter were substantial even when you take out the increased power pricing. And so when we look at our overall growth rate, you could take out the full implication of our -- of the pricing increases associated with power, and you still have a growth rate of greater than 9% on a normalized and constant currency basis. So yeah, it does have some impact. But the reality is it's the fundamental business that is driving the growth there on the top line. And that leaves us open to, as Charles said, the discussion of what happens later as inflation continues to take hold. What do we do with our pricing in addition to our list price adjustments? So overall, I'd just say that I think we're in a really good position from a pricing perspective. You can see in our blended MR per cap. And even when you sort of discount out the impact of power pricing associated with our current price increases, you still see a nice fundamental increase in our overall pricing on a per capita basis. Jon Atkin : Just two quick ones and a follow-up, churn, can it remain on a sustainable basis at kind of these below average rates? And then demand seems elevated, and you had obviously a strong result last quarter and a strong guide. And does that feel sustainable as well in terms of enterprise retail colo demand? Or is there some sort of a catch-up dynamic where you're seeing some buying that was catch-up, but it might normalize from here and demand might go back to normal levels, or do you see elevated demand indefinitely? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Yeah. I'll start with the demand piece. I think we just continue to see an increasing overall addressable market as people continue to prioritize digital transformation its become such a central part of how people are looking to compete in the modern age that. And the nature of digital infrastructure has continued to change so much as they adopt public cloud, as that becomes a prominent part of their infrastructure strategy, as they think about factors like data sovereignty and application performance and application modernization and the complexity of networking in a sort of hybrid and hybrid cloud world. All of those things really lend themselves well to our value proposition. And I think people are seeing us increasingly relevant to those discussions. And so -- and that's really resulted in what you're seeing, which is several strong quarters of bookings in a row, record levels. And as Keith said in his script, our pipeline continues to look strong. So this isn't a matter of sort of emptying the coverage. We continue to see a growing pipeline. We see record levels of pipeline in our digital services portfolio and continue to see all elements of the business really, really respond strongly from a demand perspective. So we're not seeing any fading of that. It does not feel in any way to us like some sort of catch-up, but instead a more sustained level of demand for the business. And then, relative to churn, we've always said, the best way to reduce churn over time is to put the right business into the platform to begin with. And I think our strategy is really paying off there. And we always are -- always caution people in terms of churn can move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. But if you look at eight-quarter trend or a 12-quarter trend on churn, I think it will start to reveal to you that the downward trend is, in fact, I think, sustainable. Again, I wouldn't want to bet on every quarter being where this one is. But I do think that we have demonstrated sustainable downward trajectory on our churn. Jon Atkin : Thank you. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Jon. Operator : Our next question is from Aryeh Klein with BMO Capital Markets. You may go ahead. Aryeh Klein : Thank you. Maybe, just following up on the power questions. The expectation with Singapore was for the impact to moderate in the second half of the year. And since the original guidance is provided, the backdrop has obviously shifted a little bit with Russia and Ukraine, so have the view shifted on the pace of improvement that you're expecting for the second half of the year? Charles Meyers : Yes, a little bit. I would say, overall, look, the big power issue is really Singapore. It's very much on the margin in any other places. I think, going forward, I think we might see more of -- we have the planning to do in 2023 and beyond as power -- as hedges roll off and as we think about that, as I commented earlier, but I think that's more of something we have plenty of visibility to and an ability to respond to. As it relates to this year, Singapore is by far the overwhelming issue. And there's not a ton of change from what we said last quarter. I think, Q1 was actually a little better than we expected. And then the back half of the year might be a little higher than we had originally forecasted, but they're kind of going to come out kind of in roughly the same place. We now have over 50% of our load hedged or locked in rate-wise in Singapore. So we have better visibility of that. And I don't think a ton of variability and outcome from here. We'll continue to update you, if that changes. But not a big change, probably slightly more on the back end and less in this -- we had a better quarter this quarter than what we had in that original forecast. But on a full year basis, really roughly what we had said previously. Aryeh Klein : Got it. And then in the Americas, you've had several quarters in a row, really strong bookings, and the growth rate accelerated. As we look ahead, I think over 70% of cabinets are outside the Americas in the development pipeline. How should we think about occupancy from utilization rates from here? Its obviously stepped up. What is the kind of level off or get to before you have to add more significantly to the build? Charles Meyers : Yes, a good question. Good question. I think that we have a fair amount of headroom in a lot of markets in the Americas, right? We're at a lower overall utilization rate there on a much bigger business. So there's plenty of capacity to sell. So I'm sure my sales teams are hearing me say that. So they're playing to go around. And the Americas business has performed exceptionally well. And another shout-out to Arquelle Shaw, our senior sales leader in the Americas. And I think that business is really humming and delivering strong sales execution. And so, you're right. A lot of the investment is going to -- going outside the US, but we've also are topping up in key markets in the US and in the Americas broadly to meet the demand there. So we feel good about our ability to both deliver the new capacity and to sell it. And we've got a new President of the Americas coming online, Tara Risser, and she's a tremendously customer-centric executive. And very excited about that. So I feel -- we feel great about the trajectory in the Americas. Again, I think plenty of opportunity to grow into the capacity that is there and drive utilization up. And we will continue to invest where there are markets that we start to see sort of pinch points out there in the future. And so overall, I feel really good about our ability to continue to put capacity online and sell it aggressively. Q \u2013 Aryeh Klein : Thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi. You may go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good afternoon. Just thinking through some of the comments, Charles earlier on the call talked about hybrid cloud, and you have hyperscale through the xScale. And you have, of course, the retail-centric business. And as you have more enterprise customers, are you thinking about ways that Equinix can increasingly serve their hybrid needs and go beyond retail to some enterprise deployments that they may be looking at to retain as part of the hybrid cloud architecture? Charles Meyers : Yes. I mean I think you're getting that sort of enterprise LFP and whether or not there is a sort of intermediate offer there between xScale. I would tell you that we, again, continue to -- if those needs are in the context of a broader platform requirement and how a customer is thinking about their digital transformation, then we will talk to them about how we might do that and where we might be able to meet that need. But again, the sort of the larger footprint, more commodity sort of colo enterprise requirement, isn't a major focus for us. In fact, as I talked about, we've really been retooling our revenue mix in markets like Europe to really focus on the sweet spot of the retail business, interconnection-edge, ecosystem-centric that delivers superior MRR per cab. It delivers superior retention. And that's what you're seeing show up in the business, better MRR per cab, lower churn, et cetera. So we've got to stick to the strategy that continues to drive the performance in the business. And I would tell you what we're seeing. You saw -- on occasion, you do see large enterprise-type needs. And we'll partner with enterprises and thinking that through. But I will tell you that, for the most part, I think a lot of times, customers are saying, 'Hey, we're going to put -- we're going to use a mix of public cloud and private cloud, and we really need to place our data in a sort of -- in more of an inter-cloud kind of location to drive performance and to meet statutory requirements, et cetera. And so I feel really good about the portfolio that we have. And I actually think the real -- a big opportunity with us on the enterprise side is the digital services portfolio. Really, delivering them Metal -- they're finding very well Metal is a value proposition because it helps them mitigate their technology life cycle management. It helps them be more agile, more scale, more rapidly move capacity around as they need it and as customer demand mandates that for them. And then Network Edge is a way that they really are thinking about retooling and rethinking networking in a cloud-centric world. And then, of course, Fabric, you see the momentum that we have there. And so I feel good about the portfolio, and we're going to -- we stood up the digital services BU and are going to continue to make some investments there, and I think that's going to position us really well for continued enterprise momentum. So really long answer to your question, but I think we'd be very selective about that. We don't see a big priority on sort of large footprint, lower margin profile kind of business. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. You may go ahead. Erik Rasmussen : Yes, thanks for taking the questions. So this quarter, we're expecting really good strength from hyperscalers. And as it relates to your xScale business, considering sort of this elevated demand environment, what would you say are some of the hurdles you're seeing as you think about meeting this demand? Charles Meyers : Well, I mean it's -- I think the business is executing really well. We're not sort of trying to chase every bit of hyperscale that's out there. We've got an aggressive but an appropriate plan that we think delivers strategic value to the overall platform. We're focused on a relatively small number of sort of global hyperscalers that we think are critical to how the overall cloud macro plays out and are focused on them. I think it's really just being able to continue to deliver capacity. And so we've been more aggressive about land banking. We're continuing to work to make sure that we have the capacity and the key equipment necessary. So our supply chain team has been active both in terms of both our -- the xScale side of our business and retail to ensure that we are buying inventory or making forward commitments to ensure the availability of equipment to get projects delivered on time. So I think that's going to be the key thing for us. And right now, we feel very good about that. In fact, since the last quarter, we talked about -- over a couple of quarters ago I guess it was we talked about having roughly $100 million of pre-commitment and inventory in place to try to mitigate against supply chain, we've nearly doubled that to continue to sort of anticipate and head off any pinch points that exist in the supply chain. So I think we're doing a good job there, but I think that's the area that we need to continue to focus on. And I guess the proof is in the pudding in that our delivery dates are all, on average, a few outliers here and there, but on average, we're no more than a week or two delayed on projects. And so being continuing to deliver on-time deployments. Erik Rasmussen : Great. That's helpful. And then maybe just on M&A. You've obviously been pretty disciplined in your approach historically. But in the current environment, multiples have moved up. Just wondering if the right opportunity were to come up, are there scenarios where you would stretch your comfort level to maybe not lose out on a particular deal? And what would that type of deal look like? Charles Meyers : Yes. Look, I mean we -- every deal is a little bit different. I mean I would say that there are good examples in our past of where we have stretched in what terms of maybe a multiple that we paid based on our belief about our ability to sort of buy that multiple down over time through growth. And I think Metronode and Infomart are probably a couple of examples that pop to mind that we've both turned out to be really great deals for us. But we're going to be appropriately disciplined. We're not going to win every deal, but we also believe that M&A is a key tool in the toolbox. And we think there are opportunities out there for us to continue to extend and scale our platform and our priorities kind of remain the same. Key interconnection assets, scale in markets where we're seeing success and continue to extend our platform geographically into the markets that matter. And I think all those types of opportunities are available. So -- and we've got the balance sheet to pull it off, I think. So we'll be out there, we'll be aggressive. And in cases where we think it makes sense to stretch, we will. And where we don't, we won't. Erik Rasmussen : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. You may go ahead. Brendan Lynch : Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. To start, we're about one year on from your long-term guidance when you issued your long-term guidance for a 50% adjusted EBITDA margin by 2025. Your guidance this year is implying a 140 basis point contraction for some of the well-documented reasons that have been discussed already. I just want an update, if you would, on the ability to achieve that long-term target. And what are some of the elements that are directly within your control on the cost side that could help get you there if you can't get there through pricing power? Charles Meyers : Yes. Great question, Brendan. One, obviously, that we are very focused on and think a lot about. I'll start with just simply saying that we continue to see 50% as an appropriate long-term target for EBITDA margin. There's a number of moving parts on the overall margin trajectory of the business. And as you said, some -- we've talked about many of those with power, particularly the Singapore power situation being central to that. We kind of already talked about that dynamic, which is -- were a little better than expected in Q1. Back half of the year might be a little bit worse than what we had originally forecast, but not a major shift there. As we enter next year, we'd expect to see APAC margins normalize either through moderating rates, and we can't really predict that fully. Or even if they don't moderate by us, essentially, putting additional PIs through and getting in line with the broader market. And so I think we'll see margin normalization there. And we continue to drive and expect continued operating leverage in the business in the back half of the year from several of our targeted efficiency programs in the business. And so we do think we need to have other levers available to continue to drive operating leverage. But we also may make some investments in quarter ahead, I think, given the tremendous booking strengths that we're seeing. So I don't think that would be surprising to anybody. So bottom line, we'll give you more detailed guidance on the 2023 and beyond margin profile as that becomes more clear. But I think the really critical takeaways are that : one, we continue to see 50% as an achievable target; and two, that we really remain confident that we can deliver against the Analyst Day AFFO per share growth targets through some combination of top line growth and appropriate operating leverage. And at the end of the day, that's really our lighthouse metric is driving that AFFO per share growth. Brendan Lynch : Great. Thanks. That's helpful. And maybe just one follow-up on the churn profile or trajectory. In the past, some of your acquisitions have kind of had a customer product mismatch where we saw an uptick in churn, specifically with the Verizon assets. I wonder if there's anything like that with any of the recent acquisitions that you've made that might cause churn to increase? Charles Meyers : Yeah. Really good question. Generally, we don't see that happening. I think a number of the \u2013 I think Bell was a little bit more aligned, maybe a little \u2013 maybe a little bit of that, and we'll continue to reshape that customer mix a bit, but much smaller scale than Verizon was in a bit of a different dynamic there. And then some of the other ones, I think, are more, more in line with kind of the overall customer profile or much smaller in their overall scope. So there's certainly some of that you inevitably see in M&A, but I wouldn't see anything on the horizon that would meaningfully tick that up. Brendan Lynch : Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question is from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead. Sami Badri : Hi. Thank you. I had one question and a follow-up. For the first question, I think you talked a little bit about the Americas business. And I just wanted to hit on specifically Americas MRR per cab and how it was down quarter-on-quarter and 1Q 2022. I know there were some adjustments and there was also a footnote, but I just kind of wanted to just get a better idea on what's going on there? And then the second question is regarding the $42 million of increased outlook visibility. Which regions are providing the strength for that $42 million? Charles Meyers : Sure. Let me \u2013 yeah, and recap, I'll give you a little bit of a more holistic view and then comment on Americas. And Keith just commented on this, we saw a nice uptick in overall in MRR per cap on a global basis. I think it's driven in meaningful part by significant organic strength in Europe and then some uptick in APAC in definitely with the PI \u2013 Power PI and Singapore contributing to that. But more than half of that is really driven, on an overall global basis, is driven by underlying organic strength in the business. In the Americas, we \u2013 there are a couple of moving parts there. We've always encouraged people to kind of look at a multi-quarter average since that metric can really be more volatile depending on several factors. And we saw a few of those factors. We saw some settlement activity in the Americas that was a one-time thing. We saw a large install, which is not yet ramped. And so you get the cabs, but not as much revenue. And then finally, we get \u2013 had a little bit of a price action associated with the very large renewal we did with NASDAQ, which was a huge win for us, but had a little bit of downward impact on that. But overall, I think nothing of concern. I think the MRR per cab in the Americas is still exceptionally healthy. And I think, we'd continue to be able to feel like we can continue to manage it at or above those levels. Keith Taylor : So I'd just add, just on to what Charles said there. The other thing that, as you probably recognize, we put Bell Canada's assets into our metrics last year or the end of last year, and they come at a lower MRR per cab than the average rate. And as a result, you've seen the dilutive impact of that, coupled with the fact that Canadian business continues to perform well, and so you've got a little bit of a mix on a go-forward basis. The last thing I would say is the currencies, again, this is a US dollar denominated number. And so you see that, the impact of lower currencies, we're not neutralizing it when we report on the non-financial metric page we do on the regional breakout page. But all you've got the impact of currencies influencing given the strength of the US dollar. It's just Japan is down about 12%. As an example, year-to-date, we've got other markets that have taken a little bit of a hit relative to the US dollar. So there are a number of things that are going on. But fundamentally, this is not anything to worry about. In fact, we're seeing greater strength in the business given the pricing profile that we have. And so we've not put a lot of focus on that particular metric. Charles Meyers : Keith, do you want to comment on the regional strength -- the regional breakout of the MRR system? Keith Taylor : Yeah. And then as regards to the regional, the profitability, as we said, $42 million of incremental EBITDA, $20 million is coming from MainOne. You've got $2 million coming from currencies. Again, that gives you a sense of the strength of our hedge positions on a currency basis. The financial impact of the business is very relatively de minimis for the rest of the year under current course and speed. So that feels good. So, relating to the organic business, you're seeing strong broad-based performance across the business. One of the comments that Charles made is we're seeing strength in all three regions in the world. And because of that strength in the top line is driving profitability in the top line, we think -- again, as you appreciate, in the US or the Americas business, we make corporate decisions and make accruals, and so we embed that a part of the corporate level there for the Americas region. But overall, the fundamental business across all three regions is strong. And the only thing I would add to that is, yeah, you see the fluctuation in Asia Pacific, and that's specific to the Singapore matter that Charles has spoken of. And again, that's in our numbers now. It's in our run rate. And on a go-forward basis, we feel very good about the profitability in the business. And so you're seeing that growth and the momentum in the business, and it's right across the board. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Elias with Cowen and Company. You may go ahead. Michael Elias : Great. Thanks for taking the question. One quick question on the power cost side and the price increases. When you do pass through higher power cost to the customers, just wondering, are you structuring it as a temporary surcharge, or is that a permanent increase in the power costs embedded in that contract? That's my first question. And then, my second question is you mentioned earlier that you've raised your list prices meaningfully higher. Just as we think about the implications of that on MRR per cab going forward and kind of your renewal schedule, any color you can share on what you would expect over the medium to long-term to see the MRR per cab side? Thank you. Charles Meyers : Sure. Yeah. The power PIs, I think it all depends is the answer. Because I think that if we saw a reversion back to meaningfully lower rates, then I think we would adjust accordingly. And so, I do think that we kind of separate out more of the power-related pricing adjustments associated with power volatility from more structural sort of price levels and margin profiles within the business. And so, I think we're just going to have to navigate that in terms of -- but I do think the market saw a big uptick pass through those meaningful adjustments and then saw a reversion, I think we would make adjustments there. And so -- but I think it's going to very much depend and be something we'll have to look at on a market-by-market basis. And then pricing, I think in terms of its impact on MRR per cab, yes, I mean, I think that as we increase pricing due to various inflationary factors as well as due to the continued strength of our value proposition and our ability to continue to add more value for our customers, I think that's going to have a positive impact on our MRR per cab and just allow us to continue to preserve margins and drive the appropriate returns on capital. So we're going to have to continue to monitor that in terms of just how with the pace and the level of the inflationary forces in the business are. But right now, I think we've demonstrated that across the board we can make appropriate pricing adjustments and therefore feel like we can preserve that MRR per cab trajectory. Michael Elias : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : And our last question comes from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead. Matt Niknam : Hey. Thanks for taking the question. I have one on the balance sheet and then a quick follow-up. But on the balance sheet, I think, Keith, you referenced some of the ratings agency upgrades of late. It looks like you've got some additional leverage capacity you've yet to use. I'm just wondering what's the latest thinking around optimal leverage for the business given the expanding scale and stickiness of the platform. And then just as we think about funding for Entel, I think right now, after the $1 billion plus green bond, you're sitting on about $3 billion worth of cash pro forma for that. I get the sense the company is fully funded for the Entel acquisition. I'm just wondering, if we're thinking about it the right way, really trying to understand if the Entel deal will require any sort of incremental financing upon close or whether that's just a straight contribution when it closes? Thanks. Keith Taylor : Great questions. Let me first start with just the overall performance of the business. So the one we just did, as you know, that we base yield of 3.9% when we put treasury locks in place at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. And so we're able to trade it down to a 10-year term 3.35%. So exceedingly pleased with the performance of that transaction. That effectively fully funded the acquisition of Entel and MainOne. As we noted in the results, there's -- when we portion the increased interest expense this year relative to the two acquisitions, $8 million of it was allocated to MainOne and the other $22 million is running through our books right now. Now we've absorbed the cost. It's sitting there. It's in our guide, but we've yet to report the addition of the Entel acquisition. That will happen sometime in the second quarter, the May-June time frame. And as a result, you're going to get the net benefit of that. So effectively, what you're saying is you've already funded the cost side of the equation and will enjoy the, if you will, the income side of the equation yet. So that's that. As it relates to overall sort of our capital management, we do have the flexibility. We're 3.8x levered right now as a business. As we look forward, we still feel that the leverage in the 4-plus range is appropriate. We've got more flexibility with our three rating agencies, and we're very thankful for that. We've got the flexibility to draw down on debt. We think debt is -- despite the rising interest rates as of late, it's still a cheaper source of capital for us and, hence, why we took $1.2 billion off the table in April. We're looking obviously at other debt transactions over some period of time. Europe seems to be a good place given the differential in borrowing rates. And then we always will use a blend of debt and equity, largely because that's what we do. And I think that's what allows us to have the strength in which Charles referred to before. We can transact with a strong balance sheet with great success, given how we've structured ourselves. And so, the only other thing I'd say is we are looking forward just because what we fund today, we also are looking forward into 2023 and 2024, what is the capital needs of the business. So we're maintaining that flexibility as we look forward in periods of great volatility. We always like to strike, as I said in my prepared remarks, when we think it's appropriate to raise the capital. And given the strong balance sheet, we've used that flexibility and got into the market at times that we've chosen. And that's been very, very effective to us on a long-term basis. So all that is a long-winded response, I'd say that we have great flexibility. We're absorbing costs today without the income attached to them. And I'm excited about the opportunity on a go-forward basis. The business is performing exceedingly well, and it's going to give us an opportunity to continue to fund the growth that we see in the business. And I'll stop there. Q \u2013: That\u2019s great. I really appreciate all that color. Thanks. Chip Newcom : This concludes our Q1 call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

We provide a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a list of the reasons why the company uses these measures in today's press release on the Equinix Investor Relations page at www.equinix.com. We have made available on the IR page of our website a presentation designed to accompany this discussion, along with certain supplemental financial information and other data. We would also like to remind you, we post important information about Equinix on the IR page from time to time and encourage you to check our website regularly for the most current available information. With us today are Charles Meyers, Equinix' CEO and President; and Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping the call up in 1 hour, we would like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to 1. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thank you, Chip. Good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. On the heels of a record Q1, we had an outstanding Q2, with strong and sustained demand across our product portfolio, broad pricing momentum and solid sales execution, with particular strength in Americas and EMEA, resulting in record growth and net bookings and our best-ever quarterly revenue step-up. As our customers progress and accelerate their digital transformation journeys, the relevance of Platform Equinix continues to grow. In our recent global tech trend survey, nearly 70% of the 2,900 IT decision-makers polled indicated their intention to adopt private or hybrid as their cloud architecture of choice, with over 45% of those polled working with 3 or more cloud providers and over 80% indicating their intention to sustain or increase their spend on interconnection. Today, we're seeing this demand for interconnected digital infrastructure across our regions. This quarter's bookings sizably surpassed the prior peak, a great indicator of the strength of the business and our go-forward pipeline. Our business remains resilient and highly diversified, with nearly 1/3 of our 10,000-plus customers closing incremental business in any given quarter. Despite macro conditions, this customer demand, paired with lower-than-expected churn, is driving us above the upper end of our Analyst Day revenue guidance this year and benefiting our AFFO per share guide, with the impact of pricing increases still largely unrealized. Turning to our results. As depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q2 were $1.8 billion, up 10% over the same quarter last year, representing our 78th consecutive quarter of top line revenue growth, a clear reflection of the durability of our business model across economic cycles. Adjusted EBITDA was up 8% year-over-year, with AFFO meaningfully ahead of our expectations due to continued strong operating performance. Interconnection revenues continue to outpace the broader business, growing 13% year-over-year. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Customers continue to embrace Equinix as the best manifestation of the interconnected digital edge. And we continue to scale, extend and innovate across our data center services portfolio. We now have 49 major projects underway across 34 metros in 21 countries, with 13 new projects this quarter, including new data center builds in Dublin, Montreal, New York, Paris, Warsaw and our first build in Chennai, India, the first of several anticipated metro expansions in this fast-growing market. Our unparalleled global scale and reach continues to be a strategic advantage, driving success with service providers looking to extend their reach and rapidly implement as a Service models and with enterprise customers across nearly every sector of the global economy as they modernize their infrastructure and embrace hybrid and multicloud. Wins this quarter included a multinational energy conglomerate, implementing their hybrid cloud strategy across multiple regions, leveraging Network Edge and Equinix Fabric, and F5, a global technology leader in application security and multicloud networking, establishing additional networking nodes in all 3 regions to better support their customers. In May, we closed our acquisition of 4 data centers from Entel, extending Platform Equinix into Chile and bringing our global footprint to 70 metros across 31 countries. Equinix has a decade-long history in Latin America, and this acquisition provides significant expansion capacity, enabling both local businesses and multinationals the opportunity to accelerate their digital transformation and our Lat Am aspirations. We also expect to close on the acquisition of one additional data center from Entel, extending our reach to Lima, Peru in Q3. As the world's digital infrastructure company, we believe it's our responsibility to help bring about a more sustainable future. In 2022, we continue to advance our bold future-first sustainability strategy and are pleased to have been recognized by Sustainalytics as among the best large-cap REITs for ESG and to be ranked seventh on US EPA's National Top 100 list of the largest green power users. We continue to accelerate the transition to cleaner energy grids and recently executed our second Virtual Power Purchase Agreement in Finland. Once operational, these 2 new wind projects, combined with our prior projects, will bring Equinix' total renewable VPPA capacity to 300 megawatts, and we continue to explore additional PPA projects across all 3 regions as we progress towards our goal of 100% clean and renewable energy. Turning to our industry-leading interconnection franchise, we're seeing continued diversification of our ecosystems and robust activities, including a win with Fast Shop, one of Brazil's largest electronics retailers, who chose Equinix to help strengthen interconnection for its digital core, improved cloud connectivity and integrate with the digital retail ecosystem. In Q2, we added an incremental 7,600 interconnections and now have over 435,000 total interconnections on our platform. Equinix Fabric saw a notable increase in provision capacity as channel enablement is driving network resale use cases and customers are increasingly using inter-metro connections on Fabric to connect across their deployments, including a win with Zivver, a cybersecurity company in the Netherlands using Equinix Fabric to connect deployments in Amsterdam and London to provide connectivity for its customers as part of its business expansion. Internet Exchange saw peak traffic up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 25% year-over-year, to greater than 25 terabits per second. Pivoting to our digital services portfolio. We continue to see strong growth and significant opportunity as customers increasingly leverage more Virtual as a Service and Edge solutions. Equinix Metal had a strong bookings quarter as partner-driven solutions like Pure Storage and Dell PowerStore on Equinix Metal are driving performance-centric hybrid cloud opportunities with enterprise customers. Network Edge also had a strong quarter, with a notable increase in large multi-instance deployments from enterprise customers. Both Metal and Network Edge are also driving attractive revenue pull-through to Equinix Fabric. Digital services wins this quarter included Protocol Labs, an open-source R&D lab, increasing its usage of Equinix Metal to support projects that decentralize the web and cloud storage, and a leading waste management services provider, leveraging Fortinet on Network Edge to connect their business units in Asia to their data centers in the U.S. across Equinix Fabric. Our strategy remains simple, to translate our unique and durable advantages into being the platform where buyers and sellers of digital services can come together, enabling them to deploy and interconnect the infrastructure that they need to transform their business. For service providers, demand remains robust as businesses around the world are planning major investments in digital technologies to support ambitious expansion plans following lessons learned from the pandemic. This year, Gartner projects that global spending on public cloud services will reach nearly $500 billion. And we're seeing strong demand across multiple vectors with these key cloud and IT customers. In the quarter, we added 3 new cloud on-ramps in Paris and London and now have nearly 200 on-ramps to the major cloud service providers deployed on our platform, making Equinix the home of hybrid multicloud. We also continue to see tremendous success supporting our hyperscale partners as they invest in subsea cables to facilitate the rapid growth of Internet traffic between continents. And in addition to being an integral part of hyperscale architectures, we continue to drive go-to-market alignment with these market-shaping players, partnering to meet end customer needs for hybrid cloud and making the hyperscalers some of our most productive channel partners. Hyperscaler demand for our xScale offering also remains robust. We had high leasing activity in Q2, pre-leasing our entire Dublin 6 asset, the first phase of our Paris 13 asset and the second phase of our Frankfurt 11 asset, representing more than 38 megawatts of capacity. Looking across the various xScale JVs, we've seen strong demand, with over 170 megawatts now leased across our portfolio. And we currently have 11 xScale builds under development, of which more than 80% is pre-leased. On the enterprise side, Gartner also continues to view digital transformation not as a 1- or 2-year trend, but as a systemic and long-term theme. Our pipeline strongly supports this thesis, and our enterprise activity this quarter was robust with Americas and EMEA regions driving record bookings, with particular strength in banking and health care. Expansions included a leading U.S. health care software vendor, creating an edge hosting environment on the West Coast, and the Hertz Corporation, one of the largest worldwide vehicle rental companies, who deployed on Platform Equinix to support its digital transformation journey, locating infrastructure proximate to cloud providers and tapping into our digital solutions. And once again, our channel program continued to thrive, delivering its fifth consecutive quarter of record bookings, including strong performances for our EMEA and APAC regions, accounting for more than 35% of bookings and nearly 60% of new logos. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and digital-first use cases, with hybrid multicloud as the clear architecture of choice. We saw strength from strategic partners, like AT&T, Cisco, Dell, Google and Microsoft, and including a win with Orange Business Services for -- a security services technology company, to deploy their payment card encryption solution while interconnecting to our financial services and cloud ecosystems. We're also proud to have been named HPE GreenLake's Momentum Partner of the Year for 2022 as we together work to deliver a consistent hybrid and multicloud experience for our joint customers. Now let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results for the quarter. Keith Taylor : Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. I hope you're all doing well and enjoying the summer months. Well, as you can see from our results, Q2 was one of our best quarters to date, if not our best. The go-to-market engine continues to convert our healthy pipeline into record bookings with attractive pricing, coupled with low churn dynamics. In fact, it was our eighth straight quarter of increasing net bookings activity, and our forward-looking pipeline remains robust. Our success and the momentum in the business are strong indications of the value customers place on our highly differentiated ecosystems or the breadth of our service offerings, the global scale and reach of our platform and of course, the quality of our operational delivery. With a great first half of 2022, we're again raising our underlying guidance across each of our core financial metrics. Now as you can see from our performance, we continue to manage an instrument in the business to perform across varying economic cycles, even ones like we're experiencing today. While all things macro remain within our focus, we do feel well positioned to address the volatility in the market, and here's why. We have low customer concentration, with no customer representing greater than 3% of our revenues, and our top 50 customers continue to diversify across our platform and as a percentage of revenues. With regards to supply chain, our best-in-class design and construction and strategic sourcing teams are delivering projects consistent with our budget expectations with limited delays and have access greater than $300 million of inventory holds to mitigate future disruptions across a number of critical functions. On inflation, we've largely been effective by protecting our customers and partners from the market fluctuations. But as we continue to assess the likely go-forward trends related to the cost of energy and construction, in addition to the broader inflationary increases affecting wages and other operating costs, we do expect to raise our prices. And with 60% of our revenues coming from outside the U.S., a strong dollar in Q2 has had a notable impact on our as-reported numbers and outlook, yet our sophisticated hedging program has meaningfully dampened the impact to our financial statements. Now let me cover the highlights for the quarter. All comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q2 revenues were $1.817 billion, up 10% over the same quarter last year and above the top end of our guidance range due to better-than-expected step-up in recurring revenues and strong xScale NRR fees. Full MRR per cabinet yield reached the new mark of $2,000 per cabinet. Q2 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $20 million impact when compared to our prior guidance rates due to broad dollar strength. Global Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $860 million or 47% of revenues, up 8% over the same quarter last year, above the top end of our guidance range due to strong operating performance. Q2 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, included a $10 million FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates and $4 million of integration costs. Global Q2 AFFO was $691 million, above our expectations due to strong operating performance and included a $9 million FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q2 MRR churn was 2.1%, again at the lower end of our guidance range. Looking forward, we expect MRR churn to continue to trend favorably and remain at the lower end of our 2% to 2.5% per quarter range. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on slides 5 through 7. APAC was the fastest-growing region on a year-over-year normalized MRR basis at 14%, followed by the Americas and EMEA regions at 11% and 9%, respectively. The Americas region had a record bookings quarter with great performance in our Canadian and Mexican businesses as well as our Denver and Silicon Valley markets and healthy new deal pricing. The Americas go-to-market edge then continues to sell the platform with strong global exports. The Entel Chile assets are performing well against our initial expectations, and we look forward to adding Lima, Peru to our global footprint in August. Our EMEA region also delivered a record bookings performance, with broad-based strength across our cloud, enterprise, content and digital media verticals, led by our London and Paris markets as well as our emerging markets. In the quarter, we saw healthy retail activity with strong pricing across our varying deal sizes and solid adoption of our digital services products. The integration of the MainOne assets into our platform is progressing well, and the business is tracking ahead of our expectations. We're seeing increased focus on sustainability across our European stakeholders, and thus, we're taking an active leadership role through the European Data Centre Association to address this growing and critical matter. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a strong quarter with robust channel activity, led by our businesses in Australia and Singapore. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank our Shanghai operations team for their dedication and effort during their very strict COVID lockdowns over the past quarter to deliver 100% uptime. Their efforts are a shining example of what we call the magic of Equinix as they put \"we\" before \"me\" to ensure our customers' critical infrastructure remained operational. And now, looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. We ended the quarter with cash of approximately $1.9 billion, an increase over the prior quarter, largely due to our April green bond debt offering and strong operating cash flow created by the business, offset by our growth CapEx, the cash dividend and the acquisitions closed in the quarter. In June, Fitch Ratings upgraded us to BBB+, given the strength of our business performance and its cash-generating capabilities as well as our balanced capital funding posture. We're very appreciative of the support received from Fitch. Additionally, during the quarter, we executed some ATM for resale transactions, which will provide approximately $400 million of incremental equity funding when settled later this year. Looking forward, as stated previously, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to funding our growth opportunities with both debt and equity, while creating long-term value for our shareholders. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $490 million, including a recurring CapEx of $35 million. In the quarter, we opened 4 retail projects in London, Mexico City, Milan and Tokyo and 2 xScale projects in Frankfurt and Sydney. We also purchased land for development in Bogota and Mumbai. Revenues from owned assets stepped up to 61% of our total revenues, reflecting our long-term strategy of both developing and purchasing land and IBXs. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our 162 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 7% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 87% utilized and generate a 28% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And finally, please refer to slides 11 through 15 for an updated summary of 2022 guidance and bridges. Do note, our 2022 guidance now includes the anticipated financial results from the Entel Chile acquisition, which closed in May. For the full year 2022, based on the momentum we're seeing in the organic business, we now expect our revenues to increase 10% to 11% on a normalized and constant currency basis over the prior year, trending above our Analyst Day revenue range, a reflection of the healthy digital infrastructure demands that are driving the momentum in our business. Relative to our prior guidance, we're increasing our revenues by $65 million, including $30 million of revenues from the Entel Chile. We expect 2022 underlying adjusted EBITDA to increase by a net $33 million compared to our prior guidance, including $18 million from Entel Chile. We now expect to incur $30 million of integration costs in 2022. We're raising our underlying 2022 AFFO by $33 million to grow between 8% and 10% on a normalized and constant currency basis. And given the strength in our business, 2022 AFFO per share is now expected to grow between 8% and 9% on a normalized and constant currency basis, above the top end of our prior guide, with both the MainOne and Entel acquisition immediately accretive to our business. 2022 CapEx is now expected to range between $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion, including about $185 million of recurring CapEx and about $110 million of on-balance sheet xScale spend. So let me stop here. I'm going to turn the call back to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Keith. In closing, we had an outstanding first half of 2022, and our business continues to deliver strong and consistent results. Despite a challenging macroeconomic and sociopolitical landscape, demand remains robust as customers continue to invest heavily in digital transformation. And as infrastructure needs evolve, Platform Equinix is increasingly relevant as a point of nexus in IT architectures that are more distributed, more hybrid and more cloud-connected, giving us a distinctive value proposition and meaningful pricing flexibility. The emergence of the cloud continues to disrupt the multitrillion-dollar global IT market, fueling both our hyperscaler relationships and our broader service provider business as successful new entrants extend and expand their infrastructure to drive revenue growth and traditional technology leaders build out distributed delivery infrastructure as they transform to as a Service models. We continue to invest behind this momentum, both in expanding the reach and scale of our data center platform and in accelerating the evolution of our digital services portfolio, which is seeing strong customer interest. In that vein, we're pleased to welcome Jeetu Patel and Fidelma Russo to our Board of Directors. As veteran operating leaders at Cisco and HPE, they bring deep knowledge of both technology and go-to-market aspects of the evolving digital infrastructure landscape. And we're excited about their contributions as we continue to innovate our service offerings for the digital leaders of today and tomorrow. So let me stop there and open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Matthew Niknam : Congrats on the quarter. Just first, maybe on bookings. So you talked about record quarterly gross and net bookings, Americas and EMEA leading the way. I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit about how trends evolved over the course of the quarter and whether you've seen any moderation, maybe either late 2Q or early 3Q, just in light of the macro backdrop. And then one follow-up. Keith, you mentioned the $400 million in ATM, equity issuance. I'm just wondering, with leverage under 4 turns, can you talk about the strategic rationale for the issuance and how you're thinking about potential uses. Charles Meyers : Hey, Matt. It's Charles. I'll take the first one and hand it over to Keith for the second one. So no -- I would say, the trend line on bookings continues to be strong. I think we're seeing real commitment from folks relative to digital transformation. I think we're seeing that strength across regions and across sectors, both in the service provider side of our business and the enterprise side of our business. And that's literally across virtually every sector, as we said in the script. So no moderation, in fact, I would tell you that our pipeline going into Q3 is stronger than it was going into Q2. We've got a lot of forward visibility and really continue to feel very good about the overall demand backdrop for the business. Keith Taylor : And Matt, sort of responding to the second question, as it relates to using our ATM, first and foremost is, as you probably heard in the prepared remarks, we've done that on a forward basis so we haven't pulled down the equity yet. And part of it I think is, look, there's a lot of disruption in the marketplace. And one of the things that we know is we're going to continue to build. As you heard, we announced 49 new product -- we have 49 projects underway. We added 13 new projects this quarter. We're closing on the acquisitions, and we're going to continue to fund these dividends. As we think a lot about what we need, not only through the rest of this year but through the end of next year, we want to make sure we bring balance to the market, balance to our capital plans, but also recognize that there was volatility in the marketplace. And so we basically did a forward sale through a number of transactions at $680 a share over the quarter. We're very selective in our timing as you can appreciate. And we just felt that it was a good thing to add to the overall liquidity position of the business. Let me just also, just sort of say one last thing. As you step back and you recognize the momentum in our business and what Charles has just -- what we said in the prepared remarks, but certainly what Charles has also spoken of, the momentum in our business is substantial and the investments that we're making in our assets is going to continue to be substantial. As a result, we want to make sure that we have sufficient liquidity in these periods of great uncertainty. And so raising capital at a time when you can is appropriate, so using the cash on our balance sheet, using our equity. And of course, as you can appreciate, we're going to be looking at some debt structures as well to augment our liquidity position so that we don't have to worry about that next decision, which is what will we do if an opportunity presents itself. So again, it's more about being prudent, having balance, supporting our ratings and at the same time, creating liquidity in the balance sheet for future decisions. Operator : Our next question is from Aryeh Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Aryeh Klein : Same-store revenue growth was the best it's been in a while. I think, last quarter, you mentioned you got a 50 basis point benefit from energy. Is that still the case? And then can you talk about the pricing strategy outside of energy? It sounds like you are increasing prices. So can we see increases above and beyond the 2% to 5% that you've received historically? Charles Meyers : Yes. Thanks, Aryeh. The same-store, yes, tremendous quarter on that. And in terms of how much of that wind at the back is energy, it's actually probably a little less than that number in terms of any contributions to that. So really strong quarter overall. So I believe it was, I want to say, 40 bps in that $6.7 million that was associated with energy. So -- but really, I think we would still see north of $6 million even without that. And so a good -- a really good result there and feeling great about that and feel like we can continue to deliver in sort of our previously guided range going forward. In terms of the broader pricing strategy, absolutely. We're looking holistically at the pricing strategy, not only -- and I've talked about this in a number of other forms. There are sort of several levels to the pricing strategy and execution. One is power, and that is about sort of making sure that we can fully recover sort of increases to power in markets where that's occurring and align that up with our hedging strategy. And we've talked in depth about that, but we continue to have high degrees of confidence that we can -- the combination of our hedging and our ability to pass that through will allow us to mitigate those impacts on the business. Second is actually just a broader increase in list pricing on space and power, that is already rolling through, and on interconnection. And interconnection tends to perhaps have a slightly faster impact just because it's -- when things roll through, it's a little more dynamic, if you will, in terms of the way interconnection rolls through the business. So we're raising list prices there. And then as you know, escalators, and I think we will begin to reset escalators at levels that we think are more appropriate for the current environment and dynamics of the market. And so we are already looking at new contracts priced at new list price levels with new escalators, and that -- and as I said in the sort of prepared remarks, I said that the pricing impacts are largely unrealized. Meaning that what you saw in our guide today is not really being fueled by pricing. It is really being fueled by strength in unit volumes, firm pricing, certainly, in terms of how we're pricing, but that's really yet to roll through in terms of -- and I really think we'll start to see those positive pricing impacts in '23. Aryeh Klein : Got it. If I can just follow up, is there point at which the higher prices force companies to start to reevaluate their objectives around data center expansion and whatnot? Charles Meyers : Yes, it's a great question. Obviously, sort of what is the elasticity of demand and how elastic or inelastic is the demand is a question we constantly ask and answer. I would tell you that quite empirically, our evidence would demonstrate that our business is highly inelastic. And in fact, if you look at our interconnection pricing activity in Europe over the last couple of years, we saw a tremendous flow-through on that and very little implication from a churn perspective. And so -- and then the other thing I would -- we've looked hard at kind of where people are in terms of how much of their spend overall is tied up in Equinix as a key sort of point of nexus in their digital infrastructure strategy. And the reality is, is they're getting significant value for that investment. And adjustment in pricing on that has a relatively limited impact in their overall -- in the overall dynamic there. And so we're -- we absolutely want to deliver superior value. We think we can do that at higher price points and still deliver the value that is going to compel people to make Equinix a central part of their long-term architectures. Operator : And our next question is from David Barden with Bank of America. David Barden : I guess I have two kind of higher-level questions. Charles, a lot of the investor base hasn't really lived through the possibility of recession as it relates to data centers. And there's two big questions that we get. One is, will businesses kind of pull back on their data center budgets in a recession? And the second is, given all the IPOs we've seen, some of these companies, smaller companies, start to fail as we saw maybe back in 2001, '02. Is that going to create pressure for the data center business? And I guess, if I could ask a second question, maybe this one is for you, Keith. We obviously saw a well-regarded, short-selling investor come up with a thesis that said that the data centers have 2 problems. One is that they're going to end up competing with their biggest customers, and that's going to cannibalize the need for legacy data center businesses. And second, that it's not obvious the returns on the consolidated data center businesses are actually great. So I know you guys know the answers to those questions. So I would love to kind of just air those out and kind of hear what you guys are thinking now. Charles Meyers : Sure. David, I'll start, and I'll probably not be able to resist the chance to answer some of the second one, in addition. So -- and then -- but I'll hand it over to Keith. As for the broader question on recession and potential impact to the demand backdrop and in particular, around exposure to failures, business failures and weaknesses that, that might represent in either startups or those types of companies, as I said, right now, we're seeing no waning of demand relative to people's investment in digital transformation. In fact, I would argue, that I think as they look forward to a potential recessionary environment, many of them are using that either to try to reduce costs by modernizing their IT infrastructure and moving to hybrid and multicloud with greater agility in their IT footprint and architecture. Or they're using that as a fundamental driver of competitive advantage and therefore fuel to their top line, that I think they don't believe they can afford not to invest in. And you're seeing that in virtually every sector. You look at retail, for example, and that's a classic example of a sector that people are saying, oh, boy, recession could clearly impact consumer wallet spend and retail would suffer from that. Well, we are not seeing that show up in terms of their decision-making around their commitment to digital. They simply can't afford not to be prepared for the digital future. And so we see real strength in that sector. Same could be said for various elements of banking and financial services, which people say could feel some of the sting, and yet they continue to invest. And so every quarter, it seems that we give you a different set of sectors that are demonstrating strength in our business. And I think that's just a reflection of just how durable that demand profile is. And so we're keeping a close eye on it, but our previous experience in recessionary environments as well as the current pipeline would lead us to believe that demand continues to be strong. And frankly, we're investing behind that. We're going to be prudent and appropriate and watch it carefully. But we're going to put more quota-bearing heads on the street, given the level of demand that we're seeing in the business. As to startups, honestly, our exposure is relatively limited. Startups often start in cloud. And only as they scale, they move to hybrid infrastructures. And so we don't see a lot of exposure there. And we have not seen sort of business failures or pullback in those as any kind of meaningful contributor to the business. On the short thesis, I would just tell you that I think it represents an underdeveloped understanding of the data center market and the relative position of various players because I think that as I said -- as we said in the script in various ways, our relationship with the hyperscalers, which is a key part of that thesis, is significant, both in terms of our underlying contributions to their architecture in terms of network nodes, on-ramps, et cetera, as well as our alignment with them from a go-to-market perspective. Because we are -- in fact, they're amongst our most productive channel partners as they are selling large multimillion, sometimes multihundred, million-dollar contracts to players that are implementing cloud. Those customers want an answer to what they're going to do with their private infrastructure and how they're going to place that proximate to the multicloud and how it's going to perform. And those are the answers that we're providing. Those are the questions that we're providing the answers to. And so I think that we continue to feel like that this notion of us, sort of that this is a sort of a zero-sum game between us and the hyperscalers, I think, is just not an accurate view of the marketplace. And so -- and then on the broader returns, again, I would say, yes, our business is dramatically different on a return basis. Look at our same-store sales and look at the 28% cash-on-cash returns of those, growing at 7%, which is what we demonstrated this quarter. That is a very, very different story than virtually any other player in the industry can give you. So I couldn't resist stealing that question from Keith. But Keith, please feel free to add your two cents. Keith Taylor : David, maybe I could add just a couple of points to what Charles said, which is all very accurate. But the other thing I think is very important for, I think, our investors to appreciate is that we were very wise in our decisioning on how to manage the hyperscale relationships. We have the business that Charles alluded to that sits inside a retail business. And again, as the on-ramps, the aggregation knows the regional network gateways, and things are very critical to running their core infrastructure. But then there's the piece of the business that is substantial in scale and size, that we always chose not to do inside the retail business and instead set up a structure, which is our xScale business. And as we have just talked about, our xScale business is humming as well, given the momentum we're seeing. We have 11 builds underway. We're roughly 80% utilized across all the inventory, that we have not only built but are building or are leased, I should say. And so that puts us in a very good position. Also, to isolate it, in that we only have effectively 10% exposure on an equity basis to those investments. The other thing I think is important to note is these hyperscalers, they're looking for alternatives to -- other than self-build with others because we can do it in locations cheaper and faster than they could do it themselves. And I think it's a testament to the quality of our global design and construction teams. And then last part, I think, is really important to appreciate. A lot of these deals that are done, they're price to yield. And so the price to yield based on a cost model, prices aren't going down, and they're only going up. They're longer-term in nature, your price to yield, and I think it's a really important aspect of the contracting terms. And as a result, as I said at the Analyst Day last year, at maturity, the likelihood, the revenues associated with hyperscale for us represent about 1% to 2% of our top line and will represent a full maturity, again, assuming we spend that $8 billion, plus 3% to 5% of our AFFO. And so we feel that is very resilient, not only to the overall performance of our business, but it's also resilient to the price to yield strategy that you deploy when you contract under these arrangements. Charles Meyers : Well, and just to be clear, that last statement in terms of the percentage was relative to xScale. Our broader business with hyperscale is just meaningfully larger than that. It's a $1 billion-plus business outside of xScale run rate and growing nicely because we play a very critical role in that infrastructure in terms of what they do inside of our retail facilities around the world and because of our relationship with them on a go-to-market alignment perspective. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael Rollins : A couple of questions, if I could. First, just on power. If you can give a little bit more detail of what you're seeing in terms of not just power cost in Europe and other markets where there could be issues, but also power availability. And how should investors frame the risk of the supply side of the equation? And then just switching gears over to the change in the annual organic revenue growth guidance, can you give some additional details of as the -- you've seen that evolution in guidance over the last couple of quarters. Where is the relative strength coming from in terms of regions and/or verticals? Charles Meyers : Thanks, Mike. Again, I'll start, and Keith can add on here. Yes, obviously, we're super tuned-in to the overall energy situation globally, with a particular focus on Europe, given the uncertainty created by the war in Ukraine. And so -- and you're right, it's not just a cost question, which we're certainly tuned into, but also availability. So let me tackle them both a little bit. Not a lot new to add on the pricing, power cost situation. It is clearly going up in many markets around the world, and I think that's more evident and more acute in Europe. But we are well advanced in our hedging strategy for '23 already. And we are looking at kind of where we will be on that and then how we will pass that through to our customers. And we continue to feel -- have a high degree of confidence in our ability, both contractually and executionally to get that done. The question of availability is a little bit of a different one, and we know that that's on people's minds. And although we don't want to minimize the issues there, and there's clearly some level of risk that certain trade-offs really need to be made in some countries relative to how power will be allocated, we continue to feel really confident in our ability to maintain availability of our services to our customers. And let me tell you kind of why that is. There's really 3 different levels to the issue. And this relates particularly to the question around natural gas, potential implications to the Nord Stream availability and overall supply there. And so we think about it in kind of 3 levels. First one is will the grid be sort of constrained in its ability to deliver the amount of electricity required. And that's really a factor of, particularly as it relates to gas, a factor of 1, is the grid primarily or substantially gas-powered; and two, if it is gas-powered, how exposed is it to the potential shortfalls associated with particularly Russian supply. And what I would tell you is that, generally speaking, natural gas is the underlying source for just a fraction of the electricity generation across our EMEA portfolio. It ranges from almost 0 in the Nordics, to, call it, 30% of roundabout -- around there in the Netherlands, U.K., Turkey and Portugal. Then there's a second-level question though, which is in markets that are dependent, to some degree, on natural gas, how much of that is potentially at risk for -- in terms of Russian supply. And in that case, only the Netherlands and Turkey have more than a 25% dependency on Russian gas. So the composite is really -- the composite risk is really the product of those 2 things. And candidly, we feel like it's very manageable. So that's the first level, is will the electricity grid really be impacted by these things and fall short of its ability to deliver. The second-level question is, if that were to occur, which we think it has some chance of occurring, what will local governments and regulators do and how will they deal with power allocations. And on that level, we think that -- we're confident that we -- we think that those local regulators have a very deep understanding of the criticality of our facilities and that those are -- that our facilities are inherent to the proper functioning of the Internet, of the economy and candidly, to society at large. And we have these sort of critical infrastructure designations in these countries for that reason. And so we feel confident that we're going to continue to have continuity for Equinix data centers, to be a key area of focus for those folks and get the appropriate allocations accordingly. And then the last level of that question is even if all of that were to fall down, we have the resilience within our facilities in the event of any interruption or intermittency in electric supply. And so our facilities are designed with high degrees of redundancy. And our ability to manage through intermittent or even extended periods of interruption to grid availability is very strong. And our track record on delivering exceptional availability even in adverse circumstances like that is well known and I think, frankly, a testament to really the professionalism and preparedness of our team. So that's a lot, but it's -- we've been -- as you might imagine, it is a topic of significant energy and discussion and focus for us. And all in all, we feel, while it is a less than ideal situation in terms of rising costs and potential risk around availability, is one that we feel very well-positioned to manage. Michael Rollins : And just while we're on the topic of power, maybe before getting to the revenue question, just one other follow-up. Any update on Singapore, which is a larger discussion during the 4Q earnings call? Charles Meyers : Sure. Quick one, Mike. No real update. We -- it's coming in pretty much as we had expected. And again, that exposure in terms of what we're kind of eating, if you will, relative to Singapore, we think, will resolve itself going into 2023. And so no real update. It has some level of impact on our business from a margin perspective this year, but we believe that we can resolve that going into '23. Michael Rollins : And then just the regions and verticals of relative strength as you've increased your organic constant currency revenue growth guidance. Charles Meyers : Yes. I'll give you a quick two cents on that and then have Keith add to it. Look, it's -- our business is super diverse in terms of -- and all of our regions are performing well. Absolutely great quarter from Europe. Americas performance continues to be strong. And you saw APAC was our fastest grower, right? Now I expect that to be the case. I think that the overall dynamics of Asia are going to continue to allow it to lead there. But amazing performance in Europe, really strong across sectors. And again, I think we're seeing strength in -- this is really the ecosystem nature of our business. We're seeing strength both on the supply side, meaning all these service providers ramping their business to deliver services required for digital transformation and they're doing that at Equinix, and then the enterprise buyer really seeing nexus as that point of -- or seeing Equinix at this point of nexus to really house their hybrid IT infrastructure. And so the short answer is we're seeing it across regions and across sectors. Keith, what do you want to add there? Keith Taylor : Yes. And Mike, maybe just adding a couple of points to Charles' comments. When you look at our overall growth, we telegraphed above sort of Analyst Day guide and said that we can grow the business on a normalized and constant currency basis, so normalized, taking out the acquisitions by 10% to 11%. And of that 10% to 11% of growth, roughly 60 basis points is power -- roughly 60 basis points are power price increases that we sort of initiated at the beginning part of the year. So you can see that the core business is performing just phenomenally well. And the U.S., the Americas business specifically, is performing exceedingly well and growing at 10%, 11%. It just gives you a sense of the momentum. And it's across the verticals and it's in the markets that we're fueling basically the capacity. You can also see that we're building in 13 new projects -- there's 49 projects in total, and we call them major projects. There's much more than 49 projects underway, but 49 major projects underway, a number of -- 34 markets, I think, 21 countries. So we're building across the portfolio. And just as a reminder to everybody, the majority of our growth comes from the installed base. 90-plus percent of our bookings is coming from that installed base. And so despite the fact that we don't -- we're seeing the concentration decrease, but the dispersion increase. And that's just -- that's a phenomenal aspect of our business model. And that -- and then the last thing I would just say is our pricing has been strong. Again, another quarter of net positive pricing actions, notwithstanding all the comments that Charles made, which is those are things we'll see in the future, but the relationship of a price increase to a price decrease this quarter was 3.2:1. So for every $1 of decrease, we saw $3.2 of increase. So it gives you a sense of the momentum in our business. And then -- and you can't hide away from the fact that our digital services, they're performing at a very high clip, and that's adding to the overall business. So it's a combination of all these things that are giving you the positive momentum in revenues. Operator : And our next question is from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Jonathan Atkin : So you talked a lot about influences around the business, around strong demand and power costs, pricing increases. I wonder if you can maybe flesh out a few of the other kind of headwinds or tailwinds as we think about how to model the rest of this year or next year around churn and G&A and maybe any other items that you want to call out and then crystallize maybe kind of the net impact of how you see margins and AFFO per share trend into next year. Charles Meyers : Sure. Yes. I mean I think there's obviously a lot of levers in the business. I do think churn continues to be generally a good news story. I think we're seeing -- I think our level of sophistication we have in sort of understanding, modeling and being able to effectively manage churn has really improved dramatically over the years. And I think -- so we have -- we forecast virtually with pretty great precision, our churn, on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And so I think we see that as actually a continued positive story, and that's part of what's been contributing to the sort of record net bookings levels. I think G&A is an area of continued opportunity for us in the business. I think as we look at our hiring, for example, I said we're investing in the business in terms of driving quota-bearing heads into the market given the strong demand backdrop, but we're being very prudent as it relates to adding G&A. We think that's appropriate in this environment, and we're really kind of pulling the reins back, adding only where we feel that's absolutely critical and then also investing in some of the automation and simplification that we're looking for to drive efficiencies in the business. And I think that what we hope that, that will continue to do is give us progression over time towards that long-term target of 50%. And I think we're already seeing some of that. I think on the other side of it, there probably -- there are some headwinds, right? And utilities are part of that. The Singapore situation was fairly unique this year. We think that will resolve next year. But I do think that the broader utility situation as we -- as prices rise, even though I think our hedging strategy and then our pricing increases will allow us to recover that, I do think that some of the increases are going to be a bit more 0 calorie from a margin standpoint, and that is probably going to affect margins on a percentage basis. But I think that our focus is really on driving the top line and then getting the flow-through to AFFO per share. And I think that's what you're seeing in our guide, and that's what we're going to really continue to focus on. Keith Taylor : And Jon, let me add a couple of comments, just to Charles' comments as well. Again, you asked about the second half of the year. I think it's important to realize, number one, we -- Q2 had some xScale nonrecurring revenues in it. And so think about next quarter, that -- our nonrecurring revenues are going to go down about $10 million quarter-over-quarter. And then you should see them step back up in Q4. So that's one thing that's happening. Second thing is we're making an investment in the business. We're being very deliberate about committing to the top line, committing to the value on a per share basis and driving as hard as we can on that, but at the same time still making decisions about investing in the business. So Charles alluded to the quota-bearing heads. There's development costs, another $10 million of costs in the second half of the year that weren't in the first half of the year. There's some lease adjustments of $11 million that went -- that's going through the second half of the year, related to some Hong Kong leases. And then we're investing in T&E, another $15 million, because we think that's money well spent, getting our go-to-market engine in front of the customers as well as our teams working together, coming out of a post-COVID environment. So overall, I would say you're going to continue to see momentum in the business. The guide is the guide, but we're deliberately making investments to set ourselves up for a good 2023. And the last thing I think is really important to note. Look, absent the implications of currency, with 60% of our revenues residing outside of the U.S., it has an impact to us. But we know that, that will revert over some period of time. And so when we look at it is we're making -- we're putting -- placing our bets on our -- in our hedging strategies. We're doing all the things that you would expect us to do to try and give you the predictability and the forward-looking visibility. But by the same token, absent what we just -- we reported our revenues, we just hit it this quarter for $100 million because of the weakness in the non-U.S. currencies. When that goes back to more traditional levels, where other markets start to increase their interest rates, similar to what the U.S. is doing here to stave off inflation, you're going to see us recover that type of value. And the implications on revenue is $100 million, EBITDA is $50 million and AFFO is $42 million. You had $0.46 just this quarter alone. We're impacting the year's guidance by $0.46 just because of FX. And most of that is being recovered by better business performance. And so there's a number of things that we'll continue to talk about in Q3, Q4 and certainly as we spend time with you in February on the 2023 guide on these matters. Jonathan Atkin : That's very helpful. xScale had a strong leasing quarter. Are you pricing in line with the market? Or are you seeing a slightly different trend? Charles Meyers : Yes. I mean I think that, as we've said, xScale tends to be one where it's probably a narrower band in pricing. And so -- and it really -- pricing, I think, is dictated substantially more by supply/demand characteristics in any given market. And so I would say that we feel great about our ability to deliver a fantastic offering to those customers. But I would say it's -- it prices more -- market and xScale, I think, is going to price in a narrower band. Operator : And our next question is from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Frank Louthan : How many new logos did you sign in the quarter? And how has that been trending in the last few quarters? And in particular, what sort of verticals are you seeing the most strength with? Keith Taylor : Well, look, overall, there's roughly 300 new logos in the quarter. I think the exact number is 286. Is that -- anyway, so -- and as I said, we're seeing it -- look, a lot of the growth comes from the installed base, as you understand. But we're seeing it across the portfolio. We talked about content and digital media, cloud, IT services. It's really across the board. And it goes back to Charles' comments. And as companies start to progress with their digital transformation, all sort of paths lead to Equinix. And from our perspective, there's not -- anything and everything that you sort of look at, we have an opportunity to either we have won it or we are -- or we actually have it within our pipeline. And so I would say that it's hard to sort of pinpoint one thing because if we have the capacity, we have the ability to sell in that market. And one of my prepared comments was, in the emerging markets, what we call the growth in emerging markets out of Europe, we're seeing tremendous opportunity there. It was, again, a high-performing quarter for us. And these are sort of the, if you will, the secondary markets to our majors, our majors where we do $100 million or more. So it's really right across the board, both from a geographic perspective, from a vertical perspective and then certainly from a customer perspective. And it's the combination of all those that make us feel very, very good about what we're seeing in our pipeline and the amount of activity we saw this past -- really this past quarter, but we've had growth over the last 8 quarters in a row in our net bookings line. And so it tells you about the momentum, and this quarter wasn't off the charts, one. Last quarter was fantastic. This quarter was better than fantastic. Charles Meyers : Yes. I would add 2 more pieces of color around new logos, Frank. One, I would say, if you look at the nonfinancial metrics, it's -- we're in a relatively tight band on that. And -- but I think the one thing that gets lost in that a bit is the number of customers that come to us through channel partners. And so those don't show up in that because we actually booked that through the channel partner. And so that really masks, I think, some of the momentum we like to see, particularly in the broader enterprise market, where we're relying on some of our key partners around the world, whether that be an AT&T or an Orange or a Telstra or whatever, a variety of types of partners of ours that are bringing those customers to the table. And so I think that's something that's kind of lost there, but an area, and given the strength of our channel, I think that's continuing to add significantly. And then the other thing I would say is our success with what we refer to as STAR targets, these sort of the Global 2000-type companies that we're really focused on, good momentum there. In fact, we had a number of Global 2000 additions this quarter. And I think the team is just doing a fantastic job of helping those large, complex global multinationals really think through their strategies on the enterprise side. And then on the service provider side, virtually every enterprise there, a lot of them are becoming service providers, and we're helping them on that journey and because everything is going as a Service. And so I think we're seeing some real strength on that side as well. Chip Newcom : Thank you. This concludes our Q2 conference call. Operator : Goodbye. And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Katrina Rymill, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance and Sustainability You may begin. Katrina Rymill : Good afternoon, and welcome to today's conference call. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking in nature and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those statements and may be affected by the risks we have identified in today's press release and those identified in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 18, 2022 and 10-Q filed on July 29, 2022. Equinix assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or comment on forward-looking statements made on this call. In addition, in light of Regulation Fair Disclosure, it is Equinix' policy to not comment on financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. In addition, we will provide non-GAAP measures on today's conference call. We provide a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a list of the reasons why the company uses these measures in today's press release on the Equinix IR page at www.equinix.com. We have made available on the IR page of our website a presentation designed to accompany this discussion, along with certain supplemental financial information and other data. We would also like to remind you that we post important information about Equinix on the IR page from time to time and encourage you to check our website regularly for the most current available information. With us today are Charles Meyers, Equinix's CEO and President; and Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up in an hour, we would like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to just one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Katrina. Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We had another outstanding quarter as global demand for digital infrastructure continues to grow, and customer preferences trend convincingly toward architectures that are highly distributed, persistently hybrid, deeply cloud connected and increasingly on demand. All factors fueling the Equinix position as a trusted partner in digital transformation. This vigorous demand backdrop fueled another great quarter, delivering record gross and net bookings, with strong demand across all three regions, resulting in our 79th quarter of consecutive revenue growth and further demonstrating the resiliency and durability of our business, even in the face of a complex and challenging macro environment. It is increasingly evident that the global pandemic has been a catalyst for a fundamental shift in how customers view digital transformation and its importance as a strategic imperative. And this commitment to digital transformation continues even in the face of a broader dynamic of belt tightening, as companies look to do more with less and see digital as a catalyst to both maximize revenues and optimize costs. While we continue to closely monitor macro conditions and adapt our execution accordingly, the fundamentals of our business remain exceptionally strong. Our expansive global reach and robust interconnected ecosystems continue to attract a wide and diverse customer set as they prioritize digital investments, and embrace platform Equinix as a point of nexus to support hybrid and multi cloud. This wave of digital infrastructure demand and our highly differentiated value proposition are translating to a robust pipeline, a highly favorable pricing environment and low churn, all fueling record performance across the business year-to-date and setting us up for a strong trajectory as we look to 2023 and beyond. As customers navigate rising interest rates and broad based inflation, they're benefiting from our scale purchasing power and our sophisticated capabilities in hedging, risk management and sustainability. Our operating scale and scope give us a variety of levers to manage an increasingly dynamic environment, hedging currency, power and interest rates, investing in advanced procurement teams, expanding renewables coverage and taking a programmatic approach to improving the efficiency of our world-class data centers, an advanced set of capabilities supported by a strong and flexible balance sheet. Specifically, on power, we have had a keen focus in this area and continue to feel confident in our position. Our approach to multiyear hedging is affording Equinix the visibility and predictability to communicate to customers in advance of expected power price increases, and is allowing us to deliver cost points to customers that remain highly favorable against spot rates in many markets, as volatility persists. While our aim remains to dampen this volatility for our customers through hedging, we do expect meaningful increases in power costs in many markets, and per our contracts, the full impact of these additional power costs will be passed on to customers. Overall, we believe we remain in a good position relative to competitors and the broader market. Turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3. Revenues for Q3 were $1.84 billion, up 11% over the same quarter last year, driven by strong recurring revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA was up 11% year-over-year with AFFO meaningly -- meaningfully ahead of our expectations due to strong operating performance. Interconnection revenues continue to outpace the broader business growing 13% year-over-year. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Equinix continues to extend its leadership as the most interconnected platform with four on-ramp wins this quarter, bringing the total in our portfolio to more than 200 on-ramps across 44 markets. We now have 11 metros across platform Equinix enabled with on-ramps from all five of the leading cloud providers. No other competitor has more than one. In addition to placing critical networking nodes in on-ramps at Equinix, hyperscalers are also integral to our go-to-market notion as customers continue to aggressively migrate workloads to the cloud and demand cloud proximity for their own private cloud implementations. As indicated in our recently published Global Interconnection Index, current trend lines indicate that more than 80% of Global 2000 companies will be interconnecting with more than four hyperscale providers and over 30 SaaS providers or other business partners, on average by 2026. We're continuing to invest behind the momentum we're seeing in our data center services business with 46 major projects underway across 31 markets in 21 countries. We continue to build capacity under our xScale offering, including 10 ongoing xScale projects that we expect will deliver another 80 megawatts of capacity once opened. This quarter, we added six new projects, including new data center builds in Barcelona, Tokyo and our first organic build in Jakarta, Indonesia. Our new IBX in Jakarta will add a strategically important high-growth market to our platform, as we look to enable local businesses and global organizations to unleash Indonesia's digital potential. This commitment to market leading reach continues to drive our business with customers operating in all three regions, now accounting for an amazing 64% of our recurring revenues. Key customer expansions this quarter included StackPath, a leading edge computing platform provider, which expanded into Dubai and Mumbai to support the growth of its worldwide edge compute delivery and security offerings. A win with a global multinational airline leveraging Equinix to connect to their federated ecosystem of partner airlines, as well as a significant multi metro expansion with one of the world's largest custodian banks, deploying across all three regions and utilizing the full suite of Equinix digital services. On that note, our digital services portfolio saw continued momentum as companies increasingly demand infrastructure and interconnection services that can be delivered as a service and on demand. Equinix Metal had a strong bookings quarter as customers leverage flexibility and agility across multiple metros. Wins this quarter included a major design win with a global SaaS provider and a significant expansion with a leading pediatric treatment and research facility using Network Edge and Equinix fabric to create an edge hosting environment in key U.S. metros and enable seamless and high-performance connectivity to their cloud partners. In Q3, we added an incremental 7,300 interconnections and now have over 443,000 total interconnections on our platform. Equinix Fabric had another strong quarter as interconnection diversity continues to increase. Expansions this quarter included Colt Technology Services, further expanding its footprint in Europe and interconnectivity with Equinix Fabric to optimize performance for its customers, as well as the financial software tools and enterprise applications provider implementing a global network optimization project leveraging Equinix Fabric. Internet Exchange saw peak traffic up 8% quarter-over-quarter and 28% year-over-year to greater than 27 terabits per second, representing the largest peak traffic growth since prior to the pandemic. Our channel program delivered a six consecutive record quarter accounting for 37% of bookings and approximately 60% of new logos, and remains a critical vector in how we are expanding our reach and scaling our go-to-market engine. We continue to see particular strength from strategic cloud technology and systems integrator partners like AWS, Cisco, Dell, Google HPE, Infosys and Microsoft. This segment accounted for approximately half of our channel bookings, and continues to grow in both deal dollar -- deal and dollar volume. With these partners, we jointly offer a blend of IT and networking technologies that will allow customers to interconnect seamlessly with hyperscale cloud and other as a service providers, and benefit from solutions that deliver optimal performance, cost, security agility and scale across our global platform. Channel wins included a U.K insurance firm with Equinix Partner Softcat for a data center consolidation and modernization project at our London campus where technology elements from HPE, Cisco and Palo Alto Networks are being brought together in a cloud adjacent architecture, all directly interconnected to Microsoft and AWS. Now, let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results for the quarter. Keith Taylor : Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. As you can see from our results, the Equinix team continues to execute for our customers, our communities and for our investors. Our go-to-market engine delivered record gross and net bookings in Q3, closing over 4,200 deals with more than 3,000 customers. Our success is derived from the breadth of our service offerings, the scale of our growing platform, the quality of our operations organization and the focus of our investing for the longer term. For the quarter, our net bookings performance moved up significantly, both compared to our Q3 expectations and the same quarter last year due to strong growth activity, a favorable pricing environment, lower-than-expected churn and the strength of our digital services offerings. Again, we had net positive pricing actions. Consequently, our consolidated MRR per cabinet increased to greater than $2,000 per cabinet despite the weaker foreign operating currencies. And note the expected price increases or PPI discussed by Charles are not in either are reported or are guided numbers. These price increases will be passed through to our customers in 2023. Over the past couple of months, we've been communicating with our customers about the pending power price increases. And most recently, we've notified them of the expected range of their power cost increase at the market level. The dialogue with our customers highlighted the value of our multiyear power planning and sourcing efforts, which is expected to meaningfully dampen the impact of inflated energy costs to many of our customers, both relative to the competition and the broader market. Finally, notwithstanding of strong bookings performance in Q3, our forward looking pipeline remains healthy. And our backlog and our book-to-bill interval remains constant, allowing us to remain confident as we look ahead into Q4 and plan for 2023. So given the momentum in our business, we're again raising our underlying guidance across each of our core financial metrics for the year. Now, while our business remains well-positioned and resilient, we continue to keep macro factors top of mind. Consequently, we chose to increase the liquidity position of the company. At quarter end, we had over $2.5 billion of unrestricted cash in our bank accounts, and full access to our $4 billion line of credit, increasing the financial and operational flexibility of the business. Our net leverage remains low at 3.5x our adjusted EBITDA, creating plenty of balance sheet flexibility. Now let me cover the highlights for the quarter. Note that all comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, Global Q3 revenues were $1.841 billion, up 11% over the same quarter last year, above the top end of our guidance range on an FX neutral basis, largely due to strong recurring revenues. Q3 through revenues net of our FX hedges included a $9 million impact when compared to our prior guidance rates, largely due to weaker euro and British pounds. Global Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $871 million or 47% of revenues, up 11% of the same quarter last year, above the top end of our guidance range due to strong cash flows profit and lower than planned operating costs, including professional fees and consulting costs. Q3 adjusted EBITDA net of our FX hedges included a $5 million FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates, and $4 million of integration costs. Global Q3 AFFO was $712 million, above our expectations due to strong operating performance and lower net interest expense and included a $5 million FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 MRR churn was 1.9%, a continued reflection of our disciplined sales execution to put the right customer with the right application into the right asset. For Q4, we expect MRR churn to continue to trend at the lower end of our 2% to 2.5% per quarter range. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC was the fastest growing region on a year-over-year normalized MRR basis at 19%, followed by the Americas and EMEA regions at 11% and 10%, respectively. The Americas region had another great quarter of a strong gross bookings, lower MRR churn and favorable pricing trends led by our Washington DC and New York metros. In August we added Lima, Peru to our platform as part of the Entel acquisition expanding our Latin American footprint, our fifth country and extending the Equinix platform to 32 countries and 71 markets globally. Our EMEA region delivered another record bookings quarter with strong pricing and robust channel activity, led by our Amsterdam, Dublin and Frankfurt markets with strength in our IT services and enterprise verticals. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a strong quarter with robust exports from Japan. As part of our future-first sustainability strategy, we're very proud to announce a partnership with the Center for Energy Research and Technology at the National University of Singapore to explore sustainable technologies and alternate fuel sources for data center infrastructure. And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our balance sheet increased slightly despite the weaker non-U.S operating currencies to $29.3 billion, including an unrestricted cash balance of $2.5 billion. Our cash balance increased quarter-over-quarter due to strong operating cash flow, and about $800 million of ATM activity settled in the quarter. As stated previously, we'll continue to take a balanced and opportunistic approach to accessing the capital markets when conditions are favorable. On the debt side of the house, on the heels of the rating upgrades from both Fitch and Moody's last quarter, S&P increased their debt tolerance for the company by one leverage turn, thereby increasing the level of flexibility from our balance sheet. We're pleased and appreciative of the rating improvements over the past quarters. I look forward to our continued dialogue with our rating agencies. Turning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $553 million, including a recurring CapEx of $50 million. In the quarter, we opened 6 retail projects in Istanbul, Madrid, Manchester, Melbourne, Paris and Toronto, and 2 xScale projects in Frankfurt and London. We also purchase land for development in Monterrey, Mexico. Our capital investments deliver strong returns as shown on Slide 10. A 160 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 7% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are now collectively 88% utilized, and generate a 29% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for a updated summary of 2022 guidance and bridges, including the anticipated financial results from the Entel, Peru purchase. For the full year 2022, due to strong momentum that we're seeing in the organic business, we now expect our revenues to increase between 10% and 11% on a normalizing constant currency basis over the prior year. Relative to our prior guidance, we're increasing our underlying revenues by $15 million due to strong recurring revenue performance. We expect 2022 underlying adjusted EBITDA that increased by $46 million compared to our prior guidance due to strong revenue performance and more operating spend. We now expect to incur $20 million of integration costs in 2022. We're raising our underlying 2022 AFFO by $52 million to grow between 10% and 11% on a normalized and constant currency basis, due to strong operating performance, and lower net interest expense. And as a result, our AFFO per share is now expected to grow between 9% and 10% on a normalized and constant currency basis, above the top end of our prior guide, including the impact from our Q3 ATM activity. Finally, 2022 CapEx is now expected to range between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion, including about $190 million of recurring CapEx and about $135 million of on balance sheet xScale spin, down slightly due to timing of expansion spent. So let me stop here. I'm going to turn the call back to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Keith. Our results this quarter continue to reflect strong execution by our global team and highlight the unique position that Equinix enjoys in facilitating digital transformation. As we continue to deliver exceptional business results, I want to also highlight our significant progress in advancing our future-first sustainability commitments. This quarter, in addition to our continued investments and commandments around the environmental sustainability, we're very pleased to have launched the Equinix Foundation, an employee-driven charitable organization working to advance digital inclusion through philanthropic grant making and strategic partnerships. The foundation reflects our ongoing commitment to social sustainability. And we're excited about the work we can do to build a better, more inclusive, more sustainable world, harnessing and amplifying the passion of our people to help close the digital divide in our communities across the globe. As we advance Q4 and position for 2023, our highly differentiated position continues to drive strong momentum, robust customer demand and a deep, high quality pipeline. We're delivering sustained growth at the top line and AFFO per share, while maintaining our clear focus on driving operating leverage across our business. We continue to effectively exercise multiple growth levers including expanded market reach, enhancement of our product portfolio, accelerated new logo capture through our multi channel go-to-market engine, pricing adjustments that reflect our exceptional value, and a commitment to a bold innovation and sustainability agenda, all of which demonstrates the resilience of Platform Equinix and highlights our ability to deliver distinct and durable value to our customers and our shareholders. So let me stop there and open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jon Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead. Your line is open. Jonathan Atkin : Thanks. Got two questions on energy. One is, Keith, if you could maybe refresh us on what portion of cash OpEx this quarter was for energy? And then on the PIs that you're pushing through starting next year, can you talk a little bit about to what extent it applies to customers that are in the middle of their contracts versus renewables and new contracts? Thanks. Keith Taylor : So, Jon, I'll take the first one, I think I'll pass the second one to Charles. It's roughly 13%. Again, it moves around quarter-on-quarter and it's also dependent on,-in some cases, the currency movements. But for this year, you should see the range anywhere sort of from 12% to 13% on a per revenue dollar basis. Charles Meyers : Yes. And on the PIs, Jon, the -- look, the way our contracts reads, we're not impaired in any way from putting those through -- during the -- of course, the contract. So they're not limited to when you take renewals. So just sort of backup and give you a view on, we talked a little bit about it in the script, but I think that we will give you details, more details when we do the '23 guide. But I think thanks to some really incredible work by our teams, we feel really good about where we are on that -- on the PI issue and on power generally. I think we're about 90%-plus, or more than -- well over 90% hedged in our deregulated markets, and we're going to be topping off those positions in the coming weeks and months. And we've already communicated those planned increases to customers, and are generally able, as Keith mentioned in his script, they will provide them with cost points that are meaningfully advantageous relative to current spot in those markets. So, I think we're going to -- we're in a really good position there. I think we're going to be able to pass a few. Obviously, they're not yet passed through, because we're still operating at our hedge rates from this year. But as they adjust, we've given them the advanced visibility to what they expect to see. And I think broadly speaking, they knew it was coming. And I think in a lot of cases, they're pleased to see that it's not quite as bad as they had feared it might be. Jonathan Atkin : And if I could ask a little bit about cloud, we saw slowing growth at two of the three largest CSPs, not just percentage, but even in terms of like incremental revenue dollars. And I wondered what does it mean for your business in terms of maybe affecting the pace of cloud repatriation? And more broadly, as you look at your cabinet adds, how much of that would you attribute to things like Cloud Repatriation versus new logos versus just existing customers upsizing maybe talk a little bit about those moving parts? Charles Meyers : Yes, Jon, I do think Cloud Repatriation does happen, but I think it's probably getting more airtime than maybe it's -- it really is appropriated. I mean, I think we're still very early in the movement of clouds from traditional IP architectures into cloud. And that's what we continue to see and well, I recognize, we did see some slowdown from the cloud providers : one, that was impacted significantly by currency. And two, I think a lot of it has -- as I look through those reports, and heard that was sort of reductions in usage base volume, what are likely sort of non-mission critical workloads. And so, I think that -- as I talked to CIOs, their commitment to moving to cloud-based architectures, their commitment to moving significant percentages of their overall workloads to public cloud, and then integrating that with private cloud infrastructure that needs to be cloud proximate is still full tilt. And, in fact, I talked to a CIO that said that they had -- just a Fortune 200 type CIO, but they had an application estate that was 4,000-plus applications. And when I asked him how many of those had been migrated to cloud, it was in the range of 200. And so a long way to go. And so, if you look at the -- just the quantum of growth that's happening in the cloud, in any given quarter, they're adding just the top five providers or adding $3 billion to $4 billion of incremental recurring revenue. And so I think it is still a long way to go. And I think that we continue to be particularly relevant as people think about the way things used to work in IT architectures, they all live nicely together in a rack next to each other in an enterprise data centre. Well, as soon as you start migrating workloads to the cloud and then trying to interface them with your data and applications that you're still managing on your own, things don't work quite the same. And that's what we're seeing in our pipeline, people are saying, hey, I've got to have my hybrid, my private cloud proximate. It's got to be distributed. The applications all have to work together. And so I think we're still going to continue to see vigorous demand for this migration to hybrid and multi cloud for the foreseeable future. Operator : Our next question is from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead. Your line is open. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. Good evening. Just a couple if I could. Just continuing on, it's great to hear that strong demand trends, are you seeing any softness anywhere, any kind of whether it's Europe or whatever? One of your competitors talked about small enterprise is on pressure at the margin there. It seems like -- there's certainly some caution around the uncertain and macro environment. And if you put through some of these power price increases, does that change some of the profitability dynamics for some of these companies? And then just on margin, some really good performance I saw in, particularly in the Americas this quarter. Maybe you can update us on the 50% target and how Singapore is playing out as we exit 2022? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Sure. There's a lot there, Simon. But let me try to cover it. And if I forget any of it, just bring it back up. But any softness, look, we are not blind to sort of the challenging macro conditions in which we're all operating, that's for sure. But I would say that our bookings trajectory, our sales execution, our pipeline, quality of pipeline, volume of pipeline, all continue to be very solid. And that is across regions, and it is across sectors. And I think that the phenomenon that I was just describing an answer to Jon's question is an exceptionally horizontal one. People just moving to these new cloud-first hybrid IT architectures and I think seeing the relevance of Equinix in that. And so, are there customer segments or types that are having more challenges? That we could get that question a lot. I do think that we're less exposed to either startups or small company, that's typically not our sweet spot of our business. We're really more on enterprise level, both service provider and enterprise architectures, and how people are rethinking those globally. And so we continue to see a strong level of demand. And so, I think we're less exposed to that, perhaps, and then maybe public cloud providers and others that on small or startup type businesses that might be impacted. In terms of power and Europe, generally, I would say our European business is performing very well. And yes, we do expect that power is going to -- and again, it hasn't yet impacted that. We haven't rolled those through. One, a couple of comments on that. One, our history is that we've rolled pricing through in interconnection. In fact, if you look at the non-financial metrics, we've increased MRR per cab in Europe, $100 over the last four quarters. And that's driven by interconnection pricing, that's driven by mix of business, et cetera, but the European business is performing very well. I do think it will create a pinch for people that they're going to have to pay for more for power. But just put that into context, we think that a lot of our customers are going to see monthly increases that are really modest dependent on how concentrated they are in highly impacted markets. But we think that even in worst cases, where people are in a high impact market, they might be impacted by, call it, 15% to 20% of their monthly bill. And so, for most people, we don't believe that is something that will impact their overall commitment to their digital transformation. But it does create, and we think -- so we think that we're going to -- to be able to continue to sustain the demand levels that we're seeing. And then the last piece on margin. Again, we're kind of what we would expect we were actually slightly ahead in Q3, of where our expectations would have been. And Singapore is actually slightly better than what we expected for the full year. But thankfully that's sort of coming to an end. This is the last quarter where we'll see that. I think we'll be able to now make the adjustments that we needed to make in terms of passing through the appropriate price increases in full, in the markets impacted beginning in 2023. As I said, I think we're going to be able to do that in a way that customers, even though they're certainly not going to applaud those price increases, I think, as they look at it, in a lot of those markets, they're feeling it as consumers and they're feeling at a very acute level. And I think they're going to realize -- they're starting to realize what I think the benefits of our hedging programs are in terms of dampening that volatility for them. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you so much. Keith Taylor : And, Simon, let me just add a couple of other quick points, if I may in addition to what Charles said. First and foremost, the objective to get to 50% margin targets, as sort of Charles alluded to, we're doing better than we anticipated in the Americas. Singapore is better than anticipated. And overall, we're running the business with a great deal of discipline. And I say that with emphasis. And so number one, we're seeing margin profile that's better than you might have otherwise anticipated. Two, when you sort of look into the fourth quarter, we're making some discretionary decisions to accelerate costs into the fourth quarter. But after that we continue to drive the business with greater efficiency. As it relates to the 50% EBITDA margin target, just I've said this on a number of -- in a number of non-deal roadshows, and one-on-one discussions with investors. We're not shifting our emphasis to 50% EBITDA. We believe that we can get there. In fact, the performance of the business post the Analyst Day, we're actually doing better than we thought than we anticipated at that point in time. But you've got a very volatile and fractious market. And so we got to deal with the consequences there. But if you look at it from a value on a per share basis, we are as good, if not better than we told you we are going to be. And so I think that's really important. And then the last thing I just want to leave you with is to sort of an adjunct to what -- again, what Charles said. The whole dialogue around small customers, in part of the reason that we disclose in our prepared remarks, the amount of transactions we did it to give you a sense of just the volume of activity. And so we did 4,200 transactions, again, with 3,000 customers. As we said in the last quarter, our pipeline is as strong as it's ever been. And in fact, I said it was healthy this quarter. It's actually we -- our pipeline is bigger this quarter than it was last quarter. And so we're really optimistic about the business and where we position ourselves and we can continue to drive value into the overall equation. And again, we're long-term focused, we want to drive value into the investor and we're very much focused on AFFO per share. Simon Flannery : Right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Rollins from Citi. Go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Rollins : Hi, good afternoon. First, on the stabilized constant currency revenue growth 7% year-over-year, can you unpack that in terms of what was driving the strength between whether it was utilization, just overall pricing, interconnection, et cetera? And then, second topic is on capital allocation. And just curious in the wake of higher rates, if you're considering any changes to the pace and breadth of the development strategy. And as the AFFO dollars are approaching the combination of non-recurring CapEx and the cash dividends, what does Equinix want to do with the balance sheet flexibility that you were describing earlier in the call? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Yes, I'll let Mike to -- I mean now let Keith take second part of that, Mike, and then let me talk a little bit about stabilized assets. And you can talk a little bit more on the balance sheet side and rates et cetera. But the -- look, it was a tremendous quarter obviously on stabilized assets. 7% is particularly strong. There is still a little bit of juice in there on the Singapore piece, but it was -- but it's definitely even without that significantly above kind of where we've been trending. And I think it's kind of a combination of all those factors that you're seeing pricing at interconnection, utilization, power density, all of those things probably really playing in. So -- and I think you're starting to now see the beginnings of seeing price actions. You're not seeing the PPIs, the power price increases, because those will roll through in '23. But as we've talked about, we are -- we've already adjusted list pricing on a number of our products. You're starting to see that roll through in renewals, and you're seeing it on other products that are around interconnection, et cetera. And so I think you're starting to see that as you saw, broadly speaking, utilization is trending up nicely. In fact, if you look over the last four quarters, EMEA and APAC are both up 5%. And so Europe is down about 2%, but a lot of capacity added in that region, right? And so I think we're continuing to get more out of the assets that we've deployed, continuing to feel very good about the pricing environment, continuing to dense people up driving good commercial decisions. And I think that's really showing up in the stabilized assets. We also had a couple of retired assets, that in there, they're probably also further ramp. And then the last piece, I would say is churn continue to trend. We haven't talked a lot about that. But boy, I think we've always said, look, the right to -- get the right customer, right application, right asset, that's the way to drive churn down. And I think we've seen that affect over the last -- many quarters, and continue to feel really good about that. We had obviously elevated levels to churn in the Verizon assets, which I think was really impacting our stabilized asset performance for a period of time, and have now really come through the back end of that really nicely. And I think feel really good about -- I candidly, I'm like -- I'm not sure that current level is, that's a little above the range that we've typically guided you guys to, but we will certainly take it and are pleased with the performance. Keith Taylor : And, Michael, just going to the -- maybe just a couple of things. One of the things that you've probably noted in our same-store reporting in the earnings deck is you can see that a lot of the value on a stabilized basis is coming from colocation and interconnection. In fact, interconnection on a stabilized basis is up 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, whereas colocation is up 7%. It's been diluted a little bit by the other services, which is only up 5%. And then nonrecurring is down quarter-over-quarter largely because of the one-off nonrecurring fees that we get from the xScale business. But overall, you're seeing the strong -- just to validate what all that Charles said, it's just you can see it in that slide just perfectly. As it relates to the balance sheet, if you wouldn't mind, I would like you to reframe the question just one last time. I want to make sure we get it right and respond to. So could you just ask that question again on where we are vis-\u00e0-vis our capital allocation? Michael Rollins : Yes, thanks. And it was two parts. First, if you're considering any changes to the pace and breadth of your development strategy in the wake of higher rates. And then as the AFFO dollars are approaching the combination of the nonrecurring CapEx and the cash dividend, what do you want to do with the flexibility on the balance sheet that you were describing earlier in the call? Keith Taylor : Yes. So thank you on that. So first and foremost, I think we fancy ourselves as pretty darn good capital allocators. We -- also we want to invest in the highest returning investment we can make as in the organic business, and we're going to continue to focus on that. No surprise, this quarter, we have 46 projects currently underway across 31 markets in 21 countries. So we remain very active and we want to continue to grow and expand the business horizontally. At the same time investing quite openly on the vertical side of the investment, which is digital services. So you're going to see a combination of the two and as we look into 2023 we will give you more guide on that. But suffice it to say that we -- there is an appetite to continue to invest in the business. And we really get to enjoy the cash flows we generate in the business, and low payout ratio to basically self fund that for all intents and purposes. So I feel extremely good about that. As you look forward, then, again, we are trying a little bit excess cash right now. We saw an opportunity in the market, in the quarter, pardon me, to pull down a little bit of our ATM. And so we settled some stuff that we did in Q2 this quarter. And then we also we sold some in the quarter in and of itself at 690 -- I think the average was $697 a share. And so we chose to do that because we knew we're going into periods of volatility. And we wanted to make sure that we could fully effect the use of our cash flow and invest in the long-term growth of business, which is really an expansion capital, while also investing in digital services. So that's what you're going to continue to hear us talk about. And then we're also being very judicious about -- I've spoken quite openly about we want to raise more debt even in the current environment. But the question is, where do we source that debt from? And can we take advantage of different markets around the world based on prevailing cost to borrow? That's all -- you'll hear more about that. But suffice it to say, I think you'll see more debt activity over the coming quarters than otherwise. You'd see with ATM. And then just as it relates to investment and capital, yes, I know the cost of capital is moving up. But we -- the benefit of our model is and for all the reasons you just heard Charles speak about, we get a really good return on our assets, our stabilized assets are getting 29% on them and on a gross PP&E invested. So anytime we increment that, knowing that we're keeping our costs well in check here, that you're going to get a nice incremental return. And so from our perspective, we're not arbitraging over our cost of capital. We're driving real value into the business for our customers and for the future. And as a result, we want to continue to make that investment. And we'll be very wise about what we raise in the form of capital to fund our growth, knowing that you've got a dividend that's growing, and you've got a business that's growing. And as a result, we got to fund not only the business and also the capital redeployment back to the investor. So I think it's a great question you're asking. We spent a lot of energy on it. I've got a fantastic treasury team that work underneath us. And we're looking at all ways to source our capital and fund value on a per share basis to the business. And so stay tuned. Charles Meyers : Mike, the -- you guys are pushing a lot of the buttons here. So I want to offer an anecdote that I think is really powerful. And that is kind of when I'm out and talking to customers and with sales teams, it's pretty amazing. Because what I hear from sales teams, their number one concern, not enough capacity. They're like -- we're worried, we're going to run out of capacity we need, are you building more capacity? I'm not hearing, hey, what are you going to do to my quota is next year? We know the answer to that question. I'm not hearing, hey, passing through these power increases is challenging. What I'm hearing is, we need more capacity, we need to continue to invest in the business. When are we going to get more coverage on digital services, I want to cover more markets. We need to respond to our customers' needs. And so, I think it's just a reflection, we\u2019re pushing utilization up, that's starting to create some pinch points. And so, from our perspective, as we look at how the business is performing, continue to invest in organic growth prudently and appropriately. And always in with a keen eye on the macro environment. It's still best and highest and best use for us. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from David Barden from Bank of America. Go ahead. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. This is [indiscernible] for Dave. Just, Charles, maybe just on those comments that you just made in terms of building out more capacity. Are you seeing any issues just similar to what's going on in Northern Virginia and other areas of the world of power transmission issues or power procurement issues? Charles Meyers : Yes, it's a great question. The answer is, yes. I mean, I think you're seeing that. Markets around the world are thinking about how to allocate energy. They're also thinking about the sustainability impacts of data centers in their markets, and how they want to sort of -- how they want to think about providing energy and permitting to support those, et cetera. So obviously, that's a key area of focus for us. I do think that overall, we're in a very good position. I think that not only do we have really well established relationships across those markets, we have a level of commitment. And I think specification on the sustainability side, that people I think feel comfortable that we are going to make the commitments necessary to support digital transformation in their markets, and digital growth in their markets in a way that's responsible. And so I think that's going to continue to be a differentiation for us. But we could -- and the other thing is, is that our market -- or our business and our business model are very different when it comes to power. They need to support, for example, a hyperscale facility that's going to support one or two customers and allocating that power entirely to those is very different than the power situation we find ourselves in. We have a much greater level of flexibility in terms of looking at how we're using power, moving a power around over time. And so I think there's some additional flexibility for us there. But the short answer is, yes, that is a dynamic that I think is not unique to Northern Virginia. We feel very good about where we are in that market, by the way, just in terms of our position there. But it is something that I think is going to be on people's minds. And I think we're -- on the capacity question, we're even seeing that churn -- people who were planning churn are now unplanning it. And because I think they feel like they -- that had an ensuring that they have capacity and sometimes under existing terms, or something that is close to those existing terms is a strategic decision for them. And I think we're continuing to see favorability in churn for those reasons. Unidentified Analyst : Perfect, thank you. And then maybe if I could just ask one more. Just you completed Entel and then you announced a smaller deal on Latin America. Do you just kind of walk us through the Latin America strategy and where you kind of see that, that business going? Charles Meyers : Sure. Generally, I would say that we feel like that the Chile edition with Entel was our strategic one that sort of fills out the LatAm portfolio in a really powerful way. And so I think we feel good about the level of coverage that we have there. That's not to say there wouldn't be potentially incremental opportunities there. But our businesses in Brazil -- our business in Brazil continues to thrive. Obviously, current -- market currency wise, it can be challenging and has been for years. But the growth there has been really strong, and our differentiated position in that market continues to be very good. So I think that continue to invest in that business. We're happy with the early returns on our business in Mexico. As Keith said, we've made some investments there for land and continue to see that as a -- with additional market opportunity there. Excited about the early returns. And that's one of the things we see on these businesses. We underwrite them to a certain level of performance. And almost always we're seeing that the power of bringing those assets into our channel -- our channel, broadly speaking mean, our direct teams and our partners and giving them access to those, we are hit -- we're really typically hitting bookings velocities that are much better than what we underwrote too. And so, we feel good about that. But yes, I think we feel good about LatAm. I think there's potentially incremental opportunity. But if I were to prioritize where I think we were more likely to make incremental M&A activity, it would be in probably maybe some other parts of the world. And we've talked about those in a variety of places. Southeast Asia, I think is continuing to reshape a bit and is a market that both organically and potentially through M&A, we would find attractive. India is a market that I think we will continue to invest in organically and potentially inorganically. And obviously, we've got a starting point in Africa that we are very excited about. But there's more potentially to do there. So I think that's -- I kind of went a little beyond your question there, but that's a little bit of a frame on the M&A world. Unidentified Analyst : That's great. Thanks so much, Charles. Operator : Next question is from Aryeh Klein from BMO Capital Markets. Go ahead. Your line is open. Aryeh Klein : Thank you. Maybe following up on churn, it's been low for a while here, as we move into potentially tougher macro and you ask customers to absorb kind of the forefront [ph] to the price increases. Is that something that, that you would expect to tick up? Charles Meyers : No. So, I mean, we really don't see that. I think that we' ve seen : one, I think the history of our business and this is a pretty empirically validated is that our demand tends to be pretty inelastic. And so I think that's likely to be particularly true relative to the power price increases, which I believe in hope will be at least to some degree, transitory. Now, whether or not we get back to energy level pricing levels that were -- we were at before, I don't know. But I think that -- I don't -- we don't currently see that as a driver for people to say, oh, well, we're going to churn out of our capacity. So I think it increases the level of focus that people have on efficient utilization of the capacity they have deployed. And I think they see that same dynamic a little bit in cloud, right, which is people are saying, hey, we got to tighten up on our cloud bills, we got to -- we're going to reduce usage on non-mission critical workloads. And I think you're seeing some of that impact in that business. Our business is much more on fixed contracts. We're starting -- we have a little bit of usage based revenue in some of our digital services. But I don't foresee us ticking up in churn in any meaningful way as a result of sort of the pricing adjustments. I think that we're going to continue to see people very committed to their digital transformation. I think like -- that will be an element of inflationary forces that our customers are going to deal with, much like we and every other company is dealing with out there. But I think it boils down to kind of how you -- what priorities you place, and we really feel like digital transformation, and the move to hybrid and multi cloud is, as I -- as we said in the script, both a revenue maximizing driver and a cost driver, in many cases, in terms of doing more with less. So we feel like the demand profile is going to continue to be strong. And again, our ability to forecast churn has been very, very good. And so we're not going into that blind. We continue to have confidence there. But we'll have to continue to monitor very, very closely and see how the market responds. But I think our history and an empirical data would indicate that we have a market that's pretty inelastic from a demand perspective. Aryeh Klein : Thanks. And then, Keith, I think you mentioned some of the timing related to some spending during the quarter. Looking at Q4, the margin for the quarter are towards the lower than they've been in a long time, the implied margin. How should we think about the spending in the fourth quarter and how that may be carried into 2023? Keith Taylor : Well, yes, as I said in the prepared remarks, there's an element of discretionary spend that we accelerated in the quarter. I think of that in the $20 million to $30 million range, and then you've got a pretty long range in the -- and then -- in the quarterly guide. So I would say, like, look at the underlying performance, you've got some seasonal costs to that, that sort of take place in the fourth quarter that we absorbed. But overall, the business continues to perform better than we anticipated. The margin profile, or the cash generated in the businesses is stronger than we were planning. And as a result, we use that as an opportunity to accelerate costs, and put us in a pretty good spot as we start to think about 2023. Charles Meyers : Just to give you a little more transparency on, so -- what some of those are, we're pulling forward some R&M [ph], pulling forward -- just finishing out some projects that we are focused on both on the go-to-market side, and on the product side to -- to really give us that, the momentum going into next year. We gave a little bit more -- little wider berth to the teams on T&E in Q4. Because we really continue to believe that getting our teams reconnected both to our customers and to each other is important. And I think we're really seeing the dividends of that. And so -- but we're -- we definitely have not lost the plot in terms of our focus on operating leverage. In fact, if you look at our SG&A line, it's flat quarter-to-quarter and that's in the face of increasing investment in sales and marketing. And so that implies that we're sort of tightening down on G&A. And, even though, we're adding headcount in very targeted areas to support a very healthy organic performance of our business, we're also really tightening down in areas of the business in recognizing that we continue -- have to continue to have a focus on automation and simplification and efficiency. And we got to get that G&A leverage that we need in the business over time. So, we -- there's -- we're trying to make good balanced decisions on that front. And, again, we'll give you more perspective and cover what that means. But feeling very good about the trajectory of the business as we exit towards the end of the year. Aryeh Klein : Okay. Thanks for the color. Operator : The next question is from Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. Go ahead. Your lines open. Sami Badri : Thank you. Keith, earlier, you said that you have been having conversations with your customers regarding those PIs. And you said that you have been sharing with them some ranges. I was hoping you could kind of share with us what those ranges actually are, just so we have an idea of magnitude when we enter 2023. And then I think there was a question about general activity and trends. And I apologize if this is a duplicative question, but the tech sector is reporting some elongated lead times and some sales cycles extending to a certain degree, there are even IT budgets to require Board level approvals, which are just slowing some things down. I was hoping you could tell us if that -- those are the things that you're seeing or not at this stage. And then I have one follow-up. Keith Taylor : Okay. Well, let me maybe just start with the ranges. So first and foremost, we want to have a go-to-market engine, the customer facing teams wanted to have some dialogue with the customers on sort of power increases. And so first of all, it was really everybody is seeing what's going on in the broader market, particularly in Europe. And as a result, making sure that you're sort of advising the customers that there is going to be effective power increase at some point. The second value was effectively, look, depending on where you are, one market is very, very different than other markets. Some are regulated, some are unregulated. This is the sort of the range that you should expect. As both Charles and I have mentioned, we've got a sophisticated hedging program. We basically solidified what we think is a good portion of exposure for next year. And so we have specific information on that. And so we give them a range of what that could be. And again, as market specific, is volume-specific as application specific, again, customers, there's going to be a wide range for these customers depending on where they operate. And the third value will be in the not-too-distant future here is your specific increase. And so part of it is just making sure that the customer is fully understood that we're communicating with them. And we got it with -- and we give them enough time to understand what was going to happen, particularly as they start to think about their -- sorry, 2023 planning cycle. And so that was -- that's the first part. To give you something specific about what -- look, I could tell you, in some markets, if you look at spot, you're talking about multiples of increase, particularly in the U.K. market. That's not where we are as a company. We've done a very good job of buying forward and making sure we have a good position with. And I think our customers, as we said, we think we will be in a better spot relative to our competition. and we will be certainly well below what I think prevailing market rates are. So that's the positive. That is a European discussion. As you look at Asia and Americas, it's a different dialogue. You've got a much more structured increase. And overall, I feel very good about that. I think one of the things that you should walk away though, is understanding that the company is almost wholly hedged for next year. And certainly, Europe is even more hedged than the broader company. And so that's the one thing, I think, is really worth noting here. Because last year, we had some exposure to Singapore. We feel much better where we are going into '23 on Singapore. As we said to Michael, we would go to -- come back to the market and the market would come to us and all indications is the market is coming to us. And as a result, we will pass-through those incremental costs as well. So hopefully, that helps you a little bit, Sami, but I can't give you a specific range. It's very -- it's market and customer-specific. Charles Meyers : We will give -- I mean, obviously, we will get more as those tighten up and as we get -- as we go into the call in February, we will give you a lot more transparency there. Sami Badri : Yes. Keith Taylor : Sami, what was the second question? I think it was going to go to Charles on that one. Charles Meyers : Yes, it was around the general trends in extended cycles and are we seeing tighter IT budgets and those kind of things. Look, as I said, what we are seeing is generally a substantial commitment to the digital transformation agenda. And that doesn't mean people aren't seeing the need to tighten their belt on IT in other ways, but typically, we see that they are not -- they are trying very hard not to sort of distract their agenda in terms of the move to hybrid multi cloud as [indiscernible] choice. And I was just reading something from Gartner the other day in terms of just looking at how important is a particular IT project to your sort of digital agenda? And what is it going to do to impact your competitiveness to drive top line growth to save money, et cetera? And we continue to see a vigorous commitment to those kinds of things. And so -- and we have -- generally -- and Keith talked about this, both in terms of our cycles -- sales cycle and our backlog have not seen extensions of either of those things. And so sales execution has continued to be very, very good. Pipeline continues to be strong, pipeline execution and conversion continues to be strong. And so we're not saying it doesn't exist, although we're -- but what we would say is that the demand profile and how it's translating for us in bookings and pipeline is very, very good. And we're continuing to invest in the business accordingly. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you for the color on both of those. My last question is more on bare metal. And you mentioned how you have a new SaaS customer coming on using the service, and you also have a health care enterprise or a customer using service. And one of your private data center peers recently introduced a metal service and product so I kind of want to just understand what's the vision here for Equinix and the metal solution overall? Like are you guys trying to grow this 2x, 3x? Is this going to become a much more integrated or interconnected piece to everything you do? I just want to understand what the kind of the pipeline or the road map is there. Charles Meyers : Sure. Well, definitely, I think, it can be 2x to 3x and more than that -- than its current size, for sure. I think it can be -- so we definitely believe it's a meaningful business going forward for us. I also think we want to see it be more fully integrated. In fact, I think that is feedback we're getting from our customers is we love your individual digital services, but they don't work as effectively as an integrated platform as we would like. And so Scott, who franchise who joined us is sort of out there talking to customers, hearing what's on their mind, that has been a topic. And we're really continuing to align our product and development agenda to ensure that we are addressing the needs that the customers have. And so we do believe that an integrated platform, if you look at network edge, fabric and metal, we think that's a compelling combination of offerings for customers as they look to implement digital transformation strategies in hybrid and multi cloud. And so -- but I think it's important that we really continue to view that as giving them the right sort of portfolio of services to meet their needs. We think that actually public cloud will be a great home for a significant portion of their workloads. We definitely see sometimes repatriation back to either a colo-based solution or a metal type-based solution that allows sort of different level of economic scaling and utilization is something that happens. But we are -- we want to respond to the needs of the customer and have the right solution for them. And so when that's cloud, that's great. Move the workloads to the cloud, we will give you the connectivity you need to connect it to the data and other applications you need to have it perform well, and we will distribute that infrastructure around the world. And so, I think us being able to go in with that trusted adviser status with the customer is really what's driving the business. But we definitely see a big opportunity in metal and I think -- and with the broader digital services portfolio as continued. And as we've said in the past, it's growing at a multiple of the rate of our -- of the broader business. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And our last question today is from Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead. Your line is open. Matthew Niknam : Hey, thanks for taking the question. And I'll keep it to one, because I know we're over the hour. You're tracking a 9% to 10% -- not a problem. So I know you're tracking a 9% to 10% constant currency growth on AFFO per share this year. But there's obviously headwinds from rising interest rates and higher power costs. And I know you've mentioned you intend to pass those through. But the question is really what confidence level do you have in the ability to stay within that 7% to 10% AFFO per share growth range for next year with a number of headwinds out there? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Sure. Clearly, we are not going to give you a sort of a guide for next year, and we will give you that early. I guess I'd sort of reposition the question to simply tell you that if you look at our performance of what we said we would do at Analyst Day -- at the Analyst Day and what we've now done, I think we continue to feel really good about the trajectory of the business. Top line growth is strong, stronger than outside of the bounds of what we had said. I think that -- and I think that's really on the strength of underlying business momentum. And so -- we feel really good about the trajectory going into next year from a top line growth standpoint, too. I think growth will be a little wind assisted on PPIs next year, but I think we will give you clear transparency on what that is. But I think it's going to be on top of really strong underlying momentum in the business. And we think that's translating into the AFFO per share sort of growth that we think is needed and attractive. And then you combine that with a healthy dividend yield -- and we think it's a great story. So generally, I would say feel good about the momentum. Top line growth is good. We are going to continue to focus on operating leverage. And we think, therefore, we are going to be able to deliver strong performance on an AFFO per share basis. Keith, anything to add there? Keith Taylor : And, Matt, the only other thing I would say is one of the things that, again, you talked about normalized constant currency. And so on a constant currency basis, we're taking roughly relative to where we started the year about $180 million hit to the top line because of currency movement, and about $85 million to the EBITDA line. So it gives you a sense that what we're absorbing. So the performance of the business is doing much better than we had anticipated. And you can see that coming in so many different places, including the Americas business. I think when the -- I think the other thing that's going to certainly aid many of us, particularly those that are U.S. domiciled, as currencies start to move the other direction, which I suspect that they will at some point, that you're also going to get wind at your back from currency. So not only do you have the momentum coming from what Charles alluded to, but I also think that you've got -- you're going to have currency movement when other -- where other sort of central banks move their rates up to the U.S. or the U.S. starts to slow down on their rate increase. And that's going to be, I think, a real benefit to the business. And as I said before, if you just take our top three currencies, you take them back to our traditional parity level, not a deviation higher or lower, I mean you're really talking about a significant increase in revenues just from currency movements. Of course, we hedge ourselves and we do a really good job of currency hedging. But I wanted to leave you with that thought as well. It's not just about the pure execution to the business on how we are operating it, but also there's some currency movement that I think is going to benefit us as well. Matthew Niknam : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Matt. Katrina Rymill : Thank you. That concludes our Q3 call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : That concludes our conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

In the interest of wrapping this call up in an hour, we ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thank you, Chip. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. We had a great finish to 2022, delivering one of the best bookings performances in our history, led by the Americas with continued strength in demand and favorable pricing trends across all three regions. For the full year, we delivered more than $7 billion in revenue for the first time and completed our 80th consecutive quarter of revenue growth, an amazing 20 years of continuous growth, all while driving AFFO per share performance above the top end of our long-term expectations. As we look to the year ahead, even amidst a dynamic and complex global landscape, it's increasingly clear that the secular tailwinds of digital transformation remain strong. In 2023, IDC estimates spending on digital technology by organizations will grow 8x faster than the broader economy. In the current macroeconomic environment, we believe spending on digital transformation will remain robust for two simple reasons. First, as companies work harder for each incremental revenue dollar, digital is seen as a critical driver of competitive differentiation, accelerating time to market and enabling product set evolution. And second, digital transformation is increasingly a means to do more with less, enabling businesses to reduce costs and drive operating leverage while simultaneously becoming more agile and responsive in serving their customers. In the context of this secular demand environment, we remain confident that Platform Equinix is uniquely positioned to support our customers' digital infrastructure needs. Digital leaders are demanding infrastructure that is more distributed, more ecosystem-powered, more flexible and more interconnected because it is fundamental to their ability to differentiate in the marketplace and lower their costs. Our market-leading global reach, vibrant digital ecosystems and comprehensive interconnection platform allow our customers to scale with agility, speed to launch of digital services, deliver world-class experiences and enhance value to all their stakeholders. While we will continue to closely monitor the macro environment and we'll adapt our execution accordingly, the fundamentals of our business remain strong, and we're investing behind the momentum we're seeing, including adding quota-bearing heads, evolving our product set and expanding our industry-leading data center portfolio. With regards to power, our multiyear hedging efforts continue to create visibility and predictability for Equinix and our customers in the coming year. Effective January 1, we raised pricing, passing on the full impact of these additional power costs to our customers, increasing costs but giving our customers much needed budget certainty and, in most cases, leaving them with rates below the prevailing spot market. Overall, we believe we remain in a good position relative to competitors and the broader market, and I'm pleased with where we landed for our customers and our business. Turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for the full year were $7.3 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 8% year-over-year and AFFO per share grew 11% year-over-year. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our data center services portfolio continues to extend its scale and reach. And given strong demand and high utilization, we see continued opportunity to deliver highly attractive returns on capital, as evidenced by the largest development pipeline in our history. We currently have 49 major projects underway across 35 metros in 23 countries, including nine xScale projects representing over 34,000 cabinets of retail and over 75 megawatts of xScale capacity. New projects this quarter include new data center builds in Istanbul, Seoul and Tokyo, and our first builds in both Johannesburg, South Africa and Johor, Malaysia. Our new IBX in Johannesburg augments our current footprint in Africa, entering the largest and most digitally developed nation on the continent. And our new IBX in Johor represents our entry into one of the most requested markets in Asia Pacific by our global customers. Equinix remains the best manifestation of the interconnected digital edge. And with these new builds, our unparalleled global footprint will span 75 metros and 35 countries. The strength of our global platform continues to shine, with nearly 90% of our revenue coming from customers operating in multiple metros and nearly 2/3 coming from customers operating in all three regions. Key multi-market wins this quarter included one of the world's leading hospitality companies, finding performance gains at the edge by deploying in strategic markets across all three regions; and a leading cloud and CDN provider extending coverage and scaling globally to support new services and meet growing demand. IDC estimates that more than 750 million cloud-native applications will be developed globally by 2025. And as this digital transformation wave continues, customers see Equinix as the logical point of nexus for hybrid and multi-cloud deployments. This quarter, we won four new cloud on-ramps, including one in Mumbai, making it the 12th metro on Platform Equinix enabled with native cloud on-ramps from all five of the leading cloud providers. No other data center operator has more than one metro with all five clouds. In our xScale business, we continue to see strong overall demand, leasing approximately 8 megawatts of capacity across our Tokyo 12 and Osaka two assets with meaningful expansions in our forward pipeline. Enterprise wins leveraging the cloud this quarter include a global technology company in the payments industry, deploying infrastructure to place their corporate and customer networks closer to AWS and Azure; and a leading paints and coatings company choosing Equinix for its cloud on-ramp capabilities and virtualized service offerings. Our industry-leading interconnection franchise continues to perform well with revenues for the quarter growing 13% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, outpacing the broader business. We now have over 446,000 total interconnections on our platform. In Q4, we added an incremental 4,500 organic interconnections, slightly lower than our historical run rate due to seasonally slower gross adds, customer consolidations into higher bandwidth BCs on fabric and some elevated grooming activity. Equinix Fabric saw continued growth and is now operating at a $200 million revenue run rate, one of our fastest-growing products. Attach rates for Fabric continue to move higher with 40% of customers realizing the benefits of connecting their digital infrastructure at software speed. Internet exchange saw peak traffic jump 7% quarter-over-quarter and 28% year-over-year to greater than 29 terabits per second, driven by FIFA World Cup streaming demand and reflecting the continued strategic importance of having the world's largest Internet exchange footprint on Platform Equinix. Key interconnection wins this quarter included one of Korea's largest conglomerates, establishing interconnection in Seoul for SJC2, the Southeast Asia-Japan Cable, which will be ready for service this year, and the largest water authority in the Netherlands, implementing Equinix Fabric to directly and securely connect to distributed infrastructure and digital ecosystems to ensure a clean water supply. Turning to our digital services portfolio, we saw continued momentum with Equinix Metal and Network Edge, driving attractive pull-through to Fabric. Digital services wins this quarter included a leading insurance and financial services company evolving their internal systems from their own data center to a public cloud plus Metal approach at Equinix; and a Belgian advertising service provider using Equinix Metal for fast, efficient, reliable data movement to support localized online advertising. And our channel program delivered its seventh consecutive record quarter, accounting for nearly 40% of bookings and nearly 60% of new logos. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and digital first-use cases with hybrid multi-cloud as the clear architecture of choice. We saw continued strength from partners like AT&T, Avant, Cisco, HPE and Microsoft. Key wins included delivering a critical time-sensitive site migration for a multinational banking and financial services client in partnership with Options IT and Dell, leveraging a combination of Equinix Metal, Network Edge and Fabric to overcome supply chain delays and ensure continuity of operations while interconnecting to critical trading platforms. So let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results from the quarter. Keith Taylor : Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. To start, we had a great end to the year, finishing Q4 with healthy bookings, strong pricing, which included a nice uplift in MRR per cabinet in each of our regions and a solid forward-looking demand pipeline. We closed over 17,000 deals across more than 6,000 customers in 2022, and no single customer represents more than 3% of our MRR, highlighting the tremendous scale, reach and diversity of our go-to-market engine that continues to produce despite volatile and shifting macro conditions. Given the weaker U.S. dollar relative to our prior guidance rates, FX has shifted from a meaningful headwind to a tailwind, which is positive, although 2023 exchange rates still remain below the average FX rates for 2022. And while we continue to remain vigilant to the challenges in the broader economy, we do remain optimistic about our business and the key demand drivers and feel we're very well positioned to grow and scale due to our industry-leading risk management efforts across procurement and strategic sourcing, power and treasury and our future-first sustainability program. Also, the diversity and mix of our customers is benefiting us, with large established businesses constituting a majority of our revenues has greater than 80% of our recurring revenues come from companies generating $100 million or more in annual revenues. And more than 85% of our recurring revenues in the quarter come from customers deployed in three or more data centers, making Equinix a core vendor for our customers' digital infrastructure needs. Equinix remains in excellent financial health with strong liquidity positions, low net leverage, allowing us to be both strategically and operationally flexible in this current market environment. Now as part of our larger programmatic approach to managing power costs, we initiated efforts to enhance our customer communications last fall, providing our customers insights into our efforts while continuing to protect our customers and ourselves against the rising costs through our multiyear hedging efforts. At the start of 2023, we raised our power prices primarily in the EMEA region to recover these rising costs. While power markets remain volatile, our hedging approach meaningfully dampened the impact of the inflated energy costs for many of our customers. We expect these power price increases will generate approximately $350 million of incremental revenues and costs in 2023. And as a result, the cumulative power price increases are expected to increase our revenue growth by approximately 500 basis points. Now despite these increases, our cost management efforts have protected both our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO on a dollar basis, but as expected, have negatively impacted our adjusted EBITDA margins for the year. We expect these higher energy costs to be transitory and should reverse course over our future yet-to-be-determined period, at which time both our gross profit and adjusted EBITDA margins will return to our targeted and expected levels. Now let me cover the highlights for the quarter. Note that all comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q4 revenues were $1.871 billion, up 11% over the same quarter last year, above the midpoint of our guidance range on an FX-neutral basis, largely due to strong recurring revenues led by the Americas region. We continue to enjoy net positive pricing actions in the quarter. And similar to prior quarter, price increases outpaced price decreases by a ratio of 3 :1. Q4 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included an $8 million tailwind when compared to our prior guidance rates due to the weaker U.S. dollar in the quarter. As we look forward, we expect a significant step-up in Q1 recurring revenues, largely due to strong net bookings performance and significant power price increases. Global Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $839 million or 45% of revenues, up 7% over the same quarter last year, at the top end of our guidance range due to strong operating performance. Q4 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges included a $1 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates and $7 million of integration costs. Global Q4 AFFO was $658 million, above our expectations due to strong operating performance, including seasonally higher recurring CapEx and included an $11 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q4 MRR churn was 2.2%, a derivative of disciplined sales execution, whereby we put the right customer with the right application into the right asset. For the year, MRR churn was better than expected with the average quarterly MRR churn at the low end of our guidance range. As we look forward into 2023, we expect MRR churn to remain comfortably within our targeted 2% to 2.5% per quarter range. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC was the fastest revenue-growing region on a year-over-year normalized basis at 17%, followed by the Americas and EMEA regions at 10% and 9%, respectively. The Americas region had another quarter of strong gross bookings, lower MRR churn and continued favorable pricing trends led by our New York, Toronto and Washington, D.C. metros. The strength in the region remains broad-based, and the acquired Antel assets in Chile and Peru have performed better than we planned. Our EMEA region delivered a strong quarter with continued healthy pricing trends and an attractive retail mix as well as record inter- 40 new logos in 2022, and we're already seeing customer interest for our Jakarta and Johor sites. And now looking at the capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our balance sheet increased slightly to greater than $30 billion, including an unrestricted cash balance of $1.9 billion. As expected, our quarter-over-quarter cash balance decreased due to the significant planned increase in growth CapEx and real estate purchases and our quarterly cash dividend. I said previously, we plan to take a balanced and opportunistic approach to accessing the capital markets when conditions are favorable. As such, we're happy to share that we recently priced a Japanese yen private placement, raising the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $600 million of debt with an average duration of greater than 14 years and a blended cost to borrow an attractive 2.2%. This transaction is expected to fund in Q1. We also executed some ATM forward sale transactions in Q4, providing $300 million of incremental equity funding when settled. Pro forma for these transactions, we have nearly $7 billion of readily available liquidity and remain very well funded to meet our ongoing cash needs. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $828 million, including recurring CapEx of $80 million. In the quarter, we opened six retail projects in Geneva, Los Angeles, Osaka, Singapore, Washington, D.C. and Zurich and three xScale projects in Dublin, Sao Paulo and Osaka. We also purchased our Geneva two and Sao Paulo four IBX assets as well as land for development in London. Revenues from owned assets increased to 63% of our recurring revenues for the quarter. Our capital investments delivered strong returns, as shown on Slide 10. Our now 158 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 87% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. As a reminder, similar to prior years, we plan to update our stabilized asset summary on the Q1 earnings call. And finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 of our summary of 2023 guidance and bridges. Do note, all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. Starting with revenues, for 2023, we expect top line revenues will step up by nearly $1 billion, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 14% to 15%. Excluding our power price pass-throughs, we expect top line revenue growth to range between 9% and 10%, above the top end of our long-term growth rates, as highlighted at our 2021 Analyst Day, reflecting the continued momentum in the business. We expect 2023 adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 45%, excluding integration costs. And excluding the impact of power price increases to revenues and higher utility costs, adjusted EBITDA margins would approximate 48%, the result of strong operating leverage and efficiency initiatives. We expect to incur $35 million of integration costs in 2023. 2023 AFFO is expected to grow between 9% and 12% compared to the previous year, and AFFO per share is expected to grow 8% to 10% at the top end of our long-term range from our 2021 Analyst Day. 2023 CapEx is expected to range between $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, including approximately $150 million of on-balance sheet xScale spend, which we expect to be reimbursed as we transfer assets into the joint ventures and about $205 million of recurring CapEx spend. And finally, we're increasing the annual growth rate of our cash dividend on a per share basis to 10% due to strong operating performance. The cash dividend will approximate $1.3 billion, a 12% year-over-year increase, 100% of which is expected to be attributed to operating performance. So let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Keith. Our record of strong and consistent operating performance continued in 2022, and I'm proud of how the team delivered value for our customers and our shareholders. In 2023 and beyond, we believe the opportunity for our business remains significant as enterprises and service providers alike look to Platform Equinix as their key digital infrastructure partner to advance their digital transformation agenda. To expand our market leadership, reinforce our competitive advantage and drive sustained value creation, the leadership team and I have outlined a clear set of priorities for the coming year. First, we intend to press our advantage in our interconnected colo franchise, continuing to scale and evolve our best-in-class bookings engine, delivering on key projects to enhance operating leverage, further extending our superior global reach, refining processes and systems to enhance the Equinix experience for our customers and partners, and integrating our sustainability leadership into our services in ways that better help our customers meet their commitments to environmental and social responsibility. Second, we intend to continue to enrich our platform value proposition by accelerating our digital services growth, delivering a more unified set of platform capabilities and by investing in ecosystem enablement, empowering key partners to bring their value to our platform more quickly and easily and allowing us to leverage their significant go-to-market reach. And we will advance these priorities by continuing to cultivate a culture that remains firmly people-first. We're committed to making Equinix a place that attracts, inspires and develops the best talent in our industry, cultivating an in-service-to mindset and creating a place where every person every day can say, \"I'm safe, I belong and I matter.\" In closing, our business remains well positioned. Despite a challenging macroeconomic and sociopolitical environment, digital transformation remains a clear priority across all industries and digital leaders will continue to harness our trusted platform to bring together and interconnect the foundational infrastructure that powers their success. In that vein, we're pleased to welcome Tom Olinger to our Board of Directors. As the longtime CFO at Prologis, Tom has extensive international operating experience spanning real estate and technology, which will benefit our business. I'd also like to thank Budd Lyons for his exceptional service and contributions to the growth and success of the Company over the past 15 years as he rotates off the Board. So let me stop there and open it up for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simon Flannery : I wonder -- it's good to hear the strong outlook for 2023 and the good commentary around current activity. Can you square that for us with some of the comments from Amazon and Microsoft and others about enterprises becoming more cautious in December and through the early part of the first quarter? You did talk a little bit about some grooming, I think, in interconnect, but I understand the core value proposition. But are you seeing any of that behavior? And what gives you the confidence that, that's not going to be of a concern through some of your enterprise or other customers who are facing some challenges in this macro environment? And then the second one on the pricing. Good to see the color, the detail around that. Has that -- have you been able to successfully get the payments? Has there been any pushback from the customers around that or people who have a struggle to pay those increases? Any color on that would be great as you go through the first couple of billing cycles here. Charles Meyers : Sure. Thanks, Simon. Yes, both questions, we fully expected would be there. In terms of the overall macro environment, I would say, I think that the discussion has been interesting in terms of the cloud providers talking about customers being a bit more cautious. I think in specifics around customers who have really significantly expanded their investment in cloud and the workloads they're moving to cloud, et cetera, and many of whom I think have said, \"Wow, cloud -- our cloud bill has gone crazy on us, and we really need to step back and take a look at that.\" I do think that we see some of that dynamic. We actually see that dynamic, to some degree, playing in our favor in that customers are actually, one, sort of saying, \"Hey, what are -- it's not blindly sort of everything to cloud. It is really what is the appropriate mix of infrastructure requirements and how are we going to use the various clouds and how we're going to do that effectively? And how are we going to have the agility to move things between clouds?\" And so, I think we've seen customers really, one, very committed to their digital transformation agenda; two, I do think that they -- even though they have that commitment, it's probably in the context of a sort of a broader belt-tightening environment for overall budgets. And so, I do think they're being appropriately cautious about their investments. I think that they are -- we're seeing that they are -- I heard one CEO characterize it as measure twice, cut once in terms of how customers are thinking about their investments. But we definitely see them leaning in on digital overall. And I would say that we -- even in the cloud space, the amount of adds that are going in and the incremental revenue that the cloud providers are adding is still absolutely staggering. And in terms of overall quantum, it's quite consistent. It's coming down because the growth rates are coming down because you're on a very huge base. But overall, I think people still very committed to hybrid and multi-cloud as their architecture of choice. And I think they're really viewing Equinix as a key partner in figuring out how to appropriately manage and efficiently manage infrastructure costs going forward. So while we are seeing, I think, and people being appropriately cautious in a macro environment that would dictate that, we're still quite optimistic about the overall demand profile in our pipeline. And our conversion rates continue to sort of make us feel confident in that. And then the second one, relative to the power pass-through, we feel very good. We've got -- we've communicated that out to customers. We've had a lot of inquiries. Most of those inquiries are simply about explaining and providing them additional information on the charges. And so to this point, we feel very confident that we're -- continue to feel very confident we're going to get full recovery of that. And we'll continue to update you as we learn more. But right now, all systems go. Operator : Our next question will come from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jon Atkin : So maybe looking a little bit at the revenue growth guidance, if you could unpack -- you talked about the energy price increases. But apart from that, cabinet growth versus cross-connect growth and various flavors of digital services. Can you talk a little bit about what you're expecting for 2023? Charles Meyers : Sure. Yes. Again, we're very excited. As evident in the guide, we continue to feel very optimistic about the top line of the business. Obviously, it's a bit elevated with the power price pass-through. But even on an adjusted basis, excluding that 9% to 10%, which is above the long-term guide that we had provided at the Analyst Day. So, I think it reflects the overall strength in the business. And we're seeing really across-the-board strength. I think in colo and interconnection, in digital services and really across the regions. And we're seeing a combination of solid volume and very strong pricing. And so, I definitely think pricing is going to continue to contribute, and that is separate and apart from the power price increase. Even if you take that 9% to 10%, I think us increasing list pricing, which I think in sort of an inflationary environment, we have to demonstrate that we can do that. And I think we're having good success with that. So, I think the colo business remains strong, unit volumes on colo interconnection growing at 13%. Again, we saw slightly softer unit adds there, but I think we feel like that will probably normalize through the course of the year. And then digital services, we came off a really strong quarter. 2022 was really, I think, the front end of an inflection point of really, people saying, this is a great way for us to think about how to really use the power of the interconnected edge at Equinix in new ways. And so, I think we're going to see great strength there. The Americas business performed -- '22 is just an amazing year for the Americas business. I think EMEA really demonstrated some strength coming off the back end of the interconnection price increases and continuing to really evolve that portfolio to the retail suite. And then Asia is our fastest-growing region at 17%. So again, I feel very good that we've got pretty comprehensive strength in volume and in price across products and across geographies. Jon Atkin : So just by way of follow-up and what you're expecting in terms of customer decision cycle this year, book-to-bill intervals in your core business, it sounds like no change. I just wanted to kind of verify that. And then turning to xScale briefly, if you could maybe comment on pricing in the wholesale segment, and how is that keeping pace with higher build costs and higher financing costs? Charles Meyers : Sure, yes. Generally, I think that the book-to-bill, we have not seen any extensions of book-to-bill. I think in terms of quote to book, in other words, what's the sales cycle, I think we're seeing some anecdotal evidence of this sort of measure twice, cut once. But again, the team has -- is seeing strong conversion rates, solid pipeline and continue to feel good overall. So haven't seen any material change, although again, anecdotal evidence that you're seeing a little just caution in terms of customers really making sure that they're buying exactly what they need in the right amounts. And that's not surprising in sort of the macro kind of environment that we have. And then, Keith, I don't know if you have any further comment on book-to-bill and then xScale. Keith Taylor : Yes. The only other thing I would say in book-to-bill, last year, there were some supply chain constraints. We don't foresee any meaningful amount of that this year as it relates to the installation of our customers, so continue to be optimistic about that. And as it relates to xScale, I was just saying in the prepared remarks, you can see that there's a tremendous amount of capacity that we're building across our xScale sort of portfolio. And it's exciting. And so as that relates to not only the opportunity, and not counter to Simon's maybe worried bit, we're seeing the -- a lot of volume opportunities sitting inside the xScale business. So that's good. And then from a price point, no surprise, costs have moved up and pricing, therefore, has moved up to recover that cost and get the appropriate returns. So, I feel good from both perspectives. One, there's the volume that's there. There's the activity that we're building to support that volume, and we're getting the price points and the returns that we feel are appropriate for this juncture. Operator : Our next question will come from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Your line is open. Frank Louthan : Can you walk us through a little bit of the difference between sort of what's the pass-through from the revenue side, from the power increases versus what flowed through from the price hikes that you put in this year? And what had the biggest impact from the price increases? Was it more the base rents or the cross-connects? How would you characterize that? Charles Meyers : Sure, yes. I mean, the power pass-through is a really easy one to think through. It's on the order of $350 million on the revenue line and on the expense line. So -- and it's just -- and that's really what causes the 500 bp increase on the revenue line, obviously, without corresponding flow through to EBITDA. And so that impacts the EBITDA margin. But on a normalized basis, so as reported 45% guide but a normalized or excluding that 48%, which we think continues to look very good. And so -- and in terms of power price increases on the rest of the portfolio, I think we're seeing it -- we're going kind of across the board in space, power as well as in the digital services, making adjustments that we think are appropriate in the market. And part of that is just reflecting the increasing expense environment and some of the costs inside of the business that are going up. But then part of that is also just, I think, a really strong reflection of the value we deliver to the customer. And so, I think you're going to -- you're seeing the growth is certainly partially driven by strong pricing, and that's pretty consistent across the space, power and interconnect. Keith Taylor : And Frank, let me just maybe add on to what Charles said there. As we think about our business, and I said this at the Analyst Day two years ago and we'll certainly update you in the June Analyst Day coming, but when you think about pricing, historically, it was running at about 6% of our bookings. And we've said that price increases are in the range of 3% to 5% and our stabilized revenue -- our stabilized assets are growing at recurring revenue at 6% right now. So, I think you're going to get it from a number of different spots : number one, inflation. You've got the inflationary impact, and of course, that is going to move the pricing up higher than where we historically have been. And Charles was also alluding to the fact we also are moving list pricing. And so, when you look at list pricing, plus you've got the inflationary increases and then you've got the PPIs in addition to adding what we think is great value across our set of products and services, you have a broader influence coming from not just -- you have quantity but you have price. And I think that's something that we'll continue to sort of track and update you on as we come to the June Analyst Day, as I said. Frank Louthan : And can you remind me what your average contract length is? Keith Taylor : Two to three years. Frank Louthan : Remaining, two to three years. Keith Taylor : Inside the retail business. xScale, of course, is longer than that. Frank Louthan : What's the average kind of outstanding at any -- currently? Keith Taylor : In xScale or in retail? Frank Louthan : Just in retail? Keith Taylor : Yes, the average is two to three. Again, I don't have any more refined than that. That just gives you an indication of how things will renew. And as a result, one of the things I said at least in my prepared remarks is when you look at price increases relative to price decreases, we always talk about net positive pricing actions and you've heard us mention that quarter after quarter for years. It's a reflection that it's a living and breathing organism. And that there's always going to be movement and you're renegotiating with your customers. And some people, you'll adjust down, but the bias is towards price increases, not only because that's how the model works, but you're really going to see that come through as again, you feel the inflationary impacts, you go through the power price increases, and it manifests itself in our -- on a currency-adjusted MRR per cabinet number across all three regions. And that will continue to be something that we will monitor very, very closely. Charles Meyers : Yes. And Frank, I'd offer that in a sort of -- we've become very adept at sort of managing and optimizing sort of the overall return profile in the business. And as you look at the current environment, which is strong underlying demand signal, high utilization rates in some markets, particularly we have some markets that are quite tight, it really gives us the opportunity as we look at how to optimize to not only sort of in a rising rate environment, look at how to optimize that and upon renewal, either take unutilized capacity and resell it at significantly higher rates or, in some cases, look to do that proactively. And so, I do think that, that works well for us as we continue to demonstrate that we've got a level of pricing power in the business. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Your line is open. Michael Rollins : Just a couple of expense questions and then a revenue question. So on the expenses, as you close the books on 2022, if I'm looking at the slides, it looks like there was some impact both to revenue and EBITDA or expenses from the power pass-throughs you previously have discussed, Singapore. Can you share the funnel dollar amounts of impact that we should just be bouncing off of for 2023? And then as you look at 2023, are there incremental sales or product investments that we should be mindful of as we think about the types of opportunities, Charles, that you were discussing in the priorities to enrich the platform? And then I get to the final question of just, what are some of those examples maybe specifically on how you're trying to enrich the platform for 2023 and beyond? Charles Meyers : You want to take the first one on the PPI from '22? Keith Taylor : So Singapore, let me step back first. And when I talk -- when we think about Q4, which obviously is the most current guide, you see that we did slightly better than we guided to despite some of the movements. And as we sort of mentioned in the last call, we normally accelerate some costs into fourth quarter, largely for repairs and maintenance and some outside consulting work. And we expect it, our utility costs, to go up largely because of the seasonal aspect, less about the Singapore PPIs but the seasonal aspect. And part of the reason that we did a little bit better was those utility rates didn't go up as much as we anticipated. And then we've seen some moderation in price. Price and power is still inflated but moderated relative to some of our assumptions. So when you look at the fourth quarter, I would say that it performed exactly as we anticipated with a little bit of benefit attributed to power savings and really with the operating performance and then better revenues. Specifically to Singapore though, when we look at the sort of the net hit for Singapore last year, think of it in the order of magnitude of $50 million to $60 million. The reason I'm giving you a range is there was a substantial increase or a weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Singapore dollar. And so when you look at the net impact, it had a little bit of a knock-on effect on our results because obviously, you're absorbing a cost at a higher exchange rate. And so that would -- that gives you a sense of where we are in Singapore. As you then sort of fast forward to 2023, one of the things that we had mentioned in 2022 for the costs that we do not recover from Singapore in 2022 because we were out of market, market has moved to Equinix and part of the recovery that you're seeing and it's embedded in that $350 million is basically recovering cost that -- the cost increase in Singapore that we didn't recover in 2022. So it gives you a sense, there's think of, again, in the order of magnitude of $50 million to $60 million, is that number that you should be thinking about. Charles Meyers : And of course, the overall quantum in 2023 is much larger, as I described earlier. And so -- but that's -- but I think we're clear on that in terms of how that affects both revenue and margins. Keith Taylor : Does that answer your question, Mike? I want to make sure that we -- because you're asking about the P&L. I want to make sure that we hit that question for you. Michael Rollins : Yes. So it looked like just on the Slide 12 and Slide 13, just to dig in just for another moment just to make sure I fully appreciate the difference. So it shows the 11% constant currency without power pass-through, 10% after the power pass-through and then it shows a difference in margin as well. So is that the $50 million to $60 million? Or is there an additional amount that we should just be thinking through when making the adjustments to compare it to what's happening in 2023? Keith Taylor : No. I mean, it's relatively -- is consistent with what we said. I mean, part of what you're getting is a normalized versus a normalized without power pass-through. And so the difference between those two is we're saying that if -- we would have done a little bit better had we not been exposed to that Singapore exposure. Michael Rollins : And then just on the cost for 2023, maybe moving to that, are there any specific sales or operational investments? Keith Taylor : Yes, definitely. Let me give you a little color on that, Mike. So we -- the investments that we were -- and I've talked about this in a few different forums, that we're holding a pretty tight line on G&A. We are definitely investing in the go-to-market engine so that's a clear area of investment. I think we'll be approaching closer to 700 quota-bearing heads. And so we've definitely made that investment. Some of those are -- many of those were already on board at our Connect sales event -- sales kickoff event and are raring to go for the year. But we're still adding some as we speak. Product is really not an area of significant incremental investment, but we are adapting sort of exactly how we're spending our product level investments. Scott Crenshaw has come in on the digital services side, and I think we're evolving our areas of focus. We're going to continue to focus on -- we think Metal continues to have significant opportunity. Network Edge is continuing to see momentum in the market. But I think evolving Metal to be a more foundational platform for the ecosystem to bring value to our platform is something we see a lot of value in. And so, we're excited about the VMC on Equinix that partnership with VMware. And I think that's sort of more of sort of the color of things to come in terms of more investment in the ecosystem. And so, I think that's something you're going to see. And then we're also going to probably make some efficiency and continued efficiency programs that we think are going to drive long-term, either power efficiencies in terms of PUE improvement, and/or labor efficiencies in the business because we do believe that at some point down the road, we're going to have to use margin expansion as a way to drive AFFO per share growth. If you look at the current guide, it's really being driven by top line growth and then flow through, right? And so -- and we're -- but at a very healthy margin. So absent the PPI, we're at about 48% margin, a little bit of an increase, about 10 bps from where we would have been in 2022. We would have been higher than that because we are delivering operating leverage on G&A and other areas of the business. But we've reinvested it into those areas that I just described for you. Michael Rollins : And just finally on some examples of the ways that you'd like to enrich that platform in terms of the priorities you were sharing with us earlier in the call? Charles Meyers : Sure. A couple of areas, one is definitely on that ecosystem enablement side. We've got to make it easier for partners to bring their value to the platform. And so I think in terms of how we think about enabling them from the software side with APIs, richer APIs and easier -- an easier experience for customers and partners improving our portal and our software level, programmatic engagement opportunities at the API level, that's clearly going to be an area of investment. And then making the platform easier to use and more consistent. I think we -- that's one of the things we've heard from our channel partners, making it easier for them to quote and order and deliver our services, that's going to be a continued area of investment for us as well. Operator : Our next question will come from David Barden with Bank of America. Your line is open. David Barden : I guess, Keith, you probably expect this question. But if I take your fourth quarter revenue and multiply it by four, I add the $350 million of power pass-throughs and I subtract it from the midpoint of your 2023 outlook, the math suggests that you're telling us we're going to see mid-$30 million per quarter sequential revenue growth versus what we saw in 2022, which was closer to mid-$40s million. And so, I just want to make sure I didn't mishear anything about the strength of the platform and other things that we might need to be concerned about. And then I guess my second question is, other than raising your revenue growth guidance over the course of the year, as we think about the June Analyst Day, Charles, what are you -- what kind of expectations do you want to set that we're going to hear when we get to the midyear time? Keith Taylor : So let me take the first question, David, and thanks for doing the math. So let me start off at the highest level. We expect to book more in 2023 than we booked on a net basis than we did in 2022. So you can see that the business is going to continue to perform at a nice clip. There's a lot of non-recurring activities that go on in the business, particularly around xScale. But I would say that xScale, in addition, we expect to do more in 2023 than we did in 2022. You've got some currency movements and some relatively meaty movements. But currency is now starting to feel like it's at our back. But as I said, 2023 rates are still below the average rates of 2022, and so you're taking a little bit of a hit. And the order of magnitude of that hit, just to give you a sense on the averages is about $160 million to the top line. So you've got a little bit going on there, but I think if you go back just to the fundamentals, all else being equal, if currencies continue to move as they had been, although we've been a little bit of a blip over the last couple of weeks, another 10% move in currencies is a substantial uplift in our revenues. And so not only would it recapture the averages that we saw in 2022, it would give you more wind at your back for 2023. And so bottom line is there's nothing fundamental. We're obviously giving you a little bit wider range, given the economic environment that we're operating in today. That was very deliberate and it's very early in the year. And so for those reasons, I say, look, that's the guide. It's got a wide range and we're planning to execute against the plan that I just mentioned. Charles Meyers : So in terms of the Analyst Day, I mean, I think we'll -- that will actually be progressed well into the year, and I think we'll be able to give you a continued update on momentum in a number of areas. But I think we'll also continue to give you visibility in how we're evolving, driving the evolution to a more comprehensive platform value proposition. We'll really talk about being the infrastructure platform of choice for customers as they implement hybrid and multi-cloud as the architecture of choice. And so, I think updating you on what that means for our sort of traditional interconnected colo business and what that means for expansion of the platform, continued improvement of the customer experience. And then on the digital services side, how we'll continue to evolve the platform in terms of the service offerings with probably a real focus on Metal as a foundational piece of that. And then also on cloud networking. Networking is definitely an area of value add that we have always had for our customers and I think an area that we can continue to evolve the platform in terms of how we make it easier for customers to interconnect a variety of forms of infrastructure in a very cloud-centric world. And so, I think we'll talk you through those evolutions of the strategy and update you on where we're making investments and how we see the long-term outlook playing out as a result. Operator : Our next question will come from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Eric Luebchow : So just curious on your development pipeline, I think it's about as big as I've ever seen in terms of new expansion capacity. Maybe you can talk about, based on pretty tight industry supply, what kind of fill rates your utilization rates you expect to deliver on new development. Is it happening faster than it has in some historical periods? Then in terms of development cost inflation, have we started to see that cost curve flatten out? And do you think that, to some extent, could dictate how much your ability is to raise rents, excluding power pass-throughs as we look throughout the year? Charles Meyers : Yes. I mean, we're definitely seeing strong fill rates and that's informing the continued investment in the development pipeline for sure. And I would say that we're -- so that's -- I think that's -- and I think we're seeing -- we're underwriting to return profiles in light of that, that I think are very consistent with what we've seen in the past. I definitely do think, on the second part of your question, that we are -- we've seen a meaningful uptick in cost, and we are expecting and anticipating and managing toward increases in pricing to maintain a consistent return profile. And thus far, I think we're seeing that our ability to have those price increases materialize in the market, in other words, our pricing power remains strong. So I think -- and in terms of whether they're stabilizing, I do think that, as Keith said, the supply chain situation, I think, is a bit more stable, and we were, I think, due to a good strong execution on our part and our scale and some of the capabilities we have, I think we managed it quite effectively. And I think we're continuing to be diligent about that going forward. So, I think we've stabilized a lot of the risks on the supply chain side. Labor is tight still in some markets. And there, like for example, in France, where with the Olympics coming up, it's just finding the ability to advance those projects on the time lines that you want is a challenging task for sure. So, I would say the labor piece is probably the one on the supply chain that is a little bit more an area to watch for us. But overall, I think we feel very good about the underwriting, a lot of it still going into our core campuses that have sort of a really, really well-established track record of fill rate. But we're also seeing some of our newer edge markets continue to perform well ahead of expectations. So yes, big development pipeline, managing it well and I think feeling good about our ability to sort of perform to that underwriting. Keith Taylor : And Eric, let me just add maybe to what Charles has said. And again, in our prepared remarks, one of the things that was really important that we wanted to share with our -- the group here is the fact that we're funding the business. So, we not only have the cash on the balance sheet, we're bringing capital -- more capital on the balance sheet to fund 49 major projects that we've at least announced thus far across many metros. And we're going to be in 75 metros in not too far from now. So, you got a sense, one, the capital plan is increasing. We think we've got the supply chain well secured. We have a really good procurement team and strategic sourcing team that makes sure that we have the resources available. And then you've got a global design and construction team, they're doing just an excellent job delivering the capacity as quickly as we can deliver it. And it's tough out there in some markets. But I think it was really important to understand not only the volume there, we've got strategic planning, sourcing in place. We have the capital that we need. And we're setting ourselves up to fund all those things through 2023 and put us in a really good position as we start 2024. And so leverage is not going to shift in any meaningful way so it gives us that enhanced flexibility. And at the same time, we've all effectively prefunded a lot of the costs into the model, and we are now enjoying the benefits of this large expansion or this growth initiative that Charles has alluded to, both on the physical side and on the digital side. And so, it's the combination of all those things that really give us -- make us feel very good about our capital plan, our balance sheet and the liquidity position we're in right now. Operator : Thank you. And we do have time for just one more question. Our last question will come from Nick Del Deo with SVB MoffettNathanson. Nick Del Deo : First, Charles, you noted that interconnection adds were a bit soft due to seasonality, grooming and some virtual interconnections being consolidated. I guess, can you just expand a bit more on what's specifically driving those trends, the relative importance of each one and why you feel comfortable that it's going to normalize over the course of the year? And then second, in the current environment, you've got customers more cautious about spending in general but maybe more averse to capital outlays. Do you see that as sort of a net neutral for services like Metal or net positive or net negative? And do you feel like you're educating your customers appropriately today to take advantage of them? Charles Meyers : Yes, great question. Starting on the interaction, look, we feel really good about the interconnection business overall growing at 13%. We're clearly being able to make adjustments to interconnection pricing alongside broader list prices, so the pricing element is strong there. As I said, we did see a little weaker -- Q4 is seasonally a bit weaker, but definitely, this Q4 is weaker than prior Q4s. And I think there is some consolidation. I think it's partially due to just, as I said, the behavior of customers for -- interconnection is probably as close to we have to a usage-based service. It was -- some of our digital services are more usage based. But in the colo environment, that's as close as we have to usage-based services. When people -- things start to get paid, people immediately look at the things they can impact the fastest. And so I think it's pretty common for them to look at the portfolio and say, do I have interconnection I'm not using or that's underutilized that I could consolidate on the higher circuits? And I think that's some of the dynamic that we're seeing. So, I'd expect to -- and then we did see a little bit of, in terms of these virtual BCs to cloud ZNs, a little lighter on gross adds, still very healthy gross adds, by the way, because the cloud -- I think cloud and workload migration continues very full tilt and despite sort of what people are saying about the reducing growth rates of their cloud business, we're still seeing that very. But it is a little bit lower in terms of gross adds than it was. And so -- but I think that we tend to see that -- those kinds of dynamics as something that's a bit of a burst of activity as people go through budget cycles and then they kind of run out of gas on their ability to sort of squeeze more out of that. And so we'll monitor it closely. I continue to feel like the bottom line is that customers really see our interconnection platform as fundamental to how they're thinking about go-forward hybrid and multi-cloud architectures. And so, I think the demand profile for the business for the interconnection over the long term is going to continue to be really strong. And then on the second part around digital services, I definitely think that we're starting to see a realization from customers and the ability of our sales teams to articulate that services like Metal and their ability to deliver more on-demand infrastructure that can help customers be more agile is something we're seeing an inflection point on. We won some very marquee deals in Q4 of last year. I think we're seeing very large service provider and enterprise customers starting to sort of test the waters. I think they see it as an opportunity to reduce their life cycle management of technology obligations and I think to be a lot more agile in how they implement infrastructure. And so, I think we're definitely seeing the front edge of that. I think we're seeing a lot of excitement about things like VMware Cloud on Equinix Metal. And so I think that we'll continue to be quite optimistic about that piece of the business. But we're definitely learning how to effectively sell that and how to sort of get in front of different personas. And I know Karl and the go-to-market teams are really evolving our approach in those areas, but we feel very optimistic about it. Nick Del Deo : Okay. And do you feel this current environment helps that selling proposition or kind of makes it more challenging? Charles Meyers : I think it helps it in many respects. I think overall, people are looking for a way to advance the digital agenda that they have and do it as efficiently and as effectively and with as much agility as possible. And so again, we've seen strong demand. I think that the -- those services that are more on-demand, more agile, I do think, have an increasing level of appeal to customers. Chip Newcom : This concludes our Q4 conference call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

In addition, we will provide non-GAAP measures on today's conference call. We provide a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a list of the reasons why the company uses these measures in today's press release on the Equinix Investor Relations page at www.equinix.com. We've made available on the IR page of our website a presentation designed to accompany this discussion, along with certain supplemental financial information and other data. We would also like to remind you that we post important information about Equinix on the IR page from time to time and encourage you to check our website regularly for the most current available information. With us today are Charles Meyers, Equinix's CEO and President; and Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up in one hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thank you, Chip. Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We had a strong start to the year, delivering quarterly revenues right at $2 billion with adjusted EBITDA and AFFO above the top end of our expectations. Despite a challenging macro environment, customers remain committed to their digital transformation journeys, driving 4,000 deals in the quarter across more than 3,000 customers, highlighting the scale and diversity of our go-to-market engine and the broad-based demand that continues to propel the business. We continue to see enterprises and service providers build out their IT infrastructure on Platform Equinix. And that infrastructure is more distributed, more cloud connected and more hybrid than ever before. And while some customers are appropriately cautious about the timing of their investments given macro conditions, Equinix continues to be a critical partner in their efforts to advance hybrid architectures, unlock digital performance gains and optimize cloud and network spend. As a result, our deal win rates remain steady compared to historical trends, and we continue to see a robust pricing environment across all three regions. Turning to power. We're very pleased with how the organization has navigated a volatile energy market and we remain in a strong position, significantly mitigating the impacts of this volatility for our business and for our customers. As previously discussed, we raised pricing in January to more than 7,000 customers across 16 countries, generating approximately $90 million of incremental revenue in the quarter, fully offsetting the impact of higher power costs. Thanks to timely and transparent communications, concessions and disputes are low and our days of sales outstanding remain in line with historical trends. On the sustainability front, we are committed to responsible growth and continue to advance our bold future first sustainability agenda. Sustainability is increasingly becoming a board-level issue and Gartner estimates that by 2026, 75% of organizations will seek to increase business with IT vendors that have demonstrable sustainability goals and timelines, and we'll seek to replace those who don't. We recently published our eighth annual CSR report. And in 2022, we extended our industry leadership with 96% renewable energy coverage, making our fifth consecutive year with over 90% coverage. We're also progressing well on our science-based targets with a 23% reduction in operational emissions across Scope 1 and Scope 2 from our 2019 baseline. Additionally, Equinix continues to evolve its power procurement portfolio to increase the quality of its renewable energy purchases. This year, we signed new long-term power purchase agreements for solar projects in Spain totaling 345 megawatts of capacity, bringing Equinix's contracted renewable energy PPA portfolio to 715 megawatts globally once fully operational. Looking forward, where feasible, we'll continue to prioritize projects that create new sources of clean energy directly in the grids where we operate and support a healthy renewable energy coverage mix. Turning to our results. As depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q1 were $2 billion, up 16% year-over-year, driven by strong recurring revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA was up 18% year-over-year, and AFFO was better than our expectations due to strong operating performance. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our unmatched scale and reach continues to differentiate our data center services portfolio and the tremendous strength of our balance sheet positions us to sustain our investment in new capacity to support a robust demand environment. We currently have 50 major projects underway across 37 metros in 25 countries, including 10x scale projects that will deliver more than 90 megawatts of capacity once opened. This quarter, we added new data center builds in Lagos, Frankfurt and Rio de Janeiro. Revenues from multi-region and three region customers increased 1% quarter-over-quarter to an impressive 76% and 65%, respectively. Key multi-region wins in the quarter included a Fortune 500 manufacturing conglomerate, expanding its Performance Hub deployments across all three regions to assist with a business unit divestiture and in Cloud Native Zero Trust cybersecurity company using Equinix Metal to expand its business across all three regions. Our platform remains the logical point of Nexus for hybrid and multi-cloud deployments and hyperscalers continue to look to Equinix as a critical infrastructure provider and a valued go-to-market partner. This quarter, we won five new cloud on-ramps across Milan, Mumbai, Muscat, Tokyo and Warsaw as we continue to enjoy a strong leadership position in multi-cloud connectivity compared to our closest competitors. We're also seeing the unique breadth of our product portfolio across retail colo, interconnection services, xScale and digital services resonate strongly with customers as they embrace rapidly emerging opportunities in AI. We've closed several key AI wins over the past few quarters and are seeing a growing pipeline of new opportunities directly and with key partners for both training and inference use cases that benefit from the unique performance characteristics and multi-cloud proximity of our platform. In our xScale portfolio, we continue to see strong overall demand. In Q1, we pre-leased our entire Frankfurt 16 asset representing 14 megawatts of capacity taking us to over 75% leased or pre-leased across our nearly 260 megawatts of operational and announced xScale facilities. And we have a strong funnel of additional xScale opportunities in the coming quarters. Enterprise to cloud wins this quarter included a leading consumer products company leveraging Equinix\u2019s robust ecosystems for their private multi-cloud connectivity needs and the Hearst Corporation, a diversified media company deploying on platform Equinix to execute its cloud first strategy, including the deployment of network edge for their network aggregation. Turning to our industry leading interconnection business, we now have over 452,000 total interconnections on our platform. In Q1, interconnection revenue stepped up 12% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. And we added an incremental 5,300 interconnections for the quarter. We saw some continued grooming activity and consolidation into higher bandwidth BCs on Fabric, but both moderated from the prior quarter. While gross ads remain strong, pricing is firm and the diversity of our customer interconnection continues to expand. As global data volumes continue to accelerate, internet exchange saw peak traffic up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 26% year-over-year to greater than 30 terabits per second for the first time. And as enterprises continue to embrace hybrid and multi-cloud as their architecture of choice, they're increasingly seeking the security performance and convenience of Equinix Fabric to connect to their choice of cloud and IT services across the broader digital ecosystem. One example is Cisco whose multiple edge delivered services now rank among the leading end destinations on Fabric. Customer wins included Caixa, Brazil's federal financial services company partnering with Equinix to accelerate its business by optimizing and securing its network core via Fabric. We also continue to enhance our platform with our digital services portfolio and saw a strong new user growth for our Equinix Metal offering as we cultivate product like growth. Wins this quarter included a Japanese video game company utilizing Equinix Metal in all three regions to support a new product launch and restack an Australian SaaS integrator and managed services provider utilizing Equinix Fabric and our edge services to optimize their solution offerings. Our channel program delivered another strong quarter accounting for roughly 35% of bookings and 60% of new logos. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and digital first-use cases with strong engagement across the hyperscalers and continued momentum with partners like AT&T, Dell, Cisco, HPE, Orange business and Zenlayer. Key wins included a digital modernization win with Entel, our largest local partner in Chile, on behalf of Empresa Nacional [indiscernible] at Chile and oil and gas company. Entel is delivering a fully managed SDYM [ph] solution based upon Cisco technology while leveraging Equinix data center and interconnection services demonstrating how local partners can help deliver value to clients in new Equinix markets. Now let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results for the quarter. Keith Taylor : Thanks Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. As highlighted by Charles, we had an outstanding start to the year. As you can see from our financial results, the team delivered on multiple fronts in the quarter. We had record net bookings including power price increases. Excluding those prior price increases, our net bookings performance was solid. The result of, again, net positive pricing actions across each of our regions and lower MRR churn. Global MRR per cabinet yield increase by $124 per cabinet on an as reported basis are about $27 per cabinet adjusting per prior price increases another one-offs. And as we highlighted on the last earnings call, we completed our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet raising both debt and equity in the quarter and remain well funded to meet our future growth expectations. Now, as you would expect, despite the continued strength of our business, we remain highly focused on the broader market dynamics. But as we've stated before, during periods of disruption, Equinix thrives given our high quality and diverse set of customers who view Equinix as a mission critical partner to place their ecosystem driven digital infrastructure, whether it be a cloud on-ramp, a networking node, a cable landing station, or a trading platform. I do remember 90% of our quarterly bookings come from those existing customers as they expand their current environment or maybe move to more markets or simply buy more services. Finally, our strong liquidity position, low dividend, AFFO payout ratio and reduce debt leverage allows us to continue to invest to expand our product portfolio and expand our global footprint in both cases driving top line growth. Simply put, we're in a strong, fully funded financial position allowing us to meet all of our capital meets while maintaining the strategic and operational flexibility we need to grow and scale the business.  Now let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Know that all comments in this section are on an normalizing constant currency basis. As depicted on a Slide 4 , global Q1 revenues were $1.998 billion, up 16% over the same quarter last year, and above the top end of our guidance range due to strong recurring revenues and the timing of xScale non-recurring fees. As we've noted before, non-recurring revenues, particularly those revenues attributed to our xScale business and custom installation works are inherently lumpy and given the momentum we're seeing in our xScale business across all three regions. Non-recurring revenues could fluctuate meaningfully over the next three quarters of the year.  Q1 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $2 million tailwind when compared to our prior guidance range due to our weaker U.S. dollar in the quarter. Global Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $944 million or 47% of our revenues up 18% over the same quarter last year, and again above the top end of our guidance range due to strong operating performance including flat quarter-by-quarter SG&A spent. As expected, Q1 adjusted EBITDA benefited from lower seasonal power consumption and favorable energy hedge rates, which will reset higher starting in Q2 as anticipated, resulting in increased net utility spend over the next three quarters of the year. Q1 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges included a $2 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates and $5 million of integration costs. Global Q1 AFFO was $802 million, above our expectations due to strong business performance, including lower net interest expense and income taxes. As expected, we had seasonally lower recurring CapEx spend consistent with prior years. Q1 AFFO included a $2 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q1 MRR term was 2%, a continued reflection of our disciplined sales strategy. For the full year, we expect MRR churn to average at the low end of 2% to 2.5% of our quarterly range. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized basis, EMEA was our fastest-growing region at 28% due to our significant power increases. Excluding the benefit attributed to those price increases, EMEA growth was 14%. Our APAC and Americas region growth rates were 15% and 9%, respectively. The Americas region had another solid quarter with strong performance from our public sector team and continued favorable pricing trends. We saw strong momentum in our Chicago, Culpeper, Seattle metros and a Brazilian business. Our EMEA business delivered a great quarter, successfully executing on our price increase program while also seeing lower-than-expected MRR churn. In the quarter, we saw bookings strength in our Amsterdam, Dublin and Manchester metros. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a solid quarter led by our Mumbai, Tokyo and Singapore markets with strong new logo additions and firm pricing. Now while Singapore remains capacity constrained as part of our IBX optimization efforts, we continue to proactively negotiate with certain customers with larger deployments to recover capacity which we anticipate to be backfilled at much higher rates, although it could affect our in-quarter MRR churn and net CapEx billing metric. And now looking at the capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our balance sheet increased to approximately $31.3 billion, including an unrestricted cash balance of $2.6 billion. Our cash balance increased quarter-over-quarter due to strong operating cash flow while we also raised approximately $580 million of yen-denominated debt and closed at the prior year's forward sales from our ATM program. Our net leverage remains low at 3.4 times our adjusted EBITDA with 96% of our outstanding debt being fixed with no near-term maturities. Given the global nature of our business, we continue to look to raise additional debt capital and reduce rate countries where we intend to expand, creating both incremental debt capital to fund our growth and placing natural hedges into these markets. Turning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $530 million, including seasonally lower recurring CapEx of $22 million. Since our last earnings call, we opened four retail projects in Frankfurt, Paris, Singapore and Sydney. We also purchased land for development in Calgary and Madrid. Revenues from owned assets were 63% of our recurring revenues for the quarter. Our capital investments delivered strong returns, as shown on Slide 10, are now 171 stabilized assets increased revenues by 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Taking out the benefit attributed to power price increases, stabilized assets increased 7% year-over-year. Consistent with prior years, in Q1, we completed the annual refresh of our IBX categorization exercise. Our stabilized asset count increased by a net 13 IBXs. Now stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for our updated summary of 2023 guidance and bridges. Do note, all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. For the full year, we're raising our revenue guidance by $30 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance by $20 million, primarily due to favorable FX rates and lower integration costs. This guidance implies a revenue growth rate of 14% to 15%, inclusive of power price increases or 9% to 10%, excluding the power cost pass-through and adjusted EBITDA margins of 45%, excluding integration costs. We now expect to incur $33 million of integration costs in 2023. And we're raising 2023 AFFO [ph] guidance by $44 million to now grow between 10% and 13% compared to the previous year, and AFFO per share is now expected to grow 8% to 11%. 2023 CapEx is expected to range between $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, including approximately $150 million of on-balance sheet xScale spend, which we expect to be reimbursed as we transfer assets into the JVs of about $205 million of recurring CapEx spend. So let me stop here. I'm going to turn the call back to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Keith. In closing, we had a solid start to the year. While we remain vigilant to the challenges in the broader macro economy. Our Q1 results were strong and our outlook remains positive with the overall demand for digital transformation, fueling our conviction around the long-term secular drivers of our business. We look forward to our upcoming Analyst Day in June where we will further outline the significant opportunity ahead and discuss our strongly differentiated position in capturing this opportunity as we enable our customers to access all the right places, partners and possibilities. We also look forward to diving more deeply into our evolving platform capabilities, our industry-leading go-to-market engine and sharing expectations of how all of this will translate into durable and differentiated value creation for our investors, our customers and the communities in which we operate. So let me stop there and open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first caller is Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead. Matt Niknam : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two quick ones, if I could. First, on bookings trends. Can you comment at all in terms of linearity and whether you saw any potential slowdown going to some of the macro choppiness that really picked up in March. We've heard maybe a similar theme from some others across tech. And then just the second one on cap allocation, specifically just related to potential inorganic opportunities. Just wondering what you're seeing in terms of opportunities both domestically and abroad whether seller expectations have become more reasonable just in the context of leverage now sitting just shy of 3.5 turns. Thanks. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Matt. Yes. Look, I think overall, as we said in the script, I think we continue to feel good about the demand level. I think definitely, customers are feeling tighter budgets, looking to stretch their dollars. But I think their commitment to digital is strong. And I think how they're using us in terms of looking to capture savings in a variety of areas. And again, long-term digital transformation equipments are driving pretty solid activity levels. So I think the overall, we did about 4,000 deals in the quarter of 3,000 customers, very much in line with kind of what we've done in prior quarters. Linearity was pretty good. And so we probably saw a few more deals slip into the following quarter than we would have in previous quarters. And then on sales cycle, just to give you more of a concrete data point to hang your hat on, we usually see about 45% - I'm sorry, about 40% of our deals extend beyond the 90-day sales cycle. And that rose in this last quarter to about 45%. So a little bit of an increase, but not particularly material. And as we saw a little bit of slippage, actually our linearity in Q2 is already looking pretty good. So we started with a little bit richer funnel and so we're off to a good start in Q2. So again, I think that clearly, you're feeling a little bit of caution in the macro market, but overall, I think in terms of what people are \u2013 how they're thinking about digital, how they're thinking about Equinix in that context, we continue to see a pretty good overall environment. Relative to your second question on capital allocation, look, our balance sheet, thanks to our team's efforts, is in a really good place. And as I've said in a number of settings, I do think there's going to be opportunities for us, both organically and inorganic, I don't think we're starting to see, I think, some softening in multiples. And I think that's likely to continue depending on kind of overall sort of recessionary sort of dynamics and that kind of thing. And so we'll keep an eye on that. I do think as a market leader and we've got a long track record of being able to unlock value from M&A, and we're definitely positioned to do that if the right things come along. And so I do think that we probably expect some capital allocation towards that. And I think our balance sheet puts us in a really good position. Keith, anything to add there? Keith Taylor : Yes, Matt, if I can just maybe add a couple of quick points to what Charles said. The other part about the leverage being a little bit lower than we typically run at it, part just because of the money that we raised and the opportunity we sort of went for us to go into the market and draw on some \u2013 particularly on the debt capital in Japan, that put more cash on our balance sheet. And so that cash is going to get consumed, but one of the things I wanted to certainly you and the rest of the listeners to walk away with is that we do have the cash. We have the flexibility both operationally and structurally, but we're going to consume the cash. And in many ways, we're paying today for one, we're fully funded for all that we see, but you look forward in time and say, well, what are we going to do in 2024 and what are we going to do in 2025. And so you're already \u2013 we're already thinking ahead and hence my comments that we want to continue to raise capital because we know our dividend, our dividend is going to grow. We know we're going to continue to spend capital and the like. And we want to have that flexibility that Charles sort of alludes to when things shake themselves free, if it makes sense for us, then we would certainly strike, and we need a good strong balance sheet. All that said, at the end of the day, we're going to consume the cash, we're going to consume it into our growth cycles. And our leverage is actually going to go up because we're measuring it on a net debt basis. And again, I just think we all like the flexibility and the liquidity we have as a company, and we can use that to our fullest advantage going forward. Matt Niknam : That\u2019s great. Thank you both. Keith Taylor : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Our next caller is Jon Atkin with RBC. You may go ahead. Jon Atkin : Thanks. Got a couple of questions. One on Slide 10, where you have the stabilized growth, 11% top line. I think that's a record. And I just wanted to get a sense as to what was driving that and then another metrics question, just the Americas cabinet equivalents actually was down sequentially and MRR gift [ph] to bid in APAC and in EMEA, the cabinets billing number didn't grow at all, the footnote referenced timing of installs and churn and I wonder if you can kind of drill down on that a bit. Thanks. Charles Meyers : Yes. Great question, Jon. So on stabilized growth, obviously, incredible results fueled, obviously, in part by PPI on the power price increase. So 11% is definitely really high. If you take out the effects of power price increase, that still takes you down to about 7%, so really attractive. And if you take out the new stabilized assets, which are obviously less mature and probably growing faster than others, take \u2013 we take it down to about 5% from the previous sort of portfolio of stabilized assets. So that's still at the high end of the 3% to 5% that we've been talking about. But this is pretty typical of the dynamic as you very well know, when you add in sort of a new set of stabilized assets sort of [indiscernible] the growth a little bit up. And then as you increase utilization and sort of tap out that growth, it might tend to sort of come back down a little bit. And then ROIC goes a little bit in the opposite direction. It's sort of impaired by the fact that these are less mature, but then I think we would tend to rise back. And so overall, we feel really good about stabilized assets. And I think they are a reflection of the strength of the business model. Billable cabs, yes, for sure, definitely good solid quarter in Americas. APAC is coming off a really strong quarter last quarter and so it was flat this one, EMEA actually had sort of no meaningful adds the last couple of quarters. And I know that creates a little sort of mental distance for people to see a couple of quarters without billable cabs. But I think it's important to remember that really the dynamics of the business as such. In EMEA, actually, if you look at eight quarter, 12 quarter trend, we've actually had a lot of strength there in terms of cabinet adds and you get into a situation where essentially you start seeing high utilization rates in certain markets Therefore, you're probably going to see a little less large footprint and then you actually start sort of a cycle of looking for good churn to try to make room. And that kind of \u2013 can lead to some flat spots, I think, from billable caps. But we always encourage people to really look at a longer-term trend. We clearly will grow can will and need to grow billable cabs across all three regions. And with the size of the development pipeline that we have, that will happen. But let me give you just a data point on Europe, one of the things \u2013 this happened in Europe, and it gives \u2013 I think it's something to sort of hang your hat on and really reinforce why we talk so much about our strategy and maintaining discipline in our strategy because we could turn ourselves into cabinet fingers and that's really not what we want. And so if you look at Europe, we actually had a churn this quarter in a market that is very tight about 440 cabs. And that was \u2013 it was a pretty low dense implementation from a power density standpoint and not really well interconnected. And so we were getting a cabinet yield there well below our average. When we go to resell that, we will likely resell that in significantly more small to midsized deals than sort of one big footprint. And when you look at what's likely to happen there, we're probably going to increase the revenue and therefore, the yield per cabinet, when you get more interconnection, higher power density and a higher price point, we'll probably increase the revenue from those 440 cabs, 50% from that capacity when all is said and done. And so the significant growth with no billable \u2013 essentially zero increase in billable cabs and no incremental CapEx. And so this is why when you hear us talk constantly about right customer, right application, right assets. And that's more than just a sort of a clever thing for the earnings call. That's a way of life here in terms of how we drive our sales team. And I think that gives you kind of a good reflection. So you will see the billable cab growth, but I think right now, you're seeing good healthy growth across those because I think we're playing every lever, power density, price point, interconnection, and I think it's really driving health in the business. Jon Atkin : And then if I can follow up on AI. You mentioned some wins there. And what are we seeing in terms of rough sizes? Are they \u2013 do they tend to be very cost connect rich or more density rich or what how you kind of qualify and characterize the AI demand you're seeing so far? Charles Meyers : Yes. I think it's a little early to tell, but we have seen \u2013 it's interesting because ChatGPT has created a media frenzy around AI. But the reality is we've seen AI-related opportunities in our pipeline for the last several years. And for those that are familiar with the story and out on the investor circuit with us, you've heard me talk about that. And I think that most typically, it is people thinking about how to use their data and where to place their data. And what we're seeing is actually a trend towards people saying, we want to take our data and place it sort of inter cloud. We want to have control of that data. We want to intersect it with other data sources and we want to be able to move it into and out of clouds as appropriate for these things. And so we have seen some large training model training opportunities. Those are partially economically driven just it's actually cheaper to do on sort of dedicated hardware. If you have sort of a sustained commitment to doing AI training. And so we've seen some of those. And then inference deals, which I think are going to be a bit more interconnected, are where people are actually deploying inference AI inference use cases that are sort of \u2013 and I think we're going to be uniquely well suited is when insights are both, one, when data sets are dynamic and they're updated frequently, and they're taking in a lot of new data. And secondly, where insights are real-time and mission-critical. I think \u2013 and that really doesn't sort of fit the profile of the way current large language models like ChatGPT are being used. But we do think that what's going to happen is people are going to build vertically oriented sort of AI use cases on top of foundational models that are going to be sort of cloud-centric. And I think that we're going to be well suited to responding to some of those opportunities. So I think it's going to be a mix. I actually think some of the training stuff, Jonathan, is going to be more suited to our xScale portfolio. And I think some of the inference stuff is probably going to land in the retail portfolio at the digital edge. And so that's sort of the current dynamic, but early days, but I think an exciting incremental opportunity, and we're going to talk a little bit more about that at Analyst Day. Jon Atkin : Thank you. Operator : The next caller is Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead. Nick Del Deo : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First, Keith, I thought some of your comments about Singapore and the opportunities to monetize that space are pretty interesting. I mean is the plan to just move those customers across the straight to Johor or some other market or are they going to be let go? How impactful do you think this might be over time and when might it your results? And are there other markets where this might come into play or is Singapore kind of unique situation? Keith Taylor : Well, first, it dovetails nicely into what Charles was really talking about in the European theater, where you have a tight market, you make some decisions about looking to optimize the environment. And with that, sometimes customers move out some of the large deployments. As it relates specifically to Singapore, my reference was no different really than again, what Charles is talking about. But we do see an opportunity. There happens to be a larger installation related to customer. And it maybe it does move to a different market for us, and that would be fine. But the real focus is getting capacity in the Singapore market, getting a price uplift and again, going back to what Charles talked about, that we are sort of maybe with the bread crumbs that we see something that we're looking at right now that is going to be upsized. And of course, when we do that, it has an impact on the net cabinets billing. And of course, it has an impact on our churn metric. I maintain the word churn is going to be at the lower end of our range for the year. So I'm not worried about that. But this billing cab \u2013 billing cabinet metric is the 1 that we're always sort of looking at, causes us a little bit of discomfort because we know we're doing the right thing for the business and yet it presents itself maybe a little bit unfairly to us. And so \u2013 the bottom line is that's an initiative that we would embark upon. And Singapore is not the only market. Any place that we see that opportunity. And again, I will refer back to Charles' comment, but we don't need \u2013 where we can get an uplift an optimization of the asset. We don't have to put more capital to work and you're driving value into the equation. And so that's just a real good outcome for us. And if we can do that in places, we are tight and there is the demand, we'll make sure that we do it. Charles Meyers : Yes. Nick, I'd offer a little bit more color in that saying, we have a few examples where I think we have footprints that probably would have been better suited to xScale facilities had we had them at the time that we took them that now we are sort of saying, hey, that we would really need that capacity for \u2013 to fuel the retail footprint. And obviously, in Singapore, there's a broader sort of capacity constraint concern, it's really critical that we recapture those. And so \u2013 but there are other \u2013 other markets where I think we see some of that opportunity and other markets in which some of these capacity constraints might come into play. It's also one of the reasons why I think we have to continue to lean in on sustainability. And the connection between those things is, I think, for us to make sure we're going to be in line to get the power allocations needed, the permits needed, et cetera, to continue to drive capacity in markets where jurisdictions are quite reasonably looking at how to manage their energy needs. I think it's going to be important that we are able to say, hey, we're the responsible party to partner with to continue to be a digital leader but be that in a really responsible way. So a lot of sort of interconnections between those various thoughts and threats. Nick Del Deo : That's great. That's great. Thanks for that color. Charles, can I ask one on interconnection. You talked about how adds came back in Q1 versus Q4, still below trend, though. Can you share any updated expectations regarding when we should see that growing dynamic abate and get adds back to more normal levels? Charles Meyers : Absolutely. Yes, as I noted, there's a few on the last call and in the script, there's a few factors that play out interconnection. Overall, one thing I'd say is traffic levels continue to be really attractive. You're seeing that in exchange. You're seeing that in terms of in fabric overall provision capacity. It's a little tougher for us to tell on physical cross-connects, exactly how much traffic is flowing because we don't \u2013 we don't like the electronics on those things. But it's fair to say that \u2013 I think what you're seeing is a trend towards significantly higher speeds to support higher and higher traffic. And by the way, I think AI is going to only add fuel to that fire. So gross adds have been strong. That's one of the things that we really look at is say, how many gross adds are there. And I think that's a primary indicator of health, and those have been very much in line with the four quarter averages. There is some grooming activity. As I said last quarter, we thought that would moderate \u2013 it did moderate to some degree, but was still there at an elevated level. I do think people are going to run out of low-hanging fruit on that one. And so I think that we'll eventually see more moderation there, and that will help the net adds further. I think this trend towards higher speeds, though is a more sustained trend. And so I think we're just going to have to look at kind of how \u2013 where things settle out. We've seen this in the past where traffic is sort of catching up to provision capacity a little bit. And so \u2013 but again, I think the long-term trend here is very high degrees of traffic flow, higher degrees of interconnection. The diversity we're seeing in the interconnection system and ecosystem is increasingly rich. So more a [indiscernible] sort of unique connections. And overall, just the strength is good. So 12% revenue growth a little lighter on the unit side. I do think we'll see some more moderation of the grooming per se, but I do think that that will be offset that we'll still see a little bit more in terms of fewer higher speed circuits. And so we'll just \u2013 we'll continue to track that. But I'll give you the punch line here. Interconnection is well north of $1 billion business for us, growing at 12% at very, very attractive returns on capital. And I think that the opportunity for us to continue to sort of lean into that and grow that business, particularly as we grow fabric. And as we think about what the bigger cloud networking opportunity looks like and what our role in it is \u2013 continues to be a big part of the Equinix story. Nick Del Deo : All right. That\u2019s great. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next caller is Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. Good evening. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about pricing outside of the power price increases. We certainly heard a lot on the hyperscale side of prices firming and you referenced some of the capacity constraints in the market. So what are you seeing both in xScale and then also just in your core business around the opportunities to continue to take price both on new business and on renewals. And then maybe a little bit on metal, both in terms of customer adoption and in terms of your continuing to roll out the product across your footprint? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Lots in there. So let me try to hit them all. So yes, pricing is definitely firm. Obviously, PPIs have gotten a lot of airtime, but I think perhaps an even more important trend is our ability to sort of sustain pricing power on sort of the broader portfolio of service offerings. And so we have elevated our costs on space, power and interconnection from a list price perspective across all our markets. And so I think you're going to see that continuing to sort of roll into the business. xScale pricing has definitely firmed in across the world. And so I think we're seeing attractive price points and good solid cash and cash returns on the product projects that we're underwriting. And as we said, we got a very high degree of pre-leasing there. And so \u2013 and again, we've raised pricing both on the retail side, space, power and on the interconnection units. So we have \u2013 and then you have the escalators and we are \u2013 our escalators are also going up. And so in some cases, we're doing CPI or other index-based escalators, but then more broadly, if we're doing fixed escalators, they are much higher than they have been in the past. And so I think we're seeing all of that roll through as a clear dynamic in the business in terms of and you're seeing it show up in MRR per cap, right? I mean, we gave you a headline stat there and keep script about how MRR per cab is increasing. Yes, a big chunk of it due to PPI. But even absent that, I think our yield per cab, which is an absolutely critical metric for us continues to rise. So \u2013 and then on metal, we talked a couple about a couple of really nice wins. We are really cultivating early users in what is more of a product-led growth motion that's probably a little bit more typical of SaaS providers. And so we're cutting our teeth on that to be candid, but we're getting the hang of it. And we are seeing some uptake from developers and from started digitally native service providers. And we're also seeing some pretty big opportunities in our funnel about more traditional service providers or large enterprises looking to reduce the pain of managing the technology life cycle and metal really helps with that. So we'll probably talk more about that at the Analyst Day as well. But goes continue to feel good about the underlying drivers of that business and kind of why we did that acquisition in the first place. Simon Flannery : Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next caller is David Barden with Bank of America. You may go ahead. David Barden : Hi guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I guess, Keith, I just want to make sure we all have the right jumping off point. So thank you for the waterfall for the 2Q EBITDA guide. And I just wanted to understand the combination of forces of the kind of impact of the roll-off of the hedges and you kind of increased usage as they kind of merge together to kind of create this $43 million kind of move down at the midpoint? And then assuming that that's the right jumping off point that these hedges are the right levels for the rest of the year. It implies about a $14 million sequential EBITDA growth in 3Q and 4Q to get to the midpoint of the full year guide. Could you talk a little bit about what the drivers of that will look like? Is it going to be kind of a steady cost structure with pretty much volume and price being the drivers of the margin? Any color there would be super helpful. Thank you. Keith Taylor : Sure. Well. Thanks, David, and thanks for \u2013 laying over there. And I think, first, if you start on the red line and you look at sort of the quarter-over-quarter movement, the first thing you notice is that it is not an overly substantial increase quarter-over-quarter coming off such a big number from Q1 relative to Q4 last quarter. But one of the things you'll appreciate and those hands was built into my comments in my script, nonrecurring revenue is moving around quite a bit. And right now, we're making the underlying assumption that it's not hitting in any specific quarter. And so what you're seeing is a meaningful step down in nonrecurring revenue between Q1 and Q2. So that's the first thing. And so you feel that in many different ways, but you certainly do feel it on the EBITDA line as well. The second thing is sort of attached to that is xScale we are \u2013 as Charles alluded to in his script, we sold out on complete asset in Frankfurt, and we are very active in some \u2013 across all three regions of the world, and we anticipate a lot more xScale activity. And so you'll see that play itself out into the year or throughout the rest of the year. Right now, our MRR trends about 5% of revenue for the year. I think it's probably going to be roughly 5% of revenue. But the range is going to be somewhere between 4.2% and about 7% and between the next three quarters. And we don't know exactly where. So we haven't really guided as well as we maybe would want to given the set of circumstances. And then the last piece I'd just say, look, there's an element of conservatism built into our model here for obvious reasons. And again, we're trying to be very prudent about what we look at. We give you \u2013 we know what we did for the first quarter. We're running a little bit ahead. That was again, associated with xScale, the xScale fees. But as we look forward, we really just wanted to at this stage of the game, give you the FX and then continue to look at what's going on in the business. As it relates specifically to the power and the power costs, Again, no surprise. We've been very thoughtful about the power dynamics for this year and the power price increases. And we had to factor in and look exactly what was the cost going to be for the year, including when do the hedges roll off and when did some other start and what's going on. And in the regulatory \u2013 the regulated environment. And then there are some other markets that we are going to be putting price increases through effective on May 1, and that's Hong Kong and Tokyo. So looking at all of that, more specifically, our costs are going up. And so you're going to feel that throughout the rest of the year. It's baked into the guide already was baked into the original guide. So this isn't a shift and what you should see is really EBITDA profitability continued to increase throughout the rest of the year. So again, I think we've got a making of a really good plan here, but we're going to \u2013 we're sort of holding firm on what we hopefully shared with you when we started the year knowing that one other thing that's really working in our favor is currency. And again, we get a little bit of currency, but we're all sort of reading the same thing. If you look at what the U.S. dollar could do anywhere between now and the next 12 months, some are calling for a 5% depreciation, so we're calling as high as a 15% depreciation of the U.S. dollar and 60% of our revenues reside outside of the U.S. and you don't have to go very far to figure out what is the implication of that is 60% of our revenues move 5% or 15% before taking into consideration the hedges. You have a really substantial move on top line and on bottom line. And that drives a lot of value on a per share basis. So hopefully, that gives you sort of a full look at all the things we're thinking about and try to share with you. But at this point, we felt really comfortable just sort of holding firm on our guide and just give you a little bit of FX and some operating performance coming out of Q1. Charles Meyers : Yes. Maybe Dave, a little bit of more color is that I think \u2013 I will tell you that we are also focused on every element of the business model. So if you look at the revenue line, say, P times Q, we feel very good about P, continue to feel good about Q and we're going to continue to work the heck out of that. I would say that at the next sort of a click down on cost of goods, we're continuing to drive efficiency sort of projects across the business to try to improve cost of goods and gross margin. Then when you look down further, I also think just given the broader \u2013 we\u2019re going to continue to be diligent on spent. We did spend \u2013 we opened up the wallet a bit to make sure we can add some more headcount, and we\u2019re trying to bring them up productivity as quickly as possible. But you saw a flat SG&A spend quarter-over-quarter, and we\u2019re going to continue to be very disciplined about that as well. And so, we\u2019re going to work every element of the model and continue to do what we need to do to try to deliver the long-term performance. David Barden : Thank you both so much. It\u2019s really great. Operator : Our next caller is Michael Elias with TD Cowen. You may go ahead. Michael Elias : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just first you talked about organic and inorganic opportunities. Just wondering if you could give us a sense of the markets that you\u2019re prioritizing or perhaps regions that you\u2019re prioritizing from that perspective. And then also, there were some press reports out earlier today suggesting that Equinix is exploring the sale of Hong Kong data center assets. Maybe without commenting on that specifically, just at a high level, do you view capital recycling this year as a likely option? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Yes. Why don\u2019t we \u2013 I\u2019ll take the first one and then Keith can comment on the second one there relative to Hong Kong. But on M&A as I said, I do think there\u2019s opportunities for us. We\u2019ve talked about where some of those markets might be. I think Southeast Asia is going to continue to be an area of opportunity, we believe over time. And there\u2019s several key markets there that I think we\u2019ve got our eyes on. We\u2019ve actually done a couple of organic projects already in Indonesia and Malaysia, and we\u2019re going to continue to stay sort of eyes very wide open in terms of opportunities for us in that area. India, we\u2019ve announced a new build in Chennai, but I do think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity in India, and I think that could be a combination over time of organic and inorganic. And I think that we also I think one of the things that we have not done a lot of, or we haven\u2019t done any of it yet, but I think that could be on radar, is thinking about opportunities from an xScale perspective in partnership with our partners. All of those probably represent some level of opportunity for us M&A and I think as we look at some of the dynamics and opportunities in the market, including AI. I think that could be those could be all very relevant for us. So that\u2019s the first question, and then I\u2019ll let \u2013 I\u2019ll kick it over to Keith and he can talk a bit about the \u2013 this capital recycling question. Keith Taylor : Yes. And thanks Charles. So Michael, I\u2019ll say a few things. First and foremost, we typically are not a recycler of assets. I think you have to step back and we\u2019ve said this, actually one of the analyst stay, I think it was, might have been the last one, where\u2019re basically we\u2019re a platform and all assets are very important to the platform. And in particular, Hong Kong is a very important asset to us and something that is important to our platform. So we don\u2019t think about the business as selling assets, but we do also \u2013 we do think about ways \u2013 innovative ways to allow us to scale and grow the business. And an example of that is our Jakarta business, where we recently entered into our partnership with a large conglomerate so that we go into that market in tandem. And it just, it\u2019s a \u2013 it is an innovative \u2013 sorry, innovative way to actually to raise capital. And so overall, we\u2019re not in the business of selling assets. But we\u2019re always looking across our portfolio and trying to figure out how to optimize the capital structure. And I think that sort of best reflects our view that the platform, the Equinix platform is critically important to all the different assets that we have in our portfolio. Michael Elias : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : And our next caller is Michael Rollins with Citi. You may go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Hi. Couple questions. First, and I realize it\u2019s still somewhat early in the year, but as you\u2019re looking forward and trying to manage power costs, what\u2019s your sense of where these power price increases or maybe future decreases are heading from what you see across the market portfolio for 2024? And then just secondly, as we take a step back and the market tries to contemplate the forward growth opportunity for Equinix, is it helpful to consider the company\u2019s position on three vectors, the percentage coverage of core global markets, the percent penetration of key customer cohorts, and where the wallet level is, especially when you break out past the top 50 customers? And is that something that you can give us a bit of an update on today? Charles Meyers : Sure. I\u2019ll start and Keith going to jump in here. But obviously very hard for us to predict anything on power. I would say that I would expect in general, more volatility rather than less, right? We \u2013 I think we\u2019re living in a volatile world. I think there\u2019s a lot of still dynamics at play in terms that could impact power pricing broadly speaking. And now the good news is that I think that again, we\u2019ve \u2013 this opportunity for us over the last almost year to really educate our customers about how we go about energy procurement and what it means and how it dampens volatility and why that\u2019s good for them and why it gives them budget predictability, et cetera are all things that I think have been really good for us. Obviously, you look at in sort of deregulated markets where we can hedge, we\u2019re going to dampen that volatility out. And so and again, we don\u2019t know, there definitely have been markets that have come down in price over the last several months but recognize that customers were enjoying a very different price point than what with the spot was at in sort of the latter part of 2022 and early 2023. And so they were really that was a huge benefit to them. And now some markets have moderated substantially and some people predicted they will continue to moderate further. But I think others predict, particularly in Europe, that unless we get some sort of resolution to the conflict in Ukraine that we likely have more volatility. And even I think that the fact that an energy transformation is underway in Europe under any circumstance that is going to be decade long, multi-decade long in nature, I\u2019d expect more volatility rather than less. And I think our approach to the market and how we\u2019ve approached hedging, et cetera provides real benefits. So we\u2019ll continue to sort of monitor that. I do think in some cases we\u2019re seeing some benefits in terms of power prices being a little lower than we expected in some places. We are going to have some of the hedges roll off in Q2 and we talked about that in the script. So you\u2019re going to see some elevation there. And so, that shouldn\u2019t be a surprise in the next quarter. But I definitely think it\u2019s going to continue to be a volatile overall market. Before I go to the other question, you wanted to add anything on power? Keith Taylor : The only other thing I would add Michael to Charles\u2019 comments, the other aspect of it is operationally we are highly focused on running the business more efficiently. We\u2019re very renewable and sustainable \u2013 sustainability focused and as a business, we want to continue to make sure we drive down the overall cost of the business. And so that\u2019s going to be an important aspect on a go forward basis. And Charles also made the comments in his prepared remarks around PPAs and our desire to go into contractual arrangement with whether it\u2019s wind or solar developers and create capacity for the market. And we see that as a bigger part of our business going forward as well. I think it sort of, it tamps down some of the volatility because it is predictable over an extended period of time at least those arrangements are. But overall, it\u2019s the combination of all those things and our commitment to a 100% renewable just as that\u2019s a critical aspect of our energy strategy as well. Charles Meyers : Yeah. And then Mike on the other one, I think I don\u2019t want to steal any of my thunder for Analyst Day, but I would say that I think, we\u2019ve always talked about multiple revenue or multiple growth drivers and levers in our business. Geographic expansion is one of those. So covering more markets, what\u2019s a core market that evolves and changes over time. Obviously, we continue to get a huge chunk of our bookings and profits from these sort of scaled markets. But what you see is markets start to break into that group, and they mature to a certain level. And I think we\u2019re going to continue to see that dynamic. The nature of distributed infrastructure continues to drive that. And so you\u2019re seeing hyperscalers expand their edge or their presence. They\u2019re both their edge and their core. And we want to be a partner to them in that. And so I think you\u2019ll expect us, you should expect us to see continued investment to align with that. And where the digital edge is continuing to evolve. But I do think, our commitment is to continue to be that best manifestation. And so I think we\u2019re going to continue to see geographic expansion as a driver. And then in terms of wallet share, I think it\u2019s one, we are \u2013 we\u2019re sort of a \u2013 we\u2019re an underlying provider to these companies as they scale their infrastructure. And I think that is allowing us to play in a very significant way. But then, also capturing net new markets. I think if you look at service providers, for example, the number of service providers and the life cycle from a small service provider to a scaled service provider is changing in this sort of more cloud-centric world. And so I think we\u2019re going to continue to have opportunities against both new market expansion, product line extension and new customer growth. All of those things I think are going to be drivers growth for us over time. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Operator : And our next caller is Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Brett Feldman : Thanks for taking the question. Yes, thanks for taking the question. So, Keith, it was good to hear in your comments, your expectation that you\u2019re going to continue to see full year churn towards the low end of the range that you\u2019ve targeted. I think to a casual observer that would sound very surprising, right? Because it\u2019s a sort of a broadly difficult macro environment. We talked here about slow down and spending on cloud and obviously you pushed through some pretty significant price increases recently. And so I was hoping you can maybe elaborate on what gives you confidence that you\u2019re going to continue to see low churn and then just maybe remind us when you do see churn, what is driving it and has that shifted at all from what you\u2019ve historically seen? Thanks. Keith Taylor : Yes. I think, first and foremost, it\u2019s a great question. And our confidence really comes from the fact that the team does a deep analysis into our customers. I know surprise to you, when you look at our top 10 customers, again, it\u2019s on the charts, but top 10 customers represent about 18% of our revenues. The top 50 represent about 37%, 38% of our revenues. We have a really long tail. And so we have great visibility into \u2013 particularly into our larger customers and what they\u2019re doing. So that\u2019s the first thing. The second thing is it\u2019s critical infrastructure. And it\u2019s not to suggest that companies don\u2019t struggle financially or there\u2019s consolidation or they choose to bifurcate their infrastructure choose or even just choose to do something completely different. But overall, when the majority of our growth comes from the install base and we\u2019re continuing to deliver very high quality assets with a very high operational standard around the world, we just tend not to suffer the same level of churn that we had previously. And from my point of view, it\u2019s the deep analysis of the team\u2019s done and the visibility into what we see going forward that gives us confidence that we\u2019re not going to see any meaningful churn beyond what we\u2019ve guided to. And Brett, the other \u2013 last thing I would just say that if we there\u2019s visibility to something that comes in size, we\u2019re going to telegraph it anyway. But there\u2019s just no indication that exists. And it goes back to what is the customer fundamentally doing inside our business and can the grow and scale? And that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing is those customers continue to buy more services, enter into new services, and then as we introduce new service offerings, I think it\u2019s just an enhancement or even a limiter to the amount of churn that we\u2019re going to experience as a company, because we provide alternatives. So we\u2019re not a one trick pony. So that would give, that sort of, gives you I guess, the overall sense then. Let me leave it there. Brett Feldman : Okay. Thank you. Keith Taylor : Charles, would you add anything? Charles Meyers : No, I mean, I think, in terms of character of the churn, I think there\u2019s a certain amount of ours that is more frictional churn associated with people evolving their footprints, how they\u2019re serving in customers. That\u2019s particularly true in network providers and some other service provider types. I think that, I think you are seeing, you are going to continue to see some level of cloud migration workloads that are well adapted to the cloud ought to go there. I always \u2013 I keep sort of reiterating that, and so I think we see some level of that, but more typical \u2013 most typically that is in the context of sort of an evolution towards a long-term hybrid multi-cloud architecture state that really plays to our strengths. And the last comment I would make is that we keep, we always say this regard to churn, the best defense against churn is getting the right opportunities to begin with. And so sales discipline and executing as I\u2019ve talked about earlier and in the script, that\u2019s really central to sort of maintaining that churn. And I think our teams have done a great job on that. And interestingly, I guess the last category I\u2019d give you when we do M&A, you find that there\u2019s often sort of a churn tale that comes from that because people underwrite to a different sort of an approach. And so, you saw that in Verizon and you look at \u2013 we now are reaping the other side of that as we\u2019ve sort of managed through that. And I\u2019ll tell you that transaction is looking super attractive, right? And so I think you see some of that comes on the back end of M&A transactions that\u2019s a sort of a third category. Charles Meyers : Thank you, everyone. This concludes our Q1 earnings call.",

Charles Meyers : Thank you, Chip. Good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As reflected in our results, Equinix continues to enjoy momentum in our business as digital transformation accelerates the pace of innovation and changes the way business is done. By 2026, IDC is forecasting that 40% of revenue from G2000 companies will come from digital products, services and experiences, a dynamic that is reshaping the basis of competition in nearly every industry and making digital an unprecedented force for economic growth. These secular drivers, combined with an accelerating appetite for companies to rapidly integrate AI into their operations are driving increased demand for data center capacity as a broad range of service providers extend and scale their global infrastructure to support the clear enterprise commitment to hybrid and multicloud as the IT architecture of choice. Equinix remains exceptionally well positioned to respond to this demand environment, delivering against the need for infrastructure that is more distributed, more cloud connected, more sustainable and more ecosystem-centric than ever before. Against this backdrop, we had a great second quarter with solid gross and net bookings, very strong pricing dynamics, excellent pipeline conversion and healthy new logo growth. We continue to drive disciplined sales execution at scale with more than 4,100 deals in the quarter across more than 3,100 customers, demonstrating the continued strength of our unmatched go-to-market machine and approach.  Turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q2 were $2.02 billion, up 14% year-over-year driven by strong recurring revenue growth, power price increases and timing of xScale fees. Adjusted EBITDA was up 7% year-over-year, and AFFO was again better than our expectations due to strong operating performance. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. With customers deployed in all three regions now representing approximately 2/3 of our recurring revenues, we continue to invest behind the scale and reach of our data center services portfolio. We now have 53 major projects underway across 40 metros in 24 countries, including 11 xScale builds that we expect will deliver approximately 90 megawatts of capacity once opened.  This quarter, we added 12 new projects, including new data center builds in Lisbon, Monterrey, Mumbai and our first build in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Over the past several years, we have seen Malaysia emerge as an increasingly important location for digital infrastructure. By expanding Platform Equinix in Johor and Kuala Lumpur, the two most strategic markets in Malaysia, we will enable local and global businesses to leverage our trusted platform to bring together and interconnect the foundational digital infrastructure that will power their success. Additionally, we are delighted with the recently announced results of Singapore's data center call for application, where Equinix was one of a very limited set of participants selected to build incremental data center capacity in the critical Singaporean market.  Equinix is honored to have this opportunity to strengthen Singapore's digital capabilities, delivering sustainable infrastructure that will fuel the economy, cultivate critical ecosystems and aligned to Singapore's green plan. Multi-region customer wins this quarter included Cogent Communications, a U.S. multinational ISP using Equinix's robust ecosystem and interconnection platform to optimize and enhance their global services and Apcela a provider of software-defined cloud-optimized networks for digitally transforming global enterprises as they leverage Equinix Fabric and other digital services for low-latency network and cloud connectivity. Our global interconnection franchise continues to thrive with over 456,000 total interconnections on our platform. In Q2, interconnection revenue stepped up 11% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, driven by healthy pricing, increasing traffic levels and strong gross adds. Net interconnection adds remain on the lower side at 4,100 due to continued grooming activity and consolidation into higher bandwidth connections, but the number of unique interconnection relationships across our platform continues to expand with over 110,000 unique pairs, reflecting the exceptional value of our scaled digital ecosystems.  Equinix Fabric had another strong quarter with total virtual connections passing 50,000 for the first time and the addition of new capabilities to support data-intensive workloads like AI and cloud migration. Beginning in the third quarter, Fabric customers will be able to provision virtual connections to cloud providers with bandwidth up to 50 gig per second with Google Cloud as the first cloud partner to support this capability. Internet exchange saw strength in our EMEA and APAC markets with peak traffic up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 25% year-over-year to nearly 32 terabits per second.  Key interconnection customer wins this quarter included a gaming and entertainment company, expanding interconnection across all three regions to optimize the gamer experience and PEER 1 a Brazilian telco leveraging Platform Equinix to establish its digital presence through network hubs, beginning with South America and Miami.  Turning to our xScale portfolio. We continue to see strong overall demand as cloud adoption remains a driving force in digital transformation. In Q2, we leased 10 megawatts of capacity in our Osaka 2 asset with cumulative xScale leasing now over 200 megawatts globally, and we have a strong funnel of additional scale opportunities for the back half of the year. We also won three new native cloud on-ramps this quarter in Bogot\u00e1, Madrid and Toronto, further strengthening our cloud ecosystem, which represents nearly 15% of total interconnection on our platform. Key enterprise to cloud ecosystem wins this quarter, including one of the largest auto insurers in the U.S., continuing to expand interconnections on our platform to optimize its networks and multi-cloud connectivity and a leading European automotive company deploying at Equinix to support reliable and scalable connectivity to the cloud worldwide.  As businesses increasingly look to consume their digital infrastructure at software speed, we're continuing to enhance our platform strategy and expand our partnerships. In Q2, we announced our expanded partnership with Hewlett Packard Enterprise for pre-provisioned HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise and HPE GreenLake for private cloud business addition, both available on demand at select Equinix IBX data centers. These new offerings in 7 metros around the globe will help businesses expand their hybrid multi-cloud strategies, while providing greater agility, control and predictability of workload costs and data. Additional key digital services wins this quarter included Bionexo to Brazil, a health tech company that offers digital solutions for managing health care processes, using fabric and network edge for seamless connections with partners and customers, while reducing complexity and cost. Telna, a global mobile network infrastructure provider using Platform Equinix to facilitate its marketplace for cellular connectivity among its customers. Our Channel program delivered another strong quarter, accounting for 40% of bookings and nearly 60% of new logos.  We continue to see growth from partners like Accenture, Avant, Dell, Cisco and HPE with wins across a wide range of industry verticals and digital use cases. Key wins this quarter included partnering with Kyndryl to support a large American health insurance provider with their network and application modernization efforts, featuring the deployment of cloud adjacent infrastructure and interconnection to the health care ecosystem. Now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Keith Taylor : Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you're all doing well and enjoying the summer months. I must say it was great to be back in New York City spending time with many of you at our June Analyst Day in person. As you might have guessed, we were excited to share with you our views on the expanding market opportunity. Our continued ability to manage through this dynamic and complex global environment, while working to maximize the value of our business. And perhaps, most importantly, share our thoughts on how we believe we can deliver durable shareholder value. Now as you can see from our Q2 earnings report, we again delivered solid results, while addressing many of the complexities affecting our business. We had solid gross and net bookings and positive pricing dynamics reflecting the continued momentum we see in the market. Overall, we continue to focus on driving a higher yield on both our new and existing investments. On a constant currency basis, including our net positive pricing actions, Global MRR per cabinet was up $39 quarter-over-quarter to $2,156 per cabinet. Now given the tight supply environment across many of our metros and the high utilization levels across our portfolio, we remain very focused on our strategy of putting the right customer with the right application into the right IBX. Also, we're being particularly selective at backfilling space in certain constrained markets, focusing on high price points and increased power densities. As a result, the timing of these deployments may create some fluctuations in our quarterly net cabinet billing metric, an outcome we're actively managing across all three regions. This is positively offset by strong stabilized asset growth, higher MRR per cabinet and better returns on our invested capital. Turning to some of the macro factors affecting our business. We remain pleased with how the organization has mitigated the impacts of energy price volatility across our business and with our customers. Concessions and distributes remain low and our cash collections are in line with historical trends. As it relates to our foreign operating currencies, we continue to hedge where appropriate to dampen the volatility attributed to the actions of many central banks to adjust interest rates. Also, we made some modest FX to our 2023 outlook, largely attributable to the recent devaluation of the Nigerian naira and the weaker Japanese yen, two of the currencies that we do not hedge. Now let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Note that all comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q2 revenues were $2.018 billion, up 14% over the same quarter last year due to strong recurring revenues, power price increases and the timing of xScale nonrecurring fees. As we've noted before, nonrecurring revenues, particularly those attributable to our xScale business and certain custom installation works are inherently lumpy. Hence, NRR was down quarter-over-quarter as planned. But given our significant scale pipeline, we expect to see a meaningful step-up in NRR in the second half of the year. Q2 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $3 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates.  Global Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $901 million or 45% of revenues, up 7% over the same quarter last year due to strong operating performance, including an $11 million one-off software expense related to our Americas managed services business and higher variable salaries and benefit costs. Also, Q2 saw certain EMEA energy contracts reset at higher average rates resulting in increased net utility costs as forecasted. Q2 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges included a $2 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance range and $3 million of integration costs. Global Q2 AFFO was $754 million, above our expectation due to strong business performance and lower net interest expense. Q2 AFFO included a $1 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance range. Global Q2 MRR churn was 2.3%. For the full year, we continue to expect MRR churn to average at the lower half of our 2% to 2.5% quarterly guidance range.  Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized and constant currency basis, EMEA and APAC were our fastest-growing regions at 21% and 16%, respectively. Although when excluding the impact of the benefit attributed to the power price increases, EMEA and APAC region growth rates were 8% and 11%, respectively, while the Americas region grew 7% year-over-year. The Americas region had another solid quarter with continued strong pricing trends, solid momentum from our channel and public sector teams and healthy exports across the global platform. We had strong activity in Boston, Chicago and Culpeper metros and the Canadian business.  Our EMEA business delivered a solid quarter with firm pricing, continued lower churn and a healthy step-up in deal volume. Revenue was down slightly due to the timing of large NRR deals between quarters. We had strength come from our Amsterdam, Dublin and Frankfurt metros, while booking a substantial space and power deal in Lagos, Nigeria with a large multinational energy company, highlighting the momentum across our platform, including our MainOne assets. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a strong quarter with record net bookings and firm deal pricing as well as strong imports to our Mumbai, Osaka and Singapore markets. And as evidenced by the number of new expansions, Chennai, Jakarta, Johor, Kuala Lumpur, customer interest in expanding their footprint into new Asian markets is high, and we're investing behind this demand.  And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our balance sheet increased slightly to approximately $31.6 billion, including an unrestricted cash balance of over $2.3 billion. As expected, our cash balance decreased slightly quarter-over-quarter due to our investment in growth CapEx and a quarterly cash dividend, offset by our strong operating cash flows. Our net leverage remains low at 3.6x our annualized adjusted EBITDA. And as mentioned previously, we plan to opportunistically raise additional debt capital and reduce rate environments where we currently operate. This will create both incremental debt capital to fund our growth and placed a natural hedge into these markets. Additionally, during the quarter, we executed about $200 million of ATM forward sale transactions, which will be settled in early 2024 to help fund our 2024 growth plans alongside our other sources of capital.  Turning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $638 million, including a recurring CapEx of $40 million. Since our last earnings call, we opened 7 retail projects across both the Americas and EMEA regions and two xScale projects in Frankfurt and Tokyo. Revenue from owned assets increased to 64% of our recurring revenues for the quarter. We expect this trend to continue with over 85% of our expansion CapEx spend on owned or long-term ground lease properties, including 100% of our 16 bills in the Americas.  Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our now 174 stabilized assets increased revenues by 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Taking out the benefit attributed to the power price increases, stabilized assets increased 7% year-over-year. Our stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And finally, please to refer to Slides 11 through 15 for our updated summary of 2023 guidance and bridges. Do not all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. For the full year 2023, we're maintaining our underlying revenue outlook with expected top line growth of 14% to 15% or 9% to 10%, excluding the impact of power cost pass-through to our customers, a reflection of our continued strong execution. We're raising our underlying 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $20 million, primarily due to favorable operating costs and lower integration spend. And we're raising our underlying AFFO guidance by $28 million to now grow between 11% and 14% compared to the previous year. AFFO per share is now expected to grow between 9% and 11%.  CapEx is expected to range between $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, including approximately $120 million of on balance sheet xScale spend, which we expect to be reimbursed as we transfer assets into the JV later this year or early next year and about $220 million of recurring CapEx spend.  So let me stop here, and I'll turn the call back to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Keith. In closing, we had a strong first half of the year and continue to see a robust demand environment as key secular drivers positively influence buying behavior even in the face of a challenging macro climate. The relevance of Platform Equinix continues to grow as service providers scale out their global infrastructure in response to growing enterprise demand for hybrid and multi-cloud as the architecture of choice and the associated need for hybrid infrastructure to deliver performance, agility, scalability and sustainability. In this context, we believe Equinix remains uniquely positioned and highly differentiated and will continue to drive disciplined execution of our strategy with a focus on extending our market leadership, driving operating leverage, expanding our platform capabilities to fuel sustained growth and delivering superior returns on capital, all of which we are confident will translate to distinctive and durable value for our customers, and sustained performance for you, our investors, with a keen focus on AFFO per share as our lighthouse metric.  So let me stop there and open it up for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Ari Klein : Maybe on the AI front and as it relates to xScale, there are some exceptionally large leases being done with the vast majority of those in the U.S. where xScale doesn't have a presence. How are you thinking about potentially entering the market capture some of that demand? Charles Meyers : Yes. We've talked about this in a few different forms. I do think that our posture has probably evolved a little bit in terms of our thinking around xScale in the Americas broadly and in the U.S. specifically. And I think AI is part of that. And so it's not the only factor, but I do think we had already been thinking about certain markets where we believe that -- what we see, as I said around the world, is that the markets where we have the full portfolio xScale retail digital services at scale, really perform best. I mean you can argue a little bit of whether it's chicken or egg there in terms of what's driving what. But it's -- what we do see is that when we have the full portfolio, we're able to address a broader set of customer demands. And so I think as we looked at that, we do think that there are markets in the U.S. that we would like to have an xScale presence. And so we're -- I think we're looking at how we would do that and potentially through a combination of organic and potentially inorganic pursuits.  So I do think that AI is a part of that, but really only a part. And I think that the continued demand for cloud services and the commitment to cloud adoption, I think, continues at pace with the enterprise, all of that driving really a strong pipeline across the world and it does lead us to believe that thinking about how to solve for xScale in Americas is something that is on our mind. Ari Klein : And then just the Americas and EMEA saw cabinet decline. It sounds like maybe there was some timing and churn potentially there. Can you provide some color on some of the moving pieces? And maybe give us a sense of the size of the backlog? Charles Meyers : Sure. Yes. I mean I'd start with the backlog question and tell you that backlog continues to be very healthy. We do see -- as we've said over the years, billable cabs can really be a pretty volatile metric, and it can swing meaningfully both due to timing of installs and therefore, backlog and in particular, churn activity. Undoubtedly, we recognize that billable cab has to grow over time to fuel the business. But we do see short-term fluctuations in that metric as we really optimize the platform. So if you look at it, as you noted, we've always encouraged people to really look at rolling forward quarter averages because of that volatility.  If you look at Americas running about 90%, the rolling four quarter is about 90% of what it's been for the last three years, typically. EMEA is actually -- its rolling fourth quarter average is actually meaningfully ahead of what the three-year average is and APAC is lower with three consecutive quarters of really lower cab adds, but it's a bit of a unique dynamic in APAC related to some of the capacity constraints in Asia particularly Singapore, which is why we are so excited to have been able to announce the allocation of capacity to Equinix in the Singaporean market. So we -- I think that we're comfortable there. There is some churn activity that I think is in the markets and some backlog that I think is going to roll through.  And so I think we'll -- when we look at that on a rolling four-quarter basis, I think we'll see those things normalize a bit. But let me -- and we knew this would be a kind of issue. So I want to maybe give you a little more concrete insight into the billable caps. If you look at it specifically on the churn side, over the past 5 quarters, we've had about 7 deployments of meaningful size churn. And 85% of that total cab volume coming from those churns are what we would consider favorable churn.  Basically, cabs that are in constrained markets where we really welcome the additional capacity and consolidate a very positive mark-to-market. And given the trajectory right now that we're seeing in the market on pricing, on power density, on interconnection, and as we refill those cabs at prevailing prices and power densities, we actually expect uplifts on those three -- about the -- 85% of those cabs in the 50% to 70% MRR uplift range. So that's just a reflection of kind of the kinds of actions that we're taking to optimize the platform that have impacts on billable cabs but really positive impacts and upside in terms of we look at it, and we believe we're going to get millions of dollars of extra MRR by sort of turning those cabinets over or tens of millions on an annual basis with zero CapEx. And so that's some of the dynamic that you're seeing there, and I think it will move around a bit as we identify that. Now there's not that many of those out there. And so that's -- but that is a dynamic that is -- has impacted the billable cabs a bit over the last couple of quarters. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael Rollins : Curious if you can unpack a bit more of the stabilized constant currency growth without the power price increases that I think was set at 7% year-over-year. in the quarter? And as you look at the opportunities that you were just describing in terms of re-leasing opportunities and the current environment, what's your -- is there an updated view of what stabilized organic growth should look like for Equinix over the next few years? Charles Meyers : Yes. It's a good question, Mike. I do think that we had guided to a range lower than certainly that 7% that we're seeing, absent the PPIs Obviously, PPIs are having a major impact there and reflected in as reported at 10%, but I think that's not really a valid number because that will bounce around a little bit, and we'll based on what's happening with power pricing. But I do think that 7%, obviously, is a very attractive level. I do think that we're seeing that pricing right now is very firm. We are raising -- we've raised prices on our underlying colo products and on interconnection meaningfully and continue to see strong demand and stable churn. And so I think that's going to be a positive factor.  The other one that I just mentioned in the previous conversation, a little bit about billable cabs is power densities. Power densities are definitely on the rise. And so some of the churn activity that I just talked about there, those 37 deployments were -- many of them are in stabilized assets. And so you're going to see uplift there as you turn some of that over. So long answer or non-answer to your question in terms of what is the right range, obviously, I think we have been talking about 3 to 5, 7 is obviously nicely above that. I would certainly hope that -- I do think the current dynamic of pricing in the market is a major driver. And so we'll just track that and see how we -- but obviously, we love being above that guided top end. And if we feel like that's a sustained trajectory, we'll come back and look at that. Michael Rollins : And if I could just follow up with one other. You mentioned the variability of the power side of the equation. And as you're looking at the pricing environment for power specifically, any updates of how power pricing and power revenues and those surcharges might look for 2024? Charles Meyers : Yes. I figured that might come up, too, Mike. So the -- what I'd say is that we are -- obviously, we're just a little over halfway through the year. We've been hedging into our positions. And in some markets, hedging in at rates that are below where we had been previously, and in some cases, a bit somewhat materially below that. Obviously, we still have a significant portion of our hedging positions yet to fill. And there's a lot of the year left. And so it's impossible, I think, for us to predict exactly what will happen. So I don't want to be too concrete on this matter. But I would think that there might be some markets if current course continues, where we will hedge into a rate '24 that is below what it was in '23.  And as we said to our customers, and I think as we've communicated to our customers, they really sort of embraced and understood the benefits that our hedging program provides -- and we've told them if that is to -- would occur, we would pass that through to you as well. And so I think how many markets that might occur in, not sure. But as we said when we provided the guide and when we provided at Analyst Day and in other forums, said, look, we're -- this sort of assumes nothing relative to power price increases or decreases, and we'll adjust that accordingly or sort of normalize it out because what's really important from our perspective is the underlying performance of the business. And while we do recognize that power price, for example, has some impact on the optics margin. I think it really isn't an underlying fundamental sort of impact on the business.  And so we'll let you know. A shorter answer would be, I do think that we may see some markets in which we would see a PD or a price decrease next year and others that we would see it flat and perhaps others would see it go up. But still more work to do in terms of hedging into our positions, and we'll keep you updated as we know more. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Atkin with RBC. Jonathan Atkin : Yes, a couple of questions. I was curious just about decision time frames by customers closing rates, book-to-bill, that sort of thing? And then if you look at stabilized gross margins, it looks like that was down and I forgot if you might have mentioned this earlier, but why the pressure on stabilized gross margins? Charles Meyers : Yes. I'll let Keith tackle the second one. I'll give you the first one, I'll give you a little color on the quarter. Really solid quarter from a bookings perspective. And I think we saw even though I think there are some customers who continue to be cautious in the overall environment. What we saw in Q1, as we told you, we saw a little more deal slippage from Q1 into Q2, but we had said that close rates were pretty consistent. In Q2, we saw the same thing that actually very good pipeline conversion, and we saw sales cycles not really extended very much in line with our historical norms. And we saw the push rate from quarter-to-quarter actually come -- bounced back to where it had been previously. So I would say overall, a very solid quarter. I do think the dynamic that we described previously, which is some customers just being cautious about how much capacity they're buying, obviously, negotiating hard, which is a norm for us those kind of dynamics. And then in some cases, going back and if they have more capacity than they need coming back and having a dialogue with us about whether we want to take some of that back. And as I said, that is a bit of the dynamic coloring some of our -- because we see opportunities but look very favorable for us to do that. We'll take advantage of and that's some of what's impacting the billable cabs numbers. So overall, though, I would say, I feel good about the quarter from a sales execution standpoint and from an overall customer sentiment standpoint and also feel good about where we are in terms of overall funnel for the second half of the year. So obviously, we have a big hill to climb every quarter in terms of a lot of deals. 4,100 deals in a quarter, you got to do a lot of selling, but our team, I think, had a really strong Q2 and our -- and based on my customer visits and time with the sales teams, I think there's a lot of optimism for the second half of the year. Keith Taylor : Jon, relating to the second part of the question, just no surprise. You've seen that you'll see the sort of the margin erosion across a number of the key metrics, whether it's on a total basis, whether it's in Europe or whether it's in the stabilized assets, it's primarily related to the reset of the of the energy contracts. As you look at the first quarter, we had the benefit, if you will, of contracts -- the power contracts where they were. But as they reset, was there was a meaningful step up in the second quarter, and that was felt throughout a number of our core metrics.  And as they look forward, most of that is now going to stabilize, which is the good part. And that was all factored into the pricing sort of structure that we had when we started the year. We anticipated what the price points were going to be on an average basis, and that was the rate at which we pass through to our customers. Jonathan Atkin : And then lastly, I wonder if you're seeing any tailwinds in segments of your cost connect business that you would attribute to AI given that you might expect a little bit of an uptick in connectivity requirements as these training models get spun up. Are you seeing that at all or not? Charles Meyers : We've seen specific instances of interconnect to support AI. In fact, we had a pretty significant win this quarter in the AI realm with an AI-as-a-service provider that really put their core network nodes with us to really drive interconnection to the multi-cloud connectivity and really to support the inference and interconnection to the cloud. And so we did see that -- I wouldn't say that's likely shown up. In fact, that hasn't shown up in our results yet because we just booked a deal. But I think that's indicative of some of what's going on there, it's probably a little tough to tell.  Interestingly, on interconnect, Jon, what I would say is that we've seen really strong gross add activity, and it's really in line with our nine quarter averages. And so that's, I think, a really encouraging sign. And in fact, interconnect to cloud at the end is up meaningfully year-over-year. It was moderated a little by the financial ecosystem, which was a little down year-over-year in terms of gross adds, but we're very stable on the Intersect side in terms of gross adds. And so -- and I'm sure that some of that is attributable to AI.  And then -- but then on the churn side, we are seeing a little bit more -- you're also seeing a little more churn activity with cloud as a VM, but more between service provider types, cloud to cloud, cloud to network, et cetera. And so -- and that's, I think, a lot of grooming, a lot of 10 to 100 migration and some M&A activity. So I gave you a little more there than you were looking for on interconnect. But I do think that we're -- you're going to see a lot of data transfer happening. And I think we're just really well positioned on that in terms of our multi-cloud connectivity and the sort of more advanced nature of fabric in terms of being more agile to that demand over time.  So we're excited about that opportunity, and that certainly is coming up a lot out there in the market is as people are talking about it. And really, I think more -- a lot on the service provider side, but also enterprise is really talking about the things they're doing to bring AI into their operations. Operator : And our next question is from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : You talked about the power density requirements a couple of times. So how are you thinking about that strategically? Are there redesigns or retrofitting you're thinking about doing to your IBXs? And how does that impact the scales that you've built so far and that you might build from here? I know people like Meta have been reconsidering data center design. Charles Meyers : Yes. Yes. And we certainly are actively thinking about what our -- the evolution of our design and ensuring that it's evolving and keeping pace with the market. In our retail space, we do have the -- what's really nice about the retail business is when you serve a very broad range of customers with differing density requirements, you're able to sort of dense up and extract more from the system over time. And we've really, I think, benefited from that. When you in more of the hyperscale or xScale type arena it's a little more challenging. I think you have to just be -- because you allocate all that power out typically to a single customer or maybe two in a facility, and it's a little bit different.  And so I do think average density -- design densities are going to need to be going up. I think that also to your ability to cooling is often the constraint. And I think there are -- we are actively looking at, in fact, in our innovation center in D.C., we're actively looking at and testing liquid cooling as a way to get more out of our current designs as well as implement as a more standard feature in our go-forward designs. And so I do think we're going to -- you're going to be seeing design densities going up and you're also going to be seeing us use technologies to augment existing facilities to get more out of them. Operator : Our next call is Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Eric Luebchow : One for Keith. I think you mentioned the nonrecurring side of the business would see a material step-up in the back half. And so maybe you could provide us a little more color on that. Is that more custom install work, xScale fees, maybe just the right run rate to think about for NRR as we look out the remainder of the year? Keith Taylor : Yes. As you can tell from the guidance we delivered and we've said -- Charles has mentioned a few times, the recurring aspect of our business is performing exceedingly well. The nonrecurring, a lot of what you experienced, particularly with the step-ups and the step downs it relates to the xScale fees. As you're wholly aware, there's two nonrecurring xScale fees and there are two recurring xScalev fees. As it relates to the nonrecurring, it's really the sales and marketing fee that has the biggest impact to our business.  So as we said, the pipeline is very deep. There's a lot of opportunity that's right in front of us. And so we anticipate that there will be a very large set of fees that get earned over the second half of the year. Right now, we're targeting that to be in the fourth quarter. I guess there's always a scenario where it could be the third quarter, but it's really -- it's a second half anticipated close. And so with that, that's what we've got in the guidance.  And then on top of that, of course, the recurring part of our business is still -- you're seeing a nice meaningful step-up on that and you just have to go to the midpoint of the guidance over the rest of the year. And you can see that, that one of those quarters is going to be one of the largest step-up you've ever seen in our history. But part of that, of course, is driven from the nonrecurring fees. Eric Luebchow : Great. And just one follow-up. If I look at churn, it ticked up a little bit to 2.3%. Just wanted to confirm, is that related to some of the volatility you're seeing with cabinet build metrics you mentioned earlier in the call, some of the network grooming on cross-connects? Any way to think about how we should think about churn going forward, still in the lower end of the 2% range? Or will it be a little more variable based on what you said earlier? Charles Meyers : Yes. And that's so much related to the interconnection because that does -- on a net basis, probably not having -- not a huge driver on the churn metric. But it is related in part to those deployments that I talked about when I was giving color on the billable cabs that related to churns that we view as favorable. Again, those 37 deployments, the 85% of those cabs are going to have mark-to-market that are in the 50% to 70% positive range. And so that's -- we're take those when we can get them. And so -- and several of those in Singapore. And so we will -- even with our additional allocation, that's out there in the future. in terms of build. And so it's a precious resource to have capacity in the Singaporean market, particularly capacity that has the kind of characteristics that we do in terms of cloud proximity and sort of network density and ability to drive the performance, et cetera.  And so we'll take that capacity. And those are some of the things that led to us seeing a little bit of an uptick there. But as we said in the prepared remarks, we're comfortable that we, on average, for the year, will end in sort of the lower part of our guided range. And you may see a little spikes in there like we did a little bit higher this quarter, but that generally is probably more attributable to favorable type turn activity. Keith Taylor : And Eric just maybe just add 1 other thing. As we look forward, and Charles alluded to earlier on, as we think about some of the negotiations we have to get back capacity in some highly constrained assets and markets, part of that is Singapore. And so we are working on 1 thing that clearly we'll identify it if we come to an appropriate negotiated outcome. But suffice to say, those are the examples of things that cause those small blips, but we're going to -- we'll sort of call it out for you. Operator : Our next caller is David Barden with Bank of America. David Barden : I guess Charles, when you look at the kind of the global landscape and you start extrapolating the dynamic that we've started to see in places like Northern Virginia, or Toronto, Mexico City, Southern Valley, how should we, as investors, think about the P versus V equation as power availability kind of constrict V and how do you think about your ability to ramp the P on the price to kind of monetize that scarcity element of the business that you're in? Charles Meyers : Yes, there's a lot in that question. On the -- on peak times V or Q or whichever you prefer, it's -- I think we're definitely seeing a firm pricing environment. And I think that's true of the data capacity industry at large. But I think that we see -- we obviously operate in the retail side of the business at a very different price point than the prevailing broader industry, which I think is -- centers more around a wholesale or hyperscale type price point. But both are on the rise, and I think that's going to continue to be the case for a bit of time here. I think in terms of volumes, I think volumes are also going to grow.  The question of whether or not power availability would constrain supply is an interesting question. I think that it could in market by market, but I think that -- on our side, we feel very comfortable that our relationships and our visibility to power allocations are going to allow us to continue to execute on the build plan that we have in place.  On the xScale side, I think it's a little more challenging, but we are actively working with the folks to make sure the identity that. And we're also actively looking at alternatives. And for example, things like on-site power generation, I think, are probably more of a reality in some of those -- in that market over time. So done that in certain markets. In fact, our recent Dublin facility has on-site power generation with fuel cells, natural gas-based fuel cells as a primary source of power. We actually use Bloom Energy fuel cells in Silicon Valley, not as a primary source but as a -- but I think that's -- I think we're going to continue to see trends in that area. So I don't -- and I also think that you're going to see that if necessary, the positioning of certain forms of data center capacity, particularly in the hyperscale area and some of AI training may adapt to simply go where the power is. And so I think that you may see some of that movement as well. So I don't think quantity is going to be material constrained -- materially constrained in our retail business by power availability, but it is something that I think we, as an industry, need to continue to grapple with. David Barden : And as a follow-up to that, specifically to that point about going to where the power is, do you see a shift in your CapEx allocation into kind of, let's just call it, more novel land bank development opportunities? Obviously, we've seen reports that Meta, for instance, is looking to do a gigawatt in Wisconsin or other places like this that would not tend to be in the traditional geography of data centers? Charles Meyers : Yes. Short answer is not yet. And in fact, obviously, the vast majority of our demand and our revenue and our profitability is sourced from sort of our large campus environments around the world, and that's where bulk of our land has been. You're seeing the rise in our sort of owned asset revenue because we're continuing to build now on owned land and owned facilities around the world. And so the bulk of our land bank is really still going towards that. That doesn't mean we'd necessarily be opposed to that. I think that would more likely be xScale type thing, which would probably run through the -- but I do think those are the kinds of things that we have to be thinking about. I do think in terms of more -- some of our xScale though, I think, is going to be more approximate to our campus locations in those areas where we think we can support that. But I don't think it's out of the question we do that. But right now, the shorter answer to the question is no, that's not really yet part of our equation. Keith Taylor : David, I just probably note just on the number of projects that we have underway across 40 markets today. Again, we're in we're actually spreading our capital far and wide to capture the opportunity in most of the sort of the major centers around the globe. And as a result, that's going to be, I think, more of the emphasis going forward, smaller byte sizes that make sense, and particularly those ones that are adjacent or contiguous with their existing facilities. And that's just what you're seeing. And then you heard us talk a little bit about, at least in the prepared remarks, the new markets that we're sort of entering into.  And so we'll continue to push our advantages in our -- in the markets that we have today, but also go to markets where others are less likely to go and we get to enjoy the sort of the experiences of the retail business versus just focusing on hyperscale. Operator : Our next caller is Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman : Keith, I want to come back to some of the comments you made in your prepared remarks about dealing with some stresses in the supply chain. Obviously, you've been grappling with that to some degree for a number of years now. I'm just curious how broad-based is it? Is it concentrated in the market? Is it around certain elements that go into development? And then just to clarify, is that distinct to the quite literal physical supply chain? Or were you embedding within that challenges associated with power procurement improvement? Keith Taylor : Yes, Brett, just generally speaking, given the demand for data centers and all things surrounded, to that industry. The supply chains continue to be constricted. And I think even at the Analyst Day, Charles made a reference to the fact that generator 3-megawatt generated today has roughly 120-week time line. So it gives you a sense of how far out you have to start thinking and planning. And so one of the things that we tried to emphasize at the Analyst Day was we look at look at all our markets, all of the projects and determine exactly what we need where and then we have a very sophisticated procurement team that focuses on making sure we work with the larger providers and get availability either to production capacity or a slot in the production line or available capacity from the inventories. .  And I just think that's something that we prudently do. We manage ourselves, and it's something that's going to be very important on a look-forward basis as well. And you have to tie that back into the comments Charles made about power. Demand, you have to have the available power, you have the available cooling and making sure that you have the appropriate kit to roll out the data centers in a fair way that you can deliver the capacity to the need. And again, a lot of work is done on that.  The team -- the construction -- the design, construction, procurement sourcing teams are all working together in tandem, and we look out 5 years. And in some cases, as I said, we'll go out as far as 10 or 15 years like the London market where we see a broad future opportunity as well. Charles Meyers : Yes. Brett, I'd add that I do think that one thing I did mention previously I'll put in there now is that I think one of the really critical factors in ensuring availability for what is inevitably going to be a somewhat constrained resource on power in places around the world is to bring forward really thoughtful approach to sustainability. So -- and that was one of the driving forces, I believe, in terms of our successfully getting an allocation in Singapore. And so similarly, I think our ability to work closely with -- and I've been on the phone with utility CEOs in the recent past talking about these topics in terms of how to put our heads together and try to for some of these things and sustainability has to be, I think, part of that picture.  And so I do think that that's something we're going to bring to the table. We're going to lean in and really continue our market-leading emphasis on sustainability, not only for our customers but in tandem with our partners on the utility side as well. And so I think those are other factors that I think come into play when we really think about the power issue. Operator : Our next caller is Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Matt Niknam : Just a couple of like housekeeping ones for me. First, if you can comment on what drove the slight increase? I think it was about $10 million increase of recurring CapEx. And then also, I noticed DSO stepped up somewhat modestly. I think accounts receivable is about a headwind of $100 million in the quarter. Just wondering if there's anything that you'd call out beyond typical 2Q seasonality? Keith Taylor : Yes. On the first one, just recurring CapEx is when you look at it year-over-year, Q2 tends to be -- Q1 is our lowest spend on a seasonal basis, Q2 we're sort of right on line with where we thought would be 2% and that was consistent with last year. And then you see over the next two quarters, we step it up even further. So part of it is just timing and making sure we do the work that we need to, based on the needs inside the different buildings. And as a result, it'll move around by quarter, but we can sort of massage at times into different quarters. But I would just say nothing meaningfully has caused that. It was an $18 million step up quarter-over-quarter just to be exact about it.  As it relates to DSOs, as I said in the prepared remarks, our DSOs, our recovery has gone up a little bit. But what I would tell you is some of the things that we've been working on with our customers, as you can appreciate, I said there's not -- there's certainly some discussion around the power price increases. And although we're ahead of what we anticipated, there's still some negotiations. And as a result, our DSOs had moved up a bit. Customers weren't -- some of the customers weren't paying their entire bill instead of just disputing what the power price increase was, the whole bill was being held back. And some of those have since been made in the July time frame. And so DSO, I think you're going to see that step back down to a more traditional level.  But overall, I'd just say you've got liquidity in the business, the cash we're generating and the collections you'll get some seasonality. We're running ahead of what we anticipated we'd be for the third quarter already. And as I said, I think DSO is an average days delinquent will go down. Matt Niknam : Keith, just to clarify, it was more on the guide for recurring CapEx. I think that stepped up $10 million relative to the prior guide for the year. So I was just wondering if there's anything notable to be aware of there? Keith Taylor : I'm sorry, I misunderstood your question then. As it relates No, there's a little bit more recurring CapEx when we have capacity and we look across the portfolio and think what can we do based on the capacities we have. And so sometimes when we work with Rob Abdel's organization said, we have capacity to put a little bit more recurring CapEx into the year. And so what you could do is pull it forward from one year and put it into the year prior. And so that's what you've just seen. We have -- we felt we had a little bit more capacity to invest in some recurring CapEx this year. That really takes away that obligation for next year. Operator : Our last question comes from Nick Del Deo with Moffat Nathanson. Nick Del Deo : Charles, on the interconnection front, are you still expecting an improvement in adds as we move through the year like you communicated previously? Or do you think these headwinds are a bit softer than expected? Charles Meyers : Yes. Great question, Nick. I'd tell you, in all honesty, I had expected we would have seen a bit of a moderation back up towards prior levels. now. But there's a lot of factors in play there. I think that the short answer is I do believe we're going to see that because when I look at it, the gross adds continue to be really strong. So overall demand for interconnection persistent. And as I said, even growing with cloud as the end.  And so I think that, that is the most encouraging to me. When we really unpack what is suppressed the net adds, it's clearly on the churn side. And so we've unpacked that in great depth, as you might imagine. And it really is almost all from the service provider side in terms of where we're seeing the elevated churn over normal levels. And as we unpack it further, you see there is definitely 10 to 100 migration. And I think that has accelerated a bit more than we expected just because -- and maybe we should have anticipated this, but as the cost of electronics goes down, it is more broadly available to people who have a sufficient number of interconnects to really justify that.  And so we did see continued uptick. And so it seems almost like what you're seeing is 10 to 100 migration was led by the most sophisticated customers with the most at stake -- and then you see another blip as sort of the broader population begins to sort of integrate that. But again, it's not going to be relevant for everybody. You have to have some level of concentration to routes to really make it an economically viable proposition. So you're seeing 10 to 100 partially impacted there. Then you saw -- you see some M&A activity. And that's true in the CDN space and in the network space. Those are finite things. They work their way through, and then you go back to some sort of a normal.  And then I would say the third area is just a more aggressive inventory management, particularly from the network space, where as you -- many of you know better than we do, there's some real overall business challenges where people are looking to aggressively tighten their belt in any way they can. And so I think those dynamics -- several of those dynamics are finite in nature, and which is why I kind of fully had expected that we would return. And I don't know whether we get all the way back to our previously guided range, but I think we'll see -- potentially see some lift back there. Independent of all that, even at our current level of ads, we're seeing -- one, we're seeing very strong pricing and that is driving -- and we're seeing a migration towards higher port speeds on offerings that are priced by speed. And so that mix is helping.  And as a result, I think you're going to continue to see very healthy revenue growth. So we'll track that. It's certainly my hope that we will see some elevation through the back half of the year, but we'll just have to see how that plays out. Nick Del Deo : Okay. Okay. Great. And then in Singapore, obviously, great to see the 20-megawatt allocation you got. How long before you can actually bring that online? And then about how long will 20 megawatts last you? Charles Meyers : Well, we can't speak to the actual size of the allocation. So I don't doubt there is information out there, but I can't confirm or deny anything relative to the size of the allegation. I would simply say that -- we're very excited about what we got. We're very excited about the opportunity to build incremental capacity in that market. And we believe it will give us some really solid runway in an incredibly important market. In the meantime, we're continuing to sort of very opportunistically harvest capacity to continue to meet the demands of our customers and to drive very superior returns in that market. Chip Newcom : Thank you, everyone. This concludes our Q2 earnings call. Operator : And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Also, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objection, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Chip Newcom, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Chip Newcom : Good afternoon, and welcome to today's conference call. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking in nature and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those statements and may be affected by the risks we've identified in today's press release and those identified in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K filed February 17th, 2023, and 10-Q filed August 4th, 2023. Equinix assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or comment on forward-looking statements made on this call. In addition, in light of Regulation Fair Disclosure, it is Equinix' policy not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done through an explicit public disclosure. In addition, we'll provide non-GAAP measures on today's conference call. We provide a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a list of the reasons why the company uses these measures in today's press release on the Equinix Investor Relations page at www.equinix.com. We've made available on the IR page of our website a presentation designed to accompany this discussion, along with certain supplemental financial information and other data. We would also like to remind you that we post important information about Equinix on the IR page from time-to-time and encourage you to check our website regularly for the most current available information. With us today are Charles Meyers, Equinix' CEO and President; and Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up in one hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to one. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thank you, Chip. Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Despite an increasingly complex macro environment, we delivered another solid quarter of results and continue to drive strong value creation, raising both our dividend and our AFFO per share outlook for the full year. While we continue to operate in an environment characterized by customer caution, this caution is balanced by a clear commitment to digital transformation and accelerating interest in AI and a growing reliance on Equinix as a critical partner in designing and implementing hybrid, multi-cloud, and data-centric architectures. Customers continue to see digital as a critical priority, and they remain focused on optimizing existing infrastructure spend and capabilities across cloud, network and other categories. Demand remains strong. New logo growth is accelerating, and we see a highly favorable pricing environment, allowing us to deliver higher MRR per cabinet yields driven by price, power density, and strong interconnection demand. The net result is solid revenue growth, a strong forward pipeline and continued optimism about our differentiated ability to deliver compelling value to our customers and in turn, to our shareholders. In Q3, our go-to-market engine continued to execute well with more than 4,200 deals in the quarter across more than 3,100 customers, including record new logos from high-value targeted customers. We saw solid performance across all aspects of our platform strategy with data center services, digital services, and our xScale, all coming together to address the evolving demands of our customers and strong cross-regional bookings highlighting the power of our unmatched global reach. On the AI front, we continue to cultivate and win significant opportunities across our existing customer base and with AI-specific prospects. A recent Gartner poll found 55% of organizations are in pilot or production mode with generative AI. We are seeing this manifest in accelerated interest from both enterprise customers and from emerging service providers looking to service this demand. We see strong similarities between the evolving AI demand and the multi-tiered architectures that have characterized the cloud build-out for the past eight years. And believe that our broad portfolio of offerings in tandem with our key technology partners will allow us to capture high-value opportunities across the AI value chain along three key vectors. First, in our retail business, we will aggressively pursue magnetic AI service provider deployments to support on-ramps, inference nodes and smaller scale training needs. We are well-positioned here with nearly 40% market share of the on-ramps to the major cloud service providers, key players in the AI ecosystem. And in Q3, we're proud to have been recognized at a 2023 Google Cloud Customer Awards winner for our work supporting Google AI technology. Key wins in this area for Q3 included Core Wheat, a specialized GPU cloud provider, deploying networking nodes at Equinix leveraging our unique multi-cloud on-ramps and network connectivity across multiple metros. And Lambda, selecting Platform Equinix to offer customers expanded regional connectivity, higher networking performance, security and scale for an enterprise-grade GPU cloud, dedicated to large language models and generative AI workloads. Second, we intend to meaningfully augment our xScale portfolio, including in North America to pursue strategic large-scale AI training deployments with the top hyperscalers and other key AI ecosystem players, including the potential to serve highly targeted enterprise demand. We expect some builds will be tightly coupled with our retail campuses like our newly announced Silicon Valley 12x asset, while other builds will be larger-scale campuses in locations with access to significant power capacity. And finally, in response to burgeoning enterprise AI demand, we will leverage our unique advantages to position Platform Equinix as the place where private AI happens, allowing customers to place compute resources in proximity to data and seamlessly leverage public cloud capabilities, all while maintaining control of high-value proprietary data. We also anticipate a dramatic acceleration in inference workloads and see Equinix as well-positioned to deliver performance and economic benefits derived from our reach, network density and cloud adjacency. While still early, we're seeing broad-based demand for private AI from digital leaders with specific wins in the transportation, education, public sector and healthcare verticals, including Harrison.ai, a clinician-led healthcare artificial intelligence company that is dedicated to addressing the inequality and capacity limitations in our health care system, by developing AI-powered tools in radiology and pathology. An exciting opportunity that not only drives our business, but clearly aligns with Equinix values. As AI demand accelerates, we are adapting our product portfolio and our physical platform in response to evolving customer requirements. In terms of data center design, we're using our co-innovation facility in Ashburn to evaluate technologies to support escalating power requirements and have already commercialized our early work in this area with liquid cooling solutions that are supportable in all markets, including support for direct-to-chip liquid cooling in 45 markets across all three regions. We are already supporting significant liquid cool deployments across our range of deployment sizes and densities and we look forward to sharing more with you on our progress in this space. Turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q3 were $2.06 billion, up 14% year-over-year driven by strong recurring revenue growth and power price increases. Adjusted EBITDA was up 9% year-over-year, and AFFO per share was better than our expectations due to strong operating performance and timing of recurring CapEx spend. Interconnection revenues grew 9% year-over-year with continued strength from Equinix Fabric. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our data center services portfolio continues to perform well. Given the strong underlying demand for digital infrastructure and the long duration in delivering new capacity, a factor that continues to drive positive pricing trends, we're investing broadly across our global footprint. We currently have 56 major projects underway in 39 markets across 23 countries, including 14 xScale builds that will deliver more than 100 megawatts of capacity once opened. More than 50% of our expansion capital is supporting capacity in our major metros where we have strong visibility to fill rates. Recurring revenues from customers deployed in more than one region stepped up 1% quarter-over-quarter to 77% as customers continue to move to more distributed architectures. On interconnection, we now have over 460,000 total interconnections with 4,200 net interconnections added in Q3 thanks to healthy gross adds, offset somewhat by continued grooming activity and consolidations into higher bandwidth connections. Equinix Fabric saw continued momentum with record port orders and significant growth in provision bandwidth, up 8% quarter-over-quarter to more than 200 terabits per second. Internet Exchange had another strong quarter in APAC with peak traffic in the region, surpassing the Americas for the first time. Globally, peak traffic was up 9% quarter-over-quarter and 27% year-over-year to nearly 35 terabits per second. Recent interconnection and ecosystem wins include Southern Cross, expanding their relationship with Equinix by deploying their SX NEXT subsea cable into our LA4 IBX to boost aggregate capacity on their US to Australia and New Zealand network by 50%. And the Warsaw Stock Exchange, migrating their primary matching engine and trading system to Equinix' Warsaw 3 IBX to offer more capabilities and enhanced trading performance. We continue to invest behind our platform strategy with revenue growth from our digital services portfolio significantly over-indexing relative to the broader business, including strong adoption of our network edge offering by enterprise customers. We're also seeing momentum in expanding our partnerships with leading technology companies, including the recent announcement of NetApp storage on Equinix Metal, which is an integrated full stack solution that provides enterprise customers low latency access to all clouds while keeping control of their data, a critical consideration for AI workloads. Key digital services wins this quarter included McGraw Hill, a leading educational publishing company, deploying virtual hubs using Network Edge across multiple markets to connect to key cloud providers via Equinix Fabric. And a significant win with a global gaming company using Equinix Metal to support a major new product launch. Our channel program delivered another strong quarter, amplifying the reach of our sales team and accounting for over 65% of new logos with wins across a wide range of industry segments focusing on digital transformation initiatives. We continue to see growth from partners like AT&T, Cisco, Dell, and HPE. Key wins included a top five US public school district seeking to modernize aging IT infrastructure while improving systems uptime and enhancing cybersecurity. This win executed with partners, Dell Technology Managed Services, Carasoft, and ImpEx Technologies, will deliver low latency, multi-cloud connectivity and secure network access to key ecosystem resources while lowering operational expenses. Now, let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results from the quarter. Keith Taylor : Great. Thanks Charles and good afternoon to everyone. Let me start by saying I hope you and your families are doing well. Now, notwithstanding these complex and difficult times, we continue to remain bullish about our business and the opportunities ahead as we work hard to expand our strategic and preferential position in the marketplace. As you all know, one of the core tenets of our strategy revolves around long-term shareholder value creation. With that in mind, we continue to build capacity in markets that will enhance our platform positioning and differentiate our offerings into the future. Also, we continue to work diligently to maintain rigor with our pricing strategies while closely overseeing our spending decisions. As it relates to our capital structure, we've been able to maintain a highly advantaged balance sheet with ample liquidity and lower leverage. This gives us the flexibility to opportunistically access the capital markets under terms and conditions that are beneficial to us. In addition, we're actively working to support other strategic operating goals, including how and where we source our supply chain, including energy costs, while increasing our investments in and around our future first sustainability initiatives, both highly important matters for our customers. Lastly, we remain pleased with our efforts to manage our derivative risks, including our exposure to foreign currencies and interest rates. Moving on to the business, we continue to perform well. In Q3, we had solid gross and net bookings with strong customer demand. Our pricing dynamics are very positive. MRR churn is well within our targeted range. Also, given the tight supply environment across many of our metros, we and our customers continue to look for ways to optimize deployment, including increasing the power density of the cabinets sold. This drives improved bottom line profitability and higher return on invested capital. Global MRR per cabinet was up $57 quarter-over-quarter to $2,214 per cabinet, a 12% increase on our yield year-on-year on a constant currency basis. With respect to our net cabinets billing metric, it remains flat compared to Q2, largely due to the meaningful increase in density of cabinet and the timing of bookings and churn at the end of the quarter. We have a solid backlog of booked but not yet installed cabinets and the depth of our pipeline and the related coverage ratios support an expected strong bookings performance to close out our year. Now, let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Know that all comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q3 revenues were $2.061 billion, up 14% over the same quarter last year due to strong recurring revenue growth and power price increases. Non-recurring revenues remained flat compared to the prior quarter. Although it was not before non-recurring revenues, particularly those attributable to our xScale business are inherently lumpy, for Q4, our guide implies a meaningful step-up on non-recurring revenues attributed to a number of deals expected to close across different markets this quarter. Q3 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $1 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $936 million or 45% of revenues, up 9% over the same quarter last year due to strong operating performance. Looking forward, our Q4 adjusted EBITDA is expected to remain roughly flat due to the timing of our spend and specific one-time costs attributed to corporate real estate activities. Q3 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, includes a $1 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and $2 million of integration costs. Global Q3 AFFO was $772 million, above our expectations due to strong business performance and timing of recurring CapEx spend. Q3 AFFO included minimal FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 MR turned step down to 2.2%, and we expect Q4 MR churn to remain consistent with our Q3 levels in the lower half of our 2% to 2.5% quarterly guidance range. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized and constant currency basis, EMEA and APAC were our fastest-growing regions at 26% and 10%, respectively, followed by our Americas region at 7% year-over-year growth. The Americas region had a solid quarter across many of our key metros, and we experienced strong public sector activity. As it relates to AI, sales activity discussed in Charles' remarks, the vast majority of the demand is destined for Americas footprint. And as highlighted by Charles, this quarter, we won a mix of AI training, inference and networking deployments with the pipeline of anticipated deals to follow. Our EMEA business had a strong quarter led by our UK and Dutch markets and record digital services bookings. In EMEA, as highlighted previously, we continue to lean into our future-first sustainability strategy, including implementing heat export initiatives into Frankfurt, Helsinki, and Paris communities while supporting other innovative environmental initiatives to support many other communities and where we operate. And finally, the Asia-Pacific region saw a solid performance led by our Hong Kong, India, and Singapore markets. Capacity constraints exist across a number of our markets, particularly Singapore. These supply constraints will help drive strong deal discipline and pricing power in these markets. During 2024, we'll be opening new markets in India, Indonesia, and Malaysia, expanding our APAC platform and ecosystems in pursuit of larger opportunities given the demand for digital infrastructure. And now looking at our capital structure. Please refer to Slide 8. Our net leverage remains low relative to our peers at 3.5 times our annualized adjusted EBITDA. Our balance sheet increased slightly to approximately $31.7 billion including an unrestricted cash balance of over $2.3 billion. Our cash balance remained flat quarter-over-quarter as our strong operating cash flow and financing activity was offset by our investment in growth CapEx and the quarterly cash dividend. As I've previously noted, we've been opportunistically looking to raise additional debt capital in reduced rate environments. To that end, in September, we raised $337 million of Swiss Franc denominated five-year paper at an attractive 2.875% rate. Additionally, during the quarter, we executed an incremental $230 million of ATM forward equity sales, which we expect to settle alongside our Q2 ATM forward contract in late 2023. These financing transactions will help fund our 2024 growth initiatives, alongside other sources of capital while allowing us to maintain our strategic flexibility. Also in September, we published our 2023 green bond allocation report. As highlighted in the report, we have now fully allocated the net proceeds from our green bonds aligning our financing efforts with our commitment to create a more environmentally friendly data center footprint. Turning to Slide 9, for the quarter, capital expenditures were $618 million, including recurring CapEx of $52 million. Since our last earnings call, we opened six new retail projects, including two new data centers in Dubai and Montreal. We also purchased our Dublin 1 and Montreal 1 IBX assets and land for development in Manchester in Washington, D.C. Revenue from owned assets were 64% of recurring revenues for the quarter. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our 174 stabilized assets increased revenues by 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Our stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and generated a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for our updated summary of 2023 guidance and bridges. Do note, all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. For the full year 2023, we're maintaining our underlying revenue outlook with expected top line growth of 14% to 15% or approximately 9% growth, excluding the impact of power costs passed through to our customers, a reflection of our continued strong execution. We are raising our underlying 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $17 million due to favorable operating costs and lower integration spend and we're raising our underlying AFFO guidance by $27 million to now grow between 12% and 14% compared to the previous year. AFFO per share is now expected to grow between 10% and 11%. CapEx is expected to remain in the $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion range, including approximately $215 million of on-balance sheet xScale spend, which we expect to be reimbursed for when these assets are transferred to JVs early next year and about $225 million of recurring CapEx spend, an increase over the prior quarter as we accelerate costs into Q4. Lastly, given our strong operating performance and our historically low AFFO payout ratio, we've accelerated the timing of our cash dividend increase into Q4 of this year from Q1 of next year. As a result, the quarterly cash dividend will increase by 25% to $4.26 per share this quarter. Looking forward, we expect our annual cash dividend growth rate will track at or above our AFFO per share growth rate for a number of years. So, let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks Keith. In closing, we continue to see strong demand as customers embrace AI and advance their digital transformation agendas with infrastructure that is more distributed, more cloud connected and more ecosystem enabled than ever before. Despite a variety of cross currents in the business, we are translating healthy bookings growth, a favorable pricing environment, and increasing power densities into strong increases in cabinet yield. These dynamics, combined with the continued focus on driving operating leverage and expense discipline through the business, are allowing us to deliver compelling value on a per share basis. As we close out 2023 and look towards 2024, our forward-looking strategy and vision for our platform will enable us to amplify our unique strengths, leveraging them to expand our market opportunity, and drive sustainable growth in a rapidly evolving landscape. We remain optimistic about the road ahead and steadfast in our commitment to show up every day in service too, starting with the resolve to align, inspire, and empower our teams around our strategy and our mission, enabling them to deliver durable value and meaningful impact to our customers, our shareholders and the communities in which we operate. So, let me stop there and open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead. Matt Niknam : Hey guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Just two if I could. First, on the cabs billing metric. I appreciate you, Charles, given some of that color around the increased power density. I'm just wondering if there's any additional color you can share with some of the softness in the cabs billing adds, some of the actions you may be taking to release some of that available capacity at higher mark-to-market rates and any sort of color you can share in terms of expectations for 4Q. And then second question, again, we appreciate all the color on AI. Just wondering if you can give us any more color on the conversations you're having with customers on their AI strategy, what role Equinix can play in helping them meet their goals and any sort of timing in terms of when this can become a little bit more material? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Yes, you bet, Matt. Yes, we absolutely figured that we would have a question there on the cabs, as you might imagine, key topic in the discussion. I want to start by just reinforcing that the flat cabinet growth is really not driven by a lack of demand, as you heard in the script. We had another really solid bookings quarter with overall deal counts in line with what we've been seeing. And so I think it's not a demand problem, per se. As I said last quarter, look, we recognize billing cab adds have to be part of the growth story over time, but the pressure on the metric is really linked to some other positive dynamics in the business as you sort of alluded to there. So, let me unpack that a little bit for you and give you a little more detail. I think the force that I think maybe we didn't fully appreciate the past couple of quarters or didn't highlight as much as the extent and the pace of the evolution on the power density. And so we really dug into that this quarter and looked at that for the last several quarters. And what we found is really an expanding delta between the power density of our churn cabinets and that of our newly sold cabinet. So, we look back over these first three quarters of 2023, where we've had a flatter profile on the build cabs or billing cabs, and we've turned cabinets over that period an average density of 4 kilowatts per cab, but we've added new billable cabs at an average of 5.7. So, that's really a major factor that our cab equivalent metric is not density adjusted. So, the reality is we've been paddling hard against that increase in density when it comes to cabinet growth. Additionally, and we talked about this in prior calls as well, we do have some capacity constraints, somewhat -- ones in certain markets. And those are driving some proactive churn on our part, and we see a level of customer optimization at the cabinet level similar to what we've been talking about on interconnection, but we're seeing very little customer churn or full customer churn. And so I'm not -- I'm definitely not saying that all of our churn activity is necessarily desirable or wanted. But as you can see in our churn metric, we're managing the overall churn really well within our guided range. So, as I said -- I talked about last quarter, these 37 deployments with really positive mark-to-market when you look at both price and power density and when we look at Q3, we actually saw that general range of 60% to 70% uplift as broadly applicable. So, in other words, our average of our churn cabinets or new cabinets were about 60% to 70% above what we had churned. And so obviously, that dynamic is super attractive in terms of in really explaining why we're driving healthy revenue growth even with the limited growth in billable cabs. So, I mean, we've always said we're not ones to chase volume as a business objective, because I think that often results in a loss of discipline in the process. We're very much playing the long game when it comes to our commercial decision-making. And although cabinet growth is going to have to be a part of the story over time, we're really seeing that the current dynamics are allowing us to drive, as we said, strong MRR per cab, solid stabilized asset growth and really, I think, the return on capital is going to continue to be very favorable. So, I think all of that translates into what we see as the really most critical bottom line, and that's AFFO per share and dividend growth. And I think sort of the results are really strong in that area. So, that's context on the first question and on billable cabs. Second one on AI, definitely seeing it show up. We talked about in the script about a number of deals that we won in the quarter. AI and ML are not new things for us. We kind of talked about that. We've been working, I think, through AI opportunities with digital leaders for several years now. There's a lot happening across the platform. In fact, people don't maybe remember it, but we announced our NVIDIA Launchpad offering with them over two years ago. And really, that's been a unique opportunity for us to get in early with customers as they're piloting AI initiatives in their business and really monitor AI demand in the marketplace. And so we've closed a number of deals with service providers this quarter. There's definitely an emergent set of service providers, Core Wheat and Lambda we talked about that I think are really sources of incremental demand for us. We closed those deals really in the retail footprint focused on networking and inference-type nodes. And I think that what we're seeing most of with customers is working with them on three big questions when they're thinking about AI. Where do I put my data? And I think we're seeing a lot of people looking at sort of cloud adjacent data as the answer. And I think that plays right to our advantages. Secondly, how they bring compute and other data sources in other words, data that's not their own to their own data. And then finally, how do they deliver AI generated business insights to the users of those insights economically and with high performance. And so those really are the areas that we've been deeply engaged with our customers. I think that it's a contributing factor to our probably our best forward-looking pipeline, multi-quarter pipeline that we've seen in a long time. And so I do think AI is a very positive force in the business overall. Matt Niknam : Operator : Our next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. You m ay go ahead. Frank Louthan : Great. Thank you. Just a quick question on -- so on the channel, you mentioned 65% of new logos coming from the channel. What percentage of overall sales are there? And then how do the logos in the channel tend to perform longer term versus those from the existing sales force, they produce the same amount of repeat business? Charles Meyers : Yes, I would -- I think our bookings percentage is probably in the 40%-ish range from our channel. You do have to recognize, Frank, and we've been very transparent about this. Our channel is not really a sell-through channel as much. It's really more of a sell with sort of meeting the market. But what we're using is the extensive relationships that our channel partners have, particularly in the broad enterprise to identify and then bring our unique value to the table. And so that often results in essentially a joint selling proposition between ourselves and our partners. And over time, I would say that I think we need to be moving towards a bit more of a sell-through model that would provide even more economic leverage to the model. But we do see our channel wins as very on par in terms of quality of business and our ability to sell into them. Sometimes even more readily -- we can capture incremental wallet share even more readily because of the strength of our channel partners from a relationship perspective inside of those accounts. And so I'd say very much a positive force for us. And as we look at now sort of deepening our channel relationship with key technology partners, we talked about the NetApp offering with NetApp Storage on Metal. Those are great examples. We do have a similar sort of offering with Pure. And so those things are really relevant as customers are saying, hey, we're really deeply thinking about where to place our data, we have technology opinion about the storage providers we'd like to use, and we really would like to that at Equinix to get proximity and adjacency to the cloud. And so I think those -- that's a great example for the kind of deals that we're winning in the channel, and that continues to be an important part of the business. Frank Louthan : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead. Jon Atkin : Thanks. So, I was interested in if there's anything notable to call out that drove the growth in EMEA where things seem to have accelerated a bit versus APAC, which saw a slightly slower growth. And then on pricing, which I think you mentioned in the earlier part of your prepared remarks, where do you see the main levers? Would it be renewal spreads on cabinets or harmonizing cross connects or anything to kind of call out around pricing to think about in 2024? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Sure. Yes, I mean I think when you adjust for the PPI, I mean, because the EMEA numbers are obviously done on an as-reported basis are driven significantly by PPI. And so there is that we certainly are seeing, I think, good performance across our regions. APAC, I think, is over a multi-quarter period here, a little -- has more constraints to deal with. And so from a capacity perspective, and as we've talked about Singapore being sort of a prominent example there. But I would also say that in EMEA, I think a more prominent feature for us to continue to be looking at internally. And I realize that there's not as deep a transparency or granularity in the information ability, but the deal mix in EMEA continues to be extremely favorable. And the team has done a really great job going from, what I think, was a little more dependency on some of the large footprint business over time and now in a post xScale world, really shunting the really large stuff off xScale and I think weaning away from a dependency on large footprint demand even in the enterprise I think always has the sort of the prospect of greater churn probability over time. And so the deal mix in EMEA has really shaped nicely, I think, over the last couple of years, and I think really kudos to the team on the ground there to make that happen. Then on pricing, I would just say that I think pricing broadly speaking, is very favorable. Part of that is just simply driven by, I think, an understanding from customers that increases in underlying costs are driving a rising price environment across a whole range of things and so that's one factor. But then I think that perhaps the more important one for us is, I think, being able to deliver really compelling value for them and being able to articulate that effectively to them. And so in terms of the -- where it's coming from, yes, I do think there's continued pricing activity on all -- across our portfolio, interconnection, space and power, and on our digital services. And then I think that the -- and that includes both uplifts on list pricing, and as well as on renewals. And so I think you're really seeing that show up in terms of -- as I just -- I tell you, when you look at a dynamic that says okay, if you're churning cabinets at X and you're selling new cabinets at 1.6 or 1.65x, that's a very attractive dynamic. It's not driven entirely by price because power density is a meaningful part of that. And then actually, new cabs mature even further as interconnection goes into those over time. And so I think those are some of the dynamics on the pricing front. And I think it's has been a little hard for people to hold all that in their head and figure out exactly why that you have some of these dynamics in there. But I think you're seeing it show up in terms of the MRR per cab as well as the overall revenue growth rates and then particularly dropping it to the AFFO per share results. Jon Atkin : And then lastly, the new logos you mentioned, are there any particular verticals where you're seeing penetration that's driving the vertical? And then on the churn side, anything to kind of think about for the coming quarter or year around where you might fall within your typical range for MRR churn? Thanks. Charles Meyers : You always get full value for your questions, Jon. So, new logos, I would say, the -- I think we're seeing a pretty varied set of -- across verticals in terms of -- we're not really seeing a heavy concentration. I think that more -- I would say that more, what I would consider, data-centric or data-intensive industries are where we're seeing that focus on digital transformation and on AI. And so we talked about some of those in terms of transportation, healthcare, et cetera, and we've identified a few wins there. But interestingly, things like manufacturing have been tremendously strong for us. Retail has been tremendously strong for us. Financial Services, very strong, very forward-leaning posture on AI, a very forward-leaning posture on cloud, but one that is moderated by sort of compliance, security, distributed infrastructure requirements, et cetera. And so they continue to be that sort of ideal customer for us that really is using a broad range of infrastructure options but wants to place their data and some of their private infrastructure in proximity to all that. And so we have seen, I think, very strong performance across verticals on new logos. It seems like every earnings report has a different highlight in terms of what we're talking about on new logos. And then on churn, I think we kind of gave the key highlights there. We are, again, well within our range, a little bit of churn that we are either being proactive about or that we're being sort of receptive to customers looking to optimize footprints because we believe there's meaningful upside there. And again, I think an environment that in transparency does have some level of optimization from customers who maybe were buying a little more than they needed at, I think, in the 2021, 2022 timeframe, but I think are really tightening that up to ensure that they're buying just what they need and then adapting to the multi -- the hybrid and multi-cloud architectures. And so churn is something that I think we have to continue to really keep a close eye on and right now, they're performing where we would have expected in terms of our churn as a percentage of MR. Jon Atkin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next caller is David Barden with Bank of America. You may go ahead. David Barden : Hey guys, thanks so much. Two questions, if I could, please. Just Keith, apologies for my voice. Keith, what -- I'm trying to kind of understand my takeaways for the 2024 trajectory. You've had a stronger-than-expected year-to-date through 3Q and you're guiding to kind of a weaker-than-expected jumping off point in 4Q into 2024, but then you're talking about the strong bookings. And so I'm wondering if it's too easy to read into the fourth quarter and maybe we should be looking at the second half as a jumping off point for first half 2024 rather than the fourth quarter specifically? And then the second question, if I could. Maybe Charles, when you mentioned that your churn is 4K and the new clients are coming in to 547, what does that look like? Is that like 1/10 for every three new 4s? Or is that literally just the directional movement of the new client is 50% more power dense? Thank you. Keith Taylor : So, David, let me -- so I'll take the first question and then pass to Charles. Thank you for the questions. I think it's important for us to highlight and share with everybody how the business is performing. Very much like Charles has said, the company is performing well. And notwithstanding the comments around the billing cabinets because you can't -- you don't grow revenues like you grow revenues as we did over $40 million quarter-over-quarter when you don't -- you're not creating value, and it's coming through price and volume and all the things that we do. So, as you sort of pass forward to the fourth quarter, again, a nice step-up in both recurring and non-recurring revenue. I think at midpoint of guide, we're up $73 million over the prior quarter on a neutral basis -- on a currency-neutral basis. And so that's an impressive increase. And so let me give you a little bit of a size on the non-recurring piece. You've seen non-recurring being relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. Ebbs and flows generally with a large deal done in the xScale business. But this -- the xScale business, we see an order of magnitude of roughly $30 million. So, that gives you a sense of the size of the uplift in non-recurring. That leaves you with plenty of room on the recurring revenue. Again, $73 million in the midpoint of guide. So, what's going on in the cost side of the equation? Well, there's always some seasonality as we all know. But as we sort of said in our prepared remarks, there's two things that I want to bring to the top. Number one, no surprise, the company is working hard to be as judicious as we need to be with our spend, including our corporate real estate assets. And so we've embedded a fairly large charge inside the quarter relating to corporate real estate. And so the order of magnitude of think of that as a $20 million to $30 million range, just to size it for you. The second piece is, yes, the business, as you know, we've been able to deliver a good year, and we're setting ourselves up now for 2024. And that's where our focus is because we know we had strong bookings in the third quarter. We feel we're really well-positioned for booking activity in the fourth quarter. And that sort of sets the stage or sets the table for 2024. And so we did accelerate some costs into the year into the last quarter, both on an OpEx basis, and you can certainly see it on a recurring CapEx basis. And so we made that decision, one because we could deliver better than the market was anticipating and simultaneously make sure that we get some of the investments behind us so we could focus 2024 on things that were important for 2024. And so it's a combination of those two things that really have made a difference if you look at flow-throughs. But as you then enter into the new year, you've really set the stage for a good start to 2024. If we deliver against those that booking expectation, I think it just -- it sets the table really nicely for a 2024 start. So, let me leave that. I hope I answered your question there. David Barden : No. Thanks Keith. Charles Meyers : So, I'll take the second one, David. It's pretty simple, really, in terms of -- it's really what I was talking about there in terms of the 4 to 5.7 is really a macro average, an overall aggregate average for the for the -- again, that's for the first three quarters. We basically said, look, this is the number of cabinets that were churned out over that period of time. And this is the total contracted power that was churned out over that time, divide those two and you get four. And then here's all the new cabinets we build -- booked during the year. And here's the new contracted power on those and to buy those and you get 5.7. And the reason I think it's important to characterize that as an average, I actually think it will be harder for us to deal with it was all exactly 4-kilowatt cabinets being churned and all exactly 5.7 kilowatt cabinets being added. The reality is that the workloads have quite a range. We still see meaningful demand well below that 5.7 and obvious -- that's obvious since that's an average. And then you see some meaningfully above that, right? And you might see we might see deals that are 10, 15, 20 or more kilowatts per cab. And as we said, we may even be looking at liquid cooling to support some of those very high density requirements. And so -- and I think that's important in that I think it's an opportunity for us as we have this dynamic of space being freed up to the extent that we can match that up with power and cool it appropriately using liquid cooling or other means or traditional air cooling means, then I think that's an opportunity to unlock more value from the platform. And so that's a dynamic that we're very focused on. But what I gave you in terms of the 4 to 5.7 is really an overall average. David Barden : No, helpful color guys. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. You may go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Good afternoon. First, curious if you could discuss the factors that led to the decision to adjust capital allocation and boost the dividend per share in this fourth quarter and then just kind of the go-forward metric of how to think about dividend growth? And then I have a follow-up, if that's okay. Keith Taylor : Yes. Sure. Michael, the -- well, just broadly speaking, clearly, we think of ourselves as very advantaged by the cash that we keep on our balance sheet, the liquidity position we have available to us and how we're setting up our debt structure, particularly in low rate environments. And I think that will continue to hold true as we look into 2024 and certainly into 2025. No surprise. I know this wasn't directly in your question, I'll come to the dividend in a moment. The cost of debt is going up. And so we're trying to be very judicious how we raise our capital, continue to find balance. But we know and we've set the stage, if you will, coming out of the Analyst Day for a five-year view on what we think we can accomplish as a business. And we know how much capital incrementally we need to raise all else being equal inside that business plan. And so you're seeing us execute against and strike where we can when it's opportunistically favorable to the business. And that's why you saw those rates Swiss franc put on the balance sheet right away. We've got the positive carry and so we move on and that's good liquid capital for us.  So, then as you look about how do we distribute some of the cash flow back to our investors. And no surprise, we are -- we've made a commitment to pay out 100% of the taxable income inside the qualified structure. And the way that, that happens is through a distribution of the dividend. And basically, you limit your taxable income and avoid excise taxes, if you pay out that dividend. Now, with the business, we've been saying this for the last few quarters, and I'm sure it's not lost on everybody. The operating performance of our business, and that's what the primary, that is not the -- that is the sole makeup of our dividend. We're returning capital through strong operational performance and that -- the taxable operational performance of the business, which, of course, mimics the book operational performance has been accelerating. And over the years, and certainly lately, we've been doing all we can to, if you will, to mitigate a point of time where we've under distributed. But we're at a point now where we can't hold back that momentum any longer. And as a result, we want to give our tax teams the flexibility to manage the tax provisions and tax positions this year instead of having to worry about what we file in September of next year for 2023. So, we accelerated the decision. But -- so that's sort of why we did it in Q4 and then just the sheer size of the investment or the distribution is to give you a sense of the momentum in the business and how much the taxable income is growing relative to the business. And so we needed to release that and create capacity for ourselves, not just for this quarter and closing out the 2023 year, but certainly for 2024 as well. As we look forward, we have pretty darn good visibility on what we think that taxable income is going to look like. And so we wanted to mitigate basically an under disputed issue in 2024, and we just -- we solved the problem by making this decision. Michael Rollins : Thanks. And then just on one other thing that you mentioned earlier. You mentioned the opportunity to try to improve the power density in the existing footprint. And just curious if you could share with us how the power utilization of your portfolio compares to the cabinet utilization of your portfolio? And the opportunity based on access to the utility load and thinking about the cost, like how much further can you take the power in the existing portfolio? Thanks. Charles Meyers : Yes. Great question, Mike. It's unfortunately not a particularly simple matter. But I will give you an answer to your question, which is our power utilization is actually meaningfully lower than our cabinet utilization, right? And so that does represent, I think, some opportunity for us if we -- to the extent that we can match space and power and have the appropriate cooling requirements to unlock productive value creation capacity from the platform. Again, it's not super straightforward because you have to ensure that you can -- you have the -- draw can be very different facility to facility. And your ability to augment available power is very substantially either due to availability of power from the utility or from our own ability to do that in terms of the equipment available to power distribution in the facility, et cetera. And so I do think that there is opportunity there to be had. And I think it is something that is working to our advantage in terms of the kind of overall dynamics of the business now, but one where we always have to continue to ensure that we are delivering superior reliability to our customers, understand exactly what their requirements are, can cool that -- can cool it properly, deliver the reliability and resiliency they need and sort of manage all those factors simultaneously. So, I do think, though, that you are -- I think you're properly interpreting an opportunity there that says, okay, well, then if you're churning cabinets out at lower, selling them at higher and you have some sort of headroom from a power perspective and you're freeing up space or cabinet capacity, can you take action to sort of augment power over time in ways that would allow you to create value. I think the answer is yes, and we'll be hard at work figuring out how to do that best. Keith Taylor : Mike, maybe I can just add on 1 other thing to what Charles has said. One of the main objectives coming from Ralph's organization is to drive efficiency into the IBXs. So, we're perpetually looking for ways to drive more efficiency and create the capacity -- incremental capacity that Charles refers to. We're also looking at new design and construction techniques to run them more efficiently. And that drives down our PUE and PUE is good for the customer. In some cases, we're held to certain PUE with our customers. And so it drives the efficiency into the business and create that capacity that hopefully we can resell. But these investments, particularly with some of the older data centers to the extent a new technology or certain components of our MCE become available, and we choose to make an investment. You're not expanding as necessarily the footprint but you're making an investment that frees up stranded capacity or energy, that works really well for the business and as I said, for the customer. Charles Meyers : Yes. And one last comment I'd make, Mike, is that I do think this highlights what a very different business we have. Because when you're talking about a very large number of customers in a facility, that's extremely different. So, we wouldn't have that same view relative to an xScale facility, for example, right? I mean that you design it as a certain power capacity, you sell that to a customer, sometimes an entire building to a customer at that and sort of that is what it is. One or two customers sort of it doesn't matter. But when you're talking about very large numbers of customers with very widely ranging power requirements, it represents both a challenge and an opportunity and 1 that I think, over time, we've developed a set of processes and capabilities to manage quite effectively. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Operator : Our next caller is Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. You may go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Appreciate it. Thanks for the question. So, maybe you could touch a little bit, Charles, on the kind of the enterprise sales in the quarter in the pipeline? I know with rates moving higher recently and some concerns around potential recession in the US. Are you seeing any of them pulling back an IT spend to being more cautious in their outlook as they look kind of at their IT stack and hybrid cloud migration and any signs that they're kind of optimizing costs that are evident in any of your churn numbers? Charles Meyers : Yes. Yes. Great question, Eric. As we said in the script, you heard me say that it was an environment that we -- I thought was characterized by customer caution. And I think that's true. And so I -- as I -- and I've been out as I very much like to be out in the field with our teams, both in the data centers, in the sales offices, with customers, with partners, et cetera. And I think I would say that there is a sentiment that says, hey, customers are very forward leaning from the standpoint of recognizing they need to invest in digital and digital transformation and AI, although I think they're very early in those endeavors in many cases. But they also are facing the natural constraints that are created in a more challenging macro environment from a budgetary standpoint. So, oftentimes, they're trying -- one, they're trying to move dollars around to ensure that they can fund their digital transformation initiatives. And two, they're saying, hey, what can we do to get more out of our -- more bang for the buck out of our digital dollars we spend or the IT dollars that we spend broadly. And so I think you're seeing that in terms of -- one thing that you're seeing a lot of people saying, hey, we really have to look at our cloud spend and understand that and determine what the right mix of clouds is and whether or not there are certain workloads that we've attempted to lift and shift to cloud, that we may want to think differently about or you're seeing people saying, hey, are there things that eventually we need to get into a cloud-native sort of -- as cloud-native workloads and move them. And so it certainly is working in all those directions. But I would say I think people are -- customers are really working hard to optimize their digital infrastructure. And I think we can be a real resource to them. The network is another area, right? And we talked about Network Edge and customers being very responsive to that product offering. I think that is most commonly in the context of WAN re-architecture and trying to save money on networking and still deliver higher levels of performance. And so I would say I think there is some level of caution out there, but I think that it is one where people are really trying to make room to make the investments in digital and thinking about what is the right long-term architecture, hybrid, multi-cloud distributed and data-centric. And I think that positions us well to be a trusted partner to them on that journey. Eric Luebchow : Great. Thanks. And just one quick follow-up. I was curious on the xScale kind of update, a development in Silicon Valley saw. So you made it clear that your desire to expand more into the United States. Maybe as you look at the set of opportunities in the US, is development the best option you see today to attack that opportunity? Or is M&A another lever that you continue to evaluate in the US for xScale? Charles Meyers : Yes, it's a great question. I certainly don't think we would be opposed to that. I think if we believe there were assets that were available under reasonable terms from an M&A perspective and that we could do that, that would likely be a transaction that would be executed through some sort of xScale venture -- joint venture vehicle. And so I wouldn't -- we're not opposed to that. But I do think that probably our immediate focus is on development and we'll keep you updated on both of those fronts as appropriate. Eric Luebchow : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our last question comes from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead. Nick Del Deo : Hey, thanks for fitting me in. I guess to follow up on the xScale question in the US I guess, what do you view as different about AI training that makes you want to support those deployments via xScale in the US relative to cloud where you -- if I understand it correctly, you didn't see the opportunity as worth pursuing given how competitive the supply environment is? Charles Meyers : Yes, I mean I think there's a couple of things there. One, I do think that the -- at the time that we made that judgment and we're communicating that judgment to the market, I would say that the supply demand characteristics and therefore, the return profile of xScale in the US market was less than stellar. I think that dynamic is changing. I think the supply/demand sort of landscape in the US, both because of sort of traditional AZ demand or hyperscale demand for the form -- in the form of hyperscale for AZs and those kind of things, combined with now a meaningful acceleration in demand for training, I think, changes the supply-demand profile. And then I would -- and so I do think there is a more attractive market in which to sell. The other thing that I think is something maybe that we appreciate even more powerfully now is and we talked about this when we did xScale to begin with. We said, look, we need to continue have really well developed and constructive relationships the major players in the digital ecosystem and obviously, the hyperscalers are at the top of that list. And so we continue to work hard to make sure that we can be a partner in meeting their capacity needs and not only on the retail basis, but at least as one of probably a number of providers that they're going to need to leverage in the xScale arena. And then the last thing that I think is maybe underappreciated is I think it's also important that we continue to maintain our scale and relevance in the supply chain. And so we -- I think we are very well-positioned there. And I think our procurement and supply chain teams have done an extraordinary job there. And I think part of the reason that they can do that job so well, one is the strength of our balance sheet; and two, is the scale of our operation. And so I think xScale is also a way for us to continue to maintain our position in that regard. Nick Del Deo : Okay. Are you able to share anything regarding how you're thinking about returns here or is that premature? And I guess, any progress in terms of line up partner for domestic xScale? Charles Meyers : Yes, I mean I think that last part is probably premature. But I think the first, I don't think we see a dramatic shift in the overall return profile. I mean we have seen it already, I think, improved where it was, where I think it was single-digits there for a while. If you were lucky, it was high single-digits, where I think you're now seeing sort of full return yields and levered returns even above that. And for us, given that we get some advantages in the structure associated with fee streams, et cetera, I think -- and it's still an attractive equity return profile for us. And so I think that -- but I think those returns have gone up where you're seeing cash-on-cash yields that are meaningfully higher, meaningful up into the double-digits and much more attractive now. So, I do think that, that return profile has improved. It's going to continue to be a very competitive business, though. It's -- and one that will have a very return -- a different return profile than retail, which is, again, why we want to preserve our balance sheet firepower to the extent we can to continue to cultivate our retail business, while at the same time, recognizing the strategic importance of continuing to be active in the xScale market. Nick Del Deo : Okay. Thanks Charles. Charles Meyers : Yes Nick. Chip Newcom : This concludes our Q3 conference call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Good bye. And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time and have a great rest of your day.",

In the interest of wrapping this call up in 1 hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles. Charles Meyers : Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. We had a solid close to 2023 as digital transformation and accelerating AI demand drove a record quarter for xScale leasing, robust pricing dynamics and continued momentum across our data center and digital services portfolios. For the full year, we delivered more than $8 billion of revenues, eclipsing 21 years of consecutive quarterly growth, all while driving AFFO per share performance above the top end of our long-term expectations. As we look ahead, we see our overall relevance to customers continue to rise with our global reach, highly differentiated ecosystems and full-range portfolio of services, positioning us as a key long-term partner to fuel digital transformation and unlock the enormous potential of AI. At the same time, many customers remain cautious in the face of macro uncertainty and are driving optimization across their broader IT infrastructure. Freeing up dollars for AI-related investments while still managing within tighter overall budgets. These dynamics, combined with capacity constrained in certain key markets continue to create cross currents in our business with solid gross demand and strong pricing dynamics being offset by more deliberate buying decisions and slightly higher levels of churn. Meanwhile, we continue to realize the benefits of efficiency investments over the past few years and are showing strong operating leverage in the business, allowing us to maintain our differentiated return on invested capital, expand margins and deliver outsized performance on AFFO per share which we continue to see as our lighthouse metric and the bedrock of long-term value creation. As work to make digital infrastructure more powerful, accessible and sustainable, we are building relationships as trusted advisers to our customers, innovating across our product portfolio, deepening our technology partnerships to solve customer challenges and maintaining our discipline to put the right customers with the right workloads into the right assets. This approach reinforces the kind of advantages of Platform Equinix as we focus our efforts in 2024 on 4 key areas : First, we plan to continue to expand our unmatched global reach, extending the 76 metros in 35 countries by year-end, including opening new markets in India, Indonesia, Malaysia and South Africa. We also intend to add much needed capacity in high-demand existing markets across all 3 regions, including significant retail phases in New York, Paris and Tokyo and accelerated investment in our xScale portfolio. Second, we intend to extend our interconnection leadership by combining the scalability and performance of physical interconnection and the agility of Equinix Fabric with a commitment to lead the way in the massive market of multi-cloud networking, with new innovations and products like our recently announced Equinix Fabric Cloud Router. Third, we'll continue to prioritize our future first sustainability strategy, making Equinix a clear partner of choice to help our customers track and see their sustainability goals and manage an increasingly complex global power landscape. And finally, we intend to unlock the power of platform clinics, embracing key partners and making it easier than ever to combine our value with theirs. So we can solve our customers' problems together. In particular, we focus on Gen AI as we join forces with incredible partners such as NVIDIA, to ensure that Platform Equinix is the place where private AI happens. Turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for the full year were $8.2 billion, up $925 million, a 15% increase year-over-year or a 9% increase, excluding the impact of power price increases. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.7 billion, up 11% year-over-year. AFFO was more than $3 billion for the first time, resulting in AFFO per share growth of 11% year-over-year. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. On the AI front, we saw strong momentum across the value chain in Q4 as we cultivated key partnerships and one significant opportunities. While still early, Gen AI has the capacity to transform every industry and is poised to accelerate rapidly. By 2026, Gartner predicts over 80% of enterprises have used Gen AI APIs and models or deployed Gen AI-enabled applications in production environments, up from just 5% in early 2023. We're leaning into this opportunity and recently announced our expanded partnership for IBX private cloud at Equinix. This new service provides customers a fast and cost-effective way to adopt advanced AI infrastructure that's operated and managed by experts globally. So enterprises can move quickly, while balancing performance requirements, a need for cloud adjacency and a rapidly increasing desire to maintain control of critical enterprise data. We're seeing strong interest in this service across all 3 regions with early adoption from digital leaders in biopharma, financial services, software, automotive and retail subsegments. Early wins in this partnership include a Fortune 100 global biopharma company who will create an AI of excellence to accelerate its research and development process and shorten time to market for new medications. Our data center services portfolio continues to scale with 9 new data center openings since our last earnings call. Given the strong underlying demand for digital infrastructure and the long duration in delivering new capacity, we continue to invest broadly across our global footprint. We currently have 49 major projects underway in 35 markets across 21 countries including 11 xScale builds representing nearly 20,000 cabinets of retail and more than 50 megawatts of xScale capacity through 2024. Wins this quarter included a European biotechnology company, exiting their traditional data centers in favor of a global network dense, hybrid and multi-cloud environment, including liquid cooling requirements. Andorin Holding [ph], a Turkish conglomerate, mainly serving as a strong global automotive supply company, expanding with Equinix to support their operations across 15 countries. Shifting to our xScale initiative, the wave of hyperscale demand to support AI and cloud is translating into robust demand in pre-leasing activity. Since our last earnings call, we leased 90 megawatts of capacity across 6 assets in EMEA and APAC, including approximately 32 megawatts leased at the start of the year. This brings total xScale leasing to 300 megaport [ph] globally. Wins this quarter included supporting strategic Gen AI workloads as well as the hyperscalers first-scale liquid cooling deployment at Equinix. Looking ahead, we have a meaningful pipeline of opportunities to drive continued xScale momentum in the quarters to come. Turning to our industry-leading global interconnection franchise, we now have more than 462,000 total interconnections deployed on our platform. In Q4, interconnection revenue stepped up 8% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis and we added an incremental 4,300 organic interconnections for the quarter. We, again, had healthy gross adds activity, offset somewhat by continued grooming and consolidations into higher bandwidth connections. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 22% year-over-year, to nearly 36 terabits per second, led by expansion from existing customers. Additionally, during the quarter, we added 4 new native cloud on-ramps in Bogota, Calgary and Zurich. Equinix customers can now enjoy low latency access to multiple native cloud on-ramps in 37 metros, including 8 out of the 10 world's largest metros by GDP. Wins this quarter included a leading European quantum computing company, offering its technology through Equinix Metal and Equinix Fabric, enabling different industries to explore potential use cases in quantum computing. And on insurance, a South African insurance company expanding in EMEA, leveraging Equinix Fabric and a managed service solution to be ready to begin trading. In our digital services portfolio, we saw continued momentum as Equinix Metal and Network Edge drove attractive pull-through to Equinix Fabric. In January, we announced the general availability of Equinix Fabric Cloud Router, a new virtual routing service to simplify enterprises complex cloud-to-cloud and hybrid cloud networking challenges by providing an easy-to-configure enterprise-grade multi-cloud routing service that can be deployed in under a minute. Customers can deploy Equinix Fabric Cloud Router in all 58 Equinix fabric-enabled metros globally, with low latency connectivity to all the major cloud providers as well as hundreds of other service providers. Key digital wins included NetApp, who expanded their partnership with Equinix to deliver a Bare Metal service solution, a comprehensive compute, network and storage infrastructure stack with low latency connections to major public clouds. And a leading semiconductor company, establishing a cloud adjacent storage presence using Equinix Metal and Pure Storage with integration into AWS. Our channel program delivered another good quarter, accounting for 35% of bookings and over 50% of new logos. We saw continued growth from partners like HPE, HCL, NVIDIA and WWT, with wins across a wide range of industry verticals and digital first use cases. Wins this quarter included supporting a consumer health care company's business unit spin-off with Dell, setting up a hybrid IT environment by leveraging colocation and cloud for their SAP environment in London and Singapore. Now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Keith Taylor : Great. Thanks, Charles and good afternoon to everyone. As highlighted by Charles, we had a solid end to 2023. The Equinix team continued to execute across all levels of the organization to ensure our strategy as the world's digital infrastructure company continue to separate us from our peers. For the full year, our healthy gross bookings allowed the team to close almost 17,000 deals across more than 5,900 customers. Highlighting the diversity and strength of our unrivaled go-to-market engine. Then pricing activity, both in the quarter and throughout the year, created strong pricing dine resulting in normalized and constant currency MRR per cap yield stepping up $38 for the quarter and $127 for the year to $2,227 per cap [ph]. And we had record exceled leasing over the year while generating approximately $49 of nonrecurring xScale fee revenue in the quarter, primarily related to the EMEA region. On the sustainability front, we're pleased to again be listed on CDP's prestigious 2023 Climate Change A-List and again, to be recognized in JUST Capital's 2024 rankings as number one in real estate. As we look forward into 2024, our customers remain committed to all things digital and we believe we're the best manifestation of this opportunity as customers digitally transform their form, both in the cloud and through AI. Hence our enthusiasm about our position in the broader market and the opportunities that lay out for us. That said, we remain highly vigilant to the current market conditions and the impact on our customers. As mentioned last quarter, capacity constraints exist across a few of our markets, driving continued firm pricing power, albeit with some moderation to short-term growth. But as highlighted, on our expansion tracking slide, we have several new markets and additional capacity coming online later this year, with many other projects currently being contemplated as we look to extend our platform and drive growth. Also, we're very pleased with the operating leverage the business is delivering, benefiting from prior investments while being highly present future spend, resulting in improving adjusted EBITDA margins for the year. Importantly, our forward guide on our core metric being AFFO per share reflects our confidence in the long-term opportunity of our business, a preferential position, I believe, relative to any others in our space given the foundational differences of our platform. Additionally, our as reported guidance includes positive FX tailwinds due to the weaker U.S. dollar relative to '23 rates and net power price decreases as utility rates moderate across both our regulated and unregulated markets. Now let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Do note that all comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q4 revenues were $2.11 billion, up 15% over the same quarter last year due to strong recurring revenue growth, power price increases and record xScale nonrecurring fees. As you would expect, we're very pleased with the continued success of our xScale portfolio and the MRR and other fees generated, while also expecting a strong year in 2024. As noted previously, xScale MRR is inherently lumpy. For Q1, we expect MRR will step down sequentially, yet remain elevated as a turn of revenues due to strong APAC leasing activity in January. Q4 revenues or FX hedges includes a $3 million benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $920 million, or 44% of revenues, up 12% over the same quarter last year due to strong operating performance, although down quarter-over-quarter due to a $15 million charge related to our planned corporate real estate activities and a higher seasonal increase in repairs and maintenance spend. Q4 adjusted EBITDA net of our FX hedges had a minimal FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates and does include $4 million of integration costs. Global Q4 AFFO was $691 million, above our expectations due to strong business performance and favorable interest income, offset in part by higher seasonal recurring CapEx. The Q4 included a $4 million FX headwind compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q4 MRR terms stepped up to 2.4% in the higher end of our range due to customer optimizations. For 2024, we expect MRR churn to stay in the upper side of our churn range in the first half of the year, then moderate down in the second half and we expect this key metric average within our targeted 2% to 2.5% per quarter range for the year. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized and constant currency basis, EMEA was our fastest-growing MRR region at 27% due to power price increases. Followed by our APAC and Americas regions at 9% and 7% MRR growth, respectively. The Americas region had a solid quarter of strong new logo growth and firm pricing led by our Chicago, New York and Washington, D.C. metros. The Americas saw a step-up in cabinets billing in the quarter which now includes the intel assets in our nonfinancial metrics. EMEA business had a strong quarter led by our German business and our growth in urging market metros. We've had strong xScale activity across a number of our markets over the year. MainOne, our business in Ghana, Ivory Coast in Nigeria is performing better than our business case on a constant currency basis. Additionally, we signed our first deal in our Johannesburg 1 asset in South Africa which opens in Q3. And finally, the Asia Pacific region saw good performance in both our Japanese markets and in Mumbai. As it relates to our soon-to-be opened new markets in the region, we're actively building a strong pipeline of key ecosystem customers which we expect to close prior to the IBX openings. Also, we're pleased to have recently announced our first long-term PPA in APAC for 151 megawatts. To date, Equinix has executed 21 PPAs across Australia, France, Iberia, the Nordics and the U.S. which will generate more than 1 gigawatt of clean energy once operational. This will certainly help these markets accelerate their clean energy transition. And now looking at our capital structure. Please refer to Slide 8. Our net leverage remains low relative to our peers at 3.7x our annualized adjusted EBITDA. Our balance sheet increased approximately $32.1 billion [ph], including an unrestricted cash balance of $2.1 billion. Our cash balance includes the settlement of approximately $433 million of ATM food equity sales, the timing triggered by the increase in our Q4 quarterly cash dividend. Additionally, during the quarter, we executed an incremental $500 million of ATM forward equity sales which we expect to settle in late 2024. As I've noted previously, we expect to remain opportunistic in the timing and currency of our financing strategy, including our plans to refinance the $1 billion of debt maturing this year. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were $996 million, including recurring CapEx of $105 million. Since our last earnings call, we opened 7 retail projects, including 4 new data centers in Frankfurt, Kuala Lumpur, also Washington, D.C. In our xScale program, we opened 7 new projects and are now 87% leased or pre-leased for all of our operational and the Nose projects [ph]. During the quarter, we also purchased our London IBX asset and land for development in Mexico City. Revenue from owned assets increased to 66% of our recurring revenues, a meaningful step up in last quarter, highlighting the progress we've had around asset ownership and long-term control of our assets. Our capital expenditures delivered strong returns, as shown on Slide 10. Our 174 stabilized assets increased revenues by 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis or 5% excluding the benefit attributed to our power price increases. Our stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. As a reminder, unlike prior years, we plan to update our stabilized asset summary on the Q1 earnings call. And finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for an updated summary of 2024 guidance and bridges. Starting with revenues. For the full year 2024, we expect top line growth of 7% to 9% on an as-reported basis or 7% to 8% on a normalized and constant currency basis, excluding the impact of lower power cost pass through to our customers. We expect 2024 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 47%. And a 160 basis point improvement over last year due to strong operating leverage, targeted expense management initiative and power price decreases. We expect to incur $25 million of integration costs, primarily related to the main 1 business, projects which we expect to complete by end of year. AFFO is expected to grow between 9% and 12% compared to previous year. AFFO per share is expected to grow between 8% and 10% at the top end of our longer-term targeted range on both an as reported and normalized and constant currency basis. 2024 CapEx is expected to range between $2.8 billion and $3 billion, including about $220 million of recurring CapEx. And finally, after moving forward with the 25% increase in our per share cash dividend last quarter, we're holding our quarterly cash dividend cost at $4.26 per share for 2024. For the full year, the cash dividend will approximate $1.6 billion, a year-over-year increase of 19%, 100% which is expected towards from ordinary income given our expected strong operating performance. So, let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Keith. In closing, 2023 was a year of significant progress and focused execution against our ambitious agenda. While macro uncertainties persist, we anticipate continued economic recovery as we move through 2024 and believe this will continue to embolden customers to accelerate their digital transformation agendas with a keen focus on capturing business value through the extraordinary power of AI. Against this backdrop, demand for hybrid digital infrastructure should continue to grow and we're confident that the character of this demand will increasingly align with the distinctive advantages of Equinix, offering customer flexibility to deploy architectures that are more distributed, more cloud connected, more on-demand and more ecosystem rich than ever before. Features that have positioned Equinix once again as a leader in IDC MarketScape's worldwide assessment of data center services. Digital transformation is reshaping the fabric of our world, unlocking extraordinary possibilities and changing the basis for competition in almost every industry. Thanks to our distinct and durable advantages, Equinix is well positioned to capture these opportunities. Through the combined balance sheet power of Equinix and our JV partners, we'll continue to invest in supporting the vigorous demand for large-scale cloud and AI infrastructure around the world. Simultaneously, we will leverage the reach and connectivity of the world's leading retail platform to ensure that Equinix remains the best manifestation of the digital edge and a critical point of Nexus [ph] for modern cloud-centric architectures. Reaffirming our purpose to be the platform where the world comes together, enabling the innovations that enrich our work, our life and our planet. So, let me stop there and open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first caller is Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Great. Two, if I could. The first one on the revenue guidance. I think at the Analyst Day, you talked about 18% revenue guidance. Is that -- is it the macro conditions causing the lower end to be at that 7% this year? And you've talked in the past, Charles, about in opportunities in the U.S. xScale, hyperscale market. Any update on your thoughts there? Charles Meyers : Sure. Thanks for the question. Yes. Look, I would say overall demand signal, I think, remains strong. But as a reference it, we continue to see what we're characterizing these crosscurrents in the business. And we've seen -- seen those great bearing levels of revenue headwind over the past few quarters, really from 3 sources, I'd say. The first 2 really related to macro, as you mentioned and the last one, a bit more Equinix specific. First, I think a bit of extension in the sales cycle. In Q4, a bit similar to what we saw in Q1 of '23 we saw more deal slippage which we really had not seen in Q2 and Q3. And so we thought that we were served in a better spot. But not a lot of lost deals but a number of deals that got pushed one or more quarters and that affected the quarter and the exit rate. Second, we saw churn as slightly elevated. And I think more towards the high end of our range which really reflects the continuation of the optimization activity that we -- and candidly, others across the infrastructure space have been highlighting throughout 2023. And then the last one I'd say is really more -- a little more specific to us. I think we continue to grapple with capacity constraints in some of our key markets. And that hits us on the gross fitting [ph] since we really can't accommodate larger footprint requirements in those markets and it hits us on the churn side, in some cases, as we work to try to free up capacity through doing some churn and though we've seen that certainly in markets like Cisco or so [ph]. All those factors combined to give us a little lighter Q4 and therefore a little bit lower exit run rate. And as you know, in a 95% recurring revenue business that kind of puts you behind the power curve. So our full revenue guide come in a little bit below our Analyst Day range. But again, as you saw, a lot of things, I think, to be -- to feel good about, given the xScale strength, I think we saw strong bookings performance in our retail sweet spot. A very healthy pipeline and starting to see signs of emergence of an even bigger AI-related pipeline. So we continue to be upbeat about the long-term opportunity. And importantly, I think despite the lower revenue guide, I think we're continuing to see robust pricing, really driving some operating leverage in the business when that continues to really translate to those attractive returns on capital. A growing dividend and AFFO per share performance that really is at the top end of our long-term guidance range. So I think that's the overall thing. And again, I think really, we'd love to be in that range, believe me. And it's disappointing that we're not. But I think we're giving you a realistic view of what we think the current market content will support and we're going to go like hell to try to beat that. So that's that. Relative to U.S. xScale [ph], yes, we are absolutely working on how we're going to continue to be more aggressive in this market. We think there is opportunity. As you know, our tune and my tune specifically has changed a bit on that over the last couple of years. And I think we're positioned to really continue to get some significant, both economic and strategic benefits by advancing our investment in that. And so we're hard at work on that. Nothing specific to report here but I think you'll hear from us in the near future on that. Operator : Our next caller is Aryeh Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Aryeh Klein : Maybe just on the AI front. Clearly, the momentum is accelerating. Curious how you think about the TAM there, particularly relative to the $21 billion outlined at the Analyst Day. And then maybe just on the NVIDIA DGX offering, how meaningful can that become? And is that something you can ultimately offer anywhere and beyond the $12 billion [ph] or so markets initially targeted? Charles Meyers : Yes. I mean, AI is a really interesting one. I think there is a massive opportunity. I think similar to what other people are seeing, we see it as hugely promising and moving very quickly but still pretty darn early in the overall cycle. So it's -- it clearly was a major factor in our xScale leasing. Obviously, record bookings there and I expect we're going to continue to see a lot of strength and that's informing a bit of that desire to lean in on that investment. I wouldn't say it's yet proving to inflect our retail bookings. As I just said, we kind of -- we were a little shorter than we wanted to be there. But again, we're seeing the green shoots there, we saw some great early on the retail side, both last quarter in terms of these network nodes to support large-scale training requirements with some of the service fares we talked about those. And then some really good enterprise wins as they're looking at really enterprise-level training as well as inference and how to really unlock the full power of the AI ecosystem. And so -- and we think the NVIDIA DGX private cloud managed service is a really distinctive offering. And we're seeing big pipeline build there with NVIDIA on that front. And so -- so I do think we have a very broad range of where I think we can offer that around the world and we'll continue to expand that over time. But again, I think a hugely exciting opportunity. In terms of -- you asked about the TAM, I mean as I said at the Analyst Day, I think the TAM is huge. And so I think it's probably bigger than what we've set out there. I think when you look at the possible impacts and kind of what we're seeing in terms of the early returns on AI, I think you're going to continue to see a lot of investment flow to that. And so I think the TAM is probably bigger than what we outlined. I think the key for us is really where can we be distinctively differentiated in that. Yes, I think we're going to get a piece on the xScale side. But I think the more differentiated position for us over the long term is unlocking the power of the AI ecosystem through this sort of cloud adjacent set of offerings. And on the digital services side, our cloud adjacent storage and Fabric Cloud Router all sort of hitting in that sweet spot of what we think customers are really looking for -- control over their enterprise data ability to access AI tools from the hyperscalers who are innovating rapidly in that area, stitch it all together and make it work in a way that makes sense for them. And so Fabric Cloud Router, fabric, cloud-adjacent storage, all things that really play into that. So we continue to be very optimistic about that. But I would say tempering expectations, I think it's going to -- it's going to take a little time for that to really fully realize itself in terms of the bookings flow. Operator : Our next caller is John Atkin with RBC. Jonathan Atkin : On the churn commentary, is there anything to call out in terms of reading where you saw it or which products? Was it mainly cabinets or cross connects or other? Charles Meyers : Yes. I would say more on cabinets and power. The cross-connect turn is looking a lot like it has for the last several quarters, John. Growth activity continues to be strong. I think we're seeing some grooming, particularly in the network service provider segment as their businesses are a bit more challenged and I think they're really focused on cost reduction. We are seeing some consolidation into higher speeds. So that's a bit of a bit of a headwind. But I think the more, the more, the elevation was a bit more on the cabinets and power and CapEx side. But it really is related primarily, I think, to people resizing footprints in a way that is -- aligns to what their more immediate need is because I think that it's, we have -- I think there was a time there when people were saying, \"Hey, I have more than I need but I'm just going to hang on to it.\" And I think we -- that was the case in '22. But in '23, we've seen people a lot more pressured by budget. Part of that, we think, is actually related to -- you, guys, asked us a lot of questions when we did the PPI around would that create elasticity. And we haven't seen what I would consider traditional elasticity of demand but what we have sort of heard coming from our sales teams is a pressure that says, \"Hey, I ate up all my budget with the PPI. And so I can't grow as I expected. And so if I want to do some of the things, I'm looking to do on the AI front, I got to find room.\" And so they've been more typically contracting footprints. And so that's really the dynamic we're seeing. Let me give you a little more color on a couple of areas. One, only a single-digit percentage of our churn is full customer churn. So almost all -- the rest of it is all people moving around resizing footprints, that kind of activity. And quite encouragingly, I said, well, let's look at those customers and those that are churning and tell me what their other -- what their activity level is across the rest of the platform. And quite encouraging for the most part, you're finding those customers are buying elsewhere in tandem with the optimization work that they're doing. And so I think that's really the dynamic there. In terms of, I would say we've seen a little more of that in Europe, John. And that's probably because we were -- had a little large footprint population there. So I think we're seeing it a little heavier there. But again, our guide says sort of assumes that we're going to continue to see some of this through the first half of this year with attenuation of that in the back half of '24. Jonathan Atkin : Got it. And then secondly, I was curious about the xScale initiative and the growth path in the Americas and kind of the puts and takes of pursuing that organically versus inorganically? Charles Meyers : Yes. I mean I think we're very focused right now on organic. We would certainly not be -- we wouldn't necessarily not be open to inorganic. I just think it's a tougher thing in terms of identifying those assets. I think the multiples at which those things are trading are pretty heady, to say the least and plenty of competition for those assets. And so I think we're primarily focused on organic. And -- but again, if the circumstances and conditions change, one, our balance sheet is always ready. And I think we'd be open to that. But I think our focus is probably more so on the organic side. Operator : And our next call is Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael Rollins : Just first following up on the point that you're making about customer optimization. I think in the past, you've used the analogy of managing the retail data centers is like a tetra sport [ph] of sitting different pieces and deployments together. As there's some optimization, can you share your opportunity to resell any space or power capacity that you get back and how that plays into the dynamic for 2024? And then just secondly, just curious if you could unpack the constant currency organic growth range, xPower [ph] of 7% to 8% in terms of what stabilized growth would be -- and then within stabilized, how to think about the price ARPU component relative to the volume component. Charles Meyers : Okay. Maybe Keith can jump in here on the second part of that, too and we'll tag team it a bit. But let me catch your first one first. Yes, you're absolutely right. We've long for many years, talked about our business as a bit of a tetris game [ph] in terms of figuring out how to get optimal returns from our capacity. And I would tell you that I think that given the increasing price environment, given the tendency for our churn to be a bit biased towards the large footprint side of things, we generally see churn as value accretive over time. That doesn't mean we want it all. It's -- but it's -- sometimes, we need it and we actually may sort of work to get it to happen. And that's, as I said, that happens sometimes in Singapore in the markets like that. But there is inherently a trade-off between growth rates and return on invested capital. And what we're seeing is that even in high-demand markets, there is a vacancy drag. And what I mean by that is the time frame that it takes to really fully replace churn with new revenue and that's particularly true when you're replacing a single large foot implementation with a large number of smaller deals, we're seeing probably a little longer vacancy drag than what we maybe would have thought. And so while I think that the -- that kind of positive mark-to-market opportunity exists and improving our business mix has always been central to our ability to deliver increasing MRR per cab and return on investment sort of stabilized asset performance and importantly, FFO per share, it is sometimes a revenue headwind for us. So we do see that on the churn but I think there are positive aspects to it as well. As to the 7% to 8%, look, if you look at stabilized assets, absent the PPI, they're in that 5% range. And -- and so -- but that includes selling interconnection into them. It's probably not a ton of additional volume growth. They're operating at reasonably high levels of utilization. So I do think you're going to see some positive price on mark-to-market. And I think you're going to see continued interconnection sort of probably more, in our more traditional range. And then the rest of that, that growth is going to have come from the broader footprint, including our non-stabilized assets which are probably growing at a slightly higher rate. Anything to add further on that? Keith Taylor : Yes. And Michael, let me just add maybe just a few other quick points. We've always said that we think stabilized assets can grow 3% to 5% on a sort of constant currency and normalized basis. And this quarter, we're at that range 9% with the power price increases. What are you going to feel -- what you're seeing this year being 2024, there's a couple of things. So we've neutralized currency, we've neutralized for all intents and purposes, the power price decreases. Again, that's going to have a roughly 30 basis point impact, I mean the power price, it will impact sort of the growth rate a little bit there. And so where we're really focusing is really the timing. Okay to somebody [ph], so what we're really focusing on is the timing. And so as Charles alluded to, had a little bit higher churn as we entered the -- exited the year. We have a little bit more higher churn at the front end of the year. And so when you look to the back end of the year, you actually get a much more attractive growth rate than what you start the year at. And so what it blends itself out, basically, you've got a 7% to 8% growth rate. But overall, when you sort of the business in and of itself, extremely strong pipeline. We're taking into consideration what we think is the timing delays in -- and although a reasonable book-to-bill interval, we still think that the just how -- the speed at which things are converting from the pipeline into a billable event, that's just taking longer. And then the other thing, I would just say is nonrecurring revenues for all intents and purposes, it's going to be roughly flat year-over-year. It's going to move around quarter-to-quarter, as we've talked about. Q4 was very rich, Q1 is still pretty darn good because we closed 2 large assets in xScale space in January. And so we will get -- there be some fees that. But I think what's most important is understanding that the richness of the pipeline, the timing of the year and what we envision that we'll exit 2024 with, is what gives us the confidence that we can continue to drive the value into the main FFO per share number and give you the growth. Charles Meyers : Well, Mike, I'd say that the short story on it is that 7% to 8%, I think, is 3% to 5% is the way to think about the stabilized assets. And the balance of that is going to really need to come from the broader portfolio which is probably going to have less mark-to-market juice. I think the 3% to 5% has to come in part from some juice in the mark-to-market opportunity that we have in the stabilized assets. Because those are the ones that are going to be rolling through. You probably have a little less than that in the non-stabilized portfolio because they are newer -- in newer contracts with probably less of a gap there. And then we're just going to have to continue to drive the volume on the gross bookings side. Operator : Our next caller is David Barden with Bank of America. David Barden : Two, if I could, just real quick. Charles, we've been talking about the hybrid private public cloud infrastructure for the longest time. You brought up a new term that I hadn't heard before, the private AI. And I wondered if you could maybe elaborate a little bit how that compares, contrasts or doesn't to our understanding of hybrid private public cloud. What is that, the private AI architecture look like as far as Equinix concerned? And then second, Keith. Last quarter, we talked a lot about cabinet, 8 cab [ph] per cab, consumption and how that's evolving and the potential to bring a new number to the forefront which would be something like a cabinet equivalent billing number. Could you kind of elaborate a little bit on how that looked like in the fourth quarter and where we are in evolving that disclosure. Charles Meyers : Thanks, David. So on private AI, I do think there's strong similarities and some differences between what we think about private cloud or hybrid cloud. But I think the dynamic is quite similar. And in fact, I was looking at an industry survey that was recently given to me that showed that based on their discussion with respondents that we're implementing Gen AI, about 32% of those funds were doing that in public clouds, exclusively. About 32% we're doing it in private cloud exclusively. And about -- and now 36%, we're doing it in a hybrid between some private cloud, some public cloud. And the folks who are doing it in public, many of them were doing it in more than 1 public cloud. And so that dynamic in sort of how we saw cloud large play out over the last several years. And I think the end state is going to be that, that 36% is going to be a much bigger number. In other words, a much larger number of people are going to be doing sort of prosecuting their AI agenda through both public and private infrastructure. But I would say when we talk about where private AI happens, a lot of it is really focused on where people want to place their data. And this desire to -- and it is sometimes about the proprietary nature of that data and controlling it, etcetera and it sometimes about the cost of moving data in and out of public clouds. And other factors, including performance. And so private AI, what we're seeing is people saying, look, I want to maintain my control over my enterprise data. And I want to place it somewhere that is cloud adjacent because the hyperscalers are innovating at such a rapid rate that I want to use their models, their tools, their -- and then you have this broader ecosystem outside of just the hyperscalers that is also evolving that people want to connect to. And so cloud adjacent storage Equinix Fabric and Fabric Cloud Router are incredible tools and then you mix that with the color [ph] opportunity that they might need to place GPU infrastructure and that kind of thing, that's really what we see as the essence of the private AI opportunity. And so -- and it does, I think, seem to be taking shape in a way that's really positive for us. And then, go ahead on the second piece on the -- I know that we had that question before, David, we figured that one might be coming. Keith Taylor : Yes, David. So as it relates to some new metrics, we're continuing to review the data sets. The team, we're not clear that exactly what needs to be presented that we can comfortably put out of the market on a consistent basis. But one of the things we're thinking about, just to give you a sense and we're not ready for prime time yet, is looking at density or a threshold and the extent that there's a certain amount of density over some required threshold, we modify the cabinets again, as you all know, we report on a cabinet equivalent basis. So that's what we're thinking about because we think the cabinet is probably the best representation for you to get a sense of how we're utilizing the asset. That all said, we still -- I think we have to continue to be quite transparent about the overall density of the cabinets sold so that you can see sort of a trend line. We spent some energy thinking about power prices, just doesn't feel like the right metric to be sure. And given the nature of our business model relative to others. Again, as you know, we're a retail player and it just -- it's just a different type of metric and we're not sure that, that is a valuable metric. So looking forward, we're going to continue to work it and we'll absolutely be actually -- be sort of ready to go, I think, sometime in the first half of this year with either adjusted metrics or a different view on how we're going to represent our fill rates. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Elias with TD Cowen. Michael Elias : Great. Two, if I may. One of the questions we get from investors is whether GPU-based compute is distance remediating CPU-based compute. And if so, how the legacy data centers designed at lower cabinet densities, we'll be able to handle that. Are you seeing customers swapping CPUs for GPUs for their existing data center deployments. If so, how do you mitigate essentially against the obsolescence in existing facilities? That's the first question. And then the second question is along a similar vein for AI inference. The thought is about the model we need to sit proximate to the data which candidly lives within your facilities. Although I think there's also a question of whether that's CPU-based or GPU-based. As you look to capture demand for inference, how is the standard data center design for you, guys, evolving from both a power density perspective and a cooling architecture standpoint? Any color there would be helpful. Charles Meyers : There's lots there. All of things -- thanks for the question, Michael. All things that are obviously top of discussion around FX in various places. I do think that, look, GPUs are sort of something that is much more special purpose, dedicated compute that is -- that goes beyond the traditional CPU realm. I mean, I think is a very, very clear trend. That said, I don't think that it's a world where all things compute and all things AI are necessarily done by GPUs. And I think that there is going to be a range of players that I think continue to evolve on the compute side of things to provide chips that meet various sets, of various purposes in the AI realm. And so in terms of the AI and I don't -- we aren't seeing is this massive shift out or from CPU to GPU. What we're typically seeing is people adopting GPUs in parallel. And I think that even some things that are currently GPU-centric, we think over time, may actually be well served by either current or future generations of CPU. And so we're not seeing that as a big obsolescence trend. And that relates a little bit to the second part of your question and I think both on inference and training because I would say that the evolution of the data center design needs to respond to both of those things. I would say the more acute near-term evolution is on the training side. Because it's substantially more power dense and does require, I think, different thinking around that power density and the cooling to support it. And so I think the much higher average density design that we would probably put forward xScale build-out would be that more acute representation of the near-term change. On the inference side and I think broadly on the retail side, we are seeing densities, power densities rise but at a slower rate. And I think that our ability to implement liquid cooling as long as we have access to a chilled water loop, our ability to get liquid cooling into the facility to support high-density implementations is quite high. And in fact, we announced that we can do that in a large number of markets around the world. So I think we're in a good position. I don't think we face a situation where we're going to have meaningful obsolescence even of our significantly more dated assets. And so especially as we can implement liquid cooling inside of those facilities. And so -- but I think we're -- those are things we continue to track and I do think they're going to have to be very top of mind for us. And probably the overall pace of change in our design is going to increase in this next decade than it was in the one prior for sure. piles. Operator : The next caller is Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Matt Niknam : I will keep it brief, it's 2 follow-ups. Number one, what guides your expectation for churn to, I guess, improve slightly in the second half? Is there anything you have -- you're seeing in terms of visibility or anything guiding that expectation for improvement? And then secondly, in terms of its macro, you talked about some, I guess, deal slippage and dynamics that resemble maybe 1Q of '23 that you saw in 4Q. Just any updates in terms of -- we're now, I guess, halfway into 1Q. Have those deals closed? Are they still out there? Just any color, I guess, from what you see in the first 6 weeks of this year. Charles Meyers : Yes. Let me take that one first, Matt. We have -- some of that business has close to -- some of that closed very quickly immediately after the quarter and that's just sort of a natural turn of events. Some of it is in our commit for Q1 and some of it has rolled into Q2 or quarters forward from that. So very little lost. We did -- we had lost some of that but very little of it. And so really primarily push forward. Again, as I said, Q4 did unfortunately look a little more like Q1. We would have referred it to look a lot more like Q2 and Q3. But that is the dynamic. And I think that we're -- it's hard to fully predict. But again, our customers, the sentiment we hear from customers is one, yes, we have tighter budgets. Yes, we're continuing to optimize. But boy, we sure are committed to what we're doing on the digital side of things. And yes, we want to talk to you about what we're doing in AI. And yes, we want to figure out where to place our data. But I think those things take a little time to translate into firm bookings trajectory. And then as to why we feel a comfort level around mitigation churn, we do have good visibility to our pipeline. In fact, our large deal churn, we've gotten very good at forecasting. We saw a little bit more midsized churn in Q4 which contributed some to the elevation. And so I think we have to keep our eye very closely on that. And I don't have a ton more to offer you on that particular view. But I think that we do think that it is realistic for us based on what we're hearing in terms of appetite from customers that we would see some abatement and churn in the second half. I'll add one more comment. It used to be, I would say, '21 and most of '22, I think there was a scarcity mindset relative to data center capacity. '23 really changed pretty meaningfully. The macro conditions changed. This sort of desire to tighten budgets, the desire to kind of offset the impact of PPI. I think all did play into what we were hearing was this very different appetite and a higher degree of optimization. I would say, I think we're seeing the front end, though, of some of our customers who have at least talked to us about turning back some capacity, sort of come back and say, yes, don't put that back on the market yet because we're not sure we want to give up capacity in this market. And so that's the first time, I think, in a while that we've heard that kind of mindset. It's typically from larger service providers. But I think we're going to probably see -- we're starting to see the front end of that. And so again, if macro does what we think it will do which we would probably see some improving interest rates over the course of the year. I think we would see a generally improved macro environment and I think that's sort of informing our guidance. Operator : Our next caller is Richard Choe with JPMorgan. Richard Choe : I wanted to follow up on the competitive environment. Are you seeing deals go to competitors or... Charles Meyers : Yes. I mean, we certainly see some -- it's not like we don't see any competitive loss. But our or -- and I would say it's more typically on some of the larger footprint stuff. I think there are certain use cases that were just -- so competitively distinguished that we have less that there's -- it's less likely that we'll see those it's oftentimes more a timing issue. I do think that where we're tight, customers sometimes have to find another way, right? And so we hate that but it happens. But I wouldn't say overall -- there's certainly certain markets where we have solid people with a solid value proposition that I think can compete effectively in certain markets. And I do think we're starting to see also just people thinking about how they want to allocate their workloads. And so the overall share of wallet continues to be more of the question in terms of how people are thinking about their spend going forward. Richard Choe : And then in terms of pricing actions for the year, what's kind of implied in guidance? And should we expect that there are some price increases for interconnection this year? Charles Meyers : Yes. I mean, I think overall, we're seeing a really robust pricing environment, right? And so -- and probably many of the -- we put forward through a number of price increases. I do think we're evaluating a price increase on interconnection in the U.S. market. I think -- but overall, I think that's certainly one contributing factor to our ability to continue to drive growth in the business. And I think that firm pricing is also has really, I think, informing the really critical overall message here which is a degree of confidence and a really attractive guide on the improving profitability of our business and the AFFO per share guidance which is, in fact, at the sort of more towards the top end of our Analyst Day guide. And so -- and again, as we've said, that's really our lighthouse metric. We think it's the bedrock of value creation when you combine that with our dividend yield and overall creates a really attractive story. Operator : And our next caller is Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Frank Louthan : Great. And just maybe to follow up on that, Charles. With some of this optimization with customers, any thought about customers possibly looking for some products you have to just cross connect or others trying to find that from others for less as they're trying to optimize their budgets? Is there any concern there? Charles Meyers : Yes, we don't see that as typical as there -- in a lot of markets, I think that our position is so -- it's not that we're the only game in town. And so yes, there is some substitution in cases but it really is more us seeing that people saying, hey, things that they weren't using, things that they can consolidate on the higher-speed circuits, those kind of things are really the broader dynamics. Also, I would tell you that I think we're seeing that the positivity or the positive benefits of being able to have the full range of services available for our customers is really there. And so they may say, \"Hey, your -- we think your metal offering really meets our immediate need here. It's our agile as [ph] is more flexible.\" We may eventually move that into colocation over time or sometimes the opposite. And so -- so I think that the momentum, both in the data center services and I think increasingly on the digital services side, even though I think we've got a lot of work to do continue to evolve our go-to-market motion and our underlying cash systems and processes, etcetera, to really support the slightly different business that an as a service model provides in digital services but I think we're continue to make good progress there. And I think our full portfolio of offerings is resonating well with the customer. Chip Newcom : This concludes our fourth quarter earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Goodbye.

[Operator Instructions]  I would now like to turn the call over to Chip Newcom, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin. Chip Newcom : Good afternoon, and welcome to today's conference call. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone that  some of the statements that we will be making today are forward-looking in nature and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those statements and may be affected by the risks we've identified in today's press release and those identified in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K filed February 16, 2024, and recently filed Form 10-Q. Equinix assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or comment on forward-looking statements made on this call.   In addition, in light of Regulation Fair Disclosure, it is Equinix' policy not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done through an explicit public disclosure.   In addition, we'll provide non-GAAP measures on today's conference call. We provide a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a list of the reasons why the company uses these measures in today's press release on the Equinix Investor Relations page at www.equinix.com.   We've made available on the IR page of our website a presentation designed to accompany this discussion, along with certain supplemental financial information and other data. We would also like to remind you that we post important information about Equinix on the IR page of our website from time to time and encourage you to check our website regularly for the most current available information.   With us today are Charles Meyers, Equinix' CEO and President; and Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up in 1 hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to one.   At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thank you, Chip. Good afternoon and welcome to our Q1 earnings call.   We had a great start to 2024 driven by our highest Q1 bookings performance on record, strong conversion rates, completely favorable pricing dynamics, and lower-than-expected churn, all resulting in our 85th key quarter of top-line revenue growth, the longest such streak of any S&P 500 company. We closed more than 3,800 deals across more than 3,100 customers for the quarter demonstrating both the scale and the consistency of our go-to-market machine. And we again saw accelerating hyperscale demand translate into robust xScale leasing in both EMEA and Asia. While we continue to operate in an environment of broader economic uncertainty, and see some level of corresponding customer caution, our forward-looking pipeline is strong, and we remain optimistic about the opportunity ahead.   Digital transformation, particularly given the rapid adoption of AI, serves as a powerful catalyst for economic expansion, and our customers remain steadfastly committed to their digital initiatives, recognizing the pivotal role they play in fostering long-term revenue growth and driving operational efficiency.   As we continue to make digital infrastructure more powerful, more accessible and more sustainable, we're thrilled that Merrie Williamson has joined our team as chief customer and revenue officer. Merrie is an operational and visionary leader with unique skills and experience to help drive the next chapter of our growth and brings a proven track record of building new routes to market, enhancing the customer experience, and accelerating go-to-market productivity.   On the sustainability front, we continue to advance our bold future first agenda, with Gartner estimating that by 2027, 80% of CIOs will have performance metrics tied to the sustainability of their IT organization. It's clear to us that companies are prioritizing sustainability in their digital infrastructure decisions. We recently published our ninth Annual ISR Report and continued our industry leadership with 96% renewable energy coverage across our growing portfolio, marking our sixth consecutive year with over 90% coverage. Equinix PPAs now support more than one gigawatt of new clean energy in high-impact markets, and we continue to seek additional clean energy projects that will support our growth. In late April, we were pleased to announce our first renewable PPA in Singapore, an important part of our plan to continue to grow in this strategically critical market. This project will provide 75 megawatts of solar and is in line with Singapore's Green Plan 2030, which seeks to have all business sectors supported by cleaner energy sources.   In parallel, we remain highly focused on improving the energy efficiency of our existing facilities as measured by power usage effectiveness. In 2023, we invested $78 million in high-returning efficiency projects, improving our average annual PP&E by over 8% year over year to 1.42, another lever in continuing to drive performance in our stabilized assets. We also continue to make progress on adjusting the thermostat in our facilities, with more than 50 of our data centers now operationally ready to enable A1A and strong industry support for the implementation of this important new temperature standard. Turning to our results as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q1 were $2.1 billion, up 7% over the same quarter last year driven by strong recurring revenues and xScale fees. Adjusted EBITDA was up 6% year-over-year and AFFO per share was meaningfully better than expectations due to strong operating performance. Interconnection revenues stepped up 9% year over year. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant-currency basis. Our unmatched scale and reach continue to drive performance in our data center services portfolio. Given strong underlying demand for digital infrastructure and the long duration in delivering new capacity, we see a growing scarcity mindset, and therefore we continue to invest broadly across our global footprint. We currently have 50 major projects underway in 34 markets across 21 countries, including 14 xScale builds, representing more than 16,000 cabinets of retail and more than 50 megawatts of xScale capacity through the end of 2024. This quarter we added new projects in Frankfurt, Madrid, Osaka, and Silicon Valley. Key multi-market wins this quarter include ServiceNow, expanding with Equinix in multiple locations globally, powering their continued growth including new GenAI workloads, and Wasabi technologies, a cloud object storage service provider expanding across all three regions to support their continued growth.   Our MRR per cabinet continues to rise increasing $119 year over year on a normalized and constant-currency basis to $2,258 driven by continued mark-to-market momentum, solid attach rates for interconnection and digital services, and increasing power densities. With respect to our net cabinets building capacity constraints in certain key markets and the meaningful delta in power density between churned cabs and booked cabs continues to pressure this metric. But gross additions remain strong and our booked kilowatts in the retail business were at near-record levels. Given strong bookings and upcoming capacity additions, we expect billable cabs to increase in the second half and continue to see cabinet growth as part of the long-term growth story for the business.   Turning to our industry-leading global interconnection franchise, we now have more than 468,000 total interconnections deployed on our platform. In Q1, interconnection adds picked up to 6,200 supported by healthy gross adds and a moderation of consolidations into higher bandwidth connections, and we continue to see a healthy pricing dynamic with a roughly 16% spread in the quarter between churned interconnects and new additions. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 5% quarter over quarter and 24% year over year to nearly 38 terabits per second led by the Americas.   We remain confident that Equinix's unique and durable advantages will continue to position our platform as the logical point of nexus for buyers and sellers of digital services to come together to fuel digital transformation and unlock the enormous potential of AI. This year, Gartner projects the spending on public cloud services will grow 20% to reach $679 billion as business needs and emerging technologies, including GenAI, drive cloud model innovation. We're seeing this translate into strong demand across multiple vectors with key cloud and IT customers broadly and with the hyperscalers specifically. In the quarter, we added one new native cloud on-ramp in Madrid, bringing us to 220 native cloud on-ramps across our portfolio, spanning 47 metros. This represents a nearly 40% market share of private cloud on-ramps in the markets where we operate.  We remain an integral and growing part of hyperscaler architectures, with these customers collectively representing more than $1.3 billion of annualized revenue in Q1 in our retail business alone, with deployments across an average of more than 60 of our data centers around the world. Importantly, we're also seeing strong go-to-market momentum with these market-shaping players as we partner to meet end-customer needs for hybrid cloud and private AI, making the hyperscalers some of our most productive channel partners.   In our xScale program, demand remains robust as cloud and AI needs are translating into strong pre-leasing activity. Since our last earnings call, we've pre-leased an incremental 48 megawatts capacity across our Frankfurt 10, Osaka 4, and Osaka 5 assets, including approximately 34 megawatts leased in mid-April. This brings total xScale leasing to nearly 350 megawatts globally with nearly 90% of our operational and underconstruction capacity leased, and a meaningful pipeline of opportunities to drive continued xScale momentum in the quarters to come.   Additionally, in mid-April, we announced our first U.S. xScale joint venture with PGIM Real Estate for our SV12x asset. When combined with our existing joint ventures in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America, this new JV will bring the expected global xScale portfolio to more than $8 billion in investment across more than 35 facilities and greater than 725 megawatts of power capacity when fully built out. We're also making good progress on additional planned xScale opportunities in the U.S, and we look forward to updating you on those developments in the coming quarters. Shifting to our digital services portfolio, Equinix Fabric and Network Edge continue to overindex relative to the broader business. We see solid interest from customers looking to use the combination of Fabric, Network Edge and Metal for their digital infrastructure requirements. In support of this need, our engineering teams recently completed the integration of Metal and Fabric, significantly improving the VC creation experience for Metal users. Wins across the business included global security leader CrowdStrike, exploring a cloud-adjacent storage solution on platform Equinix in EMEA to leverage proximity to Equinix's rich ecosystem of cloud and storage provider customers. And an online AI and data analytics education company building out AI infrastructure to support learning for global practitioners. Our channel program delivered another solid quarter with channel and partner influence deals accounting for over 30% of gross bookings and over 60% of new logos. We continue to see growth from the hyperscalers and from other key partners like AT&T, Avant, Dell, Kyndryl, and Zenlayer with wins across a wide range of industry segments and a broad mix of Equinix services. As we expand into new markets, our partners are accelerating our efforts to sell the global platform.   In Q1, we had a number of wins with Zenlayer in Malaysia, including delivering co-locations and interconnection solutions to a fintech firm, extending its reach into Kuala Lumpur, as well as supporting logistics consulting firm extending into Johor. We also saw a win with Kyndryl who also selected Platform Equinix to service some of its largest customers in Canada, including from the public sector. So, let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results for the quarter. Keith Taylor : Great. Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone.   As highlighted by Charles, we had a strong start to the year, delivering better-than-planned results across each of our core financial metrics. Our net bookings were meaningfully better than expected. We had strong customer momentum, lower-than-expected churn, and continued positive pricing actions, and our forward-looking pipeline remains deep as we look to execute against our plan for the remainder of the year.   Global MRR per cabinet, our ARPU metric measured in U.S. dollars, continues to show momentum across all three regions. With each of our regions now eclipsing to $2,000 for the first time despite the weaker foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar. Also, our xScale business continues to perform very well having leased another five assets year to date with a meaningful pipeline of opportunities for the quarters to come.   Now, as many of you know, Equinix's competitive advantage in the marketplace is derived from both our interconnected digital ecosystems and our industry-leading global scale and reach. But also, Equinix's operational reliability and putting the customer at the center of everything we do is a third competitive advantage.  As an example, our global ops teams strive to deliver greater than six-ninths of annual availability to our customers, which means being up and running for all, but approximately 30 seconds a year on average. To achieve this outcome, our ops team performed thorough capacity reviews and regularly monitored both our average and peak customer power draw against the shared facility capacity to ensure we can support our commitments to our customers. As demonstrated throughout our greater than 25-year history, we've reliably delivered against these operational commitments, which is why nearly 90% of our new reported bookings activity has historically come from existing customers, and by reliably delivering on our commitments to our customers, our team has also been able to deliver sustained value accretion to you, our shareholders.  As an additional update, we're also pleased to share that the audit committee of the company's board of directors conducted and has substantially completed a previously announced independent investigation with the assistance of independent third-party professional advisors. Based on the findings of the independent investigation, the audit committee has concluded that Equinix's financial reporting has been accurate and the application of its accounting practices has resulted in an appropriate representation of its operating performance. The audit committee had full discretion over the scope of the investigation and was not restricted in any way. As part of this assessment, the audit committee did not identify any accounting inconsistencies or errors requiring an adjustment to or restatement of previously issued financial statements or non-GAAP measures. Also, as previously disclosed, shortly after the release of the short seller report, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office from the Northern District of California. Additionally, on April 30th, 2024, we received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are cooperating fully with both subpoenas and do not expect to comment further on such matters until appropriate to do so.  Now, let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant-currency basis.   As depicted on Slide 4, global revenues were $2.127 billion, up 7% over the same quarter last year in the upper half of our guidance range on a constant-currency basis. As expected, non-recurring revenue stepped down sequentially yet still remained elevated as a percentage of revenue due to the level of xScale leasing activity in the quarter.  For Q2, given our strong Q1 net bookings activity and increased non-recurring revenues related to our APAC xScale business in April, Q2 revenues are expected to step up 2% to 3% over the prior quarter.   Q1 revenues, net of our FX hedges included a $14 million headwinds when compared to our prior FX guidance rates due to the strong U.S. dollar in the quarter. Global Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $992 million or 47% of revenues, up 6% over the same quarter last year and above the top end of our guidance range due to lower utilities expense and timing of spend. Q1 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, included $6 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and $1 million of integration costs. Global Q1 AFFO was $843 million, up 8% over the same quarter last year and above our expectations due to strong operating performance and lower-than-expected net interest expense. As planned, we had seasonally lower recurring capex spend, consistent with prior years. Q1 AFFO included a $4 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q1 MRR was better than expected at 2.1%. For the full year, we continue to expect MRR churn to average in the 2% to 2.5% quarterly guidance range.   Turning to our regional highlights, these full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized basis, APAC was our fastest-growing region at 12% followed by the Americas and EMEA regions both growing at 6%. The Americas region had a great quarter with strong bookings performance led by the public sector activity and healthy pickup in exports to the other regions as our team sold across our global platform. We saw particular strength in our Atlanta, Culpeper, and Miami metros, as well as a strong interest in the additional soon-to-be open capacity in the New York Metro.   Our EMEA business delivered a strong quarter with robust gross bookings activity including an increased mix of medium and larger footprint deals. In the quarter, we saw booking strength in our Barcelona, Frankfurt and Paris markets.  And finally, Asia Pacific region had a great quarter with firm pricing and strength from our digital services products, including increased adoption of inter metro connections on Equinix Fabric as customers continue to focus on their network optimization efforts. In the quarter, we saw Good Inc. recently opened capacity in Malaysia and continued momentum in our largest markets in the region including Hong Kong, Tokyo and Sydney.   And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our net leverage remained low relative to our peers at 3.6 times our annualized adjusted EBITDA. Our balance sheet decreased approximately $31.9 billion, including unrestricted cash balance of over $1.5 billion. Our cash balance decreased quarter-over-quarter as our strong operating cash flow was more than offset by the growth investments and the quarterly cash dividend. As noted previously, and given our strong balance sheet and liquidity position, we plan to remain opportunistic as it relates to the timing, size and currency of our future capital market activities, including when we plan to refinance the $1 billion of debt maturing later this year.  Turning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $707 million including seasonally lowered recurring capex of $21 million. Since our last earnings call, we opened three retail projects in Mexico City, Mumbai and Paris. We also purchased our Dublin 2, Mumbai 2 and Stockholm 3 assets, as well as land for development in Santiago, Chile. Revenues from owned assets increased at 67% of our recurring revenues, and more than 90% of the current retail expansion investment will be on owned land or owned buildings with long-term ground leases.  Now, we're also entering a stage in our asset lifecycle where we're evaluating select opportunities to invest in highly valued IBXs that have been operating for 20 years or longer. Starting this quarter, we added a new category of non-recurring capex spend to our disclosures, referred to as redevelopment capex, to track these investments to enhance the capacity, efficiency and operating standards of facilities in this category, and to attract capital investments that are intended to meaningfully extend the economic life of assets. Our first redevelopment project is DC2, one of our original IBXs that opened in the early 2000s, and home to our networking ecosystem in northern Virginia. Total estimated spend on this DC2 project will approximate $76 million broken into two primary categories of capex investment, redevelopment and recurring. We expect the $56 million redevelopment portion of the investment to yield meaningful additional space and power capacity, and, given the favorable pricing environment and high customer demand for the DC2 asset, we anticipate that this capacity will generate additional revenues and cash flow that should result in an IR well above our current stabilized asset yields. The remaining portion of the investment, which relates to maintaining our existing revenues, such as roof replacement, will be categorized as typical as recurring capex.   Now moving to Slide 10. Our capital investments have continued to deliver strong returns. Consistent with prior years in Q1, we completed the annual refresh of our IBX categorization exercise, and our stabilized asset count increased by a net six IBXs. Our now 180-stabilized asset increased recurring revenues by 5% year over year on a constant-currency basis, a quarter-over-quarter step-down as we lap the power price actions in 2023. Stabilized assets were collectively 84% utilized and generated a 26% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested.  And finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for updated summary of 2024 guidance and bridges. Do note all growth rates are on a normalized and constant-currency basis. For the full year 2024, we're maintaining our underlying revenue outlook with expected top-line growth of 7% to 8%, a reflection of our continued strong momentum. We're raising our underlying 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $5 million due to lower integration spend. We're raising our underlying 2024 AFFO guidance by $25 million to now grow between 10% and 13% compared to the previous year due to lower net interest expense. AFFO per share is now expected to grow between 8% and 11%. 2024 capex is expected to range between $2.8 billion and $3 billion including about $220 million of recurring capex spend. So, let me stop here, and I'll turn the call back to Charles. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Keith.   In closing, we continue to see our customers derive compelling value from platform Equinix, leveraging our superior global reach, our scaled digital ecosystem, our market-leading interconnection platform and our greater-than-25-year track record of delivering on our commitments to fuel their investments in digital transformation. We are delighted to see the continued strength and fundamentals of our business, we remain highly confident in the integrity of our financials and we are as optimistic as ever that we'll continue to be an important partner for digital leaders as they accelerate AI investments and embrace hybrid and multi-cloud as the clear architecture of choice.  Before we turn to Q&A, I want to spend a few minutes on my transition. In reflecting on the last six years, it has been both a pleasure and a privilege to be the CEO of Equinix, showing up every day in service to our customers, to our employees, and to our shareholders. As I transition to the role of Executive Chairman later this quarter, I'll continue to take an active part in the business as Adaire Fox-Martin steps into the CEO role. Adaire is an extremely accomplished executive with a proven ability to deliver sustained value to the full range of stakeholders. I'm confident that she brings the experience, the skills, and the passion that we need to inspire our teams and support the evolving needs of our customers, driving growth and unlocking the extraordinary power of Platform Equinix. I look forward to working with Adaire in this next chapter of the Equinix journey. I'd also like to thank Peter Van Camp, a shining example of the magic of Equinix over the last 25 years, and look forward to partnering with him as he moves from our Executive Chairman to Special Advisor to the board.   I look forward to further collaboration with both Adaire and the broader leadership team as we continue on our path as the world's digital infrastructure company capturing and creating new opportunities and leveraging our distinctive advantages to ensure digital leaders can harness our trusted platform to create and interconnect the foundational digital infrastructure that enhances our world.  So, let me stop there and open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you.   [Operator instructions]   Our first question will come from Jon Atkin of RBC. Jonathan Atkin : XScale, just interested in what you're seeing in terms of targeted unlevered returns that you're underwriting. Any difference given the strong demand profile?   And then, it looks like you've got $1 billion of senior notes coming due late this year, $1.2 billion due in 2025, and I just wondered what you're thinking in terms of refinancing cost of debt and whether a non-U.S. jurisdiction might provide a cost advantage. Charles Meyers : Yeah, Jon. I'll take the first piece and then Keith can both add to that and then take the second piece on the refinancing. Look, xScale, you're right, continues to perform extremely well. We've seen huge pre-leasing activity over the last several quarters and I think we continue to see a lot of demand out there and a lot of confidence that we'll be able to effectively pre-sell that capacity as well and under returns that I think are in line with -- I mean, I do think we're seeing relatively firm pricing. I also think we're seeing rising costs, and so I think that the combination of those things leaves us with, I think, a level of underwriting that is at or above kind of where we probably were last year and feeling very confident in the range where we are on cash and cash returns overall. Keith Taylor : And Jon, maybe I just want to add on to what Charles said there. I think it's important to appreciate that there's a fee stream that Equinix continues to enjoy on a larger revenue base to compensate for the higher costs that Charles alluded to. So, when I think about our all-in returns, they're really quite attractive as a business, and as we've talked about over the last few years, they're at a point where also that it's not only the recurring and nonrecurring stream that we get, I think there's opportunity over some period of time as our partners think about mentioning monetizing some of their investments to promote fees associated with it.  So, overall, again, I think the return profile, as Charles alluded to, is attractive, recognizing it's a higher cost model than it was previously, and you'll see that in our results. As it relates to really the debt that's being refinanced, I'm going to maybe approach it from a different perspective, because when you think about the cost, I really want to talk about the spread. Partially, the spread is really about what do we think we can borrow over whatever the base rate is. And as I made reference to it -- and I'm going to pause here for a second, Jon. Can you hear me? Jonathan Atkin : Absolutely, yes. Keith Taylor : OK. Thank you. We had a funny -- something going on with our conference line here.   So, I think about it more spread, and again, I made the reference in the prepared remarks that we're going to look at the timing and the currency in which we borrow money. Suffice it to say between how we raise our capital and where we need it to refinance the existing debt, we're really looking at different markets. And so, the spread, I think, you should expect, based on where we were, I think somewhere between 105 and 115 basis points over base, whatever that is. Now, we might do it in euro, we might do it in dollar, and we could swap it depending on where the cash flows are needed, but suffice it to say, I think we're in a really good spot to enjoy a spread relative to others that is very competitive.   The last comment I would just say is, look, the markets are very volatile right now, but for obvious reasons, you see that. And that's why I think it's important to talk about the spread. Suffice it to say, I think we will have ample access to capital. It just depends on the timing of when we execute against that transaction. So, whether it's this year or it's next year refinancing, I think we're in a really good spot. And then I think as everybody is also aware, we have effectively an unused line of credit of $4 billion. So, if the markets aren't there for whatever reason, we can always draw on that and then refinance at a later date, but I don't foresee that as being an issue for us. Charles Meyers : Jon, I would back up a little bit to the xScale and just say in addition to the underwriting continuing to be strong, pre-leasing activity strong, I think we're seeing exactly it play out very much as we expected in terms of how the whole thing fits together from a platform strategy standpoint. So very pleased with the xScale business and very pleased with how it fits in overall in terms of driving the broader value of the platform to our customers. Jonathan Atkin : Just given the demand profile and the pricing dynamic that we've heard elsewhere, would low teens be an unreasonable kind of assumption to think about for unlevered return development yields or not? Keith Taylor : I think it's reasonable. Of course, certain markets have different price points as you can appreciate. But one of the things I think, at a broad range, I think low teens is very, very appropriate on an unlevered basis. And I don't think we can -- you can't lose sight, generally speaking, of the supply and sort of the demand sort of dynamics here, that supply is going to continue to be -- it's going to be difficult to deliver into the marketplace, and so, when you look at the demand profile, I think pricing will continue to remain very, very firm. So, on an unlevered basis, we can get a really nice return and you add on the fee structure that we can enjoy as a business. And we recently announced the Silicon Valley 12 transaction. Again, we're very pleased with the overall structure and type of deal we're doing there, and we're working really hard to bring that to a fully stabilized position and you know what, the returns that you're considering. Charles Meyers : Thanks, Jon. Operator : The next question comes from Nick Del Deo of MoffettNathanson. Nicholas Del Deo : Charles, best of luck in the new role. I appreciate all the time you spent with us on these calls and other forums over the years.  First, can you share any details regarding the mechanics of the internal review, like who is engaged to perform the work or the aspects of the accounting that was reviewed and how far back they went? Any suggestions for go-forward changes? Then anything along those lines would be super helpful. Charles Meyers : Sure. I'll give you a bit of that, and Keith can certainly add to it.   The mechanics that we did, the audit committee obviously was the one conducting that, and we have a very experienced audit committee acting independently. And then they retained independent advisors in WilmerHale, the law firm that led the investigation, as well as AlixPartners, the forensic accountants, independent forensic accountants that led that. And they looked at, particularly surrounding, obviously, the accounting-related matters that were sort of referenced in the allegations in the short report. And as a public company, as frustrating as it might be, that's our obligation to undertake an investigation to look into those. And so, we tried to keep people focused on the business, while that investigation took place and we tried to focus on serving our customers while the audit committee led that investigation alongside the advisors. They collected the right information that they deemed as appropriate to validate and understand the concerns that were there and making a judgment and an assessment about the accuracy of our financial reporting, both on a GAAP basis and the non-GAAP measures that were involved here. And again, as we said in the press release and in the prepared remarks here, they came back with a level of confidence in those results and in the accuracy of those results. And so, while the investigation remains open, in large part, because we have to sort of navigate the subpoenas with the SEC and the DOJ, we feel great about the outcome. I feel like it really speaks to the integrity of our team, which, as I said, I have great confidence in and in the integrity of our financials. So, I'll leave it there, and if there's anything you want to add there Keith? Keith Taylor : No, I think, well said, Charles. Thanks. Nicholas Del Deo : OK. Again, great to hear. Thanks for sharing those details. I guess one other topic, Keith, you noted that DC2 is going through a redevelopment, obviously, a crown jewel facility for you guys. I guess you noted the attractive IRRs associated with the investments. I guess can you expand a little bit on the work that you're doing to that data center and what you think those capex dollars might unlock from a revenue perspective? Keith Taylor : Yeah, sure. It's one of those ones -- we've been working on this initiative for roughly a year, because it is a new category of expansion capex. And certainly, what you're trying to do is do two things. One, we want to extend effectively the life of the asset further than people would typically anticipate. We're really going in and doing is really a heart transplant in a live environment. It's one of our highest-performing assets in the portfolio. And so, to give you a perspective, it's substantial because we refer to the $76 million, so you get a sense it's not something that's small. It's going to do two things. It's going to extend the life. It's going to create more revenue opportunities. And think of the range of 15% to 20% of an augmentation to an already high revenue environment. So that's the kind of value you can extract from it. The $20 million, the recurring capex component, will be doing roof replacement and some other things, and so that will go through the recurring line. But it's the $56 million -- in the prepared remarks, we really talked about the fact that this is going to get a yield, a return for us on an IRR basis better than stabilized assets. So, it gives you a sense it's in the 30s. If you decide to put sort of the end-of-life stuff that was recurring into the mix, you're still in the 20s. So, it gives you a sense of the investment decision that we're making is very, very substantial in a very critical asset.   The last thing I also want to leave you with, when we make this type of decision, part of the reason we were really calling it a redevelopment is this isn't like getting something done over a quarter. Again, high-density live environment is going to take two to three years to get this done. So, it gives you a sense of the level of investment. It's not like replacing a motor. We're basically taking out the guts of the entire IBX and replacing it with basic new and updated equipment. So, overall, I'd just say it's one of those things. There's not a huge portfolio, but I think over the next three to five years or something like that, you should expect something like six to eight assets could fall into that mix. Again, it has to be older than 20 years, and we have to invest more than $20 million for it to be considered a redevelopment capex item. Charles Meyers : Yeah, I'll just add a little more color, Nick, in that. So, I think that the type of capex investment, as you said, is in the base infrastructure required to operate the data center, power, cooling, etc. But the big difference here is that -- and we're seeing this dynamic play out because of the sort of rising density needs across the business, where we are, at times, needing to derate space and actually have space come off of the sort of -- go on to what we refer to as engineering hold. And in situations where you can unlock additional usable power, either through power efficiency projects or this kind of redevelopment investment, where you're putting entirely new equipment in, if you can unlock that power and match it to the space that is unused or on hold, you get meaningful, incremental capacity. And that's really the big difference here, is you're getting incremental capacity that starts to feel like another phase of a project. And so, in this case, DC2 is coming out of the stabilized assets, which, by the way, hurts stabilized asset pool, goes back into expansion. And the reason is because it's a really meaningful uptick in the overall capacity available from that facility. And that's really the litmus test that we use to say, OK, is it appropriate to qualify as a redevelopment project? And in this case, very, very much so given the customer demand for that asset. Operator : The next question comes from Aryeh Klein of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Aryeh Klein : Congrats, Charles, on the transition. I guess going back to xScale, I think about 40% of all the leasing done by xScale since launch has been since the beginning of the fourth quarter. How does the pipeline look relative to the amount of leasing that's been done recently?  And then when fully built out, you noted having about 725 megawatts of capacity. So, you're essentially almost halfway there with what's leased. Are you looking to add more to that? Are you rethinking just how big the platform can be and the investments you want to make in it? Charles Meyers : The short answer is absolutely. We're going to continue to grow the overall platform on the xScale side and retail side, but I think clearly there is a ton of demand out there, and we think we have a very, very credible story. And I think, as you said, the leasing momentum that we have generated over the last several quarters is quite indicative of that. And so, yeah, what we have left, we feel confident we're going to be able to lease effectively and as I said in the script, we're also excited to give you updates on what we have talked about pretty openly, and we've announced the SV12x asset, the first xScale in the Americas, but we also are deeply engaged in a set of conversations around how we're going to expand our xScale platform in the U.S. and the Americas more broadly. And so, we don't have anything specific to share with you, but we will in the not-too-distant future, and we look forward to that conversation. In terms of -- now we're not yet prepared to sort of size that precisely, but I will say that when you look back at what we said when we first talked about xScale at the Analyst Day, I don't know when that was, '18 or something, and what we said was what we thought it was going to be. It's certainly proven to be a lot more than that. And I think it continues to be a super exciting opportunity. Very proud of the team that continues to run that business for us, and they're doing great things and we're excited about the value that deliver for our customers. Aryeh Klein : OK, thanks. And then just separately, you noted some of the reasons that cabinet adds were soft in the quarter, and you talked about seeing better growth in the second half of the year. Can you just talk about what underpins that? And is that coming from backlog? Or is there an assumption in there around some of the longer sales cycle times moderating? Charles Meyers : Yeah. I mean, the billable cabs, it comes from a few different things. You're right. We've always talked about the volatility in billable cabs based partially on timing of installs. It's not so much a longer sales cycle. Sometimes, it is a bit of a longer install cycle, and so, depending on the timing of installs and in fact the timing of churn, you can see volatility in any quarter. That's why we've always sort of told people over the years to look at a rolling four-quarter metric, but even that has really been under pressure, and has been under pressure primarily because of power density, and I think that kind of makes sense to people, but we're realizing, I think, that we really need to give people a bit more to hang their hat on relative to that particular metric. So, let me give you some of the math, I think, that will help people understand the billable cabs metric and how it plays here and what's causing the bit of pressure on that. We guide the 2% to 2.5% churn rate on our recurring revenue each quarter. So, we're running today at an MRR run rate of about $667 million. So, if you take 2% of that figure, at the low end of the range, so you're at $13 million to $14 million in MRR churn in any given quarter. As we said, our MRR per cab is averaging right now at 2,258. So, if you take that and divide those two together, you'd be churning roundabout 6,000 cabs in any given quarter. And more than that, if we're churning cabs that are at a lower-than-average MRR per cab, which candidly we would hope to be doing, if you're going to churn some cabs, it should be ones that are below the average, right? And so, in Q1, we were churning cabs that were at an average of 4.4 kilowatts. We were adding back cabs at an average of 5.8 kilowatts. And so, when you do that math, all in, in terms of that relatively large gap in density, you're looking at about a 1,500-cab hole that you've got to fill. So actually, staying flat on cabs is really a pretty significant win. The density increase that's causing that sort of hole in the bucket on cab count though is a really important factor in driving the MRR per cab. So, if you go and if you look at our year-over-year growth on billable cabs, Q1 to Q1, last year to this year, it's softer for sure. It's only up about 1%. But over that same time frame, our MRR per cab is up 6% across the estate, and so, you add those two together and the composite gives you that 7% growth. So, long way of saying that, in other words that stable to slightly growing cab count is certainly a different dynamic than what we have seen. But the growth is coming. It's just coming in a slightly different shape. And so, we're still driving the growth in the business and getting the economic returns that we were anticipating. So, I think that, for us, rather than looking for a new indicator, I think, what we're going to look to do is moderate expectations on the cab growth and say, look, we're having to cover that whole quarter-over-quarter from a density standpoint, but it's really driving the MRR per cab, and it's the composite of those two things that really give you the solid growth model going forward. Operator : The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. David Barden : So, Keith, just the first question would be, based on what Charles was just saying and the explanations that he's been having to make about this interpretation of MRR per cabinet and power density and cabinet numbers, where are we on the creation of these new metrics that I think we've been talking about for six months?   And the second question, if I could, would be, it's great that the audit committee hired these independent advisors and it exonerated itself and the company and all the words that were used. But how much daylight is there between what you looked at and what the SEC and the DOJ are looking at and your comfort factor that we've buttoned this thing up, and in what time frame can we expect a resolution to that? Charles Meyers : Yeah, I'm trying to decide which order to take them in. We feel like we've got the metrics that we need and I think there's a lot of complexity to introducing new metrics to the -- and so I think that the MRR per cab, even though it's probably going to have a slightly different growth profile than it has, combined with the MRR per cab are really the billable cab count and the MRR per cab. And the product of those two is really the metric that we continue to come back to. And so, I think that rather than introduce a new metric, we're going to really stick to those two and try to give you better visibility to what you should expect along the product of those two, which it really drives the growth. As it relates to the investigation, I would say that I think we can't comment in detail on the specifics of the DOJ and the SEC subpoenas, but I would say that the investigation work conducted by the audit committee and by the independent advisors who I just talked about over the several weeks seems like an eternity, but it's been the last several weeks and a lot of amazing work done really represents, I think, the foundation of what we believe is needed to address the matters in the DOJ and SEC subpoenas. And it's not unusual for I think, the sort of discussions with those parties, DOJ and SEC to lag and take a bit longer. But I feel like we've got our arms around that solidly, and we'll provide an update on that in whatever time frame that requires. Unfortunately, I think that's very hard for us to provide any specificity around.  Keith, do you want to add that? Keith Taylor : Just add one, as Charles said, and I think it's important to understand that the level of work that was done since March 20th, so five, six weeks of work, was also included what was anticipated to be needed by the DOJ and the SEC. So, a tremendous amount of work has been done, and it's surrounded by what I would call the matters that relate to accounting irregularities. And I would expect, and I know this to be true, that they're already in dialogue with the parties. They're appropriately within dialogue with the parties. And again, this is going to be done independently as you would expect. Of course, they're going to draw on the resources of the company where needed to answer to questions and queries. So, I just think it takes a little bit of time, but getting to where we are that we filed the 10-Q yesterday should give you tremendous comfort on where we concluded. And, again, there is no adjustments, no findings. And so, as a result, I feel really good about where we are. And as Charles has said in his remarks, that related to both GAAP and non-GAAP, and I think that was really important. So, again, it will take probably a little bit of time, but overall, again, I feel very comfortable that by the filing of our 10-Q, it's a pretty good strong indication of where we are in the journey. Charles Meyers : Yeah, I think the shorter answer to your question probably would have been not a lot of light between those I think, and I think we feel confident that we're going to be able to navigate those. Again, how timely I'm not sure, because I think those are probably not things that are frequently rapid, just due to the parties you're dealing with. We'll navigate them on as rapid a time frame as we can, or the audit committee and the independent investigators will, and then we'll report that back to you as we know more. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Michael Rollins : Charles, I want to wish you the best on the transition as well. Wanted to ask a question about some of the comments from earlier. You commented that 1Q was better, I think, on the net bookings, your budget and you had lower churn, and you maintained the outlook for constant-currency revenue growth ex PPI of 7% to 8%. And so, I'm curious, has your view evolved on how you expect the second half in terms of organic year-over-year growth to ramp relative to the first half of the year? And are there other considerations that kept the organic constant-currency revenue guidance unchanged? And then I'll have a second one if I could as well. Charles Meyers : Sure. Yeah. Thanks for the well wishes, Mike, and thanks for the questions.   I would say that the second half guide or the second half, I think, outlook for us doesn't look dramatically different. I think we had said that we're clearly looking at some acceleration in the back half of the year from a bookings perspective. And again, we feel good about the pipeline. We had a strong Q1, and so we probably had a slightly better Q1, and that gives us a little running start at that back half of the year. But I also think we are seeing -- although we saw lower churn than we had forecasted or expected in the prior guide, I do think we are continuing to see some level of churn in the system that I think we have to continue to navigate. And so, I think there -- not any big changes in the outlook and that's why again, you saw us maintain that outlook overall. Keith Taylor : And Mike, maybe just adding on to that, when you get to the second half of the year, you recognize that that, certainly it matters to the year, but it's not as important because it really matters to the year following. So, that's one of the things that you have to look at. We had a pretty good idea of what we think we could do for the first half of the year, and as Charles just mentioned, we're ahead of where we were. But offsetting some of that, of course, is some other things that have gone on inside the business, an example of metered power. And so, you're absorbing the fact that power costs have been down relative to where we were. We actually had a power price decrease, as you're aware, from the fourth quarter earnings call. And because of that, you're diluting a little bit of the growth. So, it's a combination of power being a little bit lower and sort of diluting it. In the second half of the year, we still anticipate to deliver against the expectations. But I would maybe characterize this as maybe a parting remark that when we look at risks and opportunities, the opportunities both in the revenue line and the cost line are much greater than those in the risk line. And so, where we are today, I just think that we're taking a posture that is appropriate given where we are at this time of year and just all the noise that's in the system. Charles Meyers : Yeah. And I mean, Mike, we've used this term on the last few calls as sort of crosscurrents, right, which is a sort of strange combination of a lot of interest in demand around digital transformation broadly speaking, around AI, in particular. I think we're still seeing that. I think we're seeing great interest in AI and in hybrid AI, private AI, sort of mixed with public cloud as a sort of preferred architecture for a lot of the AI workloads that we're looking at. I think we're seeing a lot of customers looking at where they want to place their data. And I think they are increasingly reaching the conclusion that sort of proximate to the cloud is the right answer, and I think we're really well-positioned to benefit from that, and we're seeing some demand there. We're seeing a nice pipeline on the managed DGX opportunity that we have out in the market with NVIDIA. And yet at the same time, we are also seeing, as I characterized in the script, some level of customer caution, some level of tightening and desire for optimization in a still somewhat uncertain macro environment. And so, I think it's all those things together that led us to say, hey, this guide is a good one. We feel like we've got opportunity to outperform against it, particularly, on the FFO line, but that's kind of where we landed and sort of overall balance for the guide. Michael Rollins : And just the second thing I want to hit was what you were just touching on, some of the use case examples for AI. So, you gave some examples of how customers can use the Equinix platform. Can you just share in terms of -- whether it was relative to the number of deals that you did in the quarter or relative to the pipeline, what you're kind of seeing in terms of that interest or the realization of that interest so far? And are there any other additional learnings on the AI front that the market should be mindful of for Equinix? Charles Meyers : Yeah. I would still characterize it as quite early days because I do think there is a ton of interest in AI, but I think that the actual execution of implementing infrastructure, driving workloads, etc. is I think still relatively early in the cycle. Now, I do think there is a lot of attention on really large-scale training workloads, and I do think we're seeing some of the demand in our xScale business being driven by demand from hyperscalers, which again are the largest customers of our xScale offering. And so, I think that is probably ahead of the game, but I think what we're now seeing is a really rich pipeline of enterprise training opportunities, as well as inference opportunities where inference is more distributed. And we've been saying this all along, I think that's where the unique different creation of Equinix is likely to be because of our highly distributed footprint, and because I think we bring that blend of capabilities to the table not only xScale. And we did see an uptick, I will say this quarter, in larger footprint opportunities, and I think some of that is really associated with AI-related workloads, both service provider and enterprise. And so, we're seeing a little bit of a different mix. I think still relatively early, but I think a lot of room for optimism in the AI opportunity overall for us. Operator : The last question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Charles, best of luck with everything. I wanted to come back to the cabinets if I could. I think you mentioned, Charles, at one point that you are limited for capacity constraints in certain key markets. If we look at the overall utilization, we're seeing 78%, 79%, and that's down year-over-year. You've added a lot of capacity over the last few quarters here. So, just help us unpack that a little bit because it looks like, at least, on an aggregate level, where are the pressure points here and what's the opportunity to relieve those. Charles Meyers : Yeah, great question. I mean, I think there's a few markets around the world that we have recently added capacity or it is around the corner. A great example would be the New York Metro where we are already pre-selling capacity in that, but don't yet have as much available to actually bill into as we would like. And so, I think that's a classic area of constraint. We've also seen, of course, Singapore is a more, I think, more protracted area of constraint in the business. And it's one of the reasons why we talked about our sustainability efforts there, which were quite central in our ability to gain incremental capacity to sort of awards, if you will, from the Singaporean government. And so, I think that one's going to be a little bit of a longer slog for us. And I think, unfortunately, it means that we're going to have to continue to be opportunistic about churn and trying to rerate that and use that to continue to serve the capacity that is most critical there. But those are a couple of key examples. What might be some of the other ones, Keith, you already had some constraints there? Keith Taylor : Yeah. Overall, I mean, if you look at some of the Canadian markets, it's not so much a constraint of generation, it's a constraint of distribution, and so Northern Virginia is an example of that, some of the Canadian markets, the Irish market, the Dublin market is another place. And so overall, it's sort of trying to optimize the environment as Charles alluded to, Singapore being that perfect example of deciding how you want to rerate the space and being very disciplined about what we sell, notwithstanding just a general thought about introducing a lot of new capacity into new markets, second tier, third tier markets for us. And they take longer to ramp, while at the same time, you have these major metros around the world where we're in dire need of incremental capacity. And so, that's what we're investing in. And so, it's really trying to optimize as best as we can across the portfolio, recognizing each market has a little bit of uniqueness to it. And so, working alongside what are we churning, where are we churning, and what does the inventory hold or engineering hold on some of the capacity as we augment with efficiency initiatives and the like, it's a combination of all these things that are factoring into our decision. And it goes back to the sort of the net cabinet billing discussion. When you look at the -- when you step back and say, well, that's part of what's causing that utilization level to be where it is, but you really have to step back and understand what is the revenue drivers of the business. You saw in our second quarter guide, we have a meaningful step up in revenues. A good roughly 65% to 70% of that is coming from MRR. And so, you know that we've got more revenue coming into the next quarter. We've got some MRR activity through xScale, but there's momentum in the business, and it doesn't necessarily appear the way that some of us would expect historically because it's not necessarily going to a lot of new incremental cabinets. There's more volume attached to the cabinets that we have. And so, it's a combination of those two things that I think are causing us to, I guess, be a little bit more cautious in what we talked about on a net billing cabinet basis, but we know that the revenue is there to support our growth. Simon Flannery : So, we shouldn't be thinking of utilization getting back to the low to mid-80s, be more in this sort of 79, 80 level? Keith Taylor : Charles alluded in his prepared remarks, we see the cabinet building number is going to increase and as a result, utilization will certainly continue to increase. I just don't know if it will happen at the rate that we would expect given all the other things that are going on in the business. And the caution that Charles alluded to, we are being cautious in our guide. We left the revenue guide constant, absent currency. We have momentum. We did better than we anticipated in the first quarter. Obviously, we made a reference to the fact the pipeline is exceedingly deep. That's a positive. But we're just not at a point to say, well, what does that mean from a billing cabinet basis? Are we going to alter basically the trajectory of our revenues based on what we've already guided? And there's just a number of factors that we're considering.   But overall, I'd just say there's strong momentum in the business. I think utilization will go up. I think net cabinet spilling will go up. I think based on the power utilization that we're selling, it will cause the density of cabinets to -- or a power sold per cabinet to continue to be elevated. And for all those reasons, that's why we have, I would think, momentum on the revenue line. But we're not yet prepared to change the trajectory of the revenue guide at this point. Charles Meyers : But I do think that -- I mean, look, the stabilized assets are 84% utilized overall. I think we've got room in the class that just went in for additional utilization. And so, I think that we absolutely are going to continue to see improving utilization, but we are continuing to add capacity for sure just given the level of demand that's out there. So, I think it'll just depend on how that ebbs and flows into the utilization number. Chip Newcom : This concludes our Q1 earnings call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Goodbye. Again, that does conclude today's conference, you may disconnect at this time. Thank you and have a good day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Equinix Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Chip Newcom, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Chip Newcom : Good afternoon, and welcome to today's conference call. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone that some of the statements that we will be making today are forward-looking in nature and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those statements and may be affected by the risks we've identified in today's press release and those identified in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K filed February 16, 2024, and recently filed Form 10-Q. Equinix assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or comment on forward-looking statements made on this call. In addition, in light of Regulation Fair Disclosure, it is Equinix' policy not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done through an explicit public disclosure. In addition, we'll provide non-GAAP measures on today's conference call. We provide a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a list of the reasons why the company uses these measures in today's press release on the Equinix Investor Relations page at www.equinix.com. We've made available on the IR page of our Website a presentation designed to accompany this discussion, along with certain supplemental financial information and other data. We would also like to remind you that we post important information about Equinix on the IR page of our Web site from time to time and encourage you to check our Web site regularly for the most current available information. With us today are Adaire Fox-Martin, Equinix' CEO and President; and Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up in one hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Adaire. Adaire Fox-Martin: Thank you, Chip. Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. I'm honored to be hosting my first earnings call today as CEO and President of Equinix, I'm immensely proud to lead our dedicated team of more than 13,000 employees around the world. I would like to express my gratitude to Charles and the entire Equinix team for the warm welcome and the facilitation of a smooth transition over the past two months. I look forward to the continued partnership with Charles in his role as Executive Chairman, and I'm excited and optimistic about the road ahead. As a board member for the past four years, I've witnessed many of the unique qualities that have driven Equinix's durable success. Our 25 years of investment has built a business now spanning 264 data centers in 72 metros across six continents. Our focus on customer value and outcomes has created interconnected digital ecosystems unrivaled in our industry. It is a phenomenal foundation to build upon as CEO. As the stewards of some of the most important digital infrastructure in the world, we are exceptionally and uniquely positioned to capitalize on the immense opportunities that lie ahead. Business transformation remains a critical priority for our customers, and the emergence of AI marks a pivotal point for our industry. AI, similar to the growth of cloud technologies a decade ago, will take time to fully develop. In the near term AI training workloads are driving significant demand, particularly from service providers. Our xScale program continues to be a direct beneficiary of this demand. We intend to build on this momentum meaningfully augmenting and extending our xScale portfolio, particularly in North America. This will complement our robust portfolio across Europe and Asia Pacific. We are excited to share that we recently closed on land and power for our first multi hundred megawatt xScale campus in Atlanta. We look forward to announcing details of this project and our next xScale joint venture in the coming months. At the operational end of the AI spectrum, our network nodes and inference workloads as with cloud, Equinix continues to be the preferred location for network nodes as customers seek the right connectivity solutions for data ingestion and distribution. We also see inference demand beginning to take shape. We believe the implementation and deployment of these workloads will accelerate over the coming years. The neutrality, global reach and scale of platform Equinix can deliver the performance, network density and cloud adjacency which inference workloads will require. We are already seeing significant enterprise and service provider interest in our deployment capabilities. In Q2, we partnered with WWT to serve Almavic [ph] Technologies, an AI powered marketing analytics platform for enterprise. Almavic [ph] Technologies deployed their AI infrastructure at Equinix to run proprietary inference algorithms on massive datasets for predictable cost, privacy, speed and secure access to data sources in the cloud. InstaDeep, a leading provider of AI decision making solutions, deployed an Nvidia AI cluster at our Paris 10 asset to access key ecosystems, optimize their network, and support their growth objectives. Our approach to the market opportunity created by AI is multifaceted and we believe it will deliver value in the short term and sustainable growth over the medium to long term. Our xScale offering provides the infrastructure and expertise required for massive scalable data center operations for our cloud and large scale technology customers. For our enterprise and mid-market customers, we offer AI ready data centers and turnkey solutions, enabling them to scale efficiently and effectively as they introduce AI technologies into their business operations. For those who require high performance inferencing, our Edge solutions handle the data at the edge where it is generated, ensuring optimal performance for the next generation of business applications. Over the past two months I have embarked on a listening tour across a number of our locations, meeting with our customers, partners and employees and whilst it is still early in my tenure and there is still work that I need to complete, I have noted some areas of opportunity that will underpin our strategy for the company going forward. The opportunity to simplify across numerous aspects of our business. This will allow us to accelerate our pace of execution. The opportunity to drive more focus whilst we may do less. The programs of work that we focus on will represent excellence in execution and deliver the highest quality outcomes. The opportunity to amplify our go-to-market efforts to delight our customers and energize our partners. Equinix has consistently demonstrated discipline and execution. This mantra of discipline allows us to deliver market leading returns on capital and serves as the underlying fuel for long-term growth in AFFO per share, our core financial metric. Building on this foundation and executing on the opportunities I noted should create a simpler, more focused and ultimately higher valued company. With all of this in mind, I'll turn to our Q2 performance. Equinix had a great second quarter. We delivered record growth bookings. Our pricing remains strong. We continue to invest broadly across our offerings to further enhance the scale and reach of our industry leading platform. Our delivery of Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share continues to run ahead of expectations. As you can see on Slide three Q2 revenues were $2.2 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year. This represents our 86th consecutive quarter of top line growth. Adjusted EBITDA was up 17% year-over-year with strong AFFO per share flow-through. Interconnection revenue stepped up to 9% year-over-year. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. In May, we announced the opening of our first data center in Johor with strong interest from customers across our new Malaysian footprint. In July, we announced our expansion into the Philippines through the planned acquisition of three data centers in Manila from Total Information Management. This transaction, valued at approximately $180 million, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, adding more than 1,000 cabinets of capacity, in addition to land for future development. The combination of our strong leadership position in our Singapore hub and our entries into Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines strategically position Equinix to help our customers capitalize on the expanding digital opportunity in the fast-growing Southeast Asia region. Customers taking advantage of our expanding global footprint include FirstDigital, an Internet and telecommunications provider. FirstDigital is significantly lowering total cost of ownership by building a multi-cloud network with Equinix Fabric Cloud Router to connect to Cisco WebEx and AWS across all three regions. Our global interconnection franchise continues to perform with over 472,000 total interconnections now deployed. Gross interconnection additions were at the highest level in 2 years and pricing continues to trend favorably. However, net interconnection adds were 3,900 due to grooming activity, primarily in our content and networking verticals. We do expect this grooming to lessen over time. Equinix Fabric growth was underpinned by 100 gigabit port additions and strong pull-through from other digital services products. Network Edge experienced continued rapid growth with an expansion activity from existing customers. The recent interconnection and ecosystem wins, include Nuam Exchange. This is a new company formed after the integration of the Santiago Lima and Colombia Stock Exchanges. Capital market participants can now benefit from Nuam's extended reach, low latency and secure connectivity supported by Equinix in key markets like New York and Sao Paulo. Our channel program delivered another solid quarter, accounting for over 30% of new bookings and 55% of company new logos. We continue to see growth from partners like AT&T, Avant, Dell, HPE and Orange business, with wins across a wide range of industry segments and use cases. Notable wins included an AI as a service solution via our distribution partner, Tech Data and MSP partner AsiaPac. Leveraging a combination of co-location and Equinix Fabric, our partners are delivering an LLM for a high-level learning institution based in Malaysia. Now before I turn the call over to Keith, I wanted to recognize that we believe we are in a position of strength financially from both a balance sheet and from an access to capital perspective. Our investment strategy delivers a strong return on invested capital, all of which gives us the flexibility to execute our go-forward strategy. With that, I'll turn it over to Keith to cover the results from the quarter. Keith Taylor : Great. Thanks, Adaire. Now let me first say, I look forward to the next phase of the Equinix journey alongside you and I know it's going to be a very exciting time for all of us at Equinix. And also good afternoon to all of those that are on the call today or who might be listening later. So to start, we had a great second quarter as the team continued to execute against our plans. We had record gross bookings, closing more than 4,000 deals with more than 3,000 customers. We continued our trend of net positive pricing actions, and we ended the quarter with solid net bookings. Our forward-looking pipeline remains deep, which we expect will drive momentum in the second half of the year, and we're delivering profitability ahead of our expectations. As a result, we're again raising our full year adjusted EBITDA and AFFO guidance, and therefore, AFFO per share too, our lighthouse metric. Also, as Adaire highlighted, I'm excited about the next phase of our xScale initiatives. We plan to lean into this program as we've seen strong demand from this offering -- for this offering, as evidenced by both our cloud and AI bookings momentum. We continue to believe this off-balance sheet JV structure with our equity partners is the right model to pursue this significant opportunity, which also drives durable value on a per share basis. To date, through the xScale JVs, we've invested about $4.7 billion in the program. Since our last earnings call, we leased an incremental 17 megawatts of capacity in our Silicon Valley 12 and Paris 13 assets. This brings our total global xScale leasing to 365 megawatts, representing nearly $6 billion of total contract value and more than $700 million of annualized revenue once these assets are fully ramped. Looking forward, we have a strong funnel of additional xScale opportunities and we look forward to updating you on our future JV partnerships in the near term. For non-financial metrics, MR per cabinet is rising, increasing 7% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis to $2,287 per cabinet, driven by favorable pricing environment, solid interconnection attach rates and increasing prior densities. As discussed on our last earnings call, as expected, we saw continued pressure on our unadjusted net cabinets billing metric due to capacity constraints in certain key markets, increasing power density and timing of churn. StackPath unexpectedly announced their immediate liquidation in June, resulting in 300 cabinets churning at quarter end as an example. Related to cabinet density, the Q2 cabinet churn were on an average density of 4 kilowatts per cabinet while the new cabinets booked were at an average density of 5.9 kilowatts per cabinet. In Q2, non-xScale net megawatts sold increased meaningfully compared to the prior six quarters. As we look forward, given our strong gross bookings and as a result, the rising backlog of cabinets sold but not yet installed, we expect billable cabinets to improve in the second half of the year. On the sustainability front, we're continuing to advance our bold Future First agenda, implementing innovative ways to integrate into the communities in which we operate. This includes new heat export programs across Europe and the Americas, including our new Paris 10 IBX, which helps heat a portion of the aquatic center at the Paris Olympics. This is one example of a sustainability initiative that we believe will become commonplace in the markets we serve in the future. Now let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, Global Q2 revenues were $2.59 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year and in the upper half of our guidance range on a constant currency basis, including the impact of a one-off charge against recurring revenues. As expected, non-recurring revenue stepped up sequentially due to strong xScale leasing activity in the quarter. Q2 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $6 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates due to the weaker Brazilian real and the Japanese yen in the quarter. Global Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $1.036 billion or 48% of revenues, up 17% over the same quarter last year and above the $1 billion quarterly threshold for the very first time. Relative to our expectations, adjusted EBITDA was at the top end of our guidance range due to strong operating profits and timing of spend. Q2-adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, included a $3 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and $4 million of integration costs. Global Q2 AFFO was $877 million, up 17% over the same quarter last year, better than our expectations due to strong operating performance and the timing of the land lease payment related to our upcoming Singapore 6 build. Q2 AFFO included a $3 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q2 MRR churn was 2.3%. For the balance of the year, we expect MRR churn to remain in the 2% to 2.5% quarterly guidance range. Turning to our regional highlights, the results, which are covered on Slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized basis, APAC was our fastest-growing region at 11%, followed by the Americas and EMEA regions growing at 9% and 5%, respectively. The Americas region had a great quarter with record gross bookings led by strong financial services activity, firm pricing and a higher mix of medium and large footprint deals. We saw particular strength in our Tier 1 markets, including Dallas, New York, Washington, D.C. Our EMEA business delivered a solid quarter with healthy bookings activity and strong pricing. The team did an excellent job selling our global platform with record exports and strong intra-region activity, including into growth in emerging markets such as Abu Dhabi, Istanbul and Warsaw. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a strong quarter with momentum in our largest markets in the region, including Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo as well as strong customer interest in our new Asian metros. Encouragingly, we saw strong intra-region activity driven by customers deploying AI workloads in both Japan and Malaysia. And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our balance sheet increased to approximately $33 billion, including an unrestricted cash balance of $2 billion. Our cash balance increased quarter-over-quarter due to strong operating cash flow and the debt raised in the quarter, offset by our growth investments and the cash dividend. In May, we raised $750 million of senior U.S. dollar notes due in 2034, and we immediately swapped these notes into euros at an effective interest rate of 3.9%. Our net leverage remains low relative to our peers of 3.5x our annualized adjusted EBITDA. Our blended debt borrowing rate is now 2.4%, the lowest in our industry. As noted previously, given the global nature of our business, we plan to opportunistically raise additional debt capital in low rate markets where we intend to expand, creating both incremental debt capital to fund our growth but also placing a natural hedge into these markets. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were $648 million, including recurring CapEx of $45 million. We continue to invest across our platform with 54 major projects currently underway in 36 markets in 24 countries, including 15 xScale scale projects. Since our last earnings call, we opened 10 projects across 8 metros, including new data centers in Johor, Osaka, Silicon Valley and Warsaw. We also purchased our Helsinki 5 and Madrid 2 assets and land for development in Atlanta, Dallas and Milan. Revenues from owned assets increased to 69% of our recurring revenues and more than 80% of our current retail expansion will be on our own land or own buildings with long-term ground leases. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. 180 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Stabilized assets were collectively 83% utilized and generated a 26% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP invested. And finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for an updated summary of 2024 guidance and bridges. Do note all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. For the full year 2024, we're maintaining our underlying revenue outlook with expected top line growth of 7% to 8%. This reflects our solid execution in the first half of the year and a strong pipeline to drive momentum in the second half of the year. We're raising our underlying 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance by another $15 million due to strong operating performance and lower integration costs. We're raising our underlying 2024 AFFO guidance by $15 million, an 11% to 13% increase over the previous year. AFFO per share is expected to grow between 9% and 11% at or above the top end of our long-term plan as we continue to compound value for our shareholders. And finally, 2024 CapEx is expected to range between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion, including about $240 million of recurring CapEx. So let me stop here. I will turn the call back to Adaire. Adaire Fox-Martin: Thank you, Keith. In closing, we had a strong first half of 2024. We stand apart from our competitors by seamlessly integrating a global footprint with cutting-edge infrastructure. This allows us to effectively address the wide range of opportunities in the era of AI from the training needs of the service providers to the business needs of our enterprise customers. It also positions us to continue to effectively address the broader set of demands of our customer base. We believe our unwavering commitment to discipline, simplicity and focus. Combined with our amplified go-to-market efforts, we'll continue to drive growth and deliver higher value for our employees, customers, partners and shareholders. With that, I'll stop here and open it up to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Hi, thank you, good evening. Adaire, congratulations on the new position. And thank you for the comments on your Listening Tour. And where you see the opportunities. I'd love to get your high-level perspective on what led you to take the role at Equinix. Obviously, you've known them from the Board, but you came from Google, you worked at SAP before that. So you've got a great perspective on the cloud needs of the hyperscalers, the AI opportunity. So it'd be great if you could just put all of that into context on where you see Equinix being positioned for the training, but particularly for the inference wave of AI? Thank you. Adaire Fox-Martin: Thanks very much for the question, Simon, and thank you for the kind words. It's certainly being a whirlwind of 10 weeks since I formally took the position and a lot that I've heard and understood during the listening and learning sessions. I have to say I remain exceptionally positive about the opportunity ahead. One of the reasons or one of the main reasons or one of the many reasons actually why I took the role with Equinix is obviously understanding the strategy of the company and its unique position in the ecosystem. I believe that Equinix is uniquely positioned to offer a range of enabling services for our customers so that they can actually capitalize on the opportunities presented by various different technology platforms. When I think about our demand and the customer needs, it is actually much broader than the AI portfolio. Many of our customers have made a very significant commitment to hybrid and to multi-cloud. And as customers become more at ease with cloud as a technology paradigm, we can see many more workload-based decisions beginning to occur. So decisions about where particular workloads are best suited. As I look at this in the context of AI and the AI demand, that initial short-term demand is coming indeed from the service providers. And this is reflected in our xScale business and in the bookings performance that we've seen in the xScale business. And as you heard in our remarks, this is something that we're looking to expand globally. But many CIOs like during the early days of cloud are looking to ensure that they have an AI strategy. And we are beginning to see the beginnings of enterprise training and enterprise funnel as we look at customers, looking to evolve their strategy into proof-of-concept and beyond that into working production systems. As I said, I think retail will have a much broader demand and a more meaningful long-term upside from AI as these use cases move from proof-of-concepts into production. There is, of course, a lot that Equinix is offering to our customers here, both in our retail business and of course, on the xScale side of the house. And I think this unique balanced approach to the opportunity represented in the broader demand context but also in the era of cloud is something that's extremely exciting. I'm looking forward to leading the company through this journey. Simon Flannery : Great. Thanks for your thoughts. Adaire Fox-Martin: Thank you Simon. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Nick Del Deo from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Nicholas Del Deo : Hey Afternoon. Again congratulations, Adaire on taking the helm. Adaire you had mentioned simplification focus and amplifying go-to-market as some of the areas that seemed interesting to you initially. I guess, can you expand a little bit on what you saw and things you might see on that front in the coming years? Adaire Fox-Martin: For sure. Thank you very much again for the congrats Nick. I appreciate that. First of all, when I look at the overall approach that I will take, it is about creating value, and it will always have a customer lens an outside-in perspective ensuring that customer success translates and is equal to Equinix success in many regards. When I look at this, this means looking at how we continue to evolve the product portfolio, how we continue to drive critical partnerships so that we're at the center of the digital ecosystem and how we continue to enhance and evolve our go-to-market engine. Let me specifically pick up on the notion of simplification. When one simplifies, you bring core processes back to their very core. This enables you to be agile in your response and helps you to accelerate the underpinning pace of the business. And whilst this list is not exhaustive, there are definitely a few areas that I see we have some opportunity to continue to evolve and simplify things like our quote-to-cash process, elements like our customer life cycle and ways that we can systematize and process the customer's journey with us throughout their life cycle. These type of enterprise-grade processes will help us remove friction within the system and help deliver that pace, agility and simplicity. When I look at it from a focus point of view, it is about understanding not just the footprint that's in our core, but how we continue to grow and evolve our core business, to meet the needs of our customers. And this is both in our xScale business but also on retail, where we look at how our global footprint enables customers to operate and transact in environments where they may not need to invest in the physical infrastructure themselves to do that. I also think that focus is an important point when we consider our digital services portfolio and look at this through the lens of where we have adjacency, and augmenting some of that core functionality that we have that exists in the core footprint of the Equinix data center world. This is a point where we have the right to win where customers would expect us to lead. And so for instance, I look at the underpinning growth in our fabric business, how important that can be as we look to continue to evolve our virtual interconnections portfolio. And this enables us to focus in perhaps on certain aspects of our product portfolio in order to ensure that we're investing where we can have the highest level of returns. And on our go-to-market side, we have new leadership in our go-to-market team. I think it's a very important aspect of our business to underpin our go-to-market processes with a very clear segmentation strategy that allows us to identify those customers that have the highest revenue perspective for us and to manage those customers in a high-touch environment but likewise, to enable us to extend our reach through channels and distribution effectively to customers who are in SME more general business type space. So I hope that's given you a little bit of amplification on simplicity, focus and the actual augmentation of our go-to-market. Thank you for the question, Nick Nicholas Del Deo : Yes. That was terrific detail. Can I follow up with 1 on interconnection adds. Obviously, they dropped quite a bit sequentially. I think you called out optimization, grooming and content and networking as drivers of that, but also noted strong adds. Maybe can you just expand a little bit on those puts and takes and how we should think about the path to getting interconnection adds back to a healthier and more sustainable level? Adaire Fox-Martin: I'm happy to comment on that, and I can ask any of my colleagues here to us if there's anything that they would need to add to my commentary. So first of all, as we noted, we had 3,900 net adds. We had, as Keith mentioned in his comments, the StackPath liquidation, which impacted us negatively 400. And so without that, we would have had 4,300 adds. Now let me just unpack some of the trends for you, Nick, to build on your question. First, on the positive side. When I look at the gross adds, it's the highest level in 2 years. And year-to-date, this interconnection demand is actually back to peak pandemic levels. In absolute numbers, our A-to-Z connections continue to increase, and we've seen this quarter-over-quarter. And this is obviously the way that we define unique relationships between companies in a metro. And I think this really truly speaks to the value of Equinix. So those things coupled together, the gross adds, the absolute number of A to Z continuing to increase. The fact that we're at a peak pandemic levels, I think they are very good indicators of future momentum. Pricing is also trending very favorably. We have 11% spread between churn and new additions. And you see revenue up to 9% year-on-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. So a number of positives as we look at the interconnection lens. On the churn side, we saw the churn elevated in 2023 and continued to worsen in early 2024. And this was up especially in the EMEA Theater of operation. I think networks have had the most toughest operating environment, and we're continuing to see pressure in that segment of our industry customers. I would also say that M&A affects this where we have paid cross connects, but unpaid intercompany cross connects and often replacing those in an M&A trajectory, and this takes some time for us to work through. But specifically, as it relates to EMEA, we can see that the data indicating some decelerating churn rate from the top 10 who have been churning in the past. So that again gives me the confidence to say that I can believe we'll move forward on a positive trajectory here, and this is an area of focus for me as we move forward over the course of this quarter. Nicholas Del Deo : That\u2019s great. Thank you so much. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey guys, thank you so much for taking questions and Adair, welcome. I guess I have to be the one to ask. So obviously, the DOJ, SEC subpoenas [ph] continue to kind of be subject of conversation around the company. So I guess if you could kind of give us an update on where we are and what we'll take to put that to bed to be great. Also, a follow-up on that is in the aftermath of the conclusion of the independent review conducted by the Board. Were there any changes that you guys have made in this past quarter with respect to any kind of internal or external reporting? And then the last one, if I could, Keith, you referenced the unadjusted cabinets. I think this is the third or fourth quarter in a row. We had to talk about why cabinets are in volume terms living up to expectations. And it's because of the densities and the better revenue per cabinet where we are kind of coming up with some language that represents the adjustment that you think investors need to see when they read the release or the first time around? Thanks. Adaire Fox-Martin: Okay. David, thank you very much for the words of welcome. Maybe we'll start with the muted -- the cabinet growth scenario. I'll throw that to Keith and then he can perhaps comment on the kind of investigation status. Keith Taylor : David. So first and foremost, look, we continue to see the net cabinet billings as an area of high focus. As I said sort of in the prepared remarks, roughly 300 of those cabinets related to StackPath announced their liquidation at the end of the quarter. Put that aside, there's a number of things that are impacting. And one of them I'll refer to and why we say unadjusted. But capacity constraints, of course, has continued to have an impact on base of the net cabinets billing and then the timing of churn, which is an obvious statement. The increasing density continues to be a factor. And as we said, there's two things I wanted to pull out for you. As I said in the prepared remarks, but I want to make sure that it's understood in its fullest context. First and foremost, we had record gross bookings. So it gives you a sense that the volume in the businesses is there. So that gives me great confidence, and we had record gross bookings in the Americas theater more specifically. You add to that that we had the best net megawatts billing in the retail space. I'm not talking about xScale in retail, and that tells in the last seven quarters. So this is six quarters prior, we've done meaningfully better than we had done before. So it tells you about the health of the underlying business and it really ties into what Adaire was talking about on the sort of gross interconnects. So there's the volume there. But there's this element of the business both on how things are timing out. We knew -- as you know, we're sort of forecasting Q2 would be probably a negative quarter again. There's the timing of the churn. But when I talk about the unadjusted is we do that -- we can do that math for you, which basically says, well, when you turn out a certain number of cabinets at that level of density and you apply different factors to it with a higher level of density, you're basically dealing with a whole of roughly 2,000 just because of density. And so that's why we say the unadjusted. I think the most important thing is that, look, we've given you a good sense of there's great momentum in the business. We're seeing great gross values. Yes, there's an element of churn that's coming through the business. We've been talking about that for many quarters now, the economic climate in which we operate. But overall, with the depth of the pipeline and the momentum we see in our business, that's what gives us confidence that you're going to see that abate. And then the last part I would just say is the backlog has been as high as we've seen in a very long period of time and it's substantial. Not a surprise, largely because we did more medium to larger-sized deals in the quarter. And when you do that, you have some level of extension in the book-to-bill interval, and therefore, the backlog does creep up as we work to to configure those deployments and get them into implementation. So hopefully, that answers that question. And let me then just go over to the DOJ, which I think Adaire was going to pass to me anyway, no surprise to you. We're continuing to work with the SEC and the DOJ. It's a process. We're working through that process. We continue to feel very confident in that process and how we're responding to it. I would like you to draw great comfort from the fact that not only did we file our 10-Q last quarter, but today, we filed our 10-Q today. And so when you think about the reinforcement we got from the Audit Committee's investigation of our financials, you should draw great comfort from it. But like anything, with the short seller report as it comes out and the following subpoenas that came from the SEC and DOJ, we have to respond to it and therefore, it is a process. In your question to -- was there anything that came out of what we want to do differently? I think it was very important when you look at what we announced in May, we were clear that not only did we not have any restatements but we didn't have any adjustments. Restatements is a fact about materiality. Adjustment is an adjustment. And so the system is working as it should, which is great. We have the controls, the team does the work. And overall, we feel very confident about it. But like anything, you're always are going to step back and reflect that there are other things that we could do that are different. And so that's where the team, they're looking at all the things that we do and saying, do we do different type of disclosures. You saw us recently talk about the redevelopment CapEx, which we thought one was a very important disclosure, we had already been planning for it in advance of the short seller report, but those are the kind of things that we just -- we make sure that there's appropriate augmentation of policy and disclosure, And I think it puts us in a much better position. But relating to, is there any adjustments? The answer is no. But we always think that there's things we can do better. And I'm drawing from a line of one of my co-CFO friends, he always says better, better, never done because we're always looking to do better every single quarter. And we're never going to be done. So we'll take the advice and guidance from both the council and whether anything comes back from DOJ and SEC, and we'll get better. But overall, I feel very comfortable in our financial disclosures. David Barden : Alright guys, thank you so much. Thank you both. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. James Schneider : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions and welcome, Adaire. I was wondering if you can maybe expand on your comments earlier about AI workloads moving from service providers to enterprise. From your vantage point, how long do you believe it will be before that AI demand becomes more directly material on the enterprise side to Equinix on the sort of conventional retail side? Adaire Fox-Martin: Thanks very much, Jim, and thanks for your question and your words of welcome. I think in the short term, the demand that we're seeing is primarily for training based workloads. This is primarily driven in the short term by cloud and the various different technology partners that we have. And this, as I've mentioned, is how our near-term pipeline is being represented and the beneficiary of this in many instances is our xScale business. In the enterprise mid-market retail business, we absolutely have AI-ready data centers, ready to take customer workloads. We have already closed a number of transactions where we are running smaller, AI-based workload scenarios in the training world for enterprise-based customers. We are working with many of our CIOs to support their AI strategy as they look to integrate AI into their business and manage their cost whilst they're doing so. And of course, some of our ecosystem partners have created almost a magnetism around Equinix as it relates to AI, companies like CoreWeave and Lambda that we announced last year in 2023, who have capabilities available today in Equinix data centers and, of course, the NVIDIA DGX private cloud offering that we also announced late in 2023. All of these have very active work pipelines. Some of them have active users who are making use of this system now. So I'd say that we're seeing early traction in the enterprise level inference and type workloads beginning to occur in our data center environment. But that is something that we'll see extrapolate and grow over the medium to longer term. James Schneider : Thanks. And then as a follow-up, last quarter, you outlined your plan for your DC1 data center to both modernize and expand capacity. As you look across your portfolio, do you foresee the opportunity to do this more broadly across more facilities? Keith Taylor : Yes. I think, Jim, you're referring to our DC2 redevelopment, if I'm not mistaken. James Schneider : DC2, excuse me. Keith Taylor : And I just want to make sure. We think the universe of what we call redevelopment projects like that is 5 to 7-ish. They're strategic, they have scale, they are of size and of great importance. We're doing those type of redevelopments because of the value that we get to create introduce more capacity into that highly connected data center and get a good return, not only a good return on both the element of it, which is redevelopment, but also the enhancement aspect of it. And so overall, the universe isn't massive. We have 264 data centers, as Adaire alluded to, we think is 5 to 7 strategic assets strewn throughout the world that we'll do that, too. James Schneider : Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Michael Elias from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Michael Elias : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. And Adaire, congratulations on taking the helm. Maybe to kick things off, one of the things that we've noticed is the differential in densities between what's being churned and what's coming in. As I think through kind of the evolution at the chip level, it seems like there's an acceleration in power consumption there. Do you view this as a structural trend, i.e., we could be talking about 4 or 5 quarters from now, you taking in cabinets at 7 kW per cab and churning at 4. Thus, this represents an increasing headwind to that cabinet number. I guess that's my first question. Just trying to get a sense around is this going to become a greater and greater headwind? Adaire Fox-Martin: Yes. 10 weeks in. So this is certainly one of the areas that I've done a little bit of a double click on here. And I can certainly see that there are absolutely some shifting dynamics in the business. And Keith highlighted this increasing power density in the cabs that are churning in versus, as you pointed, those that are churning out. And for us, perhaps, this is something where we would look to see the billable cabs as a measure, maybe not being as tightly tied to revenue growth as we've seen it in the past. And that's something that I think we're reflecting on. If I think about our xScale business, kilowatts probably is a cleaner metric. But when I think about it from retail, our MRR per cab and our billable cabs that, perhaps, is the right P times Q math that we have now, even though growth is probably more weighted towards the cabin yield versus the cabin count at this point. And I think that we can continue to supplement that with quarterly insights into how we're seeing the density evolve as our business evolves and as the capabilities within our data centers continue to evolve. So it's certainly something that's a whole process for us here. I think as Keith mentioned, just to reiterate, I think those very strong gross bookings plus the leading indicator of cabinets sold, not yet installed are indicators that we will improve on this number in the second half. Keith Taylor : And maybe, Michael, if I can just add on to what Adaire said. I think it's important, as Adaire said, look, we got to keep on looking at and David asked the question earlier on, we wanted to be able to respond to it in a way that absolutely makes sense and give you all the statistics at least, so you can have the same sort of view that we have. Clearly, the shifting dynamics is more density. So that's a positive. But I think what's really -- the crux of what is going to come here, if you have more density, you your price per unit is going up and you're seeing that in the ARPU or the MR per cabinet. But we're also -- when we look to monetize the capital that we invest in the business, no surprise to you, we're looking at a return on that investment. But those targeted IRRs are 20% to 30% fee leverage. And so you're seeing the cash-on-cash yield still deliver. But that one core metric really feels like it's, again, something that I think makes sense to keep on tracking. But we're really going to have to give you other components so that you get the full value of what's going on in the business. But the underlying bias is more density and that's how -- where retail is multi-tenant data center player, you need to deal with the changing shifts in customer expectations. And that -- when you go into one of our data centers, you get a real good feel for that, the true difference between something may be in 1 aisle versus something in a different aisle and that tells you like there are shifting dynamics taking place in a really live environment, and it is an ecosystem that thrives with a propensity to increase density. Michael Elias : Great, thanks for the color there. And if I could just squeeze one more in. I believe the expectation at the beginning of the year was for churn to step down in the back half. Is that still your expectation? And maybe as part of that, could you give us a sense for the churn that you're seeing among medium and small-sized deployments? Thanks. Adaire Fox-Martin: Yes. I'll comment on this, and then perhaps, Keith, feel free to add. I mean, certainly, we're seeing that our churn in the range of 2% to 2.5%, which is the range that we guided to is something that we can continue to manage to. I think that if we normalized for StackPath in this quarter, we'd have been slightly better than our expectations in terms of where we landed. We also have a supply and demand situation in the market, which has a very positive trajectory on pricing. So maybe this gives us the opportunity to be thoughtful about managing our overall churn dynamic so that we could selectively use proactive churn to help us drive and improve some yields here. I see that some of the challenges that we had in the first half will still exist at the macro level. There's certainly there's need for customers across all industry segments to do more with less. Optimization is still something that customers are looking to do because it does give them that outcome on the more with less tangent. And we definitely have a number of our customers who are in a tougher environment in terms of the industry that they're operating in and the dynamics of that industry. That being said, we see that we will be managing within our full year as per the guide to the ranges that we set. And then I guess, just from a thought process incoming to this, in the world of cloud, this is quite a usual process. I think that there is an opportunity for us to look at some -- to some enhancements in terms of management and proactive management early on of our customer engaged with us as it relates to their use profile and intention to churn. And so I think there is a potential for us to lean in and support our customers as they optimize and to engage in churn-type discussions much earlier in the process than we've been doing thus far. Keith Taylor : Michael, maybe I just -- I'll just add on one additional thing given Adaire's comments. Through the second half of the year, the pipeline is deep. The underlying expectation really is to see, obviously, our gross booking activity continuing to go up. We expect churn is going to be consistent with how we've previously guided, which is important. And then in the fourth quarter, we've already sort of telegraphed we're working with one customer in Singapore that is coming in size. That we're asking -- we're working with them to vacate the premises. We will update you on that by the time we get to the back end of the third quarter. So on the October call, but that's the one area that is a [indiscernible] churn. It was built into our guide. And as I said, it should happen by the end of the year and that gives us back some very valuable capacity in Singapore that we'd like to have to put to our use and our Singapore 6 asset isn't going to be available until probably sometime in late 2026, I would think by the time it's up and running. Michael Elias : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good afternoon. And Adaire, congratulations on the new role. I'd like to get your thoughts on the addressable market for your retail data center services maybe in a slightly different way. So the deck -- the presentation deck cites that you have about 2,000 networks, over 4,800 enterprises, and I think about 3,000 cloud and IT service providers. And when you look at the opportunity for future revenue growth, curious how much more room do you have to grow the customers in each of these verticals relative to the opportunity to increase the spend from the customers that you have. And then just a follow-up, if I could, as well. Keith, just following up from your comments about second half influences. When we take a look at the constant currency, normalized ex-PPI revenue growth for the last two quarters, it seems like the first half average was roughly 8%, which is at the high end of the 7% to 8% target for the year. And then you made comments, I think, a few times now on the gross bookings environment, the pipeline. So can you share a bit more of what's happening in the back half of the year that's meeting the annual range at that 7% to 8%. Thanks. Adaire Fox-Martin: You want to take that first, Keith? Keith Taylor : Yes, sure. I will do the first one. Adaire Fox-Martin: Yes, I'll take first or you go first. Keith Taylor : Why don't I take it? Let me take the second half of the year, first, Michael, if I may. Look, the -- it's not lost on you, and I'm sure all the other listeners that the business is performing well. The one thing that has been persistent is although we're comfortable with the range of churn, our ability to guide, it has been persistently high, and we had a tough fourth quarter in 2023, and that translates into momentum into 2024. That all said, when you look at this particular quarter, 21.59 [ph], there's an element of quarter-over-quarter currency movement. We've given you all those numbers. I won't repeat them. We also felt the drag related to energy. As you know, we have -- we're going through power price decreases. Then we had this one-off large charge to our recurring revenues that, that we booked in the quarter. To size it for you, it's roughly $7 million. And so there's a number of things that sort of have affected the sequential movement quarter-over-quarter. And that's on the recurring side of it. There's great variability in the non-recurring. We'll do our best to guide you each quarter on what's going on. Suffice it to say, the success in the xScale business has created some volatility with nonrecurring and we'll reconcile that and normalize it out for next year as well, just so you can truly get the sense of how the underlying business is performing. So all that said, we said that churn would slow down in the second half of the year and our bookings would accelerate. The pipeline is at the highest level we have ever seen in our business. So that's good churn. We have, I think, good visibility to. And as a result, that's the momentum you're seeing that you should see in the business. And so we continue to remain confident. And as Adaire said, despite the macroeconomic conditions, we know they're tough out there. Companies like StackPath when they hit the wall at full speed and just liquidate, it gives you a sense that some companies aren't doing well out there. But you've got an evolving economic environment. We know our relevance. We know the digital environment is very friendly to Equinix, and we know the supply environment is going to continue to get more constrained. So the combination of all of that continues to give us the optimism that we have, not only in how we exit year but also how we position ourselves for 2025 again, you know what our lighthouse metric is, is driving value on a per share basis. That is our whole intention. But we believe we can do that with both good fiscal management and top line growth. So hopefully, that gives you the answer that you're looking for. Adaire Fox-Martin: And perhaps, just building on that and to address the first part of the question around the opportunity in our installed base and new market opportunities. This is something that I feel very, very positive about. Not only have we undertaken or already commenced a very deep refresh of our segmentation of our customer base. But in the context of that, we have looked at each of those elements and how we can create sales place scenarios that allow us to have almost like a rinse-and-repeat model from a selling perspective into a cohort of customers. So very excited about the upsell opportunity as a result of some of those programs in our installed base, but also about the outcomes of the segmentation exercise and the way that we will define our coverage model to enable us to reach further to prospects and bring them into the Equinix family as customers. So a piece of work that's underway, and I'm very confident about the prognosis and outcome of that work. Chip Newcom : Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. This concludes our Q2 call. Operator : Thank you all for participating in the Equinix Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. That concludes today's conference. Please disconnect at this time, and have great rest of your day.",

Also, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time. I'd now like to turn the call over to Chip Newcom, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin. Chip Newcom : Good afternoon and welcome to today's conference call. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone that some of the statements that we will be making today are forward-looking in nature and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those statements and may be affected by the risks we've identified in today's press release, as well as those identified in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K filed February 16, 2024 and our most recent Form 10-Q. Equinix assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or comment on forward looking statements made on this call. In addition, in light of regulation fair disclosure, it is Equinix's policy not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done to an explicit public disclosure. On today's conference call, we will provide non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a list of the reasons why the company uses these measures in today's press release on the Equinix Investor relations page at www.equinix.com. We've made available on the IR page of our website a presentation designed to accompany this discussion, along with certain supplemental financial information and other data. We would also like to remind you that we post important information about Equinix on the IR page of our website from time to time and encourage you to check our website regularly for the most current available information. With us today are Adaire Fox-Martin, Equinix's CEO and President, and Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we will be taking questions from sell site analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up in one hour, we would like to ask these analysts to limit any follow on questions to one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Adaire. Adaire Fox-Martin: Thank you. Chip Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We had an outstanding quarter. We delivered record growth bookings with strong performance across each of our three regions. We had solid deal conversion rates and pricing remained robust. Cabinets billing increased meaningfully. All of this translated into our 87th quarter of consecutive revenue growth with attractive AFFO per share profitability, highlighting the scale and differentiation that reinforces our market position. Importantly, given the robust demand for digital infrastructure to enable AI capabilities across industries and regions, our forward-looking pipeline remains strong with healthy pre sales activities supporting our momentum in Q4 and beyond. Turning to our strategy, as I discussed last quarter, Equinix has developed a differentiated and successful business over the last two and a half decades, creating exceptional value for our customers and our shareholders. Our strength is underpinned by our position as the world's leading digital infrastructure company, our truly global footprint and scale, our neutrality and our singular value proposition around interconnection. However, we recognize that our industry landscape is dynamic and increasingly complex. Customer requirements and data center designs are evolving rapidly. Energy constraints and long-term development cycles pose challenges to our industry's ability to serve customers effectively. Equinix is particularly well positioned to address these challenges as an industry leader to seize the significant opportunities ahead and drive future growth. To this end, we will focus on three strategic areas built on the tenets I shared on last quarter's earnings call of clarity, simplicity and focus. First, we will start outside in with our customers. We will focus on enhancing how we engage with our customers at every milestone in our relationship with them. Our goal is to be the partner of choice for our customer\u2019s most critical infrastructure workloads. To achieve this, we intend to evolve our go-to-market engine in a structured and coordinated manner to deliver a frictionless customer experience that is segment appropriate. We have already seen the benefit of solution and segment focus in our record Q3 gross bookings outcome. Second, we will deliver integrated solutions that make it easier for our customers and partners to deploy and consume solutions at Equinix. Our initial efforts will focus on developing smarter solutions that extend our core co-location and interconnection offerings. This is where we have the right to win and the right to lead. In support of this, we have brought together our data center services team and our digital services team into a single business area led by Jon Lin. Third, we have been innovating in data center design and our approach to data center construction. We are fortunate to have industry leading procurement, design and construction teams. We intend to build for the future and accelerate our development of differentiated campuses that support the broad range of our customer\u2019s needs. Essentially, this means moving from many smaller builds with phased capacity delivery to fewer larger bills, balancing location with access to power on campuses that can service the full range of our customer\u2019s needs from SMEs to hyperscalers. At the same time, we will remain focused on delivering industry leading investment returns by continuing to meet the evolving needs of our customers, placing the right application into the right footprint for the best business outcome. Taken together, I believe these strategic moves which are about doing less so that we can deliver more, will drive significant long-term value for our customers, partners and shareholders. We continue to invest in the market opportunities we believe lie ahead. Earlier this month we announced our plans to nearly triple the investment capital of our xScale program with the agreement to form a greater than 15 billion joint venture with the CPP Investment Board and GIC. With the capital raised through this new JV, Equinix expects to build new state of the art xScale facilities on multiple campuses across the U.S. each with the capacity of multiple hundreds of megawatts. As discussed previously, we've already closed on land and power for a 240 megawatt xScale campus in Atlanta which we expect to contribute to this new JV. We are currently in active diligence to secure power and land in additional U.S. markets and look forward to providing more details in the coming quarters. Since our last earnings call in our established JVs, we have leased an incremental 20 megawatts in our SOL 2 [ph] data center. This brings total xScale leasing to 385megawatts globally with nearly 90% of our operational and under construction capacity leased. We believe Equinix is uniquely positioned to innovate with and for hyperscalers and we are excited about the opportunities ahead. Enterprise demand is steadily building for AI related workloads. We remain the preferred location for server provider onramps supporting the data ingestion and distribution requirements of AI workloads. Equinix customers can enjoy low latency access to native hyperscaler on ramps in 47 metros across 25 countries. This includes 12 metros with onramps to five or more providers. This is six times the coverage of our nearest competitor. Recent key service provider wins and production use cases include Nebius, a full stack AI infrastructure provider. Their new deployment in Paris will be among the first in Europe to offer NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs in support of providing essential resources for customer AI journeys. Sakura Internet, a Japanese cloud service provider is actively involved in the development of large scale cloud services for generative AI and aims to enhance its GPU based cloud services to explore new business opportunities in Asia. For Enterprise AI, Equinix is supporting our Fortune 200 shipping and logistics company who deployed at Equinix to unlock predictive capabilities in logistics and build intelligent data driven supply chains. We are also supporting a leading med tech company who is leveraging AI algorithms to analyze endoscopic images in real time. This will save lives through enhancing diagnostic precision. Our unique business model enables us to serve the full spectrum of our customers AI requirements. Our retail footprint is well positioned to serve the inferencing and private AI workloads of enterprises of varying sizes. Our rapidly expanding xScale offering can meet the significant requirements of hyperscalers and service providers. Our ability to satisfy these needs fortifies our resilience in capturing upside and managing potential downside in a highly dynamic and evolving AI landscape. Turning to our results, as depicted on slide 3 Q3 revenues were 2.2 billion, up 7% over the same quarter last year driven by strong recurring revenue growth and xScale fees. Adjusted EBITDA was up 12% year-over-year with solid AFFO per share profitability. Interconnection revenues increased 10% year-over-year with continued strength from Equinix Fabric. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Fueling our industry leading global interconnection franchise we now have 478,000 total interconnections deployed across our footprint. Growth Interconnection additions remain strong and pricing continues to trend favorably. Net interconnection additions improved to 5,700 due to strong increase in hyperscale across connects and the continued diversification of our ecosystems. Equinix Fabric saw continued solid growth and is now operating at an annual revenue run rate of greater than US$250 million with an attach rate of approximately 40% across our global customer base. Our fabric business grew thanks to 100 gigabit port editions and higher bandwidth virtual connections. Equinix Internet Exchange saw peak traffic surpass 40 terabits per second for the first time. In August we opened our first data center in Johannesburg to support the growing digital infrastructure and connectivity needs of enterprises and service providers in the rapidly growing African continent. We also opened the first phases of our New York 3 and Tokyo 15 IBXs this quarter, easing capacity constraints in two of our key metros. Customers taking advantage of our expanding global footprint include PubMatic, a digital advertising firm who expanded their partnership with Equinix to leverage AI powered predictive analytics for their ad campaigns. SaaS provider Zoho chose Equinix so they could better support their customers in complying with European data sovereignty requirements. Our channel program delivered another solid quarter contributing approximately 50% of new logos. We continued to see growth from partners like Avant, Dell, Orange Business and WWT with wins across a wide range of industry segments and use cases including AI. Q3 wins include a data center modernization project with AT&T. Together we helped a customer experience technology company blend cloud and private infrastructure resources, enable multi cloud networking and accelerate AI and automation enhancements for customer interactions. We believe this quarter is a testament to the trust our customers place in us and the value they realize from partnering strategically with us. With that, I'll turn it over to Keith to cover the quarter's financials. Keith Taylor : Thanks Adaire and good afternoon to everyone. Let me start by saying we once again delivered another strong quarter. The business continues to execute against its short term goals, another step in our journey while setting the stage for the years ahead. We finished the quarter with record gross bookings with each of our regions at or very near their all-time highs. Our net bookings were also very strong with net megawatts sold in our core business up 60% over the previous quarter, a reflection of the growth and density of our bookings activity. Additionally, we pre- sold a meaningful amount of future capacity which is neither included in our bookings nor our backlog metrics. We closed more than 4,100 deals with more than 3,200 customers and our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO were at the high end of our expectations, the result of solid revenue growth and disciplined cost management. As it relates to our non financial metrics, we saw meaningful improvements across net billable cabinets and interconnections and higher NMR per cabinet. Net billable cabinet stepped up by 3,100 globally driven by strong bookings and capacity openings in certain key markets. Given our record Q3 gross bookings and our elevated backlog of cabinets sold but not yet installed, we expect our net billable cabinet additions to remain strong through the end of the year. Net interconnection additions had a healthy step up as our gross interconnection activity remains at its highest level. Interconnection revenues increased to 19% of recurring revenues. Our MRR per cabinet metric continues to trend favorably, increasing 6% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis to over $2,300 per cabinet, driven by favorable pricing environments and increasing power densities. In the quarter, the average cabinet booked had an average density of 6.2 kilowatts per cabinet, while the density of our turn cabinets was 4 kilowatts per cabinet. As Adaire highlighted, we're excited about the next phase of our xScale initiative. The announcement of our greater than $15 billion joint venture with CPP, IB and GIC is another milestone for Equinix. We continue to believe this off balance sheet joint venture structure will enable us to serve the significant needs of our largest customers for both traditional cloud and emerging AI workloads while delivering significant value to our investors on a per share basis. Bottom line, given the strength of our balance sheet, including our low debt leverage and strategic and operational liquidity alongside the xScale partnerships, we believe that Equinix represents the best opportunity to create value in the digital infrastructure space. Now let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on slide 4, global Q3 revenues were $2.201 billion, up 7% over the same quarter last year at the midpoint of our guidance range due to the deferral of planned xScale fees into 2025. For Q4, our revenue guidance implies a meaningful step up in non-recurring revenues related to xScale fit out activities and other sales activity. Net of our FX hedges, there was a minimal FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 adjusted EBITDA was 1.048 billion or approximately 48% of revenues, up 12% over the same quarter last year at the top end of our guidance range due to strong operating performance. Q3 adjusted EBITDA net of our FX hedges included a $1 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and included $2 million of integration costs. Global Q3 FFO was 866 million, up 12% over the same quarter last year, better than our expectation due to strong operating performance, favorable net interest expense and the timing of our Singapore 6 land lease payment. Q3AFFO included a minimal FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 MRR Churn was lower than planned due to the Deferral of forecasted MRR Churn from late September into early October. As such, when we averaged the expected quarterly churn over the second half of the year, we expect MRR Churn to be in the middle of our 2% to 2.5% quarterly guidance range. Turning to our regional highlights whose full results are covered on slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized basis, APAC was our fastest growing region at 15%, followed by the Americas and EMEA regions growing at 6% and 3% respectively. Excluding the impact of par price actions, APAC grew 17% and EMEA grew 5%. The Americas region delivered very strong bookings across many of our Tier one metros including Dallas, New York, Silicon Valley and Washington DC. Demand continues to outpace supply in top markets driving a favorable pricing environment. Our new business also delivered a great quarter with record gross bookings activity, firm pricing and robust AI deal activity led by our Dubai, Frankfurt, London and Paris metros. We also had healthy activity in our growth in emerging market metros as global scale and reach continue to be a point of differentiation for our business. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a great quarter with near record gross bookings and strong inter-region activity resulting in quarterly revenues reaching the $500 million milestone for the very first time. We experienced continued momentum in our Hong Kong, Osaka, Singapore and Tokyo markets including significant AI demand in Japan for service provider, enterprise and government use cases. And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our balance sheet increased to approximately $35.4 billion including elevated cash and short term investments of $3.2 billion ahead of our $1 billion maturing bond payment in November. In the quarter, we issued more than 750 million in senior green bonds across our Euro and Swiss franc offerings as we continue to align our financings across our investing markets while supporting our Future for Sustainability strategy. To date, Equinix has issued approximately 5.6 billion of green bonds, making our company one of the top 10 largest U.S. investment grade corporate issuers in the green bond market. Additionally, we settled both Forward and spot ATM activity of approximately 975 million in the quarter. We plan to continue to take a balanced and opportunistic approach to accessing the capital markets as and when market conditions are favorable to fund our future growth, including future capital commitment purchases. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter, capital expenditures were $724 million, including recurring CapEx of $69 million, a $24 million increase over the prior quarter. As planned, we have 57 major projects underway in 35 markets across 22 countries, including 13 xScale projects. This represents more than 22,000 cabinets of retail and more than 100 megawatts of xScale capacity to be delivered through 2025. We opened seven major projects in the quarter across seven metros including new data centers in Johannesburg, Istanbul, New York and Tokyo. We also purchased land for development in Amsterdam and Bangkok as we continue to expand our footprint across South East Asia. More than 85% of our current retail expansion spend is on our own land, our own buildings with long-term ground leases. Our capital investments deliver strong returns as shown on Slide 10, our 180 stabilized assets increase revenues by 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis excluding the impact of prior price actions. Stabilized assets were collectively 84% utilized and generated a 26% cash-on-cash return on the gross PPE invested. And finally, please refer to slides 11 through 15 for our updated summary of 2024 guidance and bridges. Do note, all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. For the full year we're raising our revenue guidance by $36 million and our adjusted EBITDA guidance by $10 million due to strong bookings, performance and favorable FX rates. This guidance implies a top line growth rate of 7% to 8%. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be about 47% which includes the acceleration of certain costs into Q3 and Q4. We're also raising our full year AFFO guidance by $18 million and now 11% to 13% increase over the previous year primarily due to operating performance and favorable net interest expense and does include the acceleration of costs into Q3 and Q4. AFFO per share is expected to now grow between 9% and 10% at the top end of our guidance range. And finally, our full year CapEx is expected to range between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion, including about $240 million of recurring CapEx spend. So let me stop here and I'm going to turn the call back to Adaire. Adaire Fox-Martin: Thank you Keith. In closing, we had a great third quarter, achieving record growth bookings and delivering robust performance across key financial and non financial metrics. We are more committed than ever to seizing the vast and evolving opportunities in AI. We will nearly triple the investment capital of our xScale program once our latest joint venture is fully realized. But xScale is more than an investment vehicle for Equinix. Our xScale program is a force multiplier. Only Equinix is positioned to offer integrated infrastructure at scale across the spectrum of workload requirements from hyperscalers to enterprises to SMEs. Only Equinix can offer this globally. Only Equinix can provide this in an interconnection rich architecture. The combination of these elements marks Equinix as unique amongst our industry peers. The future of Equinix and the digital infrastructure industry is incredibly bright. I firmly believe our relentless customer focus, ability to execute effectively and highly differentiated market position will continue to drive significant long-term value for our customers, our partners, our employees and our shareholders. With that, I'll stop here and open it up to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ari Klein : Thanks and good afternoon. Maybe, Adaire, you talked a little bit about the shifting strategic focus to large campuses. Can you talk a little bit about some of the benefits you would expect from that? And does that change the value proposition of any of your existing markets in any way? Adaire Fox-Martin: Hi, thank you. Thank you very much for the question. And this is a key part of the strategy that we put together with our team recently. We have already got a long pipeline of builds that are committed and construction projects that are underway, as Keith mentioned, 57 major programs under work at this point in time. And of course, as we look through that, we will work through that and look at the opportunity to accelerate some of these builds and some of their phases into earlier timeframes so that we can deliver this capacity to our customers and to the market. As we look at the intention to build fewer and larger campuses, this is really a multifaceted approach that enables us to look at this through the lens of securing the power that's necessary to execute in these campuses, doing so in the context of a location that is adjacent to the metros that we operate in and allowing us to offer, which I think is unique in the industry, the entire spectrum of our product continuum to customers that range from hyperscalers with their requirements to enterprises with their large footprint requirements all the way through to our retail business and customers who require interconnection rich capabilities in our environment. So this is, I think, something that will augment our approach to our strategy around design and construction and how we deliver capacity to the market to enable us to continue on our growth trajectory. Keith Taylor : Ari, if I may just add one other comment to Adaire's comment. You also have to appreciate that there are certain economies of scale. If you talk about Ralph [ph] with his global design and construction team, there's just too many small, small phases that we do along the process. And it's, the stage of where we are in the industry is just, is inherently inefficient and the average size of the deals that we're seeing today are much larger. And so as Adaire says, it just, it makes sense to aggregate into the, into the major metros in which we focus, the, through the extension of those major metros into other markets as well. And do it in scale and size. And so we get an outsized return relative to where we were. And you sort of service, service the customer with a larger set of capacity available for them. Ari Klein : Thanks. And maybe a somewhat of a follow up on the development side. It looks like you're adding a significant number of cabinets specifically in the D.C. market, including DC 16, Phase 2 and 3, essentially back to back. Is there something specific you're seeing in that market? Does that go to, that shift to two larger campuses? And just even more broadly in the Americas you have a large amount of cabinets expected to come online over the next 12 to 18 months. Is that to meet backlog? Are you preempting inference demand in any way or is there something else? Adaire Fox-Martin: Well, I think we're in the very unfortunate position that market wise demand outstrips supply at the moment. And that is particularly true I think in the North American theater of operation. So we are looking forward to having the opportunity to release this capacity into the market where we know that we will not only be able to serve the needs of our customers, but also command a price premium in this robust pricing environment for the cabs that we release. Ari Klein : Thank you. Adaire Fox-Martin: Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Simon Flannery : Great. Good evening Keith. I wanted to just come back to revenue growth. I think the underlying adjusted for power pass through growth this year, 7% to 8%. Could we revisit the investor day last year? I think you talked about this being something of a transition year but longer term you saw 8% to 10% growth and there was just talking about the strong demand and pricing. So how do we think about that as we head into 2025 with the bookings backlog and how that relates to CapEx, especially given some of your new plans on expansion. Thanks. Adaire Fox-Martin: Thanks for the question, Simon. I might just jump in first and maybe just comment on some of the dynamics that we saw in the market in Q3 and then pass over to Keith to address some of the specificity of the question that you raised there. I think when we look at the first half of this year we certainly saw some headwinds, even though I believe that performance was solid during the first half of the year. And it would be fair to say that whilst in Q3 some of these headwinds still persist. We saw incredible improvement in our bookings trajectory and there are some underpinning reasons why I believe that to be the case. First of all, we are as we know, in a very strong demand environment. But our sales teams executed with precision on our pipeline and we had phenomenal execution that led to this record gross bookings which of course facilitates the growth in our backlog. And we did that in a way that means that our forward looking pipeline is also strong. So there were no major pull forwards into our Q3 outcomes as a result of the wonderful execution of the sales team. We also focused on some sales plays that cornered in particular conversations for us with our customers, enabling us to deliver solutions in very particular contexts that meet requirements for customer\u2019s right across the spectrum of the market. And we also adopted an approach where we began to demand shape so how we could look at capacity that existed in our tier two metros and demand shape the workload in concurrence with the customer so that we were actually utilizing the capacity in these non tier one metros. And it's interesting to see that the megawatts landing in our non tier 1 metros was 80% up Q on Q. So this coupled with this very strong pipe and Keith alluded to it in his opening remarks where we have already undertaken some presale activity that I think derisks both Q4 and future quarters, and enables us to look, to look forward in a positive way. We've delivered in Q3 some critical capacity into the market and pricing continues to be robust. As you heard, our interconnection ads are strong, power density is rising. So whilst we've had some puts and takes for us Q4 will be about focusing on delivering another great quarter so that we have a strong exit into 2025. Keith Taylor : Simon, maybe just adding on to Adaire's comments which I think really hit the mark in so many different ways, but as you can appreciate, our business is very geographically dispersed. As Adaire said, there's demand shaping into markets and that affects that has some impact on price and price points. That all said, the number of core markets that we are currently constrained in is something that has caused us to reflect on how we're going to grow and build the platform and so hence why we're going to build bigger in particular the markets that are the most important ones. And so that is something that I think that you'll continue to hear us talk about. There's the crosscurrents that we referred to at the beginning part of the year and still exist today. But we're seeing thankfully we're seeing the growth activity that more than outweighs these cross currents. The cross currents are really about optimization you've heard us speak about previously, particularly around network companies as they optimize whether it's their cross connect or other services, whether it's DDN providers and the like that tend to be very cross connected. So those are some of the things I think that are the forefront of our mind. That all said, we've set ourselves up for what we believe is going to be a really good Q4. That's going to be the strong indication coming off a record Q3, what does Q4 look like? And then what is the ability of the matrix our sorry, our xScale 2.0 initiative look like as we look into 2025 as well. So it's the combination of those things I think that will allow or give us the confidence that we think we're going to have a very strong exit rate to the business. And maybe just a last couple of points. One of the things we said in our prepared remarks was interconnection. Interconnection revenues have increased. Not only do we see a nice year-over-year growth rate at 10% but the average price point is moving up on a per cross connect basis. And so you're seeing increased density, increased pricing and the componentry of that relative to the size of our total revenue base has been increasing. And so it's the combination of those matters as well that we think will influence our growth rate as we look into 2025 and beyond. Simon Flannery : Thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question will come from Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Your line is open. Jonathan Atkin : Thanks. So I have a balance sheet question just with the 2.8 billion in cash, three and a half times net leverage and just given the operating trends that you've talked about, what would you potentially have in how you plan to use some of the cash going forward? Whether it might be like land acquisitions or tuck in or other data center acquisitions. And then I have a follow up. Thanks. Keith Taylor : Well Jon, you know the business really well. So with the short term investments which are very, as you can appreciate are very liquid, the cash on the balance sheet at September 30 was $3.2 billion cash and short term investments. We're going to use a billion of that to pay down our debt in November. And so on a pro forma basis, clearly that we have a smaller balance than you're probably anticipating. That all said, given the capital plans that we have, the closure of the Philippines acquisition, the dividend, we're probably going to end the year around $1.5 billion of cash. And as you and the other analysts and some investors are aware, we have a really meaningful capital appetite looking forward into 2025, but maybe even more so in 2026 and 2027 as the growth opportunity presents itself. And then you sort of tie that into also our xScale 2.0 initiative with CPPIB and GIC we're going to be a 25% partner to a $15 billion plus venture. And so we're going to have to fund that as well. And we're already seeing the initial sort of cash demands from that initiative both in what we need to do with the power, the power generator, the utility provider, as well as the long need items with the partners and the vendors. And it's really around the MEP, all the mechanical and electric and plumbing equipment and, and the like. And so that's also a, big consumer of cash on our balance sheet as we anticipate what will happen in the future, which is a lot of revenue coming from those investments. But again, we have to get ahead of them today. And so we need the cash on the balance sheet to certainly fund that future growth, pay the dividend, and continue to scale the business. Adaire Fox-Martin: Thanks, Keith. We're very focused on getting that capital into capacity as quickly as possible, right? Keith Taylor : Yes. And the leverage, the leverage is, the net leverage number, Jon, as you know, is three and a half times leverage, which is great for the industry, but we do carry a little bit more cash, as you know. But that all said, when you look at it, we still have a tremendous amount of strategic flexibility in our balance sheet and so we'll continue to. We're going to go raise more debt capital. We already have our sites on different parts of the world. We're going to raise the next tranches of debt capital. We've been really efficient with our ATM program. We can put more leverage on the books with great comfort without finding ourselves in harm's way with any of the rating agencies. And so we have a lot of strategic flexibility there. So I think suffice it to say we are in a very enviable position vis-a-vis the liquidity and strategic flexibility we have and the partners we're engaging with to continually to scale the business in the xScale franchise. Jonathan Atkin : Thank you. My follow up just relates to digital and I might have missed you talked about attach rates. I think that might have been for fabric, but can you just update us on metal and Network Edge and what the plans are going forward, how you see those businesses progressing or not. Thanks. Adaire Fox-Martin: Sure. Thank you for the question. I think from an overall digital services portfolio, Equinix has certainly demonstrated some success and some very strong success in the products that are natively digitally enabled, such as fabric and such as Network Edge. Fabric achieved a greater than $250 million annual revenue run rate with a 40% attach. This 40% attach number is a focus point for us and moving forward into Q4 and next year, we think there's the opportunity to increase that attach rate. The growth in fabric was underpinned by solid 1 gigabyte port editions and we continue to see the potential in fabric almost diversifying as an exchange where we have almost 4,000 customers who are connecting to 1,300 cloud and network destinations. Underpinning fabric is obviously Fabric Cloud router which is available in 61 of our metros. And of course all of the key cloud providers are part of this fabric infrastructure. Network Edge 450 plus customers at the moment using this service. It is yet not a meaningful revenue contributor for us at this time, but we do believe that it drives ecosystem magnetism for us and is it is an evolving part of our business and one that we are focusing on under our digital services portfolio. Overall for us, as it relates to the products in this portfolio, we're really looking to ensure that we enhance the customer experience that we deliver improved digital interactions for our customers. That includes the portal capabilities through which the customers connect with us. That includes the API footprint that partners can use to deploy their solutions into our environment. And that will include capabilities like observability providing that view to our customers. Our get started position though our first focus for our digital services portfolio will be around our interconnection product portfolio and continuing to evolve and grow that great franchise. Jonathan Atkin : Anything on metal then to kind of round out the discussion? Keith Taylor : Not at this point. Let me just give you a general, maybe another general comment, Jon, that when we look at digital services they represent just under 8% of our revenues. Metal in and of itself represents 1 1/4% of our revenues. It was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. Jonathan Atkin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next we will hear from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. James Schneider : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. It was encouraging to see your new xScale joint venture with CPP and GIC. Can you maybe talk about the pace of new capacity additions you expect from that joint venture? Could we see anything by the first half of 2027 or is that early and how should we expect the ratability of that capacity to come on through the 2029 timeframe? Adaire Fox-Martin: Yes, we're very excited as well about the opportunity that this represents for us and really does allow us to serve the needs of our customer\u2019s right across the spectrum that we engage. So we agree with you in terms of the enthusiasm here. And this is a transaction that will close shortly and as soon as that transaction closes, given that we have already closed Atlanta and that we will move the Atlanta campus into the JV. This is where we will begin our work using the model that we have redefined in our design process for our data centers. So in terms of timeframe, it's hard to give you the specificity of that right now. I believe that we are probably looking at a 12 to 18 month cycle to introduce this capacity into our footprint. But we are working to ensure that we can bring capacity on as quickly as possible. And that's part of the process that will kick in following the formal close of this transaction. Keith Taylor : And Jim, I'll just elaborate a little bit further. We've already placed a number of orders for the long lead items as it relates to the Atlanta and the next campus. So two campuses out, we're currently negotiating with the local power provider in Atlanta. There's multiple other sites in the U.S. that we're working alongside different power producers to enter into an agreement. And so the combination of all those would probably allow you to make the assumption that the delivery of value will start much sooner than 2029. But still a little bit premature to give you exact dates. But it suffice it to say we're getting ready to start preparing the land in Atlanta and that will put us in pretty good position to deliver something much sooner than the 2029 timeframe. James Schneider : Great, thank you. And then maybe as a follow up, it was encouraging to see the resumption in growth in your new cabinet net additions in this quarter. You maybe would love to get a sense of your confidence that the momentum in either the growth rate or the number of cabinets can continue to accelerate from here and maybe talk about some of the underlying drivers of that. Thank you. Adaire Fox-Martin: Yes, thank you. Yes, we were also very happy about how this measure showed up in Q3. The volume that came through for us was quite impressive. And I think despite the continuation of the power density gap that we've been highlighting over previous quarters. And underpinning the net billable cabinets, we saw strong bookings, we had lower churn, and we had capacity opening up in some of our key metros, which all contributed to that 3100 number. As we look forward, we think based on the backlog of what's been sold but not being installed, that this will remain solid into Q4 and into early 2025. And so, yep, we're very happy with, as I said, how this showed up, even given, the increasing power density which allowed us to have a churn of 4 kilowatt cab, but to sell it at 6.2 kilowatt cab. James Schneider : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from David Barden with Bank of America. Your line is open. David Barden : Hey guys, thanks so much for taking the question. So I just want to follow up on, on Jim's question. So, Keith, no good deed goes unpunished. So slide 22. Footnote 2. You highlight that you've made some adjustments to the cabinet disclosure by making a cabinet equivalent. And we talked about this, I think, for several quarters. Could you elaborate a little bit on what is the adjustment? How does this affect, is it equal adjustments in each region? You didn't make the adjustment in Asia. Does it affect the MRR per cabinet disclosures? I mean, it would be helpful to have this conversation. I think, and then if I could. Well, I'll just let you go. And then I have a question for Adaire. Keith Taylor : Yes. No, it's a fair question. So this -- again, for those that aren't -- maybe haven't looked at the notes similar to how David has looked at them, this really is more about available cabinet capacity given the demand profile and the density of certain -- density of certain deployments relative to where the power exists today. And so we take -- and this is something from the beginning of time as we continue to -- again, for those that have walked through a data center, you walk through a data center, and you'll see that the site has a very dense cage. There could be idle capacity, at least from an infrastructure perspective. And largely that's because a prior customer has taken the infrastructure that would support that environment. And so we adjust the net cabinets. This is really about us creating that visibility to you, knowing that as density goes up, absent the augmentation of power in certain markets that we will take some of the inventory out. And of course, it adjusts the net utilization. But of course, because you increase density, you're increasing your price points and the volume of revenue going through that cabinet. And again, as I've said publicly in many venues, we price to yield. So we price on a kilowatt basis. And so where they use 1 cabinet or 1,000 cabinets, depending on how much infrastructure you use, that's the revenue that we would earn from the business. So again, there's nothing meaningful here other than to say that given the density factor of some of the deals that we're doing and some of the AI workloads that we're winning, it's adjusting basically the available physical cabinet of capacity that's available. And that offsets some of the builds that we basically brought to market this past quarter. So let me stop there, David, and see if I answered your question or whether there's anything else you'd like us to touch on there. David Barden : So I just want to clarify. So to the comments that Adaire was making about 4 dubs [ph] is traditional and kind of 6.2 is incremental. Are each of these new cabinets being considered a 1.5 cabinet? Keith Taylor : Well, it depends on the configuration and what the specifications were for the data center. Again, we measure this down to the asset level, as you would appreciate. And Ralph and his team do a great job of allocating the available energy across the floor plate depending on the consumption parameters of the customer. And so all that to say is some -- I suppose a network data center like Silicon Valley 1 or DC 2, the kilowatt per cabinet is much lower than it is in some of the newer builds. And so that's just us modifying it. But it's really more about what is that new deployment. But let me give an example. If a customer took a cabinet that was now consuming 20 kilowatts per cabinet, obviously, that has a much more material impact on cabinets we take out of available capacity versus something if that was in a network data center versus a cloud data center. So those are the things that we think about, but it's really about optimization of the asset. Ralph and his team manage it specifically. We also put things on hold in anticipation of introducing -- as you know, we do additional power blocks. We are building more phases. There's a lot of things that go into this. And so if there's something that happened in a given environment, that just might be temporary because we bring things in and out of availability depending on where we are with our power utilization statistics. David Barden : And then just my final question on that, and I'm sorry to kind of thank you for Keith, for sharing all the insights. But so if I'm going to do an MRR per cabinet, then is the denominator the cabinet or is it the cabinet equivalent, which would be a larger denominator? And so what I'm looking at is more of a normalized MRR cabinet as opposed to a MRR Cabinet? Keith Taylor : Yes. We've always measured things out of what we call a cab basis, a cabinet equivalent because you might have a scenario where you sell a cage but you have fewer cabinets. There are a lot of other infrastructure that's gone into the cage. So we always measure on a cab basis. David Barden : Okay. Good. And then, if I could, I apologize. So maybe it's just me, but it was interesting to read through the prepared remarks and listen to the prepared remarks because we talked maybe 50% of the time about the xScale program and all the investments and the balance sheet management, and it's 1% of revenue. Is this an effort to change the narrative about Equinix being a part of this kind of AI training? Because I feel like the old regime works really hard to convince people that this was not where Equinix was. Then it was all about inference was almost the future, but we're talking a lot about it, and I'm not sure why. Adaire Fox-Martin: Okay, that's a great question. Thank you for the opportunity to answer it for you. As we've navigated our xScale journey, I think as we've gained momentum it has become clear to us that xScale is an opportunity to be a multiplier for our core retail co location business. And let me explain why I say that and how. I mean that. First of all, I see it very much as a business where we have a huge opportunity to maintain our already high degree of relevance in the supply chain for construction and design. And as Keith has already alluded to, we manage a whole series of very strategic suppliers to enable us to build as quickly as possible and deliver revenue as quickly as possible for all of our new builds. xScale has a benefit in ensuring that as we're building at this kind of scale and this kind of size, supply chain, position and stature remains for Equinix where it is now, which is in the top quadrant. The second element around, the narrative around xScale is that we have recognized that with the xScale footprint we have a complete product set that addresses the evolving needs of our customers. So I feel that our process and our approach is very balance orientated and very about xScale being an and to our existing business instead of a nor. First off, with hyperscalers we are able obviously to capture the training workloads and the large data store requirements of the hyperscaler community. xScale gives us the facility and the ability to do that. For service providers it also gives us the opportunity perhaps to unlock some large footprint. We've seen large footprint demand even for our enterprise customer\u2019s increase over the course of the last period of time. And this enables us to be able to provide that capability to enterprises who are looking to perhaps do private AI with Equinix, who are looking to operate with Equinix at scale across a number of geographic locations. We gave some examples of customers that are enterprise based and who are using Equinix capabilities in order to underpin their AI strategies. So I believe that this full and rich product continuum from hyperscalers, serving enterprises and our retail rich colocation facility is actually the winning strategy because the landscape continues to evolve and we now have an opportunity to be able to respond to how that landscape evolves over time. So please see this as an and not an or. We want to very clearly articulate that for us this is about being balanced in our approach to the opportunity and that whilst training workloads have dominated the total kilowatts leased at this particular point moment in time we see significant opportunity as customers move through the stages of AI adoption at a much more accelerated pace than they move through the stages of cloud adoption. And we are actually talking to our customers not just about AI projects, but about AI enabled strategies. And when you speak about AI enabled strategies, there's a thoughtful process that one needs to consider around how you integrate in a hybrid and multi cloud architecture where you store your data, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. So please, for us this is very much clearly an and motion. And as we've understood more about our momentum and the opportunity in xScale, we see that it allows us to provide a full and rich product continuum serving customers across the spectrum. Keith Taylor : All right, thank you. Maybe speaking just a little bit financially on what it means, because it's not lost to me the comment that you made about it being small relative to the size of the business. One of the things we historically said and goes back to 2018, that xScale would be 1% to 2% of revenues and 3% to 5% accretive to our AFFO. As Adaire said, we're going to triple the size of that now. And the fact of the matter is the value accretion from xScale today is probably greater than it was previously, particularly given the new price points, the yields one can derive from that type of investment. So what you're going to see over time is I think, a larger contributor to the cash flow in the business, not only directly but indirectly through the joint venture structure as well. And we're just at the front edge of it today. We get the fee stream, the non-recurring fee stream. You've seen us, we talked about that periodically. But that's not what's going to drive the consistent and recurring value for our franchise. It's the recurring fees and the performance of the JV and our ownership of that JV or JVs that will make a difference to the cash flow and the AFFO that you'll enjoy on a per share basis. And maybe the last comment is, look, on the last earnings call we talked about, the business that we've already sold into, xScale 1.0 is on a run rate basis when installed is $700 million of revenue. It's a substantial adder to growth and it's $6 billion plus of contract value. Now magnify that and think about what is the value that accretes to the businesses that Adaire highlighted. And maybe one last comment which is something that we'll absolutely be thinking about. It's not lost to me that xScale, whether it's Venture 1, Venture 2 or whichever Venture it may be, can be a provider of future inventory to the, to the core business, which is the most important part of what we do as an organization. And so using other people's capital, including part of ours to grow our portfolio is really valuable. And so we see xScale as a really important additive. As Adaire said, it's an and not an or. This is we're going to augment value substantially by the investment decisions we're making and the realization of how important it is to our future. David Barden : Thank you both. Thank you. Thank you. Operator : Our last question will come from Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Timothy Horan : Hey guys. Keith, just a clarification on that point. Your longer term guide for the xScale of 1% to 2%, 3% to 5% for AFFO. Where are we in that process now or in those numbers now? Keith Taylor : Well the revenue is very as you know Tim, and you see it in our disclosures is on a recurring revenue basis is very small because we've sold the, if you will, the space and it's being deployed. I think we're at 385 megawatts. So that's going to get deployed until very, very low recurring, a lot of non-recurring. So that's one. And then when you think about the cost model, all the work that we're doing and the debt that we've consumed and how that appears in the venture, it's not delivering a lot of incremental AFFO yet. Oh sorry AFFO yet. We get AFFO from the non-recurring fees and some of the fit out costs. So it's still on the come which is something that I hope pleases everybody. We see the opportunity in front of us and when this gets to run rate of 700 million plus or wherever we'll ever, wherever we end up with the 2.0 version, it's going to be a much more meaningful line than I think than you would appreciate. And just recognizing today you're not feeling the value yet from it. You get the cash flow from the fee stream, the non-recurring fee stream, but the real value will come in the recurring fee stream and the performance of the joint ventures. Timothy Horan : Sure. And does that start to hit like mid next year do you think? Or when does that really start to hit? Keith Taylor : Yes, we're already. Well, we're realizing a little bit of it, but certainly you're going to see it, you're going to start to see it accelerate through 25 into 26. Timothy Horan : Great. Can you talk about the progression of pricing? Has it gotten better every single quarter as supply has started to kind of dry up? And related to this, how much of future capacity have you presold capacity under development be pre sold? Adaire Fox-Martin: Okay. Certainly in terms of what we're seeing from a pricing perspective, the pricing remains robust right across all theaters of operation, but particularly in the Americas market where we are, as I said earlier, not just demand shaping towards our tier one metros, but our non tier one metros who have capacity available, also demand shaping and landing megawatts into those environments and at premium rate prices. So we continue to see robust pricing, we continue to see the opportunity, particularly in high demand environments, in capacity constrained environments, to support a churn that is positive to us where we are able to take workloads that are no longer required in that environment and replace them with much higher value workloads utilizing the same space and the same power. Sorry, the second part of the question, just remind me? Keith Taylor : Was just on the volume of prebooking 2 assets that have not yet -- right? Adaire Fox-Martin: Yes. Keith Taylor : So let me take the second part of the question, Tim. We don't -- we're not ready to give you that number. But suffice it to say, we've got 57 projects currently underway across many markets in many countries. That all said, part of the reason you're hearing us talk about it today, and we haven't talked a lot about it previously, is unless something was available for sale within 6 months, the team was not allowed to book it. Today, given the environment that we all live in and the supply and demand -- or sort of the supply constraints, we're now, if you will, preselling into future development sites that are certainly under construction today. And then on the joint venture basis, those will be things that will be built out tomorrow. And we're not talking about that. We're just talking about things that are -- assets that are under construction today we're preselling. And to give you an order of magnitude, just in order of magnitude, think of it as roughly 20% of the growth activity in the core business. That's what tells you that -- so what I mean that when you think about it, if we did X on core, think about another 20% to 25% you could add to that or business that we're not yet recording as a booking. Adaire Fox-Martin: Right. That's in our retail business. And of course, in our xScale business, we've preleased at 92%. Timothy Horan : Thanks for all the color guys. Keith Taylor : Thanks, Tim. Chip Newcom : Thank you for joining our Q3 conference call. This concludes the call today. Adaire Fox-Martin: Good-bye. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you again for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",
