My name is Dawn, I will be the operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin. Greg Waybright : Thank you, Dawn. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's first quarter 2014 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is John Lundgren, our Chairman and CEO, Jim Loree, our President and COO, Don Allan, our Senior Vice President and CFO, and Jeff Ansell, our Senior Vice President and Group Executive Construction and DIY. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website, as well is on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 :00 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, John, Jim, Don and Jeff will review Stanley's first quarter 2014 results and various other matters followed by a Q&A section. Because of the size of the queue, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. As we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such, may involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release in our in most recent 34 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren. John Lundgren : Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. As Greg mentioned, this morning, in addition to Don Allan and Jim Loree, we have Jeff Ansell, an additional colleague with us this morning. And as most of you know, Jeff runs our CDIY business. I will stay at a high level in my introductory comments and let Jeff dive a little deeper into CDIY, an outstanding quarter in CDIY, and Jim will give you a lot more granularity on both the industrial and the security segments before we open it up to Q&A. Revenues up 7%, 4% of that was organic, and Infastech accounted for the majority of the difference between organic growth and total sales. Our internal growth investments, Project Leapfrog, contributed almost 200 basis points to our growth in the first quarter. That program is really gaining some traction. Margins expanded 30 basis points to 12.1%. We had a lot of focus on cost because during the quarter, we absorbed about $25 million of negative currency pressure. But the fact that we did a really good job controlling costs in general and indirect costs in particular, we achieved some volume leverage. And as Don explained on our January call, of that $25 million, about one-third is translational and two-thirds is transactional. EPS was $1.07, $1.05 on a GAAP basis, and I think what will be good news to many of you, you'll see the convergence between GAAP and adjusted earnings as there were minimal special charges recorded in the first quarter, and it will be the same for the rest of this year. CDIY industrial both posted compelling top and bottom line results. Jeff is going to give you more on CDIY, so I will just note that organic growth was 6% and every geographic region on the globe expanded. Industrial delivered 5% organic growth and 15.6% margins. That's a 170 basis point improvement versus first quarter 2013. Looking at security, it is tracking to plan aside from the weather impact in North America, and security Europe is gaining some traction. It's not yet manifested in the financial performance. As suggested, Jim is going to give you a lot more detail where we are, where we are going with this business. We've got a lot going on, and in we think it's on the right track. But as a consequence, we're increasing the low-end of our guidance in 2014, and we are going to reiterate our cash flow performance. We are saying \u2013 taking the low-end up to $5.35 to $5.50. There's been a lot of volatility, a lot of uncertainty there that Don will talk about, and we are reaffirming $675 million in free cash flow. That's including the $250 million from a cash perspective of one-time payments. So, solid top and bottom line performance led by our CDIY and industrial tools businesses. Looking very quickly at the sources of growth, the top line momentum continues and as I suggested, our organic growth investments are starting to gain traction. Volume was up 4%. Price was flat, leading to organic growth of 4% for the quarter. Acquisitions accounted for another 4%, and currency was a 1% headwind for a total of 7%. On the acquisition front, we get more on the segments, but if you look at organic growth, the majority of our businesses grew 5% to 6% organically, and security, which represents about 20% of the business, was flat to slightly down. Jim will give you some more granularity. On acquisitions, that's primarily Infastech, which closed in February 2013. That's going really well, adding a tremendous value, both strategically and economically, to our engineering fastening business. But that will anniversary in the first quarter and will become core going forward. Very quickly at the regions, you've got more granularity in the appendix. The US was up 2%. Strong organic growth in most businesses. We did have some weather impact that affected parts of our security business, and to a lesser extent, CDIY and industrial. Europe a strong 4% with a tremendous performance in CDIY across the European region. The emerging markets were up 5%, with Asia somewhat stronger than Latin America as we continue to face both the economic, political and currency headwinds in Latin America. Finally, the rest of the world, while it's a small percentage of the business, was up 8%. There's a lot going on there. Japan, which only counts for 2% of our business, was stated, probably with some orders pull forward. There's a consumption tax that went into effect in Japan on April 1, so there's probably a little bit of order pull forward there. Canada, which accounts for about 5% of our business, was up 9%. So, good, strong performance in the rest of the world, as well as the emerging markets. Let me turn it over to Jeff Ansell, who is going to dive a little deeper into the terrific first quarter performance that his business does. Jeff Ansell : Thank you, John. Turning to page 6, we will begin with revenues that, you can see the chart depicts revenues increased 6%, or $65 million during the quarter. The three elements of that growth story that give us confidence in the CDIY business going forward are as follows. It marks \u2013 in terms of duration, it marks the fourth consecutive quarter of mid single-digit growth in the business. In terms of pervasive new product development, we had growth in every strategic business unit as innovation led the increased demand from end users. And then finally, the third element of growth was around customer connectivity and market activation that led to pervasive growth across customers, channels and geographies as depicted below with Europe at plus 11%, North America plus 5% and emerging markets plus 7%. So, we had growth in both the largest and emerging markets, driven by new product development, and consecutive sequential growth across four quarters. We feel quite good about the growth story. We did have profit expansion during the quarter as volume gains and intensive cost management offset severe currency pressure of approximately $20 million in the quarter. In total, to sum up page 6, growth of 6% organically with all regions and strategic business units delivering that growth, combined with profitability and cost focus that enabled an offset of sizable currency headwinds that masked very solid operating leverage in the quarter. Turning to page 7 to give you greater depth surrounding the sources of growth that enabled market share gain globally. We will start in the upper left portion of the chart in Europe. In the quarter, we had a great deal of success as it relates to innovation. Innovation drove growth in every strategic business unit across Europe. With this new product development tailwind, we were able to expand our retail partnerships to drive mutually beneficial growth for our growth, deliver growth for our customers and vice versa. Not only did we deliver growth in Europe, but we delivered growth in every European market as well as every European country in the quarter. This marks, as the chart shows, the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in Europe. And while we expect positive growth in each of the quarters going forward in Europe, there will be pressure based on the comps that you see from that chart. We will expect positive growth in each of the quarters going forward, albeit potentially a lower growth percentage with that comp pressure. Turning to the upper right quadrant of the chart, our Built in the USA initiative that launched in November of 2013, this initiative leverages our unique and pervasive US manufacturing footprint that we are convinced is a competitive advantage. It is over 300 products in totality across various SBUs, and it focuses on a variety of brands including DeWalt, Stanley, Porter Cable and Bostitch. Our Built in the USA growth rates were accretive to the accelerated growth rates you saw on the previous page, meaning that it's delivering growth even beyond the core business. We'll probably give you the most confidence in the pictures that you see just below the words, retail registration in the boxes, industrial construction channel, as well as even trade unions. This initiative has gotten great support in inertia. Moving to the bottom left quadrant of the chart in the emerging markets, where we've added 300 plus feet on the Street in terms of commercial resource. Over 1,500 distributors now selling our product across the emerging markets. We've set up dedicated emerging markets power tool and hand tool strategic business units. We have mid price point product developments that was accelerated by our strategic GQ power tool acquisition. And perhaps the best way to depict what's going on in the emerging markets would be this. In over less than a 24 month period, we've gone from concept from the people in this room to global \u2013 to a structure, to a global supply chain with over 1,000 new products flowing through it to end users in markets all over the globe. I believe it's some of our best work to date. And then finally, bottom right quadrant of the chart depicts new product development across the strategic business units. Two things to note. First rule of businesses is, keep what belongs to you or what you have. Second rule of businesses is, if you want to be a growth company, take what belongs to someone else, and I think this chart depicts appropriately both of those things. If you look at the advances we've made in core products like going from brush to brushless cordless drills or auto locking tape rules, those things have held our core business in place and grown that core where we've also now expanded in terms of innovation into new products like cordless nailing and cordless grease gun, et cetera. Products that are highly incremental because they expand markets that we serve. The combination of all those things led to what we thought was a very positive growth performance inside the quarter. Turn it over to Jim. Jim Loree : Thank you, Jeff. That is an impressive performance, considering the $20 million, or 170 basis points of FX headwind operating margin rate. With Europe up 11% organically, it's quite a statement about the momentum of the business. As you can appreciate from the CDIY story, the Stanley Black and Decker merger which created the world's largest tool company with its array of powerful brands, its strength in power and hand tools, its global scale and its robust, organic growth culture has created strategic benefits which go beyond the $500 million plus cost synergies and the $300 million plus revenue synergies already realized. What we have created and what Jeff and his team have managed very well, is a strategically advantaged franchise which has the capability to continue to expand margins while growing at healthy organic rates and gaining share. Now, moving to industrial. First quarter was another standout quarter for industrial with all three of the major businesses clicking on all cylinders and performing at a high level. Industrial OM was up $30 million, or 29% on 16% revenue growth with 170 basis points of operating margin rate expansion to 15.6%. Infastech contributed $14 million of the $30 million OM increase, and the remaining $16 million was organic and operational. What makes this performance even more compelling was that the operating leverage was delivered in the face of an approximate 70 basis point currency headwinds to the OM rate. Total industrial organic growth was 5%, acquisitions, in this case Infastech added 12 points and currency was a 1 point offset to sales. Industrial and automotive repair, or IAR, was up 5% organically, while engineered fastening and infrastructure each delivered 6% organic growth. This healthy growth facilitated the operating leverage which was complemented by strong productivity and tight cost controls. Now, turning to IAR specifically. Organic growth was achieved across the globe with Europe and North America both up 6% and emerging markets up 7%. IAR's results were boosted by the company-wide growth initiative, in this case, smart tools and storage and emerging markets. Mac Tools, Proto and Facom all turned in strong performances. Engineered fastening's organic growth was driven by legacy [Emhart] automotive business, which was up 11%. Outpacing global light vehicle production by a factor of 1.6 X, reflecting continued execution of their business model which involves development of new applications, recurring revenue, and increased per vehicle penetration. In addition, the Infastech integration is going very well, with all key results on track including sales, synergies and operating margin. Within infrastructure, oil and gas delivered 11% organic growth on top of a 9% growth comp the year ago. As both onshore and offshore continue to perform well in the market and the market continued to be robust. I do remind you, however, that oil and gas faces very challenging organic growth comps for the remainder of the year as the remaining quarterly comps range between 32% and 43% organic growth. At the same time, onshore pipeline project activity is facing a lull in this period as pipeliners gear up for what is expected to be a record 2015. In summary, we were very pleased with the performance in industrial during the quarter, and we continue to be bullish on this segment in total for the remainder of the year. And now we move on to security. This segment, which continues to be a work in progress, experienced a 3% revenue decline in the quarter with the 4% organic decline. Segment OM decreased $12 million to $52 million and the OM rate decreased 170 basis points to 9.1%. Once again, it was a markedly different story in North America versus that in Europe. North America, along with our small emerging markets unit, were down 1% organically taken together, and we believe US weather conditions exerted a modest downward pressure on that number. Encouragingly, the OM rate improved 40 basis points to 14.7%, and absolute OM dollars were essentially flat with 1Q 2013. Note that this is the first quarter since 4Q 2012 that both America and emerging markets OM quarter over quarter did not decreased significantly. We see this as an inflection point and expect the reversion to positive OM dollar accretion to begin in second quarter and continue as the year progresses. Importantly, we also expect this group to contribute positively to the Company's organic growth in 2014, especially in the second half. As the vertical market initiative is bearing fruit with the annualized order rate now running at $120 million, up from almost zero a year ago with the successes mounting, especially in retail and healthcare. So, stay tuned for more gains as we continue on through the year. The story as it relates to Europe security is one of significant progress under the covers, which has not yet manifested itself in the P&L. I will touch upon the specifics in a moment, but first, here are the numbers for 1Q. Organic sales were down 7% and OM was 1% versus 5.9% a year ago, representing a $12 million unfavorable OM headwind, which was steeper than expected. With that said, RMR attrition rate improved dramatically versus a year ago with a 340 basis points decrease, and this is a direct result of the intensive efforts we have made to implement basic attrition reduction processes in the various countries. In addition, order rates continued on a positive trend with a 5% increase in the quarter on the heels of an 11% increase in 4Q. And clearly, the issue in the quarter was mobilizing the field to efficiently install the growing backlog. This is the same issue that we successfully addressed in North America in the back half of last year, and we are well into the process of implementing very similar fixes now in Europe. In fact, the turnaround efforts for electronic security on both continents have followed or are following a very similar pattern. It starts with leadership upgrades, which in Europe have been extensive, but basically complete by last December. There has also been significant progress in creating a sales force in Europe comprised of hunters as opposed to individuals taking referrals from Securitas, their commercial partner in the pre-Stanley ownership era. The construction of the new sales force has been ongoing for about 18 months now and is well along, as you can see from the order rates. The next step is to stem the RMR attrition down from 18% zone to closer to 10% to 12%. This is also well underway, as I referenced, and we were able to see the results in the year-over-year improvements. We expect this initiative, which consists of both procedures which respond to customers requesting termination, as well as proactive processes involving customer care and contact throughout their lifecycle. That also involves emphasizing RMR origination and growth through tweaking the go-to-market approach in areas such as sales force focus, sales incentive plans and marketing and sales communication. Now, step four, which has been the most intensive focus area over the last 90 days, involves optimizing field operations, which means maximizing installation and service revenue, while doing it with the most efficient mix of labor, material and overhead content. The European team has made great strides during this period in producing key weekly metrics which enable vastly improved visibility to branch level activities, thus enabling management at various levels to hold the field organization accountable and monitor performance sufficiently to serve as both a management tool and a forecasting tool. So, in summary, we have an informed perspective on where we are the turnaround process in Europe, and we are managing it as closely and aggressively as possible. While it is slower than we would like, we have a high level of confidence that we are moving the needle and that the results will be evident in the P&L in coming quarters. What we now expect for Europe security for the second quarter is a significant improvement in the $12 million year-over-year OM decrease experienced in 1Q. We then expect Europe to shift to a positive contribution in either 3Q or 4Q. This trajectory would have total segment OM dollars flatish to nominally down in second quarter and then rebounding to OM dollar accretive in the second half. To simplify the guidance for the Company and adopt a prudent and conservative stance, we have zeroed out any increase in OM dollar contribution for security during the second half. This should be viewed simply as a timing hedge and not as a lack of confidence or conviction that a turnaround is underway. Don Allan will add more color on the guidance in just a few moments, and with that, I will now turn it over to him. Don Allan : Thank you, Jim. Before I jump to guidance, I'd like to spend a little time and talk about our first quarter free cash flow performance. The free cash flow was consistent relatively with prior year, and we believe we are on track to deliver our $675 million of free cash flow, which is, as John mentioned, inclusive of $250 million of one-time payments that are primarily related to restructuring charges that we took in the fourth quarter of 2013. So, a few items of note as we look at the free cash flow statement. First of all, our net income. You can see net income is up significantly year-over-year, and that's really where you see the impact of that convergence of GAAP versus adjusted EPS. In the first quarter of 2013, we had one-time special charges of $81 million after tax, and here in the first quarter of 2014, that number was about $2.5 million. A significant decline in the charges to our P&L, as expected, and that convergence has begun and is moving in a very positive direction as we head through the rest of the year. Working capital was a little bit worse than it was in the prior year, as you can see, as our working capital turns. From the seasonality perspective, always goes backwards from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. If you look at 2013, our working capital turns at the end of 2012 were about 7.5, and they went to 5.8 turns by the end of the first quarter of 2013. This quarter we had a similar phenomenon, but a little bit more significant as we built some inventory in our CDIY business to make sure that we are adequately prepared for some Q2 and Q3 demands for our specific customers in certain regions. As a result, our working capital turns at the end of 2013 were 8.0 turns and at the end of the first quarter this year at 5.9. So, a little more significant of a retraction in that sequential momentum, as I discussed, primarily due to the seasonality for the CDIY business. But we still believe that we will exceed 8 working capital turns by the end of this year, and we are on track with our plans to make sure that occurs. The other line has an unusual item in the last year, actually, in 2013 where we had a settlement or an outflow related to the sale of HHI that affected the cash flow statement which is one-time in nature that obviously didn't repeat again here in 2014. So, you see a $45 million benefit when you compare the two numbers year-over-year. Then a positive as well in CapEx, whereas many of you know we made some significant investments in 2013 related to corporate growth initiatives but also related to certain integrations of acquisitions, and our CapEx levels were at a higher rate as a percentage of revenue. In 2013, that was 3.1% of revenue, and for a full year in 2013, it was 3.5%. This year in the first quarter, it was 2.2%, right in line with our expectation and our full-year estimate of 2.5%. So, we are very pleased at the level of CapEx that we experienced here in the first quarter. Overall, on track with our expectations. Let's move to guidance. As John mentioned, we are increasing the low end of our EPS range. Previous guidance was $5.30 up to $5.50. Is now $5.35 to $5.50, and we are also, as I just mentioned, reiterating our free cash flow guidance. On a GAAP basis for EPS, we still have $25 million of expected one-time charges that will rate to ongoing acquisition integration that will occur this year. So, no change in that particular area. What is the change in guidance? There's really two things that are driving it. The first is what Jim just mentioned about security margin and the expectation for dollars and rate. We now expect it to be relatively flat versus the prior year on a full-year basis versus the expectation of 150 basis point improvement we discussed in January. And Jim walked through it in a fair amount of detail what the drivers of that particular item are. On the positive side, or what we would like to call a tailwind going related to some of our other businesses, more than offsetting the security situation, is a stronger performance in our industrial business is now expected, both on a volume basis and a profitability basis for the remainder of the year. And then we've also seen through many of the efforts around reducing our indirect cost across the Company, we saw significant benefit in the first quarter, and we would expect that trend to continue in various areas across the Company through the remainder of the year. That is more than offsetting the negative impact of adjusting the security margins, as I just discussed, and as a result, we are increasing the low end of our guidance range. A few other items just to mention around guidance, as we look at the remainder of the year, just the staging of the quarters, over the last two years, 2012 and 2013, the first half is represented at approximately 45% of the full-year earnings, and we believe 2014 will be very similar. So, our first half of 2014 will approximate that 45%. Another item to note is that in the second quarter, we had a significant organic growth performance last year, which will result in a little bit of pressure on the comp and therefore, our organic growth will be slightly lower in the second quarter versus our full-year expectations of 4%. Moving to the segments on the right side of the page, CDIY is relatively consistent with our January expectation. They had a solid performance in Q1, as you heard from Jeff. And we would expect the trends to continue as we go through the remainder of the year, mid single-digit organic growth rate and revenue and then the margin rate showing an increase year-over-year as expected. The industrial business is going to be stronger, as I indicated. We expect now the organic revenue growth to be a little bit stronger than previously indicated back in January, and then the operating margin rate will expand a little bit more versus previous expectations as well. We've seen a really nice impact to the volume leverage as we've grown the business on the top line flowing through to the operating margin, as well as some really strong efforts around indirect cost reductions, as well as other people reductions that were in place in January of 2014. This is more than offsetting any pressure that we are seeing FX in the industrial segment. And then security, Jim walked through in a fair amount of detail what the staging would be for the remainder of the year. But when you look at the organic revenue for the whole segment for the full year, we actually expect it to be either flat to a modest decrease, which is slightly lower than expectation back in January. Then I walked through the margin rate expectation a few minutes ago of a relatively flat performance. Again, we do believe that we will see improvement in the second quarter versus the first quarter on a year-over-year comparison of operating margin. And then as we get into the back half of the year, we will begin to see some incremental OM growth in the security segment. With that, I'd like to summarize the presentation portion of the call this morning. We delivered a very strong first quarter performance despite some North American weather issues and a very significant foreign exchange headwind, as you heard from us this morning. CDIY industrial delivered excellent results. Tight cost control focuses across our entire Company and embedded within our organization and allowed us to have some modest operating leverage here in the first quarter, even given $25 million of FX headwinds. We remain very optimistic about our security recovery. However, Europe will be a little slower than expected, as Jim mentioned. We are very focused on our ability to continue to improve this business and move it forward and begin to see year-over-year profitability improvement in the back half of 2014. As mentioned before, the focus for 2014 is to improve our near-term returns and our relative performance, and we believe we are doing many things to ensure that that happens. We're focused on our organic growth initiatives, which we saw the positive impact of that in the first quarter of about 2 points and our total organic growth of 4%. Our full-year expectation for organic growth is approximately 4% as well with the organic growth initiative contributing about half of that. The security margin improvement is obviously a big focus, and Jim walked through a fair amount of detail on what we are trying to achieve in that particular area. We've been focused on surgical cost reductions to ensure our operating leverage, and you can see that starting to emerge here in the first quarter. And obviously, that strong focus above and beyond the headcount actions we took on indirect cost is really helping us achieve those objectives. Working capital continues to be an area that we would drive improvement year-over-year. We do see the effects of the seasonality here in the first quarter. But again, we expect our working capital turns to be in excess of 8 by the end of the year. And then certainly last but not least, our focus on capital allocation was rebalanced, as we mentioned back at the end of 2013. We are continuing our acquisition moratorium. We are prepared to do share repurchase when certain cash flows are available to do that and at the same time, we are deleveraging a little bit here in 2014. We believe that 2014 is very much focused on executing both our operating and capital allocation actions I just mentioned, but at the same time, it's positioning our Company to deliver on our long-term financial objectives. With that, we will move to Q&A. Greg Waybright : Thanks, Don. Dawn, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) We have Nigel Cole online for Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Nice quarter, guys. I've got two questions. Firstly to Jim, you mentioned \u2013 you highlighted the backlog trends in Europe, which are obviously very encouraging and then some of the challenges of converting that backlog, given the field office situation. Can you maybe talk about some of the challenges of converting that backlog and secondly, can you talk about the pricing that you are seeing and maybe the tight margins in that backlog? Thanks. Jeff Ansell : Sure. Let me take the \u2013 we will call that a question and I have, or a subquestion, so we can answer both. But we are pretty confident in the profitability of the backlog, to your second question, because we have good visibility now into it. We know what the margin rates are in the backlog. That's something we couldn't have told you six months ago. There's been a lot of progress in that regard. Now, there's still the issue of executing in accordance with what you think the margins are in the backlog, and we are getting a lot closer on that. I would say year ago we were probably averaging 4 to 5 points off, and we're much closer, within 2 points at this point in time, and we're continuing to converge that to try to be exactly on where we think we should be as it relates to what the margin log is in the backlog. That goes to the primary question, which is some of the challenges that we face with respect to converting the backlog and how we're dealing with them. So, the way to think about this is that if we go back even just six months ago, what we had was 14 countries with about, roughly 70 regions within the countries and then a whole host of branches under them. Each one run autonomously with disparate information systems and really, no significant management process that was inherited with the Niscaya acquisition. Even as \u2013 so when questions were asked of management in the countries, or even in their regions, about what the state of the backlog was or how installations were going and what the efficiency was of what they were doing, there really was no accurate information. It was all hearsay and that type of thing. It was very loosey-goosey, and therefore lies some of the issue with respect to forecasting this business, historically. What we've done is in the last 90 days to 120 days, we have implemented a very, very rigorous set of metrics at the branch level that are now produced on a weekly basis, and we have set very specific targets for these metrics, and we expect the branch folks to deliver them. These metrics can then be rolled up at the region level within the country, the country level and the total Europe level so we can see exactly what's going on with respect to things like labor efficiency, like net realized margins, which is what I was talking about in the beginning, and attachment rate for RMR, and so on. It is a dramatic change in the efficacy of what we're trying to do here, and its very similar to what we did in the North American business in the second half. The challenge now lies in, not so much in getting the information in putting the management process in, it now lies in making sure that the people that are actually held accountable are able to execute, and that's where the level of uncertainty lies now. It is not necessarily in the profitability level in the backlog, because I think we have good visibility to that. It is much more in, okay, we've got hundreds of people in these branches that are expected to perform at a certain level, and are they really going to perform at that level, and how many of them are we going to have to replace? We could be far more specific about exactly what was going to happen in Europe with respect to margins if we knew that we had the right people in place in the branches. But this is the last shoe that we need to deal with, and I suspect there will be some attrition and so forth as we go through this process, but we are already making much more headway with respect to visibility, with respect to just the metrics in general and our ability to forecast the business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Richard Kwas : Hi. Good morning, everyone. I will have two questions, I'll make them brief. On security, I know \u2013 I realize the approach here with derisking the full year in terms of margin expansion. But when we think about the next 12 to 18 months, should be see \u2013 is the simply a push out? Or do you see potential greater magnitude of margin improvement in 2015 versus 2014, given the delay in the margin improvement this year? And then second question, Don, are these costs, in terms of you being surgical and being watching costs carefully, does any of that come back into the business later this year in 2015? Thanks. Don Allan : On your first question, I think when we look at the security business, we still see long term, as a business, that can be mid teens profitability. We've communicated that before. The reality is that we do see a shift related to the European business by a quarter or two, as far as timing. Jim touched on it, it was more a timing issue. I wouldn't necessarily expect that there would be a dramatic pop in profitability in 2015. I would expect that we continue to see sequential improvement and growth year over year in profitability in 2015. But I do believe, as Jim mentioned, there's a lot of things that we continue to be focused on in our European business, and these things will take time to continue to address. But overall, the profitability will continue to improve. But I would expect it to be more a gradual, linear type of improvement over the next two years. On the indirect costs, when I look at that, that is really an effort of focusing on two things. One, volume of \u2013 or usage, if you want to call it, it the sense of how often do people travel, when do they travel, are they being efficient about it, use of office supplies, et cetera. All these different things that are tied to professional individuals in the Company, that we've actually asked people to be more focused on the use of them and be more efficient and effective. And at the same time there's the pricing aspect of really driving more pricing benefit based on our contracts with certain vendors. Due to that, I actually believe these are permanent changes that will stay in our P&L and they will not be something that pops back and affects us at some either later quarter or later year. We're trying to attack this in a way that is driving permanent change and therefore, driving operating leverage and we are starting to see in our P&L. John Lundgren : Rich, let me just \u2013 this is John. Let me just follow up. We won't waste your spend time with some of the anecdotes. But to support what Don's saying, I think it is important to understand these are indirect costs. They're the kinds of things that John is talking about. These are the same conversations we've had with our board as every good board should ask. It's great that you are reducing indirect cost without having restructuring charges. What are we giving up? What aren't we doing? I think it's really important to note the reductions aren't coming as we break SG&A and other indirect costs into seven buckets. They aren't coming into the two or three buckets that have a long-term impact on the business, specifically. We are not cutting R&D, we are not cutting product development, we are not cutting our brand building activities. We are being very careful to ensure that we get the ROI on any of those activities before we add to them. But these are all, quite frankly, in the administrative areas and areas, the cost of doing business that we all recognize, but we think Don and his team and the folks leading this project have done a really good job in differentiating what has an impact on the business on our brands versus what is spending, quote, cost of doing business that we could be doing business at a lower cost. Don Allan : Said another way, we're going after waste, and examples would be like, for instance, these air cards that we have \u2013 we use for hot spots, for Wi-Fi hot spots, historically. Well, you don't really need an air card anymore, because we have iPhones, and if you desperately need to get onto the Wi-Fi, you can use that. So, we have hundreds of air cards that we canceled, and we've canceled a lot of data services in areas where we \u2013 where people had access to Wi-Fi. No need for that. As we go through each element of spending, there are just enormous opportunities to slash waste out of the system without affecting the ability of the individual to perform, and that's really the focus of this effort. John Lundgren : Which is really a natural evolution when you have a large merger such as we had with Stanley and Black & Decker and a few other large acquisitions on top of that. You put organizations together, people together, that settles down, they begin to work together. And then you focus on all the different types of costs that we are right now, which is really enforcing policy, changing policy and driving price. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please, go ahead. Will Wong : Hi, thanks. It's actually Will Wong on for Mike. Regarding emerging markets, you guys had about a 5% growth there this quarter. Just wondering how it stacked up relative to your expectations? And just more broadly, relative to the organic growth initiatives, emerging markets being the biggest driver of that [$50 million] of revenue growth the next couple of years. Just wondering, of those five pieces, how each is progressing to date and also relative to your expectations? John Lundgren : Yes, this is John. I will take it. You may or may not have been on the call during the source of growth discussion, and Jim can provide a little more granularity. We are about on track for emerging markets. Our growth is flat relative to the fourth quarter. But there are, as you'd suggested, a tremendous amount of moving pieces. 85%, or 80% of our emerging market volume is either in Latin America or Asia. Latin America, we continue to the face political, socioeconomic and currency headwinds, and it varies dramatically by country. Tremendous currency headwinds in Brazil, inability to ship in Venezuela and Argentina for different reasons. And as a consequence, Latin America grew low single-digits. That was below our expectations, but we absolutely believe, due to circumstances well beyond our control, on the other side, Asia continued to do well. We tempered our expectations for Asia, as China is an example, the GDP in the 7% range versus low double-digits as it's been in the past. But we kept up or exceeded market growth in those particular areas. A tremendous amount of the organic growth initiative to which you referred is taking place in emerging markets, as Jeff pointed out in his presentation. We've got about 300 additional feet on the street, salespeople, commercial people, focusing on those markets. And we think that's a great investment in that those people are not as expensive as a salesperson in Europe or in the US, yet the revenue that each of them generates has the ability to be as great. So, we think of that as very high return on our business. All-in, a tremendous \u2013 a lot of moving pieces within emerging markets, but in general, at the end of the day, consistent with our expectations, given the tremendous headwinds we faced. And I just \u2013 Jim will do it if I didn't, give a shout out to our emerging markets team. If you think about the currency headwinds they faced, the political issues they faced in Argentina and Venezuela, as well as just softening markets in Asia or less robust markets, I should say, they did a terrific job delivering on their commitments to us and our commitments to the external world. This is a very experienced, capable team with highly capable, local executives in each and every market coordinating really well between our industrial and our CDIY businesses to ensure that we are getting our products to the markets, to the end users, to the customers, irrespective of the channel of distribution, which is much more grey, much less black-and-white than it is and developed markets. So, all-in, a long answer to a simple question, but there are a lot of moving pieces, and we are quite pleased with how well that team performed. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Saliq Khan from Imperial Capital. Please, go ahead. Saliq Khan : Hi. Good morning. I'm speaking on behalf of Jeff Kessler. I had a two-part question for you. The first one is from a RMR standpoint. What type of trends are you seeing from North America? And from a broader perspective, as we look at the dichotomy between the types of success that you're seeing in North America versus Europe, versus the rest of the world, do you see a shift in the focus on the regional level breakdown from a long-term perspective? Jim Loree : Sure. Yes, we will see a shift, because I would say we are far more capable in North America of delivering what I will call monitoring RMR versus service RMR, which has a higher gross margin and therefore, a higher operating margin. We \u2013 as it relates to the portfolios, we had a slight increase in North America during the quarter. We had just a very, very slight decrease in Europe. It was actually very encouraging to see the stability of the RMR portfolio in Europe in the first quarter. But the RMR portfolio in Europe tends to be more service-based than it is monitoring. The challenge for us strategically here, because we do have the monitoring capacity in Europe, is to drive RMR monitoring sales increases. I alluded to in my comments, a few things that we are doing to be more proactive about driving RMR sales in Europe by changing the comp plans, which has been done, by focusing the sales force more on that, by focusing on RMR attachment in our metrics when we look at the sales and orders. All that stuff over the long term will help us shift the mix from the service RMR, which is good. It's better than installation, but it's far from the profitability level of the monitoring RMR. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Dahl from Credit Suisse. Please, go ahead. Michael Dahl : Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask about the CDIY business, particularly, with Jeff here today. First on the PPT growth was pretty impressive and well in excess of the other SBUs. Can you talk specifically what you think was driving that? Was it outsized product launches in DeWalt or anything there? Then, just second, a quick clarification on the inventory comment. It sounds like that was unintentional build, and so just wondering if that was related to a specific promotion or product launch? Jeff Ansell : Yes. Michael, this is Jeff. To respond to the question, the PPT growth led all four of the SBUs for the fourth consecutive quarter. We continue to grow that business concurrent with the rest of the business but at accretive levels. And really, the driving force behind that is two things. Protecting the core business with things like innovations within brushless, cordless, et cetera. Things that are driving higher average tickets within our core and then augmenting that with the expansion products that fall into adjacencies that are predominantly incremental. Things like cordless nailing, cordless grease guns, heated jackets, things that we hadn't done historically that provide us new revenue opportunities to serve the same end use customer channel. That's really why that has \u2013 that business has performed at an accretive level, and new product development is clearly the driving force there and will be for the foreseeable future. I spend a high percentage of my time working on the pipeline of new product development with the teams, and if you could see my now, I'm smiling quite robustly. It looks quite good. In terms of inventories, we have intentionally put inventory into the system for two reasons. One is, even with headwinds of weather that existed in the first quarter, we had positive POS. We are not exactly certain what happens from a global perspective as the US thaws and other things continue to advance. The thing we are not going to do is starve our growth. We have the opportunity over three quarters to work through that inventory and if, in fact, there is more demand, we want to be able to serve it. It's not atypical. We do this typically in every first quarter. We've done it at an accelerated level because our growth is also going to accelerate. John Lundgren : This is John. I will just add, because you won't get a follow-up, Jeff and his team have a 10-year track record, that's my history. Jeff's is a little longer than mine, of doing exactly what Jeff said. SFS was, if you will, born and embedded in the CDIY business. Jeff and his head of operations, there's no one in this Company that understands the benefits, both in terms of cash flow and productivity to high working capital turns, getting the \u2013 having supply and demand match, rigorous S&OP process. Of things that I worry about, and there are many, CDIY getting \u2013 making sure inventory is in line as the year progresses and driving the continuously improved working capital turns for which they've got an incredible track record, I've got a high degree of confidence that that will continue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Wood from Macquarie. Please, go ahead. Mike Wood : Thank you. Good job with the 31% ex-currency incrementals in CDIY. I'm curious if you can comment if you think you could sustain that level, or if the quarter had the distortions from, say, better efficiency from that inventory build that you just talked about or any delayed promotions around the timing of the spring selling season. Thank you. John Lundgren : First of all, when we do inventory builds in the first quarter, or any quarter, for that matter, you don't really get the benefit in your P&L until you sell the product to your customers. Because the way the accounting works, you have to basically \u2013 any positive variance, or any variance related to that, gets put on your balance sheet, and then it will flow through as your cost of sales when you sell to your customers. There is certainly no impact in the first quarter related to that aspect of it. As far as the FX impact, we did mention there was a $20 million impact to CDIY, which obviously prevented us seeing operating leverage. But when you excluded the impact, you did have that operating leverage. As time goes on here, assuming there's no change in currency rates, the number's going to get a little smaller, just a little bit smaller in the second quarter, but it will still be significant. And in the back half, there will be a still a little bit of negative FX pressure, but it will be at a much smaller pace. And then you will really start to see the operating leverage flow through at that point in time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Wendy Clark of UBS. Please go ahead. Wendy Clark : Good morning. Can you talk about how business trended in your North Americas security business over the course of the quarter? And did business improve meaningfully in March following weather headwinds earlier in the quarter? And then you also continue to see good momentum from your security vertical initiatives. Curious if you are seeing any competitive response at this point. John Lundgren : Okay, so yes, we did see positive development throughout the quarter. January and February weather were \u2013 we had branch closings that really exceeded any days of branch closings that anybody here \u2013 since we can remember since we've owned securities, which is about 10 years, over 10 years. So, it was really rough from that perspective. I don't want to overstate the impact, it could've been 1 point of revenue or something like that, that \u2013 maybe 2 at most that is derived from that. However, there was definitely a positive trend, as the quarter went on. The vertical initiatives in healthcare and in education and retail, I'd say are the ones we're making the most progress on, especially retail and healthcare. The wins really, I think are just beginning to get our competitors' attention. Most of what we are doing in those areas, we're doing with proprietary differentiated technology, which is really going to be difficult in the very, very short term to compete against in the types of bake offs that we are having. But we expect competitor response at some point, that would be natural and normal. It will be the ones, the bigger companies that can muster a competitive response with technological solutions. I think we all know who those are. We have some that \u2013 we have a very big one and we have several that are more vertical focused. You have one that competes heavily in financial services, one that competes heavily in retail, and they are all doing their own thing. But we haven't seen anything directly related to our activities yet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please, go ahead. Jeff Sprague : I just wanted to come back around to cash flow. Jeff addressed what he's doing on working capital and inventory in his business. But where are the leverage points for the year? What I'm thinking about, is there any scope to reduce the $250 million as you execute through the year? Working capital in the emerging markets as you work that, opportunities on payables. Wondering if the bias to your cash flow this year is potentially to the upside or the downside? Thank you. Don Allan : I will take that question. I feel really good about where we are with the $675 million. I do think that, like every year, we start out with a large, as I mentioned, working capital negative. The vast majority of that is planned and has been the case for the last three or four years. And then we have the specific actions that we are taking, not only in inventory, but all the other areas of working capital as we progress throughout the year. Of course, there's a big seasonality impact in the fourth quarter that goes the other way, as we see a lot of the revenue in our CDIY business in the month of October and November. And then it slows dramatically in the month of December, which allows us to really collect a lot of receivables, reduce our inventory levels, et cetera. All those dynamics together really drive our confidence and our ability to exceed 8 working capital turns this particular year. As far as other items on the cash flow, we are controlling CapEx, as I mentioned. We want that to be 2.5% of revenue, which is roughly $300 million for the year. We think we are tracking to that. We don't want to starve the CapEx to the point where we cause issues related to revenue or other areas in our business such as productivity projects and our supply chain. But we think we are at the right level with $300 million. And then the one-time payments of $250 million, I think that's a very reasonable balance estimate at this point. I'm certainly not concerned about it being above that number. With anything, it does have the potential to be slightly below it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Please, go ahead. David MacGregor : Yes. Good morning. Question for Jeff on CDIY. I noted that your pricing was down about 1%, and I'm mindful that this might be a mix driven, just giving everything you are doing in the emerging markets. But I'm just wondering if you could talk about all the innovation that you seem to be delivering to market right now and your ability to price that innovation just given competitive developments. Jeff Ansell : Yes, certainly. The emerging markets platform, 1,000 new products that we outlined, most of which began launching already this year, it does put downward pressure on the absolute price, given that it's MPP versus HPP. That said, we've found a way most recently through \u2013 via the acquisition of GQ and the work we've done in those markets to make sure that we are profitable at those price points. While we serve a different market and different price point, we also continue to be squarely profitable in that. The one thing that I would say also in the quarter is we did have benefits from some promotional activity in the first quarter of this year that we didn't have last year, if you recall. We didn't throw out a lot of products. We did have some promotional activity that helped us deliver 6% growth. That said, clearly inside the P&L, operating leverage excluding the currency headwind. All things played together quite well. We don't see a dynamically or dramatically different pricing environment that we had in the previous quarter or the previous several quarters, I would say. Operator : Our last question comes from Liam Burke from Janney Capital Markets. Please, go ahead. Liam Burke : Thank you. Good morning, John. Good morning, Jim. Jim, you had a fair amount of success or fair amount of history developing the emerging markets in Latin America. As you continue to grow in Asia Pacific, are those markets developing faster or slower or pretty much the same as you experienced in Latin America? Jim Loree : I think when we grew in Latin America, we were in a period when Latin America was on fire, so to speak, in a good way, with positive FX, positive economic growth. Some euphoria in Brazil, lack of government intervention in places that we are getting it now and so forth. What we've seen is in some ways, the Latin American market has either matured in some cases, or in other areas, has gone into a volatility stage that John was referring to earlier. So, not a classic development of the market. I think what we see in Asia is that starting with China, you almost have to take them one at a time. China, as everybody knows, for a long time was in the 9% to 10% growth mode, and the growth in China has slipped to maybe 7%, according to the government, maybe less according to what we see. But we still see strong out performance, double-digit growth in China. And the combination of having the hand tools and the power tools, having the MPP and the HPP, great distributional that we have, now moving to interior China with our distribution channels and so forth. I think all of that enables us to have the same kind of development rate that we had in the halcyon days of the development of the Latin American market. India, we don't have a big presence there, and it's just a big question mark as to where India is going, and a lot depends on the election that's going to occur here shortly. In fact, I would just mention that in the emerging markets in general this year, about 60% of the countries are undergoing electoral processes, which creates near-term instability and uncertainty. But \u2013 so some of these \u2013 the answer to this question is a little bit more medium term I'd say, than long term. Southeast Asia, we see to be a really strong growth area for many years to come. Indonesia, in particular, I think is going to be very, very strong. Thailand, if it could ever get through its political challenges, could be very strong, as well. The Philippines will \u2013 is gaining momentum as we speak. I think we are pretty bullish on Southeast Asia in general. Then, as we move over to some of the other regions like the Middle East, it's always a bit of a crapshoot as to what's going to happen there geopolitically. And then Russia and Turkey, big question marks. I think in general, to sum it up, I'd say we are just seeing a lot of volatility. It's not quite clear where the growth is going to be the strongest in any given point in time, or where it's going to be the weakest. Our approach has been place our bets cautiously and conservatively in the areas that we feel are the best places to be, but don't eliminate presence in other areas, because there, you just don't know. So, that's been the approach, and I think we're going to see excellent growth from the emerging markets for years to come. I think we have a nice, strong, I won't call it a head start because I think some of our other competitors got a head start on us. But we are working on a leapfrog at this point in time strategy. John Lundgren : Liam, the only thing to add to that, I think that's an incredibly good summary of a huge number of geographies with a lot of moving pieces. I believe \u2013 I know you are aware of this, but just to remind you, you mentioned Latin America in general. A lot of the early growth in addition to the environment being incredibly robust, as Jim suggested, were Stanley Black & Decker synergies. If you just take the two big regions, or if you take all the other emerging markets, Asia, Eastern Europe, Middle East, Stanley and Black & Decker has similarly-sized businesses, we were both underdeveloped. The opportunity to grow was there, and we've invested in that, as Jim suggested. Black & Decker had a meaningful business in Latin America, Stanley did not. A tremendous amount of the early growth in Latin America were, quite frankly, what we've categorized as revenue synergies. Selling legacy Stanley products through well-established Black & Decker channels of distribution, even producing hand tools in our formerly Black & Decker plant in New Baraba, that gave us a nice jumpstart to growing in Latin America. Just to add to what Jim said, which is, I think, pretty clear. Operator : Thank you. I will now turn the call back to Greg Waybright for closing remarks. Greg Waybright : Dawn, thank you. We'd like to thank everyone again for phoning in this morning and for your participation, and obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Paulette and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor & Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin. Greg Waybright : Thank you, Paulette. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's second quarter 2014 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is John Lundgren, Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call are available on the IR portion of our website as well as on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 :00 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, John, Jim and Don will review Stanley's second quarter 2014 results and various other matters followed by a Q&A section. Because of the size of the queue, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. And as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release in our in most recent 34 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren. John Lundgren : Thanks, Greg, and thank you, Paulette. Thanks to those of you listening in this morning for our second quarter call. During the second quarter, our organic growth of 1% was negatively impacted by the shortened North American outdoor product season as well as some volatility and slower growth in emerging markets. Each of those two factors was worth about $25 million in revenue or 100 basis points for a total of about 2 percentage points of growth of the combination of those factors. This being said, our sharp cost focus on price realization delivered some healthy growth as well as operating margin expansion despite some significant currency pressure. Currency was about a $20 million headwind in the second quarter, and that was in line with our expectations. And as you'll recall, it's slightly below the $25 million headwinds that we experienced during the first quarter. So about $45 million during the first half of the year thus far. Gross margin expanded 100 basis points versus prior year to 36.5%. And operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 13.7%. Diluted EPS was up 17% versus prior year to $1.43. And as the spread between reported and GAAP earnings narrows, that's $1.37 on a GAAP basis. You're going to hear a lot more about segments in just a few minutes, but just a couple of highlights on the segments. CDIY operating margin expanded to a post-Stanley Black & Decker merger record of 15.7%. Price productivity cost action more than offset currency and the previously mentioned outdoor product headwinds. Our Industrial segment delivered 3% organic growth and a very strong 17% operating margin, which was up 260 basis points versus second quarter '13. Security North America and emerging markets organic growth was 2%, and their 16.5% operating margin was up 310 basis points versus prior year, approaching the historical levels of profitability that that business has demonstrated its ability to achieve. And Security Europe turnaround took a very positive step as operating margin was 240 basis points sequentially. So based on the segment results, the net performance and the programs that we have in place in the second half of '14, some of which you'll hear a little bit more about today, we're going to increase our 2014 EPS guidance range and we are reiterating our cash flow guidance. Specifically, the EPS range of $5.50 to $5.60 ex-charges with at least $675 million of free cash flow, and that's inclusive of $250 million of one-time payments. Turning to our sources of growth, on our first quarter call, we communicated that we expected organic growth and total growth to decelerate modestly in the second quarter, based in part on prior-year organic growth comps of 6% and 9% in CDIY and Industrial respectively. And the addition of adverse impacts of the outdoor product softness and the emerging market volatility resulted in total organic growth of 1%. And there was no incremental growth via acquisitions in the quarter, all of which is depicted in the chart that's projected on the left. In terms of the regions, the US remains healthy, as POS exceeded shipments excluding outdoor across the board. CDIY share gains in Europe as well as solid performance in Industrial was partially offset by Security Europe volume softness. And it was a rocky and volatile road in emerging markets with geopolitical issues in Venezuela, Russia, currency in Brazil, all having impacts. But this being said, we remain quite optimistic based on the strength and efficacy of our mid product price range. Early indications are very good. Jim will talk a little bit more about that in just a minute or so. And in the gray area, you see a shaded portion called emerging market organization. The reason we differentiated that and we've shown the plus-3% in the second quarter versus the 1% is our emerging market organization, this is the area of the group of products and people and markets where we have focused our organic growth initiatives. And specifically, it excludes Engineered Fastening and our hydraulics and CRC infrastructure businesses. So I think it's just worthy of note that where we have focused and targeted the incremental investments to drive organic growth despite the market headwinds, we did achieve 3% in the second quarter. Let me turn it over to Jim who is going to do a deeper dive into some of the segments. Don is going to follow that with some guidance and a look at the cash flow. Jim Loree : Thank you, John. Starting with the CDIY, it was an impressive quarter for margin expansion with the post-merger record of 15.7%. Achieved in the phase of flat organic revenue growth, an outcome which was about 4 points lower than expected organically for CDIY due to the weak outdoor product season and unusually volatile emerging market conditions that John referenced that we were able to absorb these two transitory growth issues in CDIY during the quarter, while handily beating consensus and upgrading our total year estimate is a testament to the underlying earnings power of the company. Even more encouraging, the outlook for CDIY organic growth in second half is strong with the resumption of mid single-digit growth and the operating leverage that goes with it. I will now address the two second quarter CDIY growth governors in a bit more detail. First, outdoor products. Some of you will recall that last year, the outdoor season selling was delayed in 1Q, mostly notably in March, due to cold weather, causing us a CDIY growth issue in the first quarter of 2013. The second quarter 2013 proceeded normally, but the season got off to a late start and in total was relatively soft based on historical norms. Given the easy comp this year, the big four retailers in the aggregate were relatively optimistic in first quarter about the overall season despite the unwelcomed cold weather conditions at the time. Plus orders and selling were both good in 1Q '14 against an easy comp for us. So no issue. However, as the cold weather persisted into second quarter, retailer sentiment regarding the season quickly were pessimistic and replenishments virtually ceased as they attempted to liquidate their high inventories of outdoor product. So instead of an outdoor quarter, which was expected to be up in the high single-digits right around 10%, we ended up with one that was down about 15%, which caused us 2 points of year-over-year growth in CDIY. That is now behind us. The other growth challenge in the quarter, emerging markets was simply one of unusually high volatility in the face of gradually slowing markets. It was a quarter in which Latin America, about half of our emerging markets tool business, grew only 2% with Brazil slightly negative as the World Cup became a huge market distraction and with zero sales in Venezuela once again. The other half of the emerging markets portfolio was impacted by Russia and Turkey, which were down 16% and 30% respectively. China was also quite slow. Normal indications are that the second half will be stronger for both tools emerging markets with our major NPI foray into mid price point power tools and hand tools hitting the market across the geographies as we speak, the Venezuela sales drag anniversarying in September and the outlook for Brazil and China looking modestly better. Now moving to a very bright spot in the second quarter organic performance, Europe. We couldn't be happier with the progress that the CDIY team is making there with organic growth up 7%, representing a five-quarter streak with growth averaging 6% in one of the more tepid economic regions among the developed markets. This represents clear market share gains stemming from both new listings at retailers and distributors as well as a deluge of NPI including great success with the XR brushless cordless product as well as multi-tools and steam products. Our four major product categories, professional power tools, consumer products hand tools and storage and fastening and assembly each averaged 500 new distribution outlets on a year-over-year basis. So as we step back from the CDIY picture, we see a very healthy franchise with world-leading brands, broad and deep global distribution, delivering record margins during a quarter in which organic growth was suppressed by a few unusual items. And as we look forward, we have tremendous NTI momentum in both developed and developing markets and the cost structure that is poised for operating leverage. Turning to Industrial. Industrial this quarter once again hit on all cylinders and demonstrated the kind of operating leverage that is achievable with a few points of organic growth. In this case, 3 points of organic growth and 1 point from acquisition yielded 22% growth in operating margin. The margin rate came in at 17.0%, up 260 basis points versus a year ago, as price, productivity, SG&A control and volume all contributed to the performance. Both Industrial and Automotive Repair or IAR and Engineered Fastening developed strong OM growth, up 22% and 18% respectively. For IAR, organic growth of 2% was a mixed bag across geographies. North America was solid 6% with strong performances from Mac Tools, industrial distribution, engineered storage and Advanced Industrial Solutions. Europe was off 3 points, primarily as a result of timing related to an ERP project. And emerging markets were up 1 point, the latter impacted by the same type of market issues as CDIY. Engineered Fastening was also up 2% organically with automotive up 9%, significantly outpacing global light vehicle production, which was up 2%. The industrial portion of Engineered Fastening was down 2%, with timing of sales to electronics OEMs weighing down a strong performance in industrial distribution. Infrastructure was up 5% organically with oil and gas up 4% and hydraulics up 9%. In total, it was an excellent quarter for the Industrial portfolio and we can expect continued momentum to carry into the second half. Moving to Security, this was a quarter in which the financials began to reflect the underlying progress which has been made in both North America and Europe over the last nine months or so. Revenues were flat with organic growth down 1 point, operating margin up 8% year-over-year recovering to 11.3% and up 80 basis points. North America and emerging markets was up 2% organically with Europe down 6%. North America and emerging markets OM was up 310 basis points versus a year ago, approaching very healthy historical norms at 16.5% of sales, benefiting from volume, better pricing, field efficiency and a tight SG&A framework. In North America, vertical market penetration continued to grow with a series of large exciting wins in retail, financial services and higher education. Europe was characterized by improved stability and predictability as many of the operational and organization fixes discussed over the last few quarters began to produce results. In that regard, Europe performed in accordance with expectations with OM still in the low single-digits, but improving sequentially by 240 basis points and setting the stage for continued improvement in the second half. Over the 14 country P&Ls in Europe, 12 are now considered stable or improving and only two, Spain and Italy, representing 10% of the European portfolio, are still facing significant structural and operational headwinds. On a very positive note, Europe attrition is tracking to a targeted range of 10% to 12%, with that 700 basis points favorable to last year. Our focus in Europe continues to be on tight operational management and cost reduction to drive margin expansion and ultimately organic growth. So while Security is still a work-in-progress, especially in Europe, we are quite confident that we are on the right track and the results will continue to improve as we go forward. With that, I will turn it over to Don Allan for some commentary on the financials. Don Allan : Thank you, Jim. I'd like to spend a little time talking about our cash flow performance this morning. We're very pleased with our second quarter free cash flow of $376 million, as the earnings growth and lower one-time payments resulted in this excellent performance. And you can see as you look at the second quarter versus the prior year in the line other, there's a significant benefit and that's being driven by these lower one-time payments in a significant way. As we've begun to wind down these activities as discussed back in the late part of 2013 and begun to execute that throughout the early stages of 2014 and are very pleased with that result. Moving to the right side of the page, looking at our year-to-date performance, you can see that we still have a very significant working capital negative outflow. That was planned and expected. Our working capital turns are at 6.7 times, right in line with our expectations. We still have plans in place to achieve a goal of somewhere between 8.5 and 9 turns by the end of the year. And we feel very good about those plans and the ability to execute on them in the next six months. Another item of note is our CapEx. As you know, we have been very focused on controlling the level of CapEx, getting ourselves within a band of 2% to 2.5% of our revenue. And through the first six months of the year, we're at 2.15% of revenues. So very pleased with that as well. Looking at free cash flow in total through the first six months, a $166 million. If you look at the history of our company post-merger of Stanley and Black & Decker, the historical trend would say that roughly 24% to 25% of our free cash flow happened in the first half of the year. And just extrapolating that will give an indication that our goal of $675 million is very much achievable. The other thing to factor in those, we are very much focused on controlling CapEx, controlling the one-time payments, and we feel very comfortable with our plans related to working capital, which gives us the confidence that we have the ability to at least achieve $675 million cash flow for this year. Moving to guidance on the next page, I obviously touched on cash flow over the last few years, but let's spend a little bit more time on EPS. As John mentioned, we increased our guidance range for 2014 for EPS to $5.50 up to $5.60 from the previous range of $5.35 to $5.50. On a GAAP basis, the range is up the same amount of factor to $5.38 to $5.48. So the difference between GAAP and adjusted is roughly $0.12, which approximates to $25 million charges that we have anticipated since the beginning of the year. So no change there. What is driving this change in guidance? It's really three factors. The first is that we do expect our organic growth to be a bit lower as emerging markets are experiencing some volatility that Jim walked through in a fair amount of detail. Although things are looking better in the back half of the year, we do expect the full year to be slightly lower versus previous expectations. The outdoor season has been short and obviously that has an impact on the full year as well. So as a result, we believe our organic growth where we originally thought of approximately 4% will be somewhere between 3% and 4%. So a modest decline in organic growth versus prior expectations. More than offsetting this impact, however, is a much stronger performance in our Industrial business and a very strong performance across the entire company related to lower indirect cost as well as pricing benefits. As we continue to focus on really programming the company to be prepared for certain volatility in the topline, which is most likely will occur. And then the last factor that's changing is we will be lowering our tax rate to the bottom part of the range where we gave initial range earlier in the year of 21% to 22%. We expect that to be closer to 21%. However we do expect a little bit of share creep in those two items will neutralize themselves. Two other factors to note really to guidance, I mentioned this factor back in April that if you look at the company most-merger for the last three or four years, our earnings have been split from first half and second half approximately 45% and 55%. When you do the math, you'll see that the new guidance range indicates that that is consistent with these trends. And so we feel comfortable with that expectation as well. And then looking at the second half earning split versus the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we would expect 47% and 53% respectively, as we do some timing issues related to tax, which shows some positive benefits in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And then as we continue to accelerate these indirect cost benefits and pricing benefits, that will have a more positive impact in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And lastly, a little bit of flavor on the segments over to the right, you can see that our CDIY and Industrial segments continue to be consistent. We expect mid single-digit organic growth in both segments. Our margin rate year-over-year improvement as the operating margin rate continues to increase due to some volume leverage, cost actions. And those items are more than offsetting the negative FX that John walked through in a little detail earlier on. In Security, we expect a flat to modest decrease in organic revenue, consistent with prior expectations, and the margin rate to be relatively flat. So no major change with the outlook associated with Security. We feel like we've programmed the company to be prepared for a little bit of volatility associated with some of the economic and market conditions around the world by really focusing on indirect cost and certain pricing actions. And it positions us well to achieve our new guidance range. So to summarize the call this morning, 2014 continues to be focused on executing operating and capital allocation actions. We've delivered a very strong second quarter performance despite some significant weather issues, foreign currency pressures and emerging market volatility. We were able to demonstrate margin expansion across all our segments. We have very tight cost focus across the entire enterprise, which enabled significant operating leverage. We remain optimistic about Security European recovery and we feel like the second quarter was a very positive step forward. We remain focused on our 2014 near-term items, which is really to make sure that we're focused on the returns and relative performance of the company. And we're focused on organic growth initiatives, the continued Security margin improvement, surgical cost actions across the entire company to ensure we continue to achieve operating leverage, not losing sight of our working capital focus and achieving 8.5 to 9 working capital turns by the end of the year, and then of course making sure that we continue to stay on track with our capital allocation rebalance for 2014 and '15 with an acquisition moratorium and then the share repurchase and deleverage as we continue this year and into 2015. All these items, we believe, position us very well to make sure that we deliver our long-term financial objectives. With that, we'll move to Q&A. Greg Waybright : Thank you. Paulette, we can now open the call to Q&A please. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Mike Dahl - Credit Suisse : With respect to the margins, really impressive job on CDIY this quarter, hitting a new record. Was wondering you highlighted a bunch of things, but given that, the mix of geographies and products shifted a bit. Could you quantify how much that also may have helped and how you think about margins longer term in this segment, given how far you've come? Jim Loree : I think one of the great misperceptions about CDIY business or any of our businesses is that as you go across the globe, we have radically different profitability structures. And while the gross margins and the SG&A can be somewhat different as you go from geography to geography, typically the operating margins are very consistent. So the mix of, for instance, the lower emerging markets did not have a dramatic positive impact on the operating margin. The extra-good performance in Europe vis-\u00e0-vis, say, the US with its outdoor issues did not have a significant impact on operating margins from a mix perspective. So really the geographic mix in general is not a big deal in terms of driving the margin rate. What really drove it was a series of things that Don and actually all three of us talked about, which is a really, really tight focus on margin management, starting with gross margins, productivity in the factories through the Stanley fulfillment system, pricing and new product introduction, driving competency in the organization in terms of price management. And then on the cost side in SG&A, as you know, we took several actions in last year that are now carrying over into this year as planned. But on top of that, we have a very sharp focus on indirect cost reduction across the company. We spend over $1 billion a year of cost in this indirect area, which would be the non-people related expenses. And every dollar that today is under a microscope as to whether it's really driving revenue, driving value and whether it can be reduced without hurting anything really to the company's overall growth and profitability. So that's what drove the margin improvement and not some kind of a mix impact. John Lundgren : Let me add one point and it'll just even further amplify what Jim said, because you asked basically about geographic mix, and I think Jim described in quite accurate detail. They're consistent. He didn't talk specifically about product mix. Historically, hand tools and storage have been slightly higher profitability than power tools. This being said, the team has made great progress on power tool margins with some of its design and engineering efforts. And in this particular quarter, you'll note from Jim's deep dive on this segment, power tools was up 2%, while hand tools and storage was flat. So if anything, it's a negative product mix in the quarter, more than offset by the initiatives that Jim just talked about. So there're lot of good things going on within the four walls of our CDIY business. And I think Jim described them quite accurately. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Barclays. Stephen Kim - Barclays: I guess I wanted to follow up here on CDIY. I think you're looking for mid single-digit organic growth as we go forward. Obviously the broader context in things housing related has gotten softer of late, it sounds, both on the remodeling as well as on the new construction side. You called out outdoor, which makes a lot of sense due to the weather. But I was curious if you could provide a little bit more granularity around what your expectations are for things getting stronger. You just mentioned, I think, that hand tools and storage was flat in the quarter. Was kind of wondering whether you think any of that maybe reflects some of the softness I was referring to in the broader housing context, and what international or emerging markets expectations you've got embedded in that mid single-digit CDIY outlook. John Lundgren : The North American POS was 6% in the quarter. It was up sequentially versus the first quarter. So we didn't see any softening in our POS in North America. And we, as we forecast POS on a go-forward basis, continue to see a strong performance in whatever market conditions we happen to be in right now, which don't appear to be slowing from our perspective. And that's partially because as you know we're not directly tied to the housing market. We're indirectly tied to the housing market. In Europe, we continue to see strong performance based on the product introductions that I referenced and the outlets that were increased. So we expect continued mid single-digits there. And in the emerging markets, we were 5% in the first half and we expect to be up at least that much in the back half and potentially more based on a tremendous, as I said in my comments, new product introduction in the mid price point product. That's not to be underestimated, and that is a significant initiative that's been in the works for about a year-and-a-half now, almost two years and the products are literally being sold as we speak. Whatever geopolitical situation that we have as we sit here today, that will drive our performance under those circumstances. So we're quite confident about the mid single-digits in CDIY in the back half. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Wood from Macquarie. Mike Wood - Macquarie: In terms of the European Security business, is any of the resizing of the business there incremental based on the organic growth weakness in Southern Europe? And at this new resized level, can you talk about much longer-term where the structural margin range is for that European conversion Security business? Don Allan : Obviously we talked to the European Security business in the sense of how much sequential improvement it made quarter-over-quarter, very pleased with that. We're not seeing incremental improvement yet versus the prior year. And our expectation is as we go through the remainder of the year and we get closer to the fourth quarter that at that point, we could see some year-over-year improvement in the business performance. Now that's really going to be dependent on a couple of factors. One, we are seeing some difficult performances, Jim mentioned, in Spain and Italy. When you exclude those two countries, you'll most likely see a healthy performance year-over-year in this business excluding those two countries. But those two countries right now are weighing down the business a little bit. Our expectation at this point is that we would expect some incremental improvement even with them by the end of the year, but that could be modest challenge for us. We've factored that into our guidance. So we're not overly concerned about this. But when we look at that business specifically, we do see that as a bit of a challenge. As far as long-term, we still continue to believe that it is a business that can be double-digit profitability over the next few years. And then eventually it can get to mid-teens levels along with the rest of our Security business. And the factor that's really going to drive that second stage evolution is going to be what we've been doing in North America over the last 18 months or so, which has been rolling out the vertical market solutions to key verticals such as retail, financial services, healthcare, et cetera, and bringing those to Europe, because we haven't done that at this stage, because we're kind of in a turnaround recovery mode of that business getting all the basics in place, the operating rhythms, the field organization structure the right way, et cetera, et cetera. And by the end of the year or early next year, we would begin to bring this vertical approach to the European marketplace. And as a result, that will help us move the profitability of the business closer to the mid-teens level over the long-term. John Lundgren : Don reference Spain and Italy without too much cause and effect, but I think you're all quite familiar with what's going on, particularly in the Spanish market, which is a large market for us. Just three things to touch on, first of all, a very intense competitive environment which makes it a difficult market in the first place. Second, not news to anyone, commercial construction is nom-existent in Spain and has been for the last year-and-a-half. And thirdly, with the Niscaya acquisition, we were largely influenced by the financial services verticals, specifically banks. And it's probably not news to anyone that our bank branches in Spain are closing at a very, very, very rapid rate. So we are fishing in a much, much smaller pond in an intense competitive environment two years ago and that's creating some headwinds for that business that Don referenced to. But it's probably appropriate to give you just a little bit of the whys. Don Allan : Yeah, but there's really no cause for major concern, because it's really less than 10% of our European portfolio and less than 5% of our total Security portfolio. But we're being very right in saying that we don't think we've solved the issue in Spain and Italy yet. Jim Loree : And we factored it into our guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Mike Sang - Morgan Stanley : It's actually Mike Sang in for Nigel. Wanted to jump back on the MPP initiative. It sounds like it's going well and you alluded to it earlier, but against the backdrop of weaker emerging markets. I was wondering if that changed your view at all on how much you need to invest to build that business and how the calculus impacts the topline and margin contributions? Jim Loree : So just to refresh everybody who may or may not have heard this in the past. But the MPP markets in tools across the emerging markets are about 60% to 70% of the total markets. And they are where the growth is the fastest, and they are where the local competitors are the most skilled at driving growth. So if you're going to play in tools on a serious global emerging market platform, you have to play in the MPP market and you have to do it with products that are at the price point and at the performance point that you are meeting or exceeding the local competition. So our strategy has been very much focused on exactly that. And it actually plays quite well into slowing markets, because slowing markets tend to have some economic distress. And when distress occurs, people move from higher-priced products to lower-priced products. So we expect the growth in the mid price point and we call it MPP+, which is mid price point plus or MPP or MPP-. And we have a next step with MPP to see a little degradation from MPP+ to MPP kind of a water fall down in terms of where the market goes. And I think we're extremely well positioned in that regard, and we made our investments. It's not like we have to make a lot of new investments. We put 300 feet in the street. We've designed the products. We bought GQ, the Chinese power tool company. We've upgraded the products very nicely with local Chinese leader in that market. And they also export beautifully into all our markets around the world. So we're in a pretty good place there. And I think in addition to that if the markets were accelerating, I suspect that the desire to invest amongst all the competitors would be even stronger. I think the likelihood of investments by competitors is still there. But perhaps the magnitude and speed at which they invest will be regularly sum up by the market expectations. So in kind of a perverse way, I think we're in a very good spot. Operator : Our next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo : What's the organic growth rate that's assumed in the 3% to 4% for the year in terms of the contribution from organic growth initiatives? And then second one, John, you talked about Spain and Italy being a pressure point within European Security. At one point, you start to look at that and say, do we really need to be there and is that structurally important to our overall Security business and it may make sense for us to just move away from those markets longer term. John Lundgren : 2% organically in the first half, if we're going to be up 3% in the second half for the year, the math would say we have to be 4%. It's just math. 2% plus 4% divided by 2 is 3%. So it's 4% to 5% in the second half, if that's your question, versus 2%. And this is globally of course for the entire corporation all in. And obviously that's going to vary by segment. And the answer to your second question, that's a great question, we ask ourselves that question all the time. We look at all the alternatives and will continue to. I think what's important to note is before we abandoned something, we give it our best effort to fix it. And we've made some tremendous improvements there. We will continue to do that. But you are right on, we're not in a position on this call to talk about paths forward. But I think let's get realistic. Jim gave you a very important number. It's 10% of our European Security business, which means it's 5% of our global Security business, which means it's 1.25% of our company. We are looking at it. We're focusing on the alternatives. We're not going to move a lot of needles irrespective of what we do. But to the extent it continues to be a drag, you've followed us a long time, we have a history of if we can't fix something in 18 to 24 months, we used to do something else with it. And we don't follow more than anything that is in earnings cost to capital. Jim Loree : The growth initiative impact for the year, and it's going to be about 1.5 point. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : It's actually (inaudible) for Mike. Part of the increase in the operating EPS guidance was due to better Industrial performance expectations. Within Industrial, was there a specific area that's driving this outlook, or is it kind of evenly spread across each of the individual groups? Don Allan : Within our Industrial segment, the largest businesses are Industrial and Automotive Repair business, which are very large businesses in the US and Europe, our Engineered Fastening business which is performing extremely well, and then our smaller businesses within the Industrial segment as we report are oil and gas and hydraulics. Each and every one is up beautifully year-to-date, and we expect more good things. Jim talked about how well Engineered Fastening was performing. It's still 50% to 60% of that business is OEM auto and it's performing at a level four times the rate of the market. So we're obviously gaining share, well managed business, diversifying into other verticals. IAR is strong and we think will continue to be. IAR has a large percentage of its business in Europe, but it's performing quite well in Europe despite a relatively stagnant market. And oil and gas and hydraulics being much more volatile had really nice second quarter and we see those trends continuing. That's a very long way of saying there's strength across each and every business within our Industrial segment. And at the current point, there are no fixed uppers. There is just leverage, the great positive momentum that those business leaders have taken into the second half of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeremie Capron from CLSA. Jeremie Capron - CLSA: Good progress on margins and I wanted to follow up on liquidities question on the Industrial segment where we've seen over 200 bps of margin expansion there. I'm wondering if you could give us more color on what's driving this margin expansion and what we should expect going forward as manufacturing activity seems to be expanding. Should we expect operating leverage to continue to play a large role there and to see margins trending up further? Jim Loree : We clearly see that across the portfolio within Industrial for components of it, if you want to look at that, which is really three ones that we talk about externally, infrastructure, IAR and Engineered Fastening are contributing in a positive way for organic growth and continuing in a very positive way for operating leverage. And the reason they're contributing in such a significant way for operating leverage is all the things that all three of us have articulated in a fair amount of detail this morning, which is the focus on surgical pricing actions in our businesses. We're focused on indirect cost controls. We've also taken other SG&A cut actions that we embarked upon in the fourth quarter of last year. And we've been very focused on how we improve our operating leverage across our company. And I think you're seeing the most significant impact within our Industrial segment. But then again when you look at the rest of the company across at CDIY and even in Security, so it's just really representing the impact of all the things that we're trying to do to manage the business, manage the organic growth, manage the margin mix, manage the price, manage the cost and really enhance the operating performance of the business. And ultimately the true cash flow of the business in the company starts to come through. And you saw that in the second quarter with a very strong cash flow performance. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Ken Zener - KeyBanc: John, I wonder if you could do the math for me. On US Security margin split between CSS and mechanical and expand on you guys' comment on how the domestic field efficiencies are lifting the CSS business, because I know there have historically been some real spread there. Do you think that part is picking up as well as mechanical coming down? John Lundgren : I won't do the specific math, because we don't necessarily want margin by sub-segment within a segment in the public domain. You know this business really well, but I think I can help you directionally. Ken, historically mechanical access security and access of that higher margin has been convergent, that is converging as electronic margins increase and we maintain or increase it at a faster rate than either access or MAS. Our MAS business is still a little soft, so it's representing a lower percentage of the total due to no other factor than what Jim has talked about on several of the calls, specifically the switch from a direct to a distribution model and the resulting margin impact of that, which over time we're highly confident will be offset by increased volume, by increased share, by operating leverage. But as we speak, consistently high margins, there's no huge spread across the three sub-segments within North American Security. And as Jim referenced to a previous call, the Asia-Pacific or emerging market piece that's baked into that same number, there's no dramatic difference there either. By healthcare business and emerging markets business, margins are a little lower than North America. And that's really all the detail on sub-segments that we care to get into. Jim Loree : Ken, you've been with us a while. You remember, I'm sure, when the Security business in North America started having some issues about a little over a year ago, we discussed at the time one of the reasons for that was that we had made an organizational change where we had taken the structure that we had been running the CSS business on historically, which was a centralized structure in terms of metrics management and field deployment, and we had pushed that centralized structure out into that AD P&Ls in the various geographical regions of the United States and had placed accountability at that level for managing P&Ls and then rolled it all up into a total. And it turned out that that particular move was not a very smart one. And so when we started going backwards in the field about a year or so ago in terms of efficiency, we determined that one of the reasons was that we did not have the people in running these P&Ls that were really capable of managing the efficiencies and the labor loading and all the complexities that go with managing a field like that. So about nine months ago, we reversed that decision and we went back to the centralized model. And now what you're seeing is the benefits of a very, very metric-based daily intense management model, which is the way that you make money and manage your field effectively in electronic security business. And having made that mistake once, we will not make it again. I can promise you. Operator : Our next question comes from Winnie Clark from UBS. Winnie Clark - UBS: You talked about the headwind you saw in CDIY in North America in the second quarter as retail inventory replenishment came to a halt. Have you started to see that come back and is there a potential for the tail of the outdoor season to be a bit longer and strong due to the slower start that you saw? And then could you see some benefits from restocking in the second half? Jim Loree : The outdoor season, it's so very specific to the first quarter and the second quarter that there's very little replenishment that goes on in the third quarter. And really what you've got now is retailers are just trying to make sure that they don't get stuck holding it back with a bunch of inventory. So there's really no chance for, I'd say, either really any significant upside or downside relative to outdoor. John Lundgren : I think that's very well said. I mean to oversimplify what Jeff Ansell's team would say, you get to the middle of June, that season is over. They're already looking forward to fall products. So we're optimistic what's there. We'll sell through. But due to the late start, to Jim's point, it was the reorders that didn't take place. In their minds the season is over. That volume, there's probably no reason to think that volume in terms of shipments will come back. And we'll move it on from there. Operator : Our next question comes from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates. Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Can you break out the second half assumptions kind of embedded in that 4% to 5% organic across the major regions, I guess, just compared to the volume that you saw in the first half growth? Don Allan : We don't really give it that way. But the reality is when you look at the trends that we've seen in our company in some of the commentary that Jim mentioned this morning, we've seen a very strong performance in certain pieces of our European business. Other pieces such as Security Europe have been a little weaker. Emerging markets had a solid performance in Q1 and then had some volatility in Q2, and we expect that to improve in the back half for all the reasons that Jim walked through around MPP. So I'm not going to give you specific numbers by regions. But what I can tell you is that from a trend perspective, things will move. I think Europe will be relatively consistent with a little bit of it tailing down as we start to comps and difficult comps in CDIY Europe. Emerging markets will ramp back up from what we saw in Q2 and get stronger. And then the US will be a little stronger than what we thought, because we were definitely impacted by outdoor in a negative way, and we don't expect that to repeat. So we would expect a modest improvement in that particular performance. Jim Loree : To help you with your modeling, it's too much detail to get into on the call. We do included in the appendix in tremendous detail at least in terms of Europe performance and history. But just thinking at a high level, 50% of our global business is in the US or 53% is in North America, 25% in Europe and 25% in the rest of the world. Rest of the world is clearly going to grow faster than North America and Europe. And weighted average gets you to the 4% to 5% in the second half and 3% to 4% for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Saliq Khan from Imperial Capital. Saliq Khan - Imperial Capital : Security has been talked about previously as well but if you're looking at much of the drag on the overall revenue growth it's previously been the result of Security business, particularly as we're looking at Europe. Now Stanley has been criticized by the investment community for a lot of its challenges within that division, which has traditionally been a very high margin business. There have even been talks about the divestiture of the Security business from the rest of Stanley, I know someone mentioned that previously as well. Now we've been writing a lot about Security turnaround strategy for several months now and it's really nice to see that Security is finally seeing an uptick. With that being said, within the vertical market penetration, specifically in North America, which segments are you seeing the most traction in, and what is working within those segments that you can use to penetrate in other segments and also try to emulate that strategy in the European market as you look into the back half of 2014 and go into 2015, I know that a large number of the sales force within Security sector has previously been replaced by those people that are not just looking for new business, but also farming for existing businesses as well? John Lundgren : Those two issues, which verticals are gaining traction in the US and is there learning that applies to other verticals, and then second that's I think will help the audience the most. Well, our order rates are running close to $100 million annualized on the verticals. And within that $100 million, I think the number one vertical would be retail. And we've been doing some work in integrating EAS systems with Security systems that seems to be very appealing to large retailers. And we've had one very large win and then a couple of smaller ones. And we see a couple on the horizon in retail, which is kind of a very unique value proposition that nobody else is providing at this point in time, which does a lot of data analytics for the headquarters and the regions of the retailers. So that's one exciting area. Another one is healthcare. And our healthcare activities are really divided into two pieces. The one is the traditional security business that covers acute care facilities and senior living facilities and just medical facilities in general. And that's your basic security systems. But we also have this other part of our business which we call it healthcare, but it's centered in patient security, but now it's evolved to an asset tracking a patient safety, a compliance productivity generating business that really ties together a lot of software solutions with hardware components and peripherals and brings the ability to kind of manage the hospital better or the senior living facility better to the hospital. And we're kind of combining that now in a go-to-market basis in selected areas with our core security business. And what we're finding is that the value proposition that we can bring to the C level type people in hospitals, for example, is very, very compelling. So we've had some wins already that are pretty significant there and we have some wins on the horizon that I think will eye-opening in size. And then another one is higher education. We've had several significant universities wins in the last six months or so. And these tend to vary from providing kind of campus control solutions to more traditional or more basic security solutions. But we have several technologies today that we are kind of weaving together as we go to these various verticals. And one of them is the RTLS technology that we gained through the AeroScout acquisition. And another is the EyeLock technology that we have exclusive rights to in these markets. And then we have done a really nice job I think also integrating with the PSIM systems, the basic security systems, so that we can kind of go to a customer and take what might be a hodge-podge of various security systems that they might have installed across their enterprise and sort of tie them together in a better way. So these are kind of all at the root of the success of the vertical initiative. And I think just to focus on becoming a subject matter expert in each one of these verticals and providing solutions to the customer. The ability to transfer this to Europe, I think we're getting very close to the point where we can begin to do that. That will not be an overnight sensation. It will take at least one to two years for it to really settle in and start driving the growth there. But it is very powerful. These solutions are transferrable. And there's not a whole lot of extra work that needs to be done to take them to Europe in terms of the product modifications. It's really more of preparing the European sales force to sell these and commercialize these. And that is something that we want to do, but we also want to make sure that the environment is stable and that the talent is there to be able to do that in Europe. And we're nearing the time when we can kind of make that happen, but it's going to be a quarter or two before we actually make that happen. Operator : Our next question comes from Liam Burke from Janney Capital. Liam Burke - Janney Capital : IAR had a good quarter with Mac Tools up, so the automotive vertical looked pretty strong for the quarter. Are there any other verticals that contributed or have shown unusual strength either in this quarter or as you see it going forward? Jim Loree : Liam, I don't know if you jumped on the call late. I talked a little bit to a previous question on the Industrial segment. As you know, IAR and Engineered Fastening are the big businesses. And Engineered Fastening is about 50%, OEM auto the other 50% spread across aerospace, consumer electronics and other verticals. Then the rest of that segment, as you know well, is infrastructure or hydraulics and oil and gas businesses. All performed extremely well in the quarter. So we really had broad-based organic growth and operating leverage across the entire Industrial platform. It was a very encouraging quarter. And no one specific vertical or end-market to single out has been an extraordinary driver. Operator : Our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James. Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James : The inventories on a year-on-year basis are up pretty sharply. Now I don't think I should be too worried about it. You did mention, Don, that you are expecting working capital to improve by year-end and you did raise guidance. But where are those inventories on a year-on-year basis and was there any benefit to fixed cost absorption during the quarter? Don Allan : As I mentioned back in the April call, I actually indicated that we would be mostly like building some inventory in the CDIY business in the second quarter to prepare for the remainder of the year to prepare for the MPP rollout in emerging markets. And as I indicated a few minutes ago, the working capital turns pretty much came in line with our expectations by the end of the quarter. So you're exactly right, the inventory levels are a little bit higher than maybe what we originally anticipated six months ago or so. But they're right in line with what we're anticipating as we began the second quarter. We feel good about how we're positioned for the remainder of the year. We have very robust plans, like we do every year, in place to address the inventory payables and receivable levels over the next six months and feel that the working capital numbers that I provided are very achievable. As far as absorption, yeah, obviously the impact was part of our guidance, part of what we planned. It was not very significant, but clearly it does an impact on the higher levels of inventory versus the prior period or the prior quarter, but didn't drive anything significant beyond our expectations. It was right in line with what we expected. Operator : Our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. David MacGregor - Longbow Research : I guess the question from here is, which is kind of the other side of the equation, is how do we grow the business and what might be achievable in terms of just growing the RMR portfolio from here and if you could just talk about what sort of the most impactful levers are to you at this point. Jim Loree : You're right on. I mean the first quarter of business was to keep what we have. And then in the process while we were doing that, we were also and have been now for almost two years building a sales force and a commercial engine for that business, because when we acquired it, we didn't have one. We had an organization that was reliant on its cousin, which was the Securitas Corporation. So I'd say that sales force rebuilding process has gone reasonably well in most geographies. And if set aside Spain and Italy, which if you look at the organic growth being down 6% in the second quarter, I think it was down 7% in the first quarter, what you have there is two things going on. One if the spill-over effect of the prior attrition from prior quarters having an impact. But equally as important the installation business is down. And it derives from Spain and Italy being about a third of the issue. And then beyond that, we have a very, very focused initiative to make sure that we're not taking on business that is low-margin business and low value-added business. So that has an impact. And then finally, it's just a matter of making sure that we have the requisite number of salespeople or feet on the street on the payroll. We need to deal with the Spain and Italy issues, as was talked about earlier. So that's part of it. And then I think the feet on the street issue, earlier in the year, we were down probably about 30 to 40 people versus what we needed to have or wanted to have in sales in Europe. And I think today, we're right around down 10. So we're making a lot of progress on that front, getting to where we need to be. And the order rates in the back half of the year need to kind of come up. They're negative right now, consistent with the organic growth numbers, and they need to come up. And so that is the focus right now. It's making sure that the feet on the street are performing. And all this is very tactical. But as you've seen when we address these tactical issues in sequence here, we've been relatively successful. So we're confident that we can get that done. And then of course, the medium to longer-term solution to this is to have this vertical market of products and the vertical market sales organization that was discussed a few minutes ago transferred over to Europe. So this is a staged execution project just like everything else we've been doing here. And right now, we're in the stage of making sure that the origination capability of the organization is not only there, but performing at a level that is acceptable. And then of course, the next step from there will be bringing in the vertical market solutions. Operator : I will now turn the call over to Greg Waybright for closing comments. Greg Waybright : Paulette, thank you. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation. And obviously please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is John. I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Gregory Waybright : Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. On the call, in addition to myself, are John Lundgren, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website as well as on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 p.m. today. The replay number and access code are in our press release. This morning, John, Jim and Don will review our third quarter 2014 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Because of the size of the queue, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is, therefore, possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren. John F. Lundgren: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. I am really pleased with the performance of our team in the third quarter, given what's going on in the geopolitical front and many others. Let's get right into it. Organic growth of 6% was led by CDIY and our Industrial business, and the combination of the 6% growth, sharp cost focus and price realization delivered strong operating leverage. Our OM rate expanded to a post-merger record of 14.1%, that's x charges, of course, and 120-basis-points increase versus 2013. Diluted EPS, up 12% versus 2013 to $1.55, $1.50 on a GAAP basis. And please note the convergence of GAAP and reported EPS as the large acquisitions, accompanied by outsized restructuring charges, are more fully integrated and the overwhelming majority of that is now behind us. CDIY revenue grew 10% organically, another post-merger record of 16.5% operating margin rate as volume leverage, productivity, price and cost actions offset the continued foreign exchange and emerging market headwinds that you'll hear more about later in today's call. Industrial delivered 5% organic growth, 15.9% operating margin, and that's up 170 basis points. And the turnaround in Security, Europe continues. At the same time, we're taking some further actions to strengthen the global Security business as well as sharpen our focus on our vertical market solutions activities. And Jim Loree is going to give you a lot more detail on Security, in general, and vertical markets, in particular, when he gets into the segments. Free cash flow is $189 million in the third quarter and remains strong. Year-to-date, it's up $464 million versus 2013. And as a consequence of the earnings performance in the third quarter cash flow, we're raising our fiscal year free cash flow guidance and reiterating the earnings midpoint while tightening the 2014 EPS range. We're looking at approximately $800 million of free cash flow for the year and EPS of $5.52 to $5.58. Let's turn to the sources of growth during the quarter. The developed markets showed great strength, and they led the way this quarter as both CDIY and Industrial performed well in the U.S. as well as Europe. And remember, those 2 geographies account for 74% of our total revenue. Pricing in the emerging markets, as well as surgical pricing actions elsewhere in -- primarily in our developed markets, led to a 1% overall increase. And pricing offset the negative foreign exchange impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar against virtually every currency. More to come on that in the fourth quarter as we think this is going to continue, and Don will get into that in far greater detail in his piece of the presentation. Within the regions, U.S. demand remains healthy in both retail and industrial channels. Overall demand in Europe is flat with the exception of the U.K. and several smaller countries. So the 4% growth that you see in Europe is clearly the result of share gains. Emerging markets remained under pressure, most notably Venezuela, Russia and Brazil, but we're really encouraged that the recent mid-priced products that we launched earlier this year are gaining a tremendous amount of traction. More on our recent product launches, as well as the current initiatives in those markets, as Jim dives into the segments. So in the interest of time, let me turn it over to him. James M. Loree: Okay. Thanks, John. Let's start with CDIY. It was a blockbuster quarter for organic growth in the developed markets with double-digit performances in both North America and Europe, overwhelming a second consecutive slow growth quarter, in this case, 2% in the emerging markets, for a total performance of 10% globally. CDIY operating margin grew 19%, achieving another post-merger record rate of 16.5%, and margin gains resulting from volume leverage, modestly positive price, operations productivity and tight SG&A cost management overcame currency pressures. Last quarter, in my remarks, I said, and I quote, \"So as we step back from the CDIY picture, we see a very healthy franchise with world-leading brands, broad and deep global distribution, delivering record margins. As we look forward, we have tremendous NPI momentum in both developed and developing markets and a cost structure that is poised for operating leverage.\" That is, in fact, exactly what our CDIY team delivered in bigger proportions in North America and Europe than even we expected. Across the global product lines, strength was broad-based with growth in Professional Power Tools, Consumer products, Hand Tools & Storage and Fastening & Accessories, each in a range from 8% to 11%. As the cover page indicated, CDIY new product development momentum is driving both revenue and profit growth. DeWalt DC brushless, an important and growing segment of cordless, is off to a very strong start. A host of other examples around the globe, ranging from highly innovative products, such as the first-in-world cordless electric pneumatic nailer and the Autosense drill, as well as practical products, such as the new designed in the market for the market, emerging market power and hand tool lines, all contributed. Putting the company's leading array of brands to work across categories also continues to produce strong results with examples such as DeWalt storage, adhesives and hand tools, Stanley FatMax power tools and Porter Cable hand tools all registering gains. Although difficult to quantify exact incremental revenue from these types of activities, we're confident that contributions from our NPD effort yielded 3 to 5 points of global growth benefit in the quarter. In the U.S., our Built In The USA program, which promotes tools assembled in our U.S.-based production facilities, including our recent plant addition in the Carolinas, has been highly successful. The U.S. business also enjoyed a kicker from an unexpected 3Q appearance of the outdoor season initially thought to be lost to weather back in the second quarter. On top of these benefits, underlying U.S. tool demand remains solid as DIY fundamentals are strong even as new construction markets are choppy but positive. So to sum up North America, exceptional growth execution and a good underlying market led to great 12% organic growth. And now moving to Europe where the market fundamentals are weak but the performance is equally as impressive. As I said last quarter, we couldn't be happier with the progress that the CDIY European team is making with organic growth up 11%, representing a 6-quarter streak with growth averaging 7% in one of the more consistently stagnant economic regions within the developed markets. This sustained performance is indicative of clear market share gains stemming from intensive NPD, new listings at retailers and distributors and a high-performance commercial team, which refuses to succumb to a victim mentality in a weak market. The other growth challenge in the quarter, emerging markets, up 2% organically, was one of continuing high volatility in the face of generally slower markets. It was a quarter in which Latin America, about half of our emerging markets' tools business, once again grew only 2% with Brazil flattish while issues in Venezuela and the western mining-dependent countries essentially offset stronger performances in Argentina, Mexico, Colombia and Central America. The other half of the emerging markets portfolio was also up only marginally as modest rebounds in Russia, Turkey and India were offset by weakness in China and Southeast Asia, to a lesser extent. Our major NPI foray into mid-price point power tools and hand tools across these markets is hitting the sweet spot for end users at a time when they tend to be more cost-conscious with their purchases. The program is thus tracking to plan but generally cutting into distributor's share of wallet as tougher markets create constraints on distributor willingness and ability to finance incremental inventory levels. As we look ahead for CDIY in total, we see the continued benefit of forward momentum with the winning combination of global scale, robust NPD, great brands, a growth culture and a tight rein on margins and cost more than compensating for lackluster markets in Europe and some of the emerging regions as well as a strengthening dollar environment. In that vein, we expect what is already an excellent CDIY growth story to continue. Now turning to Industrial. Industrial this quarter, once again, performed well and delivered respectable 3x operating leverage off of 5 points of organic growth with 17% growth in operating margin. The rate came in at 15.9%, up 170 basis points versus a year ago as price, productivity, SG&A control and volume all contributed to the performance. Both Industrial & Automotive Repair and Engineered Fastening delivered strong OM growth, up 29% and 19%, respectively. For IAR, organic growth of 7% benefited from strong demand in developed countries. North America was solid at 9%. Europe was up 11 points and still up an impressive 7% when adjusting for a prior year SAP conversion, which resulted in a 4-point easier comp. IAR Europe enjoyed strength in virtually all regions, driven by strong NPD and commercialization activities. Emerging markets were only modestly positive, the latter impacted by the same type of market issues as CDIY. Engineered Fastening was also up 5% organically with automotive up 16%, significantly outpacing global light vehicle production, which was up 5%. The Industrial portion of Engineered Fastening was flattish with sales to electronics OEMs weighing down a positive performance in industrial distribution. Infrastructure was down 1% organically with oil and gas down 4% and hydraulics up 7%. In total, it was another overall strong quarter for Industrial with a similar story shaping up for fourth quarter. Moving to Security. Revenues were down 3% with organic growth down 2 points and operating margin at 11.0%, down 12% and 120 basis points year-over-year. North America emerging markets was up 1% organically with Europe down 7%. North America emerging markets organic growth was modestly positive in both Convergent and Access Technologies, partially offset by a decline in Mechanical Access. Operating margin was essentially flat with last year. The OM rate was also consistent with the year ago, solidly in the mid-teens and just slightly shy of historical norms. Installation of a large vertical market retail win in North America, which has substantial future recurring revenue content, coupled with lower sales in the higher-margin Mechanical Access business, produced a less than desirable operating margin result in the quarter. Vertical market order progress continued to be a bright spot. In the spirit of allocating management resources where they are positioned to optimize their contribution to business success, several recent management adjustments have been made in North America in emerging market Security. Jim Cannon, a proven Stanley Black & Decker management veteran who has previously led both Oil & Gas and IAR, including responsibility for the Mac turnaround, has been named president of the unit. Brett Bontrager, who is succeeded by Jim, has been named to lead Global Vertical Markets, where he will continue to leverage his strength in developing these markets and winning customer accounts in North America while coordinating the transfer of Vertical Solutions to Europe as well. And then finally, Joe McCormack, another seasoned Stanley Black & Decker leader with extensive experience leading distribution commercial teams, has assumed leadership of Mechanical Access. We expect these changes to enable the continued forward progress of the Security North America and emerging markets team in both revving up organic growth and tightening operational execution. Moving to Security Europe this quarter. Performance was stable and consistent with commitments, extending its recent track record of predictability. OM is now in the mid-single digits, once again, improving sequentially this time by approximately a point. 3Q attrition came in within the target range of 10% to 12%, and order rates were up in the high single digits. This is an important calculus and that we will be looking for an easing of negative organic growth in the first half of '15 and then a flattish second half of '15 in order to continue to drive forward OM rate growth and a business turnaround. Finally, as mentioned last quarter, of the 14 country P&Ls in Europe, 12 are now considered stable or improving and only 2, Spain and Italy, representing 10% of the European portfolio, are still facing both significant structural and operational headwinds. We are committed to completing our strategic review of these countries in Q4, and you could expect a decisive solution dealing with the issue in the near future. So while Security still has a ways to go, especially in Europe, we are confident that we are in the right track, and our recent actions will continue to improve the probability of success. And with that, I will turn it over to Don Allan for some commentary on the financials, including the total year outlook and some preliminary thoughts on 2015. Don? Donald Allan : Thank you, Jim. We are very pleased with our third quarter 2014 cash flow performance, which resulted in $189 million of free cash flow. On a year-to-date basis, our free cash flow performance was $355 million as we continue to benefit from increased operational earnings, lower restructuring payments and reduced capital expenditures. These 3 factors are responsible for the vast majority of our year-over-year improvement through the first 9 months. Additionally, we are also pleased with our third quarter working capital turns performance at 6.4x, which is up a half a turn versus the prior year. We believe this bodes well for us achieving our year-end goal of 8.5 to 9 working capital turns as we're looking for a half turn or better improvement versus the 2013 year-end. Many of you are aware that every year we experience a significant positive working capital benefit in the fourth quarter due to certain seasonality aspects of our CDIY business. As a result, we tend to generate close to 60% of our annual free cash flow in the fourth quarter. If you extrapolate our year-to-date performance through the third quarter, which is $355 million, and consider the fact that it indicates our free cash flow for the full year of 2014 will approximate $800 million. Considering all these factors I just mentioned, we are increasing our annual guidance for free cash flow to approximately $800 million from the previously communicated, at least, $675 million. This improved performance will ensure we will achieve our debt deleveraging goals for 2014 and then allow us to begin the previously communicated share repurchase program at some point in the fourth quarter. Now let's review our 2014 EPS outlook on Page 10. As indicated by John earlier, we are reiterating the midpoint of $5.55 while tightening our range, which is now expected to be $5.52 to $5.58. There are factors changing within our annual guidance which have an overall neutral impact on full year earnings. As a result of the strengthening U.S. dollar versus other key currencies, we now expect $75 million of currency pressure versus the previously communicated $60 million for the full year of 2014. However, offsetting virtually all of this new $15 million of Q4 currency pressure will be continued strong operational performance of several key businesses within CDIY and Industrial. This operational performance is being driven by solid organic growth in developed markets, strong cost controls over indirect costs and focused customer pricing initiatives, all the things that you heard from Jim a few minutes ago. An additional factor potentially impacting our annual guidance would be a modest benefit to earnings from the potential or possible reclassification of our Security Southern European business to discontinued operations. We will finalize this strategic decision in the later stages of Q4 and communicate it in the appropriate time frame. Let's turn to segments. We continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and solid operating margin rate expansion year-over-year in both the CDIY and Industrial segments, primarily due to volume leverage, solid price actions and cost controls, which are more than offsetting currency. Our Security segment will have a modest, organic revenue decline of for the full year, and the margin rate will decline modestly as well versus the prior year. The organic growth in North America and emerging markets will be more than offset by the declines we are experiencing in Europe, as Jim has discussed, based for the Q3 performance. Although headwinds have been somewhat unrelenting in 2014 due to currency pressures, combined with economic or political issues in emerging markets which have caused volume challenges, we believe we are taking all of the correct actions to combat these headwinds through cost-control actions and customer pricing initiatives. This approach will allow us to achieve strong operating leverage on solid organic growth, specifically, earnings will expand 13% on organic growth of 3% to 4% in 2014. We'd like to give you some thoughts on 2015. We see these currency and emerging market volume headwinds continuing and currently estimate it to be $50 million to $75 million against our 2015 operating profit growth expectation. Most of you know we have a track record of responding to these types of headwinds with focused cost-reduction actions or other profit-enhancing initiatives. And I think 2014 is a great example of this. We are currently considering several cost-reduction initiatives, which would largely, if not completely, offset these headwinds that we see for 2015 at this point in time. We're evaluating 3 areas for potential cost reductions : the first is combination of a few existing Stanley Black & Decker businesses to maximize the commercial go-to-market opportunities and, of course, leverage the back-office functions. In my mind, this would be a continued evolution of the Stanley and Black & Decker merger : number two, further cost rationalization of the Security businesses to improve profitability while enhancing our SG&A investments to stimulate growth within the verticals; and then three, other surgical actions and certain functions as well as corporate overhead. If we proceed with these actions, which I believe are highly likely, it will require additional restructuring charges of $10 million to $25 million in excess of our current 2014 estimate of $25 million. However, do not misinterpret our 2015 comments. We do expect solid growth in profit during 2015, and we are simply discussing one headwind we need to offset. Moving to the next slide, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing 2015 foreign currency impacts. As we are all aware, the U.S. dollar strengthened during late September against the 4 major currencies which impact us : the Canadian dollar, the European euro, Brazilian real and Argentinian peso. As a reminder, these transactional exposures primarily exist in our CDIY and Industrial businesses with 80% of it within CDIY. This is due to the extensive global supply chains that are in place as well as the importing of finished goods and components into Latin America and Canada in U.S. dollar-based transactions. We have finalized most of our initial key currency-hedging activities for 2015 at this stage. And based on yesterday's spot rates, we estimate the 2015 negative currency impact to approximate $45 million to $50 million versus 2014, which includes the impact of these recently executed currency hedges. To give you an example of the sensitivity of these 4 major currencies shown on the chart, a 1% movement of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar will result in approximately a $2.5 million to $3.5 million annual currency impact, and you can see examples of the other 3 currencies on the page. As I mentioned previously, we are focused on managing these types of headwinds with mitigating actions and are currently in the process of evaluating what these potential offsets could be. I believe this slide provides good transparency to the impact of currency in 2015 on our company. So I'd like to summarize the presentation portion of our call today. We are very pleased with the strong Q3 2014 EPS and cash flow performance. The strong organic growth of 6% mentioned by John has been supported by solid innovation and the 2013 growth investments continuing to blossom. The tight cost control and surgical price actions across the entire company enabled excellent operating leverage, and our operating margin expanded to a post-merger record. Security Europe continues to perform better and made another positive step forward in Q3. Our focus in 2014 continues to be on improving the near-term returns and relative performance of Stanley Black & Decker through organic growth initiatives, Security margin improvement, cost actions, pricing, ongoing working capital focus and, of course, the rebalance of our capital allocation through the end of 2015. Finally, we are preparing for new currency and emerging market volume headwinds with offsetting mitigating actions in 2015. So we continue to drive operating leverage as we grow revenue organically. We believe this approach in 2014, '15 and beyond positions our company to deliver on the long-term financial objectives we have established. That concludes the presentation portion of the call. Now let's move to Q&A. Gregory Waybright : Great. Thank you, Don. John, if you would, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Winnie Clark from UBS. Winifred Clark - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Could you talk a bit about -- a little bit more about the emerging market expectation continuing to be sluggish and now somewhat weaker in 2015? You quantify the dollar change in your expectation, but what does that translate to from an organic growth expectation? Does that impact your ability to drive 3% organic growth via your initiatives next year? John F. Lundgren: Yes. No, a very fair question. Let me start at a higher level. Emerging markets, depending on exchange rates, accounts for 17% to 19% of our total revenue. So first and foremost, put that in perspective. Within the emerging markets, we didn't touch on specific geographies. But historically, as a group, these are growing in double digits, low teens and now they're growing at 2% and 3%. Specifically, certain markets, in our case, Venezuela, where we've had essentially no business for the last 12 months, that will anniversary which is nice in terms of our ability to grow. Argentina is difficult but continuing up. We've seen some bright spots in the last quarter. Brazil, it's much about currency and the economy, and of course, China, a very, very good -- switching to Asia. China, a big piece. We saw 7.3% GDP growth in the third quarter. That's encouraging. It's below where they have been, but better than of late. And of course, the geopolitical situations in Russia, Turkey, the Ukraine is impacting all of it. So at the end of the day, it's 17% of our volume. And if the markets are growing at 10% and we're gaining share -- maintaining share, excuse me, that's 170 basis points of organic growth. If they're flat, it's 0. So simply said, we have the products to go into those markets. We are certainly tempering our expectations for those markets in total, but that's what's baked into the kind of guidance that we've been able to provide thus far. James M. Loree: And if you just think about it from a macro point of view, there clearly is a rotation of economic growth away from the -- in the short term, away from the emerging markets and more into North America, in particular, and Europe, kind of sort of -- expected to continue to sort of stay the same, maybe get slightly better. So we would expect to see the organic growth profile of the company mirror that economic growth rotation. So I would expect to see developed markets kind of -- and emerging markets converge for a period of time in sort of similar growth rates and then, over the long term, emerging markets to kind of ramp up again. We have taken considerable action in terms of product innovation and product development, brand development channel. We've made significant investments in the emerging markets. So we do think that we will be able to outperform the market or the economic performance of various countries. However, the volatility does remain high in the short term and are probably well for the medium to long term as well, but one has to be in these markets because these markets are the future. The 2/3 of the world's economic output and -- within 20 years will be from the emerging markets, and we will be there. So this is a -- this is not a period where one should get shy or cautious about being in these markets or second guess their strategy. This is a time to hunker down and gain as much share as possible. John F. Lundgren: Yes, and thanks, Jim. And just to follow up because you only get the one question. I think 2 things. Jim's referring specifically to our feet-on-the-street advertising promotion efforts in those markets, but a greater importance, made in the market for the market to hit the right price points to get the products to the -- particularly to the distributors who are short on cash and thinking very hard about their purchase. So at the end of the day, think about the math. And in the appendix, if you're not familiar with it, we don't go through it in each presentation, but it'll just help you with the math that will give you every region of the country and the percent of Stanley Black & Decker revenue that, that region accounts for. So if you're modeling, it'll just help you with kind of a weighted average and you can apply your own assumptions to the market. And to Jim's point, we will mirror that. Operator : And our next question is from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Don, I just wanted to dig into your comment about currency with the hedges, about $45 million, $50 million headwind for '15, and you're mentioning the possibility of further actions this year to offset that. And so what I'm going to try to figure out is do the incremental actions you're considering offset the $45 million to $50 million? Or do we think about that as the total actions you've taken this year offsetting that headwind, potentially? Donald Allan : The actions that we're -- that we are evaluating would offset the currency impact as well as the emerging market volume impact. So I -- we described a $50 million to $75 million headwind for 2015. Within that, there's a $45 million to $50 million currency pressure, and then the other component is the volume concerns that we were just talking about related to emerging markets. We're looking to take actions that would offset all of that. Operator : Our next question is from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Just quickly on -- 2 questions. Don, I think you said buyback in Q1 because of higher cash flow. Just wondering why you wouldn't be aggressive here in Q4, given this is seasonally the strongest cash flow quarter. And then the second question, CDIY margin, 16.5%, very strong number. How should we think about this from a sustainable standpoint? I know there's some seasonality within the business, but just trying to understand as we think about '15, given the strong margin here this quarter. Donald Allan : So the first question is, I said the fourth quarter, maybe there was a Freudian flip and the word first came out, but I did say fourth quarter. So we expect to start the repurchase in the fourth quarter. So our objective has always been, since the beginning of the year, would be that we would focus on deleveraging. We had about $300 million roughly of deleveraging we wanted to do. We believe with this outperformance of cash flow we will be able to adequately achieve that, and then we'll be able to move forward with our repurchase program at some point in the fourth quarter. As far as the cash flow and the seasonality comment, yes. I mean, when we look at the history of our CDIY business, it is -- it was a little muddy last year, I think because of some other dynamics. But every other year, post-merger, about 60% to 70% in some cases, of the free cash flow or working capital benefit occurs in the fourth quarter. And it's because of the timing of the different promotions and other activities related to the holiday season and the vast majority of those shipments occur in October, early November. And then the good news is we're able to collect a lot of those receivables. And then we ramp down our production in our plants, so our inventory levels are actually able to decline because we do -- the -- our major customers tend to have a weak first quarter because it is the winter months. Operator : And our next question is from Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : On the Security, it seem to be very specific in the U.S. on Mechanical, if I interpreted your comments correctly. So would you expand on that, if it was related to -- going to the distribution model, if it was aggressive behavior by a competitor? Or was it simply more misexecution? James M. Loree: Well, the Mechanical issue is kind of the issue for North America and emerging markets Security in the quarter, without a doubt. The other issue, which is the CSS kind of efficiency and operating margin rate, is simply a one quarter blip, where we have a big installation of a huge vertical market customer project. So you do have that correct. And I'd say what we believe about the Mechanical business today is that we have selected the correct strategy, and we have attempted to implement it effectively for about 2 years now and, at some point, the -- once patients dwindles with execution. And we've made some mistakes along the way, and we expect that new leadership will tackle the project and get it right. So that's the impetus behind the management change, and we're looking forward to Joe's experience coming into this job and getting this right very quickly. We've studied the strategic elements and aspects of this in depth, and we see that as the right strategy. We've got the specifiers in place. We haven't seen any untoward competitive activity. The market is going to be good at some point in time. It's not bad right now. We're just not performing at that level. So we get to those situations and it's time to make a change. John F. Lundgren: Just to add to what Jim said, the one thing you didn't mention is coming out of that is -- which as you know, is the largest annual Security trade show. It's not a product issue as well. The product is very, very well received. We're encouraged by that. So just to reinforce everything Jim said, plus we're -- not only do we feel the strategy is right, we're -- we feel we're in better shape than we've been in the past in terms of product offering. So it's up to us to execute. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Just a question around Europe Security. I was wondering if you could provide us a little bit of granularity, maybe it's collectively, not by country. But in the -- what's going on in the 12 P&Ls you view as, at least, satisfactory versus the other 2? And what would actually be the gating decision to drop Spain and Italy into disc ops? I mean, the -- obviously, if you decide to exit, that might be one thing. But if you're looking at a sale, I wonder if you would consider dropping it into disc ops before you have an agreement on the exit. John F. Lundgren: I'll take it, and Don can correct me on the accounting. Let me take the second part of your question first. We've said all we could say about whether or not -- what we said is we're evaluating it. We will have a decision in the fourth quarter, and we will communicate it. That is all we're going to say. It's all we're in a position to say for all the reasons that I know you understand. I respect the question. Please respect the fact that we're not able to provide any more insight on it, other than we want you to be aware we're not letting that issue fester. What I think is important to understand, we timed that and allow us to go through '14 P&L. We do report them. And the ones, the big ones that matter, U.K., France and Sweden, all performing pretty well and very near line average and historical margins. The math is really important, and it's interesting. We talked about Spain and Italy, which, together, from a revenue perspective, represent 10% of European Security; if you just cascade that with the math, which represents 4% of Stanley Security and 1% of Stanley Black & Decker revenue. Yet that region is accounting for 70 to 100 basis points of headwind or negativity to our Security margins. And quite frankly, that's just math. And it's 2 things going on, those are very competitive markets. They're difficult markets, as you can imagine. But secondly, particularly, Spain, which is 80% of that 10% or 70% of that 10%, the financial services industry, as you know, is in turmoil. Retail bank branches closing left and right. I'd be off -- I shouldn't speculate, at least 30% to 40% down. And that was our strength in Europe. So when you got -- very competitive in Spain -- so when you have a very competitive market that's 30% to 40% smaller than it was 1 year, 1.5 year ago, that's just tough sledding. So we're evaluating all the options in the best interest of our shareholders and of our employees in the company, recognizing the pros and cons of the 2 or 3 different alternative that you outlined. And when we're ready to -- when we're in a position to take a firm stance, you'll be among the first to know. James M. Loree: Let me also just mention that another way to look at this situation, Security Europe, is -- and at the P&L, is that once you excise the Southern Italy part that we're talking about, the gross margin rate is north of 40%, and the operating margin would be a couple -- kind of in the mid to slightly above mid-single-digit range. So what that says is that the SG&A is quite high, and it's in the 35-plus-percent range, which is just too high for a Security business, no matter where it's located in the world. So it's very important that part of what Don mentioned in terms of this cost exercise that we'll be going through in the fourth quarter to yield profitability improvements in 2015, there will be a significant -- as he mentioned, a significant portion of it targeted at the Security Europe cost structure, and particularly, as it relates to the SG&A. And we will find a way to make some significant improvements in that structure, that cost structure so that we get the operating margin lift that comes with that. So I think is very encouraging, from my perspective, that the gross margin is north of 40%, once you get that Southern Europe portfolio excised. Operator : And our next question is from Stephen Kim from Barclays. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I wanted to follow up a little bit on the CDIY. I think you talked about the outdoor previously as, I think, hindering you by about 2 points of growth. I think you mentioned that in either 2Q or 1Q. And I'm triangulating on that to be about $30 million impact. I was curious if you could give us some sense. Is that kind of in the ballpark of what you benefited from this quarter? Can you get it all back? Or just some color around that. And then what you think the incrementals on that look like? Is there a reason to think the incrementals there sort of higher or lower than the segment average typically? James M. Loree: We -- just so -- just for clarity, we only got about 1/3 of that back. So it didn't even contribute -- it might round to a point, point of growth for CDIY, but it wasn't a significant an issue as -- or a benefit as it was a hurt in the second quarter. And incrementals are going to be pretty much consistent with the rest of the portfolio. John F. Lundgren: Yes. Steve, outdoor -- just to quantify what Jim said, outdoor was up 2% VPY in the quarter, which was nice, but it's still down 3% year-to-date, emphasizing what Jim -- that helps to quantify what Jim just said. So despite a pleasant surprise in the third quarter, it didn't begin to fill the hole in the second quarter. It's just added a bit in the third. Operator : Our next question is from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : I wanted to just ask about the vertical market solutions revenue in Security and how much revenue you're expecting that to contribute in North America in 2014. And wanted to also clarify the margins there, I know there was some mention of project mix headwinds in the quarter and some mention of -- perhaps that was related to a big vertical market install? I wanted to clarify that because I thought the margins on the VMS was higher. And then just finally, the latest thinking on bringing the vertical market solutions to Europe. Donald Allan : Yes. I'll take that one. I think that was 4 questions in one and I'll have to break that down. So when we look at 2014 for the vertical market solutions, we've said throughout the year that our expectation is that we'd probably get pretty close to $100 million of revenue from these solutions during the year, and we're tracking relatively well to that at this stage of the year. So we feel pleased about how that's progressing. As far the gross margins, we've also said that they most likely will be accretive to the overall business. But you have to look at this across the entire contract. And what I mean by that is when you have large jobs like this, you have an installation component. And in the case of the third quarter, as Jim was describing the impact of a large job, we were doing the install, and we'll be close to finishing that here in October. But that does have a negative mix impact, but the profitability is lower on the installation. And then the recurring revenue stream starts later this year and continues into next year. And then when you look at the overall profitability of the entire job, it achieves the type of profitability we were describing before. And that's the way you have to evaluate it. I think it's important to remember that as we continue to focus on the vertical selling solutions, that we're occasionally going to have a quarter where we have a little bit of a mix challenge we have to work through when we have a large installation. But over the long term, these will be profit-enhancing activities. John F. Lundgren: Simply said, you need to do the installations to keep the pump primed to generate the future recurring revenue. It's always a challenge to balance the -- balance the mix and balance the timing. But it's the nature of the business. And the larger the install, the more of a short-term challenge it is with the -- yet, at the same time, the greater the long-term reward. Operator : And our next question is from Tim Wojs from Baird. Timothy Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Just on European CDIY, really strong growth there again. I guess what type of growth should we expect going forward there? I know you said new products and retail expansion has been a driver, I guess. But can you give us some color on what might be in the pipeline there? And especially if comps get more difficult in the 2015, what we should expect for growth? Donald Allan : I'll take that one. So yes, we -- obviously, we talked about how pleased we are with the performance in CDIY Europe. Jim went through that in a great deal of detail. There's been a lot of activities around new product introductions, new customer listings, some new brands put on products that didn't exist before in the European marketplace, such as the Stanley FatMax brand on power tools, so some great examples of that. And I do think there's momentum to continue that into 2015 in the sense of having new product introductions, expansion of some of the things that we did in certain countries into other countries within Europe that we haven't penetrated yet. I wouldn't expect to see high single-digit revenue performance, but I do expect them to outperform the market as a result and continue to have share gains. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Wood from Macquarie Capital. Mike Wood - Macquarie Research : I wanted to focus in on the CDIY business. The CDIY sales in North America for Stanley took a while to reflect the housing recovery, given there was a considerable lag. Now we're starting to see building product companies reflect more tepid growth in end markets that are slower compared to last year. What are you able to do -- or what are you planning to do proactively in the North American CDIY business to get out in front of the curve from a cost or share gain perspective? James M. Loree: Well, I think what we're doing is exactly what we did in the quarter, which is we're basically driving new product innovation as hard as we ever have. As I said in my remarks, that new product innovation resulted in 3 to 5 points, at a minimum, of contribution to revenue growth. John F. Lundgren: So 1/3 to 1/2 of the growth. James M. Loree: Yes, which also drives profit growth because you mix into higher-margin new products. And so it's a growth -- it's an innovation machine right now, which is clearly -- I mean, I can guarantee you that there are significant share gains going on in the U.S. and in Europe and, frankly, globally. I mean, this business has grown its market share significantly over the last 4 years, and it will continue to do so. Now we don't see any near-term abatement in the CDIY business U.S. market. It is largely DIY-driven, much more so than new construction driven. New construction, when it hits and the lag occurs and so forth, that will be an added bonus. But we did not ride that curve up in the last couple of quarters, like some of the building products companies did, and we certainly aren't going to ride it down, having not ridden it up. So I wouldn't correlate us quite as closely to the building product companies as your remarks seem to imply as well. John F. Lundgren: Yes. Just to help you, Mike, I think you're aware of this, perhaps not. For the 10, 11 years I've been here, and I think for the 100 years before that, we have been 3 to 9 months, so take the midpoint, 6 months, behind any significant change in North American residential construction. That's just the nature of our business, the wallboard folks and the timber folks and those who are involved in foundations, et cetera, are obviously at the beginning of that program, and we're closer to the end. So the lag, to use your words, not -- and Jim, I think, described it well. He just didn't put a number on it. That's been going on for 100 years, and we don't anticipate that it's going to change. Operator : Our last question is from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. William W. Wong - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : It's actually Will Wong on for Mike. Don, thanks for providing the additional color regarding the cost cuts. The company has initiated cost-cutting actions over the last 2 or 3 years to offset weakness in end markets as well as FX and we're just wondering how long this can continue without cutting into the core capabilities for growth and operations, but your license fees appear to be unplanned and reactive rather than proactive? Donald Allan : Well, I think we -- for those -- as I mentioned, for those of you who have followed us over the years, we are very proactive about looking at certain headwinds we see and how we're going to react to it. And so you can describe that as reactive or you can describe it proactive. I look at it as proactive. At the same time, I look at our company and I see, every year, significant productivity programs that occur in the supply chain, productivity programs that incur in our SG&A costs that we never talk about. We just do those every year, and those are the more proactive things that you're describing. They need to happen to continue to enhance our profitability to allow us to deal with occasional periods of time when we have commodity price pressures, et cetera. We don't like to sit back and just let things come at us and then not do anything about it. Our response is to do something about it. And what we're basically saying is that we are going to take a proactive approach to a headwind that with -- become a reality in the last 30 days. And we're going to do it in a way that is surgical in nature. It's going to be a combination of continued evolution of the Stanley and Black & Decker merger. It's going to be the continued improvement of the Security profitability, Europe and -- specifically, as Jim and I both talked about it, and it's also going to be the continued enhancement of the efficiency and effectiveness of our functions and our corporate overhead. These are all things that we need to do every year and sometimes we accelerate some of these things to deal with headwinds that come at us quickly. John F. Lundgren: Yes. And just, again, to quantify, we've said this before in a lot of calls, but what Don's talking about, the proactive or ongoing nature of our business, particularly to CDIY and IAR, for that matter, the tools business. It's as simple as -- and real prices have declined 1% to 2% a year, let's say, 1% for the last 15 years, real prices. We get price by mixing up, by being -- by mixing into higher-margin items and a good price discipline. But with gross margins round numbers of 35%, real prices declining 1% a year, if you don't get net 3% productivity every year, your margins would decline. Look at the math, our CDI margins are not declining. So if you exclude all the new headwinds to which Don's referring to, particularly foreign currency, emerging market growth, just to stay in the game you need 3% productivity every year to offset 1% real price declines, and we've been doing that for a long time. I think Don can account for 15 years of it. Donald Allan : Yes. John F. Lundgren: And that's just part of our DNA. That's part of SFS that we don't talk about too much. But I just kind of want to steer you away from anything we're doing, is we see something going wrong and the knee-jerk reaction is to fix it. That's a necessity, too. We wouldn't be where we were this year if we hadn't done a whole lot of those programs. As Don described, the level of unanticipated and uncontrollable macroeconomic headwinds we faced, yet we're plodding along with a pretty successful year relative to expectations. Operator : Our next question is from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates. Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Don, can you just talk a little bit about some of the cash flow items that are dropping below the free cash flow line? I think one seems to be on the head settlements and then there's a lot of grouped in the other line, about $200 million so far this year, and I think last year is about $30 million. Can you just maybe explain what those are? And then let us know if there's anything that you'd expect along those lines in fourth quarter or next year. Donald Allan : Yes. The other line in operating cash flow is where you see the impact of all the reduced restructuring payments. Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC: And was it down on the -- in the financing investing side? Donald Allan : Well, that would simply just be the activity around commercial paper and financing. And as we go through the year, we see fluctuations in there. We tend to increase our commercial lines, paper lines as the year begins because we have cash outflows in the operating levels. And then as the year goes on and we have our strong fourth quarter, as I described, that slowly and gradually goes away, and you'll see that this year. You do have some other type of currency and hedging activities that do happen below there, but we could certainly walk you through that in a little more detail off-line. Operator : And our next question is from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : The question is -- the questions I have are really on the mid-price point. You mentioned that the launches are pacing to expectations. I guess the question is, are your distribution build-outs where they need to be? And Jim, I think you made some passing reference to some pressures that are being felt by some of those distributors. Can you just talk about what you might be doing to support those distributors, such that the fourth quarter and beyond isn't at risk in terms of the growth? James M. Loree: Well, I mean, we're doing everything we can, obviously. We're not going to overextend our sales from a credit point of view with distributors in markets that are relatively volatile and weak. So there's only so much you can do in terms of financial support, and we're certainly not giving significant extended terms or anything like that. You'd certainly see that in the working capital if we were doing that. So what it really boils down to is distributor training and end user kind of support, so through advertising, through having feet-on-the-street, working with the end users to try to stimulate demand and construction projects, those types of things, creating awareness for the products in the market. But this is just going to take its course. We're not going to jam these products into channels. We're going to allow them to gradually kind of take root and let the products speak for themselves. And I'd say we've done a pretty good job about 1.5 years ago of sort of sprinkling the resources into the various markets. And what we're also doing right now is we've done a study of our sales force effectiveness in managing this distribution channel across all the different countries. And we're looking at the emerging markets right now as sort of a portfolio of countries, and we're saying, \"Okay, we had -- we added about 300 feet-on-the-street, 200 salespeople, 100 marketing people during that time frame.\" And now we're kind of looking at that resource allocation and saying, \"Okay, number one, where are the folks effective? And are there certain folks who are more effective than others?\" Of course, there are, so some rank ordering, some performance evaluation, some changing out some of the folks who are nonperformers. And then the other piece of the activity is to look at some reallocation of resources based on the economic outlook for various countries. So for instance, we wouldn't want to have a -- an army of people in Venezuela trying to sell products when there's no market. So those type of resources could be reallocated to countries such as Colombia, which are -- which is very, very robust right now, so that kind of process, looking at the whole picture of doing the resource reallocation. So no incremental costs of any significance, however, more effectiveness. That's really what we're looking for. But this is not going to be a -- given the market status that we are in right now, this is not going to be a huge sensation. Don't look for 20% growth because of the new products or 10% growth. This is going to be -- will keep us in the game, drive market share quietly, market share increases steadily, methodically. And then when the markets come back, there'll be a lot more share for us and lot more growth. John F. Lundgren: Yes. Importantly, Doug, the key is, as Jim said in his presentation, made in the market for the market. In our history, if you go way back, and you followed us a long time, we would make western-specification products, then we try to take 10% of the costs out and sell it for 20% less. And it was a strain on margin -- it's not quite that simple, but it was a strain on margin nor were the products at a price point that appealed to the distributors in some of these emerging markets where wage rates are so much lower and things of that nature. So the acquisition of GQ which we've talked about, leveraging that capability across a broader portfolio, our Design To Value program where we're truly starting with a blank piece of paper, building these tools from scratch with no extra cost or no extra feature that the end user isn't willing or able to pay for. That's what's driving this. And as I say, it's early days, but we're encouraged thus far. Operator : Our next question is from Liam Burke from Wunderlich Securities. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division : IAR was very strong, particularly in Europe and the U.S. Was there any particular vertical that showed inordinate strength? Or did you just see strength across-the-board? James M. Loree: I mean, there was -- I wouldn't say across-the-board. I mean, mining is still weak. But generally speaking, pretty strong. General manufacturing, very strong. But lot of strength in various verticals. Operator : And our next question is from Jeremie Capron from CLSA. John F. Lundgren: In Rich Kwas', I'll say, multi-faceted question, but it was an important one, and as Don was processing, he didn't get to it on the sustainability of CDIY margins. It's probably worth a word from Don before we close. Donald Allan : Yes. So Rich was asking about the 16.5% margin we saw in Q3, what's the sustainability? What does it mean going into 2015? What I will tell you is that for this year, as I mentioned in the guidance, we'll probably see 60, 70 basis point improvement in the CDIY margins year-over-year, and it's due to a lot of the great things that Jim walked through and that we've discussed through the first 9 months of this year. We expect continued improvement in the margins going into '15. As we all know, quarters change and fluctuate. But on a full year basis, we would expect that we would continue to see improvement. I think the next step and hurdle is we want to try to move them towards 16%. We will see a little bit of pressure against them next year because of the FX that we talked about and maybe all the cost actions don't get allocated directly to CDIY. But even given that, I do expect to see some year-over-year improvement. Operator : And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Gregory Waybright : Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's fourth quarter 2014 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is John Lundgren, Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our Web site as well as on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 p.m. today. The replay number and access code are in our press release. This morning, John, Jim and Don will review our fourth quarter results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we\u2019re going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is, therefore, possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren. John F. Lundgren: Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. We\u2019ve got a great deal to talk about this morning. So I\u2019m going to run very quickly through the highlights. So Jim Loree and Don Allan can get into more detail and then we can jump right into the Q&A. Looking at fourth quarter highlights, revenue expanded 7% organically led by CDIY was up 11% and strong performance in industrial up 5%. But it's also noticeable that Security expanded in the quarter with mid single-digit organic growth in North American emerging markets and flat performance in Europe. Operating margin for the quarter was 13.7% which was up 50 basis points versus the prior year. Volume, sharp cost focus and pricing benefits were partially offset by the currency headwinds. The currency issues that you\u2019ve heard a lot about intensified in the fourth quarter, as we absorbed a headwind of approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter, which was $10 million worse than we expected. And that brought the total for the year to approximately $85 million of foreign exchange headwinds, a combination of translational and transactional. The Security turnaround continues and we were encouraged that the European operating margin rate improved sequentially and versus prior year by approximately 110 basis points. Our fourth quarter capped an encouraging year. So I'll just take a minute and look at the results for the total year, revenues up 5% organically with CDIY delivering 7%, Industrial 5%, and Security flat. Earnings per share grew 14% on an adjusted basis and now have converged with our GAAP earnings per share. Free cash flow was a record almost $1 billion as the team delivered over one full working capital turn improvement up to the level of 9.2 working capital turns for the total Company. And our cash flow return on investment improved 390 basis points to 13% as our record cash flow coupled with our decapitalization plan improved this metric. It\u2019s probably important to note, Don can cover it more detail if need be, 340 of the 390 basis points of that improvement was operational where about 50 basis points of the improvement was due to the FX devaluation impact on equity. So arguably one small benefit of the foreign exchange headwind that we\u2019ve been facing. And finally, we\u2019re initiating GAAP EPS guidance of $5.65 to $5.85 per share, 5% to 9% growth, absorbing foreign exchange headwinds currently estimated at $140 million for 2015 versus the $85 million I discussed in 2014. But it also includes free cash flow estimate of at least $1 billion and Don is going to cover that in more detail when we get to the outlook. So moving on, let's take a look at where the growth came from in the fourth quarter and for the year. We achieved strong volume growth across developed and emerging markets. Europe remains strong, particularly strong across CDIY and Industrial performed well. Pricing actions within emerging markets and surgical pricing actions across the remainder of our businesses are contributing to organic growth. But with this being said, currency headwinds intensified as we move through the quarter and as a consequence dampened our organic growth performance by about four percentage points as the dollar strengthened against most currencies. And again, Don has got some more granularity on that, so I\u2019ll not delve on it at this point in our presentation. From a regional perspective, demand in the U.S was healthy in both retail and industrial. Importantly, in retail we had strong sell-in as well as strong sell-through in our retail channels. Jim will discuss that and where we stand in terms of inventories as we kick off 2015. Europe showed some exceptional share gains. Most noticeably in CDIY, but also in industrial both within IAR and the automotive end markets, as those markets are likely tracking flat to slightly up at best. And Jim is going to talk more about the drivers of that performance. Emerging markets were heavily influenced by strong shipments in our Engineered Fastening Electronics business in Asia, but also experienced good solid growth in our tools business in Latin America. So when we put it all together for the full-year, our volume -- organic volume growth and performance outpaced GDP in each and every region where we do business. And that's a testament to the organic growth initiatives that we\u2019ve discussed on previous calls. Let me turn it over to Jim Loree to get into some more detail on the segments and some of the programs that are driving those results. James M. Loree: Okay. Thank you, John. Along those lines we\u2019ve made a very determined effort over the past two years to ramp up organic growth and importantly translated into operating leverage. So it's fulfilling to close out 2014 with a record 7% organic growth quarter, our highest full year OM rates since the Stanley Black & Decker merger and record full-year EPS and cash flow. We also, as John mentioned, achieved 9.2 working capital turns, a first for us, which contributed to a 130% cash conversion ratio for the year. And it's especially encouraging that all this was accomplished in the face of $85 million or about little more than $0.40 a share of unplanned currency headwinds amidst a slowing global growth environment outside the U.S. It's clear that our operating management team is executing at a high level and it\u2019s charged up and more than prepared to continue to drive results in a challenging environment. For the business level commentary, I\u2019ll start with CDIY, which served up another outstanding quarter. Organic growth was 11% against the 6% comp in 4Q \u201913. All major geographies contributed, with North America up 14%, Europe once again overcoming challenging end markets, up 7% organically, and emerging markets up 7%. Total revenue was also up 7% and operating margin grew 18% demonstrating impressive operating leverage. Gains resulted from cost leveraged, modestly positive price, operations productivity, and tight SG&A cost management, which more than offset severe currency headwinds. Across the global CDIY product lines, organic strength was once again broad-based with professional power tools up an exceptional 20% and Tools and Storage up 10%, Fastening & Accessories 7% and Consumer products up 2%. CDIY new product development momentum in concert with a business wide commitment to commercial excellence and continued exploitation of the revenue synergies from the merger are driving both revenue and profit growth. The DeWalt DC brushless line powered by electronically commutated motors is off to a very strong start. This fast growing category in which we enjoy a substantial lead already represents 20% of the cordless market. And putting the Company\u2019s leading array of brands to work across categories also continues to further enhance our strong customer partnerships as well as produce favorable POS results. Examples abound, such as DeWalt storage, adhesives and hand tools, Stanley FatMax power tools and Bostitch hand and power tools, which are all producing meaningful gains. CDIY\u2019s robust supply chain capabilities developed through many years of continuous improvement via the Stanley fulfillment system have continued to support its commercial successes and also enabled CDIY to achieve 10 working capital turns for the first time. While global growth has been decelerating in most areas outside the U.S., underlying U.S tool demand remains solid as DIY fundamentals are strong and new construction markets are moving in the right direction albeit with some choppiness. So North America once again enjoyed the benefits of combining excellent commercial execution in a market with solid fundamentals, the result being 14% organic growth at a positive share trend. Now shifting over to Europe, where the markets remain weak, but the performance continues to be impressive. Here our team acknowledges the reality -- market realities and understands that strong growth is only possible with their commercial engine hitting on all cylinders. We call it commercial excellence. That is what they\u2019ve accomplished over the past seven quarters, accumulating a 7% organic growth track record during that time. And their success has derived from robust new product commercialization, brand leverage, growing customer partnerships and excellent sales in channel execution. The other CDIY growth story for the quarter was emerging markets, up 7% organically. Notable in the face of high volatility and continued downward revision to GDP estimates, most recently in Argentina, Brazil, and Russia. Nonetheless, Latin America was up 9% organically and the Middle East Africa region was also very strong, a combination more than offsetting weakness in Russia, Turkey, and China. Our major NPD initiative into mid price point tools across all these developing markets is coming at a time when end-user said to be more cost conscious with their purchases. The program is less tracking to plan and is expected to contribute greater than $50 million of incremental revenue in 2015 as it continues to gain momentum. And as we look ahead for CDIY, we anticipate continued strong performance. The winning formula of organizational agility, global scale, robust NPD, great brands and tight control of costs should more than compensate for lackluster markets in Europe and some of the emerging regions as well as a strengthening dollar environment. In this regard, with our CDIY and IAR businesses, both operating from positions of strength, after an expensive evaluation we recently took the action to combine these two businesses into one global tools and storage unit with revenues totaling about $7 billion. While there are meaningful cost savings associated with this consolidation, the overwhelming rationale for this move is to harness the extraordinary go to market potential of our total tools franchise.  This unified approach will enable us to capture the benefits and competitive advantages of being the world's largest branded tool company. We are the only player with major positions in each of power tools, hand tools, accessories and storage, as well as significant global channel presence in all four major end markets, construction, DIY, industrial, and auto repair. In addition, we intend to leverage the unique organizational strengths of both CDIY and IAR, including technology, product development, and global footprint across a larger base. This exciting next step in our evolution should be viewed as a growth enhancer and a logical extension of the Stanley Black & Decker integration that has produced stellar results over the last five years or so. Now turning to Industrial. Industrial this quarter once again logged a solid organic growth quarter, up 5% and maintained its margin in the mid 15% zone. However, FX pressures weighed down total revenue and operating margin growth, which were up 1% and flat respectively. For IAR, organic growth of 5% benefited from good performances in both developed and developing countries. North America was up 8%, Europe was up 3% organically in the quarter, capping off a plus 7% performance for the year and IAR emerging markets came in up 5% with dynamics very similar to those experienced in CDIY. Engineered Fastening grew an impressive 10% organically in 4Q with automotive up 11%, demonstrating market penetration gains in view of light vehicle production levels, which were up 1%. The industrial portion of Engineered Fastening was also a good organic story with growth up at similar levels as we supported a major customer\u2019s very strong new product launches. We continue to love this Engineered Fastening business, which grew to $1.5 billion in revenues, produced full-year operating margin growth of 20%, and achieved a record 18% operating margin rate. Infrastructure was down 10% organically as lower oil prices and deferral of pipeline projects begin to take their toll on our oil and gas business, which represents 3% of total company revenues. All in all, it was a solid quarter for Industrial in view of the currency issues and downward pressure on GDP outside of the U.S. Moving to Security. It was a very important and modestly successful quarter for Security, which in addition to its third consecutive quarter of stable OM rates in the 12% zone, achieved positive organic growth with a plus 3% performance. Total Security revenues declined 1% as FX weighed down total growth and North America emerging markets was up 5% organically with strength from both the vertical market initiative and from Access Technologies. Security Europe was flat organically for the first time since 2011, the year Niscayah was acquired, that the organic rate was not negative. While that is admittedly comparing against the low bar, the trend is in line with our turnaround plan and that\u2019s encouraging. Europe OM percent was up in the mid to high single-digit range, up 110 basis points versus a year-ago and representing the third consecutive sequential quarterly improvement. Order rates in both North America and Europe continued on their positive trend and attrition in Europe remained on target at 12%. The organization has responded well to the leadership adjustments made in the fourth quarter and both North America and Europe are poised to deliver organic revenue growth and be accretive to operating margin in 2015. While we expect the overall Security recovery to be slow and steady during the next several quarters, we do expect it to continue to gain momentum as 2015 progresses. The decision to divest Spain and Italy, previously announced, will remove structural obstacles from the European recovery. In summary, Security has achieved stability during the last several quarters and appears to have bottomed. In this regard, it should know longer be viewed as a major downside risk, but rather as a modest earnings growth opportunity in the near-term. The next step in the evolution is to demonstrate a sustained ability to generate organic growth, while further improving cost efficiency. This will play out over the coming quarters. And depending on the success of that trajectory, it is possible to envision OM rate expansion moving toward Company line average over time. So while Security still have has a way to go, especially in Europe, the turnaround is on track and we expect it to become an earnings growth contributor in the very near future. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Don Allan for commentary on the financials, including our 2015 outlook. Donald Allan : Thank you, Jim. We are very pleased with our 2014 cash flow performance, which resulted in $991 million of free cash flow, just shy of a $1 billion. The free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was a healthy 130% as you just heard from Jim. As we experienced during the majority of 2014, our free cash flow benefited from increased operational earnings, lower restructuring payments, and reduced capital expenditures. The Q4 free cash flow was stronger than expected due to these factors combined with an outstanding working capital turn performance. Due to certain seasonality aspects of our CDIY business, we experienced a significant positive working capital benefit in the fourth quarter of every year. As a result, we tend to generate approximately 60% of our annual free cash flow in the fourth quarter. However, our businesses performed above and beyond this seasonality trend, and drove working capital turns to 9.2 times which is up more than a full turn versus 2013. We indicated in October that our objective was to push towards the year-end. Our businesses did an excellent job exceeding this expectation through the continued use of the Stanley fulfillment system. It is exciting to see our long-term objective of 10 working capital turns very close on the horizon, hopefully within the next two years. This strong cash flow performance allowed us to achieve our debt deleveraging goals for 2014 and we were able to commence the previously communicated share repurchase program in the fourth quarter through the use of some equity forward share repurchase derivatives. Now let's review our 2015 EPS and cash flow outlook on Page 10. As indicated by John earlier, we\u2019re establishing 2015 guidance at $5.65 to $5.85 of EPS, and free cash flow of at least $1 billion. As indicated throughout 2014 by myself, John, and Jim, we\u2019re changing to GAAP guidance in 2015 due to the lower levels of M&A and expected one-time charges. However, we recognize all your current 2015 estimates are before these one-time charges. Therefore to provide transparency in this conversion we had disclosed on this page that our EPS guidance range includes approximately $0.25 in restructuring charges. On a comparable basis to our adjusted 2014 results just reported today, our EPS guidance range excluding restructuring charges is $5.90 to $6.10 EPS. Greg and Dennis will work with all of you over the next several days to ensure this conversion in guidance is clearly understood. There are several factors within our annual guidance which we consider significant and I would like to explain in some detail. Starting with some key tailwinds. The first item is we expect organic growth to be up 3% to 4%, which will be translating into EPS of $0.45 to $0.55, which is a similar leverage ratio we\u2019ve seen over the past few years. The organic growth is slightly lower than the 5% organic growth we just experienced in 2014 as markets outside the U.S are likely to be challenged in 2015. Specifically, we expect emerging markets to be volatile and organic growth in many emerging countries will be muted by the strength of the U.S dollar or political unrest. Additionally, we expect several European markets we serve to be challenged and the outside share gains we\u2019ve achieved in CDIY over the past few years although have been fantastic, we believe it will become more difficult to repeat those on an ongoing basis. Also we do anticipate a slowdown in our oil and gas business from lower crude oil prices. The next item related to tailwind is the execution of various cost and customer pricing actions during 2015, which will be a tailwind of approximately $0.50. The SG&A cost actions represent a further cost rationalization of certain areas in our Company. Specifically, in the Security business we\u2019re reducing back-office costs and overhead costs to improve profitability while at the same time we want to enhance our SG&A investments to stimulate growth within the verticals. We also have taken surgical cost actions in a few functions in other businesses and at corporate headquarters. Additionally, as Jim mentioned, we\u2019ve decided to combine our CDIY and IAR businesses to better serve our various tools and storage customers and further accelerate growth. This combination is generating from solid back-office cost savings as you'd expect. All of these cost actions commenced over the past two months and will continue to be implemented in the first half of 2015 to ensure we achieve our profitability objectives. The 2015 impact of these cost actions represents approximately 50% of the $0.50 EPS tailwind. The remaining 50% of this tailwind relates more directly to actions we can take in response to FX pressures, specifically key strategic pricing increases for products that we import into the Canadian, Brazilian, and European markets, as well as pursuing commodity deflation opportunities with many of our suppliers. The commodity deflation we\u2019re currently focused on is in the areas of diesel fuel, resin, and copper. However, we continue to monitor this area for other future opportunities as the year evolves. The final tailwind shown on page 10 is the continuation of the share repurchase program in 2015. And we expect an EPS benefit to be approximately $0.09 to $0.12 during the year as the repurchase program will be staggered throughout 2015 and in line with our cash flow generation as it occurs during the year. And many of you know, a large part of our cash occurs in the back half of each year. Now shifting to headwinds. John mentioned the FX headwind we\u2019ve experienced in the fourth quarter, while we like many other U.S multinationals have a significant headwind for 2015 related to foreign currencies as they weakened versus the U.S dollar. As a result, we now expect approximately $140 million of currency pressure, given the strengthening of the U.S dollar over the past 90 days. This will generate $0.70 to $0.75 EPS headwind for 2015. I'll provide more detail insights relating to FX impacting our Company on the next slide, and more importantly, how we hedge these risks and respond to operations. A few other items of note related to annual EPS on the left side of the page you can see. First is the tax rate will be relatively consistent for 2014, which means approximately 21%. Also I want to remind everyone to recognize the seasonality of revenue and profitability in the first quarter, as it is historically the lowest revenue and profit quarter for us. We expect the normal operating profit seasonality again this year in 2015. However, additionally we'll expect higher levels of restructuring charges and higher levels of impacts of foreign currency in the first quarter of \u201915 versus the first quarter of 2014. And specifically related to restructuring, in Q1 2015, the charges will approximate 60% of the full-year $50 million restructuring estimate. Therefore, Q1 2015 EPS will approximate 16% of the full-year EPS. Let's turn to the right side of the page and discuss a little bit of details around our segments for 2015. We expect mid single-digit organic revenue growth and solid operating margin rate expansion year-over-year in both the CDIY and industrial segments due to volume leverage, price actions and cost controls which will more than offset the significant currency impact. Our Security segment will have a modest organic growth number for the full-year. The organic growth in Security North America and emerging markets will complement an improving performance in Security Europe, where we anticipate growth to begin to emerge in the second half of the year. Profitability in Security will continue to improve from volume leverage and cost actions, which will more than offset the foreign currency impact. We expect solid year-over-year profit improvement as we continue to progress forward with our Security Europe multi-year recovery plan. Although the currency challenges have been unrelenting and they\u2019re causing a significant 2015 headwind, we believe we\u2019re taking all the correct actions to combat these headwinds through our cost control actions and customer pricing initiatives, while at the same time ensuring we continue to strategically invest in organic growth. This approach will allow us to achieve solid operating leverage and healthy organic growth, but muted total revenue growth due to FX. Specifically, earnings will expand 5% to 9% on an overall revenue outlook of flat to a decline of 1% in 2015. So moving to the next slide and a little bit of discussion on foreign currency. As you\u2019re all aware, U.S dollar strengthened during late September and October against the four major currencies which impact us, Canadian dollar, European euro, Brazilian real and the Argentinean peso. At the time, this created a negative currency impact of approximately $45 million to $55 million for 2015. However, we\u2019ve all seen the additional devaluations in most currencies versus the U.S dollar since mid November through the last several days. This included other currencies which impact us, such as the British pound, Australian dollar, Swedish krona, and Japanese yen. We have finalized our key currency hedging activities for 2015 over the past several months based on yesterday's spot rates. We estimate that 2015 negative currency impact will approximate $140 million versus 2014 and this includes the impact of these currency hedges. The expected 2015 impact is approximately 50% translational and 50% transactional. The transactional impact is due to our extensive global supply chains and primarily related to the importing of finished goods and components into regions such as Latin America, Europe, and Canada. In terms of hedging, our key currencies are materially hedged and as such future volatility on our largest exposures; specifically the Canadian dollar and the European euro have been significantly reduced for the remainder of 2015. As an example, if the euro moved to parity with the U.S dollar gradually over the next five months, we\u2019d only expect an additional $12 million to $15 million P&L impact in 2015. Now I'd like to discuss a few things outside of hedging activities related to currencies and how we respond operationally. We are typically prepared to take additional mitigating actions to offset significant portion -- a significant portion of these currency impacts in the following order. First, as I just mentioned, we pursue customer price increases where large transactional FX headwinds emerged due to us importing U.S dollar based products or components into these countries or regions. The second area is we focus on improving our cost base to the pursuit of commodity deflation in this type of environment. The third area is we look at pulling forward specific plan, cost rationalization projects for various selected businesses and functions. And then, finally we can\u2019t lose sight of the fact that we\u2019ve to continue to improve our localized production and component supply over the long-term. These actions are all well represented in our 2015 guidance as significant tailwinds. All these factors are how we manage a difficult currency environment with a proactive approach that ensures we generate solid earnings growth while balancing our requirement, continuing to invest for future growth. Now let's move to the summarize -- the summary page of our presentation. We are very pleased with our strong 2014 EPS and cash flow performance, despite significant FX pressure and emerging market volatility. We achieved many of the objectives we established in early 2014 such as strong organic growth of 5% supported by innovation and the growth investments continue to blossom [ph]. Tight cost controls and surgical price actions across the entire Company enabled excellent operating leverage to emerge in our P&L. Security Europe continues to perform better and made solid progress on its multi-year transformation. Debt leverage -- leveraging target -- deleveraging targets were met and we took a modest step towards our $1 billion share repurchase program in Q4. And then we exceeded our cash flow return on investment goal and ended the year at the low-end of our long-term range of 12% to 15%. Our focus in 2015 will continue to be on improving the near-term returns and relative performance through the organic growth initiatives, security margin improvement, cost and pricing actions, ongoing working capital focus and the continued rebalance of our capital allocation. We believe this approach will continue to be successful in 2015 and beyond as it positions our Company to deliver on the long-term financial objectives we\u2019ve established. This concludes the presentation portion of the call. And let\u2019s move to Q&A. Gregory Waybright : Great. Don, thank you. John, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning and congratulations on your kind of growth this quarter. Just wanted to focus on price here and -- in light of the raw material deflation, have the discussions with your key customers change in any materially way? And on top of that, given the currency move, have you seen any change in behavior from your European and Japanese competitors? James M. Loree: So this is Jim. The deflation at this point is not material. It\u2019s significant, but not material, and its spread over many, many different businesses and product lines and so forth. So, for any given skew or any given product line, it\u2019s probably no more than a point or two of the total selling price. And we don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t entertain price adjustments unless there is really material inflation, that\u2019s when the customers will get more interested in doing that. And likewise it works the same way on the other side when we have inflation. We don\u2019t pursue inflation based price increases with our major customers until it becomes material. So it\u2019s a -- there is a healthy understanding that for these types of immaterial moves that we don\u2019t rock the boat, if you will. So that\u2019s the kind of approach there. As long as it kind of continues at this pace, we\u2019re looking at maybe $40 million, $50 million of deflation across a 12 -- almost a $12 billion revenue base. And then, the second part of the question \u2026? Gregory Waybright : Well it was on behavior from our European and Japanese customers [indiscernible] it\u2019s important to note where their production is. So, go ahead James. James M. Loree: So, if you look at Bosch and Makita everybody has global footprints with concentration in China. And most folks are using either renminbi or dollar denominated currencies to basically set purchase prices, so -- or the -- and the manufacturing costs are obviously established in those regions as well. Now, so then you take Makita, well Makita has more Japanese manufacturing than say some of the others. Bosch has more European manufacturing than the others. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably for them some opportunity to shift some production to these areas where the currency has gone down. But recognize that in both Japan and in Europe that the labor rates are exceptionally high relative to the emerging markets. So it really takes some pretty significant currency movements on a sustained basis to make it a practical reality for them to be able to shift a lot of manufacturing. And we also have a fairly substantial ability to shift production into Europe with our manufacturing footprint there. We really don\u2019t have much of a Japanese footprint at all. So, there is some movement that\u2019s possible. I think it\u2019s really at the margin and not really a significant impact. Operator : Our next question is from Tim Wojs from Baird. Please go ahead. Timothy Wojs : Yes. Hi, guys. I guess, just to talk about the CDIY outperformance there. I think in the press release you talked about share gains. I\u2019m just curious where the share gain is coming from? Is it more shelf space at retail or is it better sell-through, is it just better product? Maybe just a little bit more color there and then maybe what's in the pipeline around sustaining that growth rate as we get into 2015? John F. Lundgren: Yes, Tim, this is John. The answer is all of the above. You saw the organic growth rate particularly in Europe where the market is flat at best. And as Jim pointed out in his segment overview, we\u2019ve had six consecutive quarters of organic growth averaging 7%. So when you\u2019re growing 7% in the market that\u2019s growing 0% to 2% on a very best case, there\u2019s a significant share gain in Europe. We\u2019re gaining share in U.S. Again, I think Jim gave some of the wide, but to help we\u2019ve recouped all of the lost share when legacy Black & Decker was a little bit slow, but for very good reason that we\u2019ve talked about to convert from NiCad to Lithium-ion. That share gain has been -- that share loss has been completely recaptured and we\u2019ve got the offense on the field specifically with the brushless initiative that Jim talked about. That represents about 20% of the market and we\u2019ve about 40% of it. So that\u2019s driving particularly our top professional power tool gains in North America. I think the other bright spot specifically is, is sell-through. On occasion this time if you\u2019re our -- our customers it\u2019s quite well-known. Keep a very close eye on their inventories in the month of January because that\u2019s the end of their fiscal year. January tends to be a slow shipment month and we make up for some of that in February and March. The sell-through was outstanding in December and January. So it\u2019s sell-in and sell-through which translates to share gains. Again, when our organic growth is about 2x the rate of the market it has to be share gain as long as it\u2019s selling through. Lastly, it\u2019s been overwhelmingly driven by both ongoing and arguably breakthrough, new product introduction. Our vitality index is in the 30s which is quite high for a business of that nature. Both in Europe and the U.S., the sources has been a little bit different. U.S. has been professional power tools primarily. Europe it\u2019s been right across the board. Hand tools, power tools and even home products, some tremendous innovation in a segment of the business or sub-segment that\u2019s more important in Europe than it is in the U.S. But doing particularly well and the words in the press release said expanded customer relationships, that\u2019s exactly what that means. We\u2019ve gotten new distribution with customers particularly in Europe but elsewhere, expanded shelf space and new distribution displacing both competitors and in some cases private label that\u2019s also helped that growth. So simple answer all of the above, but that gives us a lot more color on where it\u2019s coming from. James M. Loree: And maybe just to follow on very briefly. When you take last year, $300 million of revenue from new product introductions in CDIY over a 1000 skews and then put those new products to work by leveraging them across our -- what I call in my comments, our leading array of brands. But the flexibility that we\u2019ve with our brands with DeWalt, with Black & Decker, with Bostitch, with Stanley FatMax which is growing significantly, Porter Cable and so on. The ability to leverage those new products across those brands and then across the global geographies at the same time with a scale that we\u2019ve managed to put together with both hand tools and power tools in the global footprint of the company, that\u2019s how we\u2019re doing it. And then the other term I used was commercial excellence. We\u2019ve committed to commercial excellence, and that means all those cylinders in that commercial engine are hitting at the same time. You put all that together and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve created is this commercial machine which is out there gaining share in many, many different places around the world. John F. Lundgren: Yes, Jim thanks for that. And just without being more specific than we need to be on this call, just one anecdote or great example of what Jim talked about. Stanley FatMax power tools, certain North American customers and certain large retail customers elsewhere in the world, it\u2019s the fast -- one of the fastest growing power tool brands in the market and four years ago that didn\u2019t exist, because Stanley didn\u2019t have the capability to make a power tool that would merit or justify putting the FatMax name on it. And its as Jim suggested, it\u2019s a tremendous synergy from a merger that\u2019s now four years, almost five in the rearview mirror, but still continues to show some great results in terms of our top line opportunity and brand penetration. Operator : Our next question is from Jeremie Capron from CLSA. Jeremie Capron : Hi, good morning. A question on the reorganization that you talked about, in terms of combining the various tools businesses under a single umbrella. Can you give us a little more detail in terms of the timeline here and what's the ultimate goal that we\u2019re looking at a single business division for IAR and CDIY? And the second leg to this question relates to the charges that were booked in the fourth quarter. It looks like you booked more charges than guided just three months ago, is this related to that combination or anything else in there? John F. Lundgren: Yes, this is John. I\u2019ll talk about the combination and Don can give you the specifics on the charges. You\u2019re directionally right, but your logic is -- you don\u2019t have quite all the background, but Don will touch on it. Look, the combination just makes tremendous sense. It isn\u2019t the entire industrial segment importantly and CDIY. It\u2019s our industrial tool business and our professional tool business, specifically the IAR business and industrial storage combined with CDIY to take -- to make about a $7 billion business and clearly the largest tool business in the world with leading positions in all four vertical markets as Jim discussed in his comments. I think very importantly there are modest cost savings associated with that which tail in comparison to the revenue synergies that was on in two areas. The combination of best practices in new product development, our product review board process and everything we do to reflect customer input and marketplace needs to more quickly develop, commercialize and introduce and sell-through new products across both of those businesses will be a tremendous advantage, secondly to apply technology that\u2019s applicable or formally utilized in one business to the other and lastly the commercial excellence that Jim talked about, best people, best practices in each and every channel. So in this particular case, we\u2019re very good at taking cost up, we\u2019ve proven that. There will be some backroom efficiencies as a result of this. The driver here though is top line synergy, organic growth by combining the best of the best, not just similar, and we think of it as the next step in the evolution of the merger of Stanley Black & Decker. And there was enough going on that this natural, if you will, internal combination; it would have been premature to try to do that before now. We\u2019re going to do it now. It will be reflected in our segment reporting going forward. Let me have Don talk about that a little bit and then give you a little more granularity on the charges. Donald Allan : Yes. So, as John just touched on, the segment reporting for the Company will change in the first quarter 10-Q because the completion of this combination of the two businesses will happen in the first quarter. So, we\u2019ll still have three segments. We\u2019ll have a tools and storage segment which will include CDIY and IAR. We\u2019ll have an industrial segment which will include Engineered Fastening in our infrastructure businesses, and then we\u2019ll have Security in the current format, so not a dramatic change just moving one business into another in that change. Related to restructuring specifically, we indicated in the October earnings call that, we were evaluating additional restructuring of up to $10 million to $25 million beyond the initial guidance of $25 million. We actually recorded about $54 million in the fourth quarter, so it was at the high-end of that range. So it was very close to our expectations. A portion of that was related to the combination of these two businesses. A lot of the charges that took place in the fourth quarter were more associated to the U.S. activities, and what's going to occur in 2015 are more related to European activity. Operator : Our next question is from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo. Richard Kwas : Hi, good morning everyone. John F. Lundgren: Good morning. Richard Kwas : Just a question around guidance, in terms of the CRC-Evans business, what type of decline are you assuming within industrial given the lower oil prices and that\u2019s obviously a high margin business, so there is some margin impact. And then second, are you assuming any benefit within CDIY or even industrial with regards to the lower oil prices, meaning demand benefit or is that assumed to be potential optionality in terms of the organic growth guidance for the year? Donald Allan : Hi, Rich. It\u2019s Don, I\u2019ll take that. As far CRC-Evans goes, as John or Jim mentioned, just first of all a reminder, it is 3% of our total revenue just to give you a size -- sizing of it. It is considered a small pressure to us year-over-year. We do expect that business to probably see 10% or 20% of revenue decline, \u201914 versus \u201915, and it\u2019s really just due to what we\u2019ve seen of this halting of all the activity around construction pipeline or constructions of the pipeline. But frankly it\u2019s not a very material impact to us, but it does have a marginal impact. Related to your question around gas prices and oil prices and how does that, could that have a positive impact on buying activity in CDIY or industrial and whether we factored that? We have not specifically factored that into our guidance. It\u2019s something that certainly will evaluate as time goes on over the next 12 months, but right now that\u2019s not specifically factored into our guidance. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Patrick Murray : Hi, good morning. This is Patrick Murray on for Mike. So with respect to the FX headwinds, if we\u2019re to see any incremental U.S. dollar appreciation over the course of the year, how much more opportunity beyond what you have incorporated into 2015 guidance do you see is opportunities to offset any incremental U.S. dollar strengthening? Donald Allan : Yes, I think we -- as I mentioned in my comments, we\u2019ve done a lot of hedging activities to try to minimize the future impact. But if the dollar continued to strengthen versus all our major currencies like it has been over the last 30 days, there would be an impact. I gave an example of the euro where, if the euro did move to parity over the next five months, i.e. but he middle of the year, that would probably be about $12 million to $15 million additional headwind to us. So, certainly we\u2019ve looked at those different sensitivities and scenarios and their possibility. As far as how we offset them, yes we have evaluated different options and -- if you remember that slide as I walk through, what we do, we first look at pricing with our customers in certain markets where we\u2019re importing the products. So, if there\u2019s changes related to those currencies we have to evaluate whether we want to go back with additional price increases. The second was commodities. So, if that environment generates more commodity deflation, do we have additional opportunities that we could go after with our suppliers, and then the third area was, cost rationalization? I don\u2019t think there is a huge opportunity in that particular category, but there are few things that we could do if we saw a continued pressure around foreign currencies. So, I think we\u2019ve done enough sensitivity analysis to feel comfortable that we can deal with a reasonable level of continued strengthening over the next three to six months. John F. Lundgren: Yes. And I think to kind of remove the focus from three to six months which is, not what we\u2019re hear to do necessarily, although I know its an important part of trying to build your model. Don, I think was -- hopefully was very helpful in talking about an equal split translation versus transactional. This year it was about, 2014 the FX impact was about 60% transactional, 40% translational. Next year it\u2019s about 50-50, meaning a little less of it is in our control. On the transactional piece, Don talked about everything we can do short-term. Long-term, we were on a global supply chain network that I think Jim described quite eloquently, and the issue is moving sources of supply to the lower cost countries whether its commodities, labor costs, general cost to manufacture. The issue with that in the short-term that I think it\u2019s important to understand, we make premium products in 70% of what we make in terms of tools or 67% are bought by people who do it for a living. The quality standards are extraordinarily high, and it\u2019s very difficult to qualify material or component suppliers in places like Latin America and certain Asian markets quickly. So, despite the fact that opportunity exists, you can rest assure that our supply chain folks are working diligently and vigorously to qualify new suppliers on a longer term basis to allow us more flexibility to shift production -- meaningful pieces of production to weaker currency markets. But that\u2019s something that happens over one to two years, not three to six months, and it\u2019s just an important distinction not to understand. Operator : Our next question is from Wini Clark from UBS. Winifred Clark : Good morning. You noted your organic growth expectations are being muted in \u201915 versus \u201914 by headwinds outside the U.S. Can you talk a bit about what you\u2019re expecting from emerging markets specifically, because while volatility continues their comps are not particularly difficult, and it seems like your MPP initiatives are gaining some momentum. James M. Loree: Yes, it\u2019s Jim. We think that the emerging markets, all else equal in terms of no major change from where we are today, in terms of the environment. It will be slightly higher than our overall line average growth outlook. So, probably mid-single digits pushing, well maybe a little higher than that, but right in that kind of a range. Operator : And our next question is from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. We almost reached the milestone, and no security questions on the call, but I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll flip one in. John F. Lundgren: Thank you. Nobody was listening. Jeffrey Sprague : Yes, it\u2019s nice that you didn\u2019t have to spend that much time on it. But could you give us a little bit more detail on how attrition is running? Where you\u2019re at on the commercial initiatives? And any color you can share just kind of on the sale process for Italy and Spain? John F. Lundgren: Yes, we\u2019re in a good place on all of those. We\u2019re not going to get ahead ourselves on Italy and Spain for obvious reasons, NDAs and things of that nature. I think Jim can give you a lot more granularity on attrition and a few of the other positive momentum. James M. Loree: I think as most people on the call that have been following us know that, we made tremendous progress on attrition in Europe in the last 12 months and really have put in real process. We have people, measurement systems that are tracking it, people that are accountable to manage it. And the results reflect the improvements that we\u2019ve made with respect to the process. And so, getting to that 12% which was something that we put out there when we were running 17%, 18%, we did that within a year. That\u2019s a huge, huge achievement because it enables us to actually have the opportunity to grow now. And what I mean by that is, with -- I\u2019m taking Europe as an example. With recurring revenue as 40% of total revenue, if you are trading at close to 20% rate, you\u2019re digging an 8% revenue hole every year before you even start originating new business. And so, when you get down to 10% to 12% which is more of the industry average, you have a hole that\u2019s substantially smaller closer to 4% of total revenue, and you need order growth in the kind of -- in that range to be able to be flat if you will, and that\u2019s kind of where we are now, where you saw the flat performance in Europe in 4Q. Now what we have to do here is, sustain the attrition at these levels which we think is very doable, and from there we have to kind of rev up the origination machine, but do it in a way where we are going after profitable business and not just cutting prices to get the business, because the other little variable in this whole equation is making sure that the gross margins that you\u2019re taking on with a new business are high enough so that you don\u2019t kind of depress the overall gross margins of the business. And I think the team fully understands that over in Europe. We have new management in place as of the fourth quarter. It\u2019s actually a guy that was the Chief Operating Officer for about a year over there, so he\u2019s very familiar with the situation. We\u2019ve got country -- we\u2019ve got the country managers making a pretty good place. Everybody knows what their plan is. We have the one issue that was operationally impossible to manage because of the market trends and structural issues which was Spain is now as you know going to be divested. And so, I think the table is set for what I described in my comments as, moving forward. We\u2019re going to move forward, I wouldn\u2019t expect substantial growth out of Europe in the next couple of quarters, but I would expect to see it positive. And as we continue to make progress, then we will start to bring in some of these vertical solutions from the U.S. and that\u2019s when you can really expect to see the growth start to really rev up in Europe and become more consistent with what we\u2019d have expected when we purchased Niscayah. So that\u2019s sort of the lay on the land on that one. John F. Lundgren: You asked about process in Spain and Italy, and let me just say two things because, as I referenced before Jim spoke, we are just not in a position to provide a lot of insight on it due to NDAs and things of that nature. We\u2019re very comfortable saying, we\u2019ve got a great term in place, and it\u2019s a good combination of tested and proven senior Stanley security leaders with some good help from our corporate business development team to oversee that process. The other thing, we\u2019ve broken this out, recognized that Spain is 5, 6, 7 times the size of Italy relative to the size of the business and where the focus is. And as you know Jim alluded to, well our business was heavily focused on the financial institutions vertical and probably a third of the bank branches in Spain have closed in the last year and it\u2019s a very difficult competitive environment. So we know it\u2019s the right decision for the company. We do have a good team in place, process is underway, but that\u2019s all we\u2019re going to -- in a position to say about it for reasons that I know you\u2019ll understand and respect. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Wood from Macquarie Capital. Mike Wood : Hi, thank you. If I exclude the rest of the buybacks that you called out, the mid-point of your GAAP earnings is up about 5% from what you did in 2014. I\u2019m curious with the free cash flow guidance you gave which is a starting point of 1% growth. Is there anything dragging down on cash flow growth next year, higher CapEx or any kind of working capital progress that you can discuss? Or should it more closely near the GAAP earnings growth? Donald Allan : I think when you look at cash flow for 2015; we have to factor in a couple of things. One, yes, there will be a little bit higher levels of CapEx, but nothing really dramatic and material. However the working capital component will be less of a positive and frankly is a modest negative next year, because what happens as you continue to grow, you have to basically get half a turn or a full turn improvement in your working capital turn just to get a positive impact in the cash flow statement. And as we get closer and closer to 10 turns which is a great thing, the amount of year-over-year benefit or improvement in turns is going to be smaller. And so, next year we might get three times, five times of a turn improvement in our working capital turns. But that actually will create -- could create a negative in cash flow depending on where revenue ends up. I know that\u2019s really a big driver there. We don\u2019t look at that as a major issue, its just one of the benefits of the great success that we\u2019ve seen in working capital turns. And we still think cash flow is a great story, and will continue to be going forward. Operator : And our last question is from Stephen Kim from Barclays. John Coyle : Hi, guys, its John filling in for Steve today. Just kind of the commentary that we got over the course much of 2014 relating to the R&R [ph] market just that it was one of moderating year-over-year, but your sales in CDIY really accelerated over the course of the year. So, can you talk about maybe some specific product categories that you\u2019ve seen for CDIY, and then was your commentary that sell through was strong in the fourth quarter meant to signal that these trends have persisted into the first quarter of \u201915? Thanks. James M. Loree: Well, I assume you\u2019re talking about the U.S. because the R&R [ph] data I think typically that what you look at comes from the U.S. I think all you have to do is look at the DIY performances from the major customers to understand that the R&R [ph] market is alive and well, yes the -- at least in the home centers. And if you look at housing starts, yes we\u2019ve had some nice improvement there, and we know that over time that we kind of benefit from that as well. I mentioned that the U.S. demand in DIY is strong and it is, and our POS is even stronger than the underlying demand. And so, as a consequence as we finish out the year, our inventory levels are down about a week in retail over where we would normally expect them to be, which is just indicative of when you have sales of 14% positive organic growth in North America, nobody is going to plan for that, and I think that\u2019s what, why you see that. Now as far as specific categories, its really -- if you go back to the professional power tools being up 20%, and I think that could be a clue as to, where the most significant growth has been, and a lot of that has to do with the cordless market and in specifically the DC brushless market. And so, I think its really flying off the shelves, and it\u2019s a great -- and it\u2019s a completely redesigned tool, and its price value combination is very, very competitive. Its performance characteristics really are untouchable in the market right now with -- by the competitors, and it does it at a price that is reasonable, slightly above competition. And that\u2019s a driver, it\u2019s not the only single -- it\u2019s not the single driver, but it\u2019s an important one. And really as John said we made tremendous progress in cordless in general over the last four years. And gaining back all that share that was lost in kind of the \u201908, \u201909, 2010 period, and so a combination of those things I think is just -- and growing, improving exceptionally strong relationships with the large customers at this point of time, very constructive relationships. End of Q& A Operator : And I would now turn the call over to Greg Waybright for closing comments. Gregory Waybright : John, thank you. We would like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation. And please contact me and/or Dennis if you\u2019ve any further questions. Thank you.

Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates Operator : Welcome to the Q1 2015 Stanley Black & Decker Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is John and I\u2019ll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. You may begin. Gregory Waybright : Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's first quarter 2015 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, John Lundgren, Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website as well as on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 p.m. today. The replay number and access code are in our press release. This morning, John, Jim and Don will review our fourth quarter results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we\u2019re going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is, therefore, possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren. John Lundgren : Thanks, Greg, and thanks everybody for joining us this morning. We\u2019ve got a strong quarter and I think a lot of encouraging news that we\u2019re very much looking forward to sharing with you and then taking your questions. During the quarter, revenue expanded 8% organically. Total growth was 1% as the topline impact of foreign currency was negative 7% in the quarter. Our Tools, Storage and Engineered Fastening businesses all continued strong momentum. They both grew in the double digits organically and Security built up the momentum from the fourth quarter and posted 2% organic growth as North America and emerging markets as well as Europe grew organically within the quarter. I won\u2019t dwell on those numbers because Jim is going to dive into much more detail on the segments in just a minute. Both gross and operating margin rates expanded in the first quarter, 50 basis points in gross margin and 120 basis points in operating margins. They increased due to higher volume, along with sharp cost focus and price realization delivering operating leverage, despite $50 million of foreign currency pressure just within the quarter. Earnings per share were $1.07, the same number versus flat in the first quarter of 2014 as the strong business performance most notably in Tools and Storage, offset higher plant restructuring and tax rate. Due in part to our strong fourth quarter cash flow in conjunction with our previously communicated equity derivatives, we executed repurchase actions that reduced the share count by approximately eight million shares in the first quarter. This was a meaningful acceleration versus our prior plan.  We are also reiterating full year 2015 guidance for earnings in the range of $5.65 to $5.85 on a GAAP basis. That\u2019s inclusive of $0.25 a share in restructuring charges. It represents a 5% to 9% year over year EPS growth, despite $60 to $70 million of incremental foreign exchange pressure since our last report and it\u2019s now expected to total between $200 million and $220 million in 2015. We are also reiterating free cash flow outlook of at least $1 billion. Don is going to walk you through the moving pieces and our assumptions around them with respect to the share repurchase, currency impact and cash flow in just a few minutes.  Moving to the next slide and looking where the growth came from. The momentum continues in the developed markets and that\u2019s been led by the US. As they say, another solid quarter of organic growth, but with currency headwinds almost two times what we experienced during the fourth quarter of 2014. The organic growth of 8% came on the heels of 7% organic growth in the fourth quarter. Over the last eight quarters, our organic growth has averaged 5%, right in the midpoint of our targeted 4% to 6% range.  Strong volume growth, particularly in the US, but we also had solid growth in every other region of the country as you can see in the box on the right. Pricing was again positive in the quarter, as actions to combat currency primarily in the emerging markets, but also surgical pricing actions across the remainder of our businesses are contributing to the organic growth. Currency headwinds did intensify as we moved through the quarter. They ramped up toward the end of the quarter and they did dampen the organic performance by 7% as I previously said as the dollar strengthened against almost every currency in countries where we do business. Don is going to give you a very granular look at that in his portion of the presentation.  Just quickly on a regional basis, demand in the US remains very healthy, particularly in retail, both strong sell-in and sell-through in the industrial channel, as well as within our security business. Europe has been a very pleasant surprise as we continue to show strong share gains, most notably in Tools and Storage, as well as our industrial business. As you can see, total organic growth is 6%, with these markets tracking flat to slightly up, maybe in low single digits. Finally, the Emerging markets were aided by strong shipments in our Engineered Fastening, Automotive and Electronics businesses, while certain markets, most notably Russia, remain under a lot of pressure.  Let\u2019s move it over to Jim and he can give you a lot of detail on the segments. James Loree : Thank you, John. I think this first quarter performance on the heels of a very strong showing in 2014 is indicative, not only of how far we have come in pursuit of exceptional value creation, but also how much potential there is ahead of us. The title of our opening slide this morning is, Accelerating Organic Growth and Margin Expansion. That is a topic we are very excited about here as a company. A record 8% organic growth is notable considering that the US is one of the only major world economies with legs. European economic growth is still spotty at best and emerging markets in the aggregate are weak and getting slightly weaker. 120 basis point operating margin expansion speaks clearly to the underlying operational strength and volume leverage potential of the company, especially reviewed in the context of overcoming well over 100 basis points of year-over-year currency headwinds. Our ability to upgrade total year organic growth guidance to 5% and hold EPS guidance in the 5% to 9% growth range despite total FX headwinds of between $1 to $1.10 a share, means that the underlying organic EPS growth of the company for 2015 is expected to be somewhere between 25% and 30%. Our global tools franchise is on a tear, gaining share and hitting on virtually all cylinders. Our large, highly profitable Engineered Fastening business, has fully digested the successful Infastech acquisition and is growing at rates well above market. Security is now generating positive, albeit modest organic growth and is tracking to previously communicated improvement benchmarks and thus offers more in the way of future value creation upside than downside. Overall we emerged from Q1 2015 with strong operating momentum and conviction that despite one of the tougher operating environments in recollections, we can continue to perform well. In a few minutes I will conclude my section with some commentary on how we plan to keep the growth and operating margin expansion momentum going, but first I will provide some color on segment level performance, starting with Tools and Storage, which offered up another outstanding quarter.  Total Tools and Storage revenue was up 3% and operating margins grew 21% to 15.7%, demonstrating impressive operating leverage. Gains resulted from volume leverage, modestly positive price, operations productivity and tight SG&A cost management, which more than offset the severe currency headwinds. Organic growth was again in double digit territory, this time 10%. North America was up 15%, Europe once again delivered outsized growth, in this case up 9% organically. Emerging markets were flat as 9% growth in Latin America was wiped out by a steep greater than 50% decline in Russia and minus 8% in Asia, as softness in China prevailed. The mid-price point product rollout continues to proceed well and this important initiative provided support for the emerging market organic revenues and prevented them from contraction in the quarter.  Across Global Tools and Storage, organic strength was broad-based once again, with Professional Power Tools up 13%, Consumer Power Tools up 10%, Accessories up 13% and Hand Tools and Storage up 7%. All categories benefited from strong new product introduction momentum and customer level execution. POS and major box customers in the US was robust despite less than ideal weather conditions and aggregate weeks in hand decrease during the quarter. We believe sell-through in the hardware lumber store and staff channels was also very strong as both resi and non-resi construction markets benefited from good growth in end user demand. Industrial markets in the US were somewhat weaker than we saw in 2014, but still positive. Our best guess is that the total US tool market was up about 5% including power tools, which we believe was up a slightly higher rate, maybe 7%. The European market, as measured in local currency, continued to be soft, perhaps up a point or two. In the developed markets, we believe we continued our share gain momentum during the quarter.  As Tools and Storage, which was previously known as CDIY and IAR recently combined, continues to rack up gains now in its combined form, the question we often get is what exactly is management doing to drive the performance? The simple answer is we are taking a great asset, feeding the new product innovation machine and coupling it with outstanding commercial and supply chain execution. By combining Stanley and Black and Decker five years ago, we created the world\u2019s leading tool company with power tools, hand tools, storage and accessories as well as a broad array of leading brands, global scale and the only tool company in the world with meaningful presence across all four major channels, construction, DIY, industrial and automotive repair.  We executed the integration well, extracting over $500 million of cost synergies and greatly exceeding our original targets for both cost and revenue synergies. Most importantly, we fused these companies together by creating a winning culture with both an innovation growth orientation and operational discipline enabled by the Stanley fulfillment system. What we are experiencing today in terms of performance is the manifestation of all the above. It was a great idea on paper. In practice, it is exceeding our expectations. We look forward to delving more deeply into this story as well as offering insight into how we plan to keep the growth going with those of you who are interested at our upcoming Analyst Day on May 15.  Now moving to security, it was a modestly successful in line quarter for security, which registered 2% organic growth and 110 basis points of operating margin rate accretion while facing an overall 6% revenue decline as FX took its toll. Nonetheless, operating margin was up 4%. North America and emerging markets revenue was up 2% organically and Europe was up 1% on the same basis. Notably, the European team delivered the first organic growth quarter for this unit since Niscayah was acquired in 2011. This came on the heels of a flat organic growth performance in 4Q 2014.  During several 2014 investor conference calls, we foreshadowed that the next marker in the European turn around would be shifting from negative organic growth to modestly positive growth, something we expected to occur sometime in 2015. Having first wrestled the European attrition to rates within our targets range of 10% to 12% during the first half of 2014, as of 1Q 2015, we have stabilized the value of our recurring revenue portfolio and are now in a position to achieve positive overall European security organic growth and a prospective basis. The benefit of revenue stabilization was clear in the quarter as the team delivered its internal operating margin commitment, a $4 million increase over prior year. Late last week, I visited with them in London and I can say that they\u2019re fully grounded in what they have to do to continue the positive trend and they have both the substance and the strength of conviction to back it up. I will look for continued progress on that front.  The other really positive turnaround news in security was the commercial lock business in North America with delivered 4% organic growth, their first positive growth quarters since fully converting to the independent distribution model in early 2013. And also on a positive note, Automatic Doors continued along its strong growth trajectory.  In summary now, two full quarters into the leadership adjustment in both Europe and North America, the early returns are promising. Both units are poised to deliver improving organic revenue and operating margin results while continuing their recent track record of predictability. And as I mentioned last quarter, we expect the overall security recovery to be slow and steady during the next several quarters, but we do expect it to continue to gain momentum as 2015 progress.  Now turning to industrial. Industrial had a mixed quarter, with an outstanding performance from Engineered Fastening, the largest part of it, offset by market related issues in oil and gas. The net result was a 2% decrease in revenue with 6% organic growth. But oil and gas deleveraging and FX pressures decreased operating margins by $12 million or 14%, bringing the rate down 210 basis points to a still respectable 15.3%. Engineered Fastening achieved a very strong 12% organic growth, including a plus 20% performance in the automotive sector, aided by strong equipment and fastener growth. This was in contrast to global light vehicle production, which was up 1%. With about two thirds of their business overseas, FX wiped out 10 points of Engineered Fastening revenue growth. So their total revenue was up only 2%. Nonetheless, they achieved both absolute margin growth and rate accretion. Infrastructure, which includes oil and gas and hydraulic, was down 15%. Oil and gas, approximately 2% of total company revenues, was down 23% organically as the market related contraction in pipeline activity depressed the topline. All in all, a solid operational performance by the Engineered Fastening team mitigated, but could not completely offset the OM pressure from both the market related issues in oil and gas and currency.  There were a lot of moving parts to our total company first quarter story, but the punch line is 8% organic growth with 120 basis points of OM expansion, while overcoming well over 100 basis points of year over year currency headwinds. Clearly this management team is executing in a high level despite numerous external obstacles, with the biggest being the strong dollar. We have confidence in our total year outlook that we will continue to overcome these obstacles and deliver. However, a natural question from the investment community is, what\u2019s next? We plan to answer that question for both the total company and for its individual parts on May 15 during our Investor Day at our Tools and Storage headquarters in Towson, Maryland. An important part of the story will be a deep dive into the Stanley fulfillment system 2.0, otherwise known as SFS 2.0. This is an initiative which we have been quietly working on for over a year. It is the next chapter in the evolution of SFS, which many of you know is a key element of our culture and has been for over eight years. SFS has enabled us to achieve a high level of customer facing supply chain execution and working capital efficiency, as well as generating well over a billion dollars of free cash flow since its inception. SFS 2.0 is the next generation of that business system, which focuses on fueling additional organics growth and margin expansion in the coming years. It is an exciting set of initiatives which provides us with a clear path to differentiated out performance, leveraging off the base that we have already created. The initiatives are listed on this slide. It starts with core SFS, which is simply a continuation of what we have been doing for years, supplemented by four new elements; Digital Excellent, Breakthrough Innovation, Commercial Excellence and Functional Transformation. We will provide greater insight into these elements as well as business strategies, portfolio strategy and acquisition criteria as well as capital allocation and financial objectives at the upcoming May Investor Day. With that, I'll turn it over to Don Allan, our CFO for his comments. Donald Allan : Thank you, Jim. I\u2019m going to start by spending a little time on our first quarter free cash flow performance, which was an outflow of $243 million. This was relatively consistent with prior year and typical of normal seasonality that we see in our company where our inventory levels rise, especially in the Tools and Storage business to ensure we\u2019re adequately prepared for Q2 and Q3 demands of key customers, in particular in a mature or developed market. However, the incremental investment we made in Tools and Storage inventory during the first quarter of this year was modestly higher than normal as we managed through the west coast port strike and we prepared for strong organics growth to re-occur in the second quarter of this year.  The core SFS principle Jim just mentioned require agility to respond when business conditions change, such as strong organic growth such as we have experienced over the last three quarters. SFS has enabled us to reach working capital and asset efficiency levels that are considered world class compared to other industrial and security peers. SFS continues to assist us on our journey to 10 times working capital turns. But we want to ensure that we are agile in changing market conditions, just like we saw over the last few quarters.  Due to our confidence in our ability to generate at least $1 billion of free cash flow during 2015, as John mentioned, we were able to accelerate our share repurchase activity relating to our repurchase program that we announced at the end of 2013. By using a mixture of cash repurchases and equity derivatives, we took actions to lower the share count by roughly 8 million shares within the first quarter and 9.6 million shares since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014. This brings our cumulative total share actions to the equivalent of approximately $900 million for the program that we announced in the fourth quarter of 2013.  Moving to page 11, as John touched on and as all of us are well aware, another significant weakening of currencies versus the US dollar occurred during February and March of this year. Given this shift, I would like to spend a few minute updating you on our 2015 foreign current impact. For us, it resulted in significant incremental currency pressure, most notably from movements in the Brazilian Real, many other Latin American currencies and several other currencies that moved in concert with the Euro. The result of these fluctuations has created a total negative annual impact of $200 million to $220 million versus 2014, which in an incremental headwind of $60 million to $70 million versus what we communicated during our earnings call in January. As a remainder, these amounts are net of our derivative hedging activities.  The incremental currency headwinds of $60 million to $70 million have been broad based and in fact out top exposures in the Brazilian Real, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Argentinian Peso, represent only approximately $30 million of this incremental impact, with two thirds of that $30 million impact due specifically to the Brazilian Real. This demonstrates the positive impact of our Euro and Canadian dollar hedging program in 2015. As you may recall, I spoke of increased hedges on the Euro and Canadian dollar in January and while those currencies moved negatively during the first quarter, much of that impact was mitigated by these hedges. The remaining portion of the $60 million to $70 million incremental headwind from currency is caused by exposures in approximately 20 countries around the world, which clearly demonstrates the broad based nature of this currency movement. As we have reviewed during past calls, we attempt to mitigate these currency impacts in our P&L beyond what we do in hedging activities through a multi-stepped approach. The first is pursuing customer pricing increases where large transactional FX headwinds emerge due to importing of US dollar-based products or components specifically into countries such as Canada, Brazil and even parts of Europe.  The second area of focus is we focus on improving our cost base thought he pursuit of likely commodity deflation in this environment, which we have been seeing in the last three to six months as well as we evaluate pulling forward certain specific cost rationalization projects for selected businesses and function to ensure that we try to offset this impact. And then the last area which we can never lose sight of is the long term pursuit of increasing our localized production and component supply in certain key emerging markets around the world to minimize this impact. So in summary on this page, we continue to activity manage a difficult currency environment with a proactive approach that has enabled us to manage near time volatility, but at the same time balancing the requirement of continuing to invest for future growth. Let\u2019s move to page 12 and talk about 2015 EPS outlook. As indicated by John and Jim\u2019s comments earlier, we are reiterating 2015 guidance as $5.65 to $5.85 EPS and free cash flow of at least $1 billion as the strong organic growth performance in Tools and Storage, combined with an acceleration of our share repurchase actions, has allowed us to offset the incremental currency headwinds that I just described. Let\u2019s walk through these assumptions which led to a neutral impact on our guidance in all more detail.  First, we expect organic growth to be approximately 5% versus our prior expectation of 3% to 4%. This change recognizes the strong organic growth momentum that emerged in the second half of 2014 with our Tools and Storage business, which we expect to continue for the coming months. Additionally, as we saw in the first quarter, our two other segments are generally on track to their planned organic growth rates and we expect this trend to continue for the reminder of the year. This overall improved organic growth performance contributes an incremental $0.25 of EPS impact for the full year of 2015, which is over and above the $0.45 to $0.55 EPS benefit we described in our initial guidance back in January.  The second item is our ability to accelerate our share count action in the first quarter of 2015 given our confidence in cash flow outlook that I described earlier. Specifically, we executed cash repurchases and equity derivatives that reduced our share count by approximately 8 million shares. Our prior assumption was that much of these actions were to occur during the second half of 2015. We did increase our debt levels modestly to execute this plan, and combined with normal first quarter seasonality of cash outflow, this increase in debt will be a temporary phenomenon. The results of these share count actions are a benefit of approximately $0.10 of EPS over and above the initial range we provided in January of $0.09 to $0.12 of EPS.  Then finally, as I just covered in a fair amount of detail, we expect to $200 million to $220 million of currency pressure given the strengthening of the US dollar over the past 90 days, versus our prior expectation of $140 million to $150 million. This will generate an incremental $0.30 to $0.35 of EPS headwind for 2015. Also keep in mind that our other planning assumptions, including tax rates and restructuring costs remain the same for the full year. There\u2019s three other items that are important to take note of related to guidance as you start to think about the different quarters and how they stage for the full year. The first item though is related to revenue and the adverse currency impact is now expected to be approximately 7% versus our prior assumption of approximately 4% to 5% for the full year. This will result in total revenues being down approximately 2% on the full year. Second item is restructuring charges in the first half of 2015 will approximate 80% of our full year expected restructuring charges of $50 million.  Then finally I remind everyone to recognize the seasonality of revenues and profitability that happens in our company every year in the first half. We expect that our operating margin as a percentage of the full year to be relatively consistent with 2014 when you evaluate first half versus second half. However, higher planned restructuring charges and the higher tax rate in the first half of 2015 will result in first half EPS approximating 43% of the full year EPS, which is modestly lower than the 2014 first half as a percentage of the full year and clearly due to the dynamics of restructuring and tax.  Now let\u2019s turn to segments, which are presented on the right side of the page and in our reporting structure. We expect mid to single high digit organic growth in the Tools and Storage business, as well as solid operating margin rate expansion year over year. The operating margin expansion is expected to be due to volume leverage, cost actions and price which more than offset the negative currency impact. Organic growth within this segment is expected to remain strong in the first half and show lower levels of growth in the back half as we begin to experience more difficult comparables. Our security segment will have a modest organic revenue growth for the full year, with the margin rate increasing versus the prior year. The organic growth in security in North America and emerging markets will compliment an improving performance in security Europe, which started the year with good momentum as you heard from Jim earlier.  Profitability in security will continue to improve versus prior year, from volume leverage and cost actions, which again will allow us to more than offset the foreign currency impact. We expect solid year over year profit improvement as we continue progressing forward with our security Europe multiyear recovery plan. Then finally for industrial, we expect solid mid-single digit organic growth as Engineered Fastening strengths will be able to offset the expected declines in our oil and gas business. However, due to the now increased importance of oil and gas as a percentage of this particular segment, we do expect margins to be relatively flat versus the prior year as volume leverage generated by Engineered Fastening will be offset by the deleveraging impact of oil and gas due to the sluggish market conditions in that particular business. This assumption change more about the impact of recasting our reporting segments than it is a change in business assumptions since January.  In summary, the strength of our Tools and Storage organic growth, combined with accelerated share count actions, offsets the higher foreign currency impact I just described. Therefore we still expect to achieve solid operating leverage and healthy organic growth even with the incremental currency headwinds, which means we expect earnings will expand 5% to 9% on an overall revenue decline of 2% in 2015. Additionally, we believe we will continue to demonstrate strong free cash flow as it would be at least $1 billion.  To summarize the presentation portion of our call today, we believe we delivered a very strong start to the year and here are some of the highlights. We are very pleased with the strong robust organic growth story in the first quarter of 8%. Focused on the tight cost control and surgical price actions across our entire company, which enabled an excellent Q1 operating leverage in the face of $50 million of currency headwinds. Security took another positive step forward on its multi-year transformation, with 2% organic growth and year over year profit growth. Then finally, because of our confidence in our free cash flow outlook, we were able to accelerate our share repurchase program, which means we\u2019ve really completed $900 million of our program since the fourth quarter of last year in the program that we announced back in the end of 2013.  Our operational focus in 2015 will continue to be on improving near term returns and the relative performance of our company through organic growth initiatives, the security margin improvement and stability and continued growth organically, cost and pricing actions and of course our ongoing working capitals focus. We believe this approach was very successful in2014 and again here in the first quarter and we will continue this focus for the remainder of 2015 and beyond as it does position our company to deliver on the long-term financial objectives that we have established.  That concludes the presentation portion of our call. Now let\u2019s move to Q&A. Gregory Waybright : Great. Thanks Don. John, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Thank you very much, gentlemen. You made a very busy day a little easier here today. I have one question really on your cost actions and kind of thinking about the holistic nature of them. And really the nature of my question is, these offsetting actions you are taking, would you view them all as structural and permanent? Or should we expect some of this to come back the other way as perhaps the FX pressures hopefully wane at some point in the future? If you could give us a little context around that, I think it would be very helpful. Thank you. John Lundgren : Yeah, absolutely. So we embarked on this journey of cost actions in a more significant way about a year and half to two years ago and one of our main objectives was to take actions that were permanent in nature and not temporary that would result in some type of snapback of costs in the future. We\u2019ve been targeting areas such as indirect spend, which is basically all costs that are non-people related and putting forth policy changes, structural changes, procurement changes, etc., that are driving a lot of those benefits. And they\u2019re permanent changes that we expect to be maintained over the long term.  The other thing that we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve taken specific headcount restructuring actions related to the combination of our CDIY and IAR business for Tools and Storage. We\u2019ve taken some corporate headcount actions, as well as some of our other businesses that are more surgical in nature that will allow us to really continue to focus on productivity and driving a more efficient P&L Because of this approach and these different types of actions, it really gives us confidence that it\u2019s not of the nature that we are just pushing down costs on a temporary basis and we will experience some snapback in the future. Operator : And our next question is from Rick Kwas from Wells Fargo. Rich Kwas : Good morning, gentlemen. In terms of the competitive environment with regards to currency, any changes you've noticed here in the US with competitive actions from foreign-based entities? And then quick follow up, hedging activity for 2016, Don, does this leave you in a position where you're going to still get hit in 2016 unless you put incremental hedges in? How should we think about that as we look forward here? Thank you. Donald Allan : Yeah I\u2019ll take the latter one first. As I mentioned, we\u2019ve done a lot of hedging activities specifically around the Euro and the Canadian dollar. The benefit we are getting for that here in 2015 or the neutralization I guess of currency is about $70 million. And so that would be an impact that we would see in 2016. We\u2019ll also have a modest carry over impact by some of the recent currency movements we\u2019ve seen. So we think going into next year, there is about $100 million headwind for currency that some of which we are focused on how we deal with through hedging activities, but we are also focused on what cost actions we can take as we go into 2016 to offset that impact as well. Similar to what we\u2019ve done over the last two years, we are going to take a very similar approach to that as we embark into 2016 as well. And Jim maybe you want to answer the comment on \u2026 James Loree : On the competitive environment in the US and whether there have been any changes related to the FX dislocation that\u2019s occurred. Most of our, in fact all of our major competitors have global footprints that are relatively similar. Our major European based competitor has a little bit more European footprint in terms of supply chains and our major Japanese competitor has a little bit more in Japan. But we all have a lot in China, Mexico and other low cost areas around the world. So there really isn\u2019t a major structural change to the cost competitors that is created by the dislocation. I think we are all responding -- all competitors are responding as you might expect, which is in the emerging markets where we are shipping into those markets from dollar stable kinds of -- or dollar, like Chinese or dollar denominated supply chains, there is a fair amount of price appreciation going on to partially offset the currency impact and then the US is always brutally competitive and continues to be brutally competitive. Operator : Our next question is from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Yes. Good morning. Congratulations on a great quarter and all the progress. I guess the CDIY, your incremental margins were substantially larger than I'd expected and obviously there's an awful lot going on in that segment right now. But I guess the question is just how much of this is from the combination of the IAR business and are these contribution margins expected to sustain through the rest of the year? John Lundgren : David, very fair question. There are cost benefits to the combination of the IAR business. They\u2019re quite small relative to the volume leverage particularly the advantage of a prolific new product development process that really was founded or grounded in our CDIY business. It\u2019s now incorporating IAR. So roughly three quarters, two thirds of the benefit and ability to maintain margins is due to the volume leverage new products and incremental margins and only a small portion would be due to the -- there are some cost benefits, but that is truly the icing on the cake rather than the driver for putting these two businesses together. James Loree : But as far as the impact in the quarter or in the past couple of quarters, it\u2019s been nil. This is just getting going, so the impact that John just described is yet to come. Operator : Our next question is from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Robert Barry : Good morning. Congrats on a very solid quarter. Wanted to just talk a little more about the organic growth outlook. You raised it by 1 to 2 points and wanted to clarify how much of that is stronger end markets versus better momentum on your own initiatives and to the extent that it's the markets, where are you seeing any incremental strength or weakness? John Lundgren : Yeah, I\u2019ll take a shot at that and I\u2019ll certainly ask Jim or Don to chime in. It is overwhelmingly share gains in our case. 50% of our revenue roughly is in the US. Those markets are slightly stronger than we\u2019d anticipate. But you saw our Global Tools and Storage business up 12% in the quarter. So there\u2019s significant share gain there. Europe as I said in my piece of the presentation, globally the markets are up 2% at best. Some estimates are flat and we are up six 6%. So again, it\u2019s easily 3X the market growth rate. Now Tools and Storage business is up more than that. So again share gains. I think the wild card is in the emerging markets, which collectively represent about 20% of our revenue. They\u2019re up but at a much lower rate as Jim mentioned in his piece of the presentation. Certain markets like China and Russia are down, but in total the emerging markets are growing at low single digits and so are we. So simply said, the overwhelming majority of what you\u2019ve seen in our numbers is share gain and again it\u2019s focused in our Global Tools and Storage business and our Engineered Fastening business. Operator : Our next question is from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley Mike Sang : Hey, good morning guys. It's actually Mike Sang in for Nigel. I didn't see capital deployment guidance and I apologize if you talked about it, but you didn't change your free cash guidance, but to the extent you do better on free cash this year, how should we think about where you'll spend that incremental upside? Donald Allan : This is Don. We didn\u2019t specifically give guidance related to capital deployment. What we have said about this year though is our primary objective was to complete our program of up to $1 billion of share repurchase and you could argue that we\u2019ve pretty much done that with $900 million of it completed at this point in time. We also said that we have opened up our -- reopened our funnel of BD opportunities over the last six months or so and we are evaluating different things and we may have some types of small acquisition later in the year of modest size. But that\u2019s really about what the plan is at this stage and we feel good about where we are. If we outperform our cash flow, we\u2019ll have to evaluate the timing of that and would make sense based on what\u2019s happening in BD as well as what our stock is trading at that point in time. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse Mike Dahl : Hi, thanks and quite a nice quarter again. Some pretty challenges conditions with the FX side. I wanted to go back to one of the prior comments on walking around the regions. John, I think you've been clear that some of these European comps, a lot of it's been driven by some tremendous share growth and new product innovation. What's the expectation as far as -- I know you mentioned that you think it'll moderate, but has the continued strength caused you to push out your expectation for how long you can keep a four or five point premium to the market growth on that side of the business? John Lundgren : Sure. I'm going to have Jim walk you through that, but remember we\u2018ve got a stated objective of growing at 2x the rate of the market and we\u2019ve been doing a pretty good job in our Global Tools and Storage business. But Jim, I know you want to shade more light on that. James Loree : It's a great question because the comps are -- we are comping against two years organics growth in the tool business that\u2019s averaging about 7% per quarter. When you look at the market growth and you look at that you say how long can this go on? It's very fair question, but I would say that the team in European tools in particular, but also in Engineered Fastening, those two management teams are really, really growth oriented teams. And the ability to gain share is not constrained necessary by structural conditions. If they keep executing at that level, then I think that it will be in that 4% to 6% range for a while. And the other thing about Europe is that even though the markets haven\u2019t picked up, the optimism in Europe is palpably higher. If you talk to business people in Europe, there\u2019s a lot of hope I guess is the best phrase or word I can think of, but not necessarily with our people. But when you just talk to people in general in Europe, there\u2019s a sentiment, a more positive sentiment than we\u2019ve seen in a long, long time. That may actually help with the market and may over time push the market up a few points and certainly that would be helpful as well. But the reality of tough difficult comps is a real one and it's one where we don\u2019t necessarily push our expectations to organic growth much higher than say 4% to 6 %. I think achieving that 2x market growth is something that we can continue to do for a while. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Kessler from Imperial Capital Jeff Kessler : Not to steal the thunder from Investor Day, but could you go over -- be a little bit more specific as to the four parts of SFS 2 and how they impacted the first quarter, how you expect them to impact the year? What are -- specifically what are they going to do? And number two, put some numbers to that to flesh it out. James Loree : Sure. That\u2019s kind of like Investor Day, but I'll give you a quick snapshot. Jeff Kessler : Yeah. That's all I want. James Loree :  The four initiatives, Digital Excellence, Breakthrough Innovations, Commercial Excellence, and Functional Transformation, we\u2019ll start with functional transformation is an approach that we are taking to reduce the cost of our staff functions if you will, so increase their efficiency while maintaining their effectiveness, which is very high. The functional transformation will yield benefits over a multi-year period, but really at the moment we are investing in this. There\u2019s an actual expense related to it in the quarter and we\u2019ll get into that at the investor day. The other three are intended to drive growth and they all require some investment, but the functional transformation is a way to fund that investment without affecting our day to day operations in a negative way.  Digital Excellence, we are doing a fair amount of work in that area to prioritize where we\u2019re going to make our investments. So there\u2019s not really any revenue impact from that at this point in time. There are some expenses associated with that. I think the one that has the most near term impact is Commercial Excellence because commercial excellence includes several different elements. One of those element is pricing effectiveness and you probably have noticed over the last year or so that we have been averaging about a point in price as a company and that is about a point higher than we have been doing historically. I would say virtually a large portion of that differential impact is associated with the Commercial Excellence initiative. There are many other parts to it. I think I used the term Commercial Excellence several times when I was discussing the CDIY or the Global Tool Business and they have really taken Commercial Excellence and each element of it and deployed it within that business to achieve some of their differentiated performance and share gains. They can do even more with Commercial Excellence and the rest of the company can really do a lot more with that. So that\u2019s what we expect to see in the future. And the final one, it's important to differentiate between what I\u2019ll call incremental innovation or day to day innovation, which I think we and our competitors all do reasonably well. We have things like, a good example do that would be the DC brushless innovation that we\u2019ve done recently and the share gain that we\u2019ve achieved through that. The Breakthrough Innovation is basically taking, going beyond Incremental Innovation and really looking for those breakthroughs that can change the whole competitive framework of the industry and give us a competitive advantage. So we have studied competes in the best pockets of breakthrough innovation in the world, primarily in the US. And we have deployed some of the practices that you\u2019ll see in the valley and so forth. And we are doing some experimentation with that and we are hopeful that we can create some breakthrough innovations. In the meantime we are going full speed ahead with our normal incremental innovation and the incremental innovation is really what\u2019s driving the share gain and one of the things that\u2019s driving the share gain on the tools business today. That\u2019s a quick snapshot. There\u2019s plenty more to come on May 15. John Lundgren : Jeff. Just let me tie that up in a bow without -- and Jim there I think did a very nice job of not stealing our own thunder for Investor Day because we\u2019ve got a lot of communicate. We want communicate it very coherently and systematically all in the same place. But SFS or SFS 1.0 if you like was focused on operational excellence. We think we\u2019ve done a very, very good job and working capital turns have doubled as a result of that. Eliminate ways to eliminate complexity, unless it adds a benefit that the customer is willing to pay for and so forth. You\u2019ve heard us talk about it a lot. We think we\u2019ve gotten it down. We\u2019ve been at it about eight years and we think it truly, truly is imbedded in the DNA of this company. What Jim described is an effort -- in terms of when will the benefits come, we are paying as we go and I think Jim described that perfectly in terms of we\u2019re investing in getting a little bit of benefit.  The future benefits will come well down the road just like they have with SFS. But importantly, it is all designed to embed a growth culture, first establish an embedded growth culture within the company. If we look at all our long-term objectives, we\u2019ve done a really good job meeting or exceeding all of them with the exception of organic growth, where over the years we\u2019ve been at 3% to 4%, which is then about the industry average, about our competitors average, peer group average. Of late, we\u2019ve stepped that up due to some phenomenal results from the incremental growth platforms and programs that Jim described. Long-term we are looking to drive that up and just embed it into our culture and have it become equally as important in our DNA as we think running our operations effectively and efficiently has become. Operator : Our next question is from Jeremie Capron from CLSA. Jeremie Capron : Thanks and good morning. I wanted to follow up on your commentary on pricing. You had a full point of price gains in the quarter, and you sounded pretty dismissive in terms of any deterioration in the pricing environment globally, yet we're seeing a peeled down train in commodity prices. My question really is how sustainable do you think your price gains are for the remainder of the year and what sort of dynamics are you seeing in terms of your price cost. It looks like a nice tailwind here. Donald Allan : Sure. I\u2019ll take that one. Yeah, we were very pleased as John mentioned with our price performance in Q1. We\u2019ve talked about price as a company on and off over the last decade several times, but in the last year, year and half, we\u2019ve really put a significant emphasis on gaining price in different ways across many of our businesses. It\u2019s not always just about list price. It\u2019s about other types of activities that happen with your customers and really trying to drive the maximum value associated with the product or the service that you\u2019re providing to your customer. That emphasis has not changed. There has been a new dynamic as you mentioned in the last six months or so where commodities have moved in a certain direction it\u2019s been a benefit to companies like us.  The reality for us is the number is not overly significant. We touched on it briefly back in January. It\u2019s roughly $50 million of benefits for us on an annualized basis. At this point in time, we continue to evaluate that as we go into next year and see what other opportunities we have. But it\u2019s not really large enough to drive a significant pricing discussion across an $11 billion enterprise like our company. If that dynamic ever changes, then we could potentially have the circumstances that you described and we have gone through those cycles. But we have put significant routines and processes in place around pricing to really deal with these types of dynamics and make sure that we understand the levels of profitability that we are achieving on key products, especially what we call our A products and services that we provide and I don\u2019t expect that focus to change. I actually expect it to accelerate and become more mature overtime. Operator : And our next question is from Liam Burke from Wunderlich. Please go ahead. Liam Burke : Thank you. Your growth domestically on Tools and Storage was pretty strong. You have brought back manufacturing to the US. Has that program helped drive organic sales growth and do you plan on adding more capacity in the US? John Lundgren : Yeah, Liam I\u2019ll take it. The answer is absolutely yes. Yes and yes. Simply said, we knew -- it\u2019s turned to be not a terrific hedge in terms of production costs, because when we first brought this production back we had total delivered product cost. Obviously we took a lot of product off the water in time and improved our working capital turns. We had costs within flat to 5% and we are driving that down towards cost neutral relative to some of the low cost countries. It\u2019s probably not at parity now given the strength of the dollar. That means, but we knew it was a good thing to do in terms of supply chain, satisfying our customers, keeping fill rates above 98%. We underestimated the positive impact customer reaction, particularly in the industrial distribution channel and what we call the two step channel of the, quite frankly the loyalty. It created the incredibly positive reaction from professional contractors and folks working in manufacturing facilities around the country.  So we are very pleased with not only our ability to get the facilities up and running, we\u2019re very pleased with -- we\u2019re delighted by the customer reaction. As a consequence, we\u2019re looking at two other opportunities near term in the US and again, it\u2019s not going to be a step function ship, but it will be a gradual shift to expand two existing US facilities to produce more of our core products sold primarily in the US in those markets. More to come on that when it happens. We can\u2019t get ahead of ourselves in terms of our own workforce then our planning and various negotiations are currently in process. But there is more to come. As I say it will not be gigantic, but it will be incremental or an evolution versus the revolution, but based on the results to date, we\u2019ve got a lot of good reasons, qualitatively and quantitatively to do some more of this in the next 6 to 18 months. Operator : Our next question is from next question is from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Go ahead Michael with your question. John Lundgren : Mike, are you on mute? Gregory Waybright : Move to the next one. Operator : We have a question from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates. Dennis McGill : Good morning. Thank you. I just want to go back to an earlier question on the margin performance in the first quarter and the new tools and storage business. If you look year over year, that incremental margin being over 70%, and I think you talked to for the full year some of the drivers that are plus or minus. But was just hoping maybe you can talk to specific in the quarter, what the drivers were there and then how you think some of those drivers progress as you move through the year. John Lundgren : Sure, we can touch on that. As we touched on obviously, we saw significant operating leverage through the organic growth. We also are seeing really solid benefits from SG&A actions that I mentioned around indirect costs. We\u2019ve seen some good pricing initiatives that drop all the way to the bottom line. It\u2019s a combination of all those factors. Of course there\u2019s also a little bit of commodity deflation occurring as well that\u2019s beneficial to this particular business. Combining that with the fact that I mentioned at the beginning, which is organic growth, you have a high level of activity happening in our plants that occur because of higher organic growth in Q1 and expected higher organic growth in Q2 well above what we experienced in the first half or the first quarter of last year. So there\u2019s certainly a leverage effect that\u2019s even greater than you would normally see because of organic growth numbers that are basically double digit. Operator : And I will now turn it back over to Greg Waybright for closing remarks. Gregory Waybright : John, thank you. We\u2019d like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation in the call. And obviously, please contact me if you\u2019ve any further questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Amanda, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin. Greg Waybright : Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's second quarter 2015 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is John Lundgren, Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website, as well as on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 p.m. today. The replay number and access code are in our press release. This morning, John, Jim and Don will review our second quarter 2015 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we\u2019re going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is, therefore, possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren. John Lundgren : Hey. Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. This is an encouraging quarter to say the least, as everything from organic growth, the margin, earnings and capital allocation demonstrated that innovation is robust, SFS 2.0. is gaining traction and our management team and our 50,000 associates around the world are demonstrating agility and executing really well in a volatile environment and as a consequence they are overcoming numerous challenges that are well beyond their control. So let\u2019s get to it, second quarter organic growth of 8%, offset by currency of negative 8%, so essentially flat revenue. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of organic growth at or above 6% with Tools and Storage leading the way up with 11% organic growth. We as a company achieved and delivered growth across all three segments. The Black & Decker merger closed in the first quarter of 2010, more than five years ago and our operating margin in 2Q \u201815 expanded to a post-merger record of 14.4%, plus 70 basis points versus second quarter 2014. Volume with sharp cost focus and price realization delivered robust operating leverage despite a $50 million foreign currency pressure. There are lots of puts and takes with respect to FX and Don will provide a lot more detail around this in our estimate for the year, which still includes $200 million to $220 million of foreign exchange headwind that we have every intention of overcoming. Second quarter diluted EPS was a $1.54, up 11% versus prior year, overwhelmingly, on strong operational performance. And on June 23rd, we announced the dividend increase of 6% from -- to $0.55 a share from $0.52, that maintains our compelling dividend payout and as well as, an unrivaled history on the New York Stock Exchange in terms of continuity of dividend payment and increasing the dividend. As a consequence of a great first half and actions we are taking up for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our 2015 full year GAAP EPS guidance range to $5.70 to $5.90 from $5.65 to $5.85, so the range is now up 6% to 10% versus 2014 and that\u2019s despite a $1 to $1.10 per share foreign currency earnings pressure. Let\u2019s take a look at our sources of growth, which in fact were very similar in terms of both source and geography for the first quarter of 2015. Volume was up 7%. We got 1% from price, leading to the 8% organic growth that I referred to previously. No impact from acquisitions, offset by 8% price, so you see flat revenue for the year -- for the first half of the year, as well as for the second quarter. All geographies showed some strength, with the U.S. leading the way at 11%, strong growth in Europe [Technical Difficulty] despite relatively stagnant market condition, emerging markets as a total were up 4% despite some areas of weakness, specifically Russia and China that Jim will talk to you about in a minute, and the rest of the world was up 7%. So the very, very strong second quarter back to back up 8% organic growth, so enough from the total there is lots of really good news and strong momentum within each of our three segments. So let me turn it over to Jim to take closer look. Jim Loree : Okay. Thanks, John. I'll start with Tools and Storage, which continues to be a great story. Revenue was up 4% while operating margin grew 9%, we said our post-merger record with a 64.4% rate, once again demonstrating impressive operating leverage, gains resulted from volume leverage, modestly positive price, operational productivity and continued tight SG&A cost management, which more than offset another quarter of severe currency headwinds. Organic growth remained in double-digit territory, this time 11% averaging a noteworthy 10% over the last four quarters. All regions contributed with strong performances as North America was up 14%, Europe 7% and emerging markets accelerated to 5% growth. Across the global product lines, organic strength was broad-based, with Professional Power Tools up 14%, Consumer Power Tools up 15%, Accessories up 12% and Hand Tools & Storage up 5%. The categories benefited from strong customer level execution and new product introductions as the Tools and Storage innovation machine not only remains robust but continues to gain momentum. Contributing to growth within the quarter was an outdoor season, which is tracking to a more normal pattern. Against this backdrop we released the stream of new products in the category, including the DeWALT outdoor, which delivers a full line of products with the performance and runtime demanded by long care professionals that includes a compelling new [indiscernible] line which competes favorably with many gas power tools. This is a great example of DC brushless technology and advances in lithium-ion that have opened up segments that historically have not been served by cordless. POS was again robust to get across the channels with major big-box customers in the U.S. continuing their strength, aggregate weeks on hand, are in a good place remaining at or below prior year levels. We also believe sell-through in the hardware, lumber store and staff channels was very strong as both resi and non-resi markets -- construction markets benefited from good growth in end user demand. The e-commerce channel continues to grow an importance, particularly for the DIY end-user. This is true for both big-box and independent retailers. Not surprisingly Industrial markets in the U.S. remained somewhat weaker than we saw in 2014, but we are still positive. For the ninth consecutive quarter, we are able to highlight Europe at an impressive growth story for Tools. The business is averaged 7% organic growth over this time period in a relatively flat market. Our team continues to control their destiny by leveraging our broad stable of leading brands, launching new innovative products across categories and adding new points of distribution. European Tools represents a prime example of commercial excellence and action as we define it in SFS 2.0. Growth within Tools emerging markets accelerated in the quarter as a double-digit performance in Latin America and solid growth in India, Turkey, the Middle East and Africa was enough to overcome a steep market related decline in Russia and a weak performance in China. The mid-price point product rollout led by our Stanley Power Tool line continues to proceed successfully and this important initiative provided support for emerging market growth amidst volatile underlying market conditions. And looking at the markets, our estimate is that the U.S. is growing about 5% to 7%. In constant currency, the European market is slightly positive and the emerging markets are growing about 2% to 3%. On a global basis, this takes our total market growth in 2Q at about 3% to 4%, which when compared with our 11% organic performance implies continued share again. Many ask us whether or not the high levels of growth can continue as the comps get tougher and global GDP trends slightly lower. Our response has been consistent. Organic growth in the double digits against this backdrop will be difficult to sustain, however, in the environment we are operating in. This business has the ability to deliver growth within our 4% to 6% targeted levels on an ongoing basis. We have leading brands, global scale and organization that continue to raise its own high standards for innovation, as well for commercial and supply chain excellence. And clearly we are well on the way to creating the organic growth culture and vision when we integrated Stanley and Black & Decker. SFS 2.O is the new catalyst, which will continue to drive momentum. Now moving to security. We continue to make progress on most underlying businesses in security, although this quarter it was two steps forward and one back. Execution in both Europe and the North America Mechanical Locking businesses was very encouraging. However, North American convergent, we are continuing to deal with growing pains related to an increasingly complex business mix, specifically installing jobs efficiently. It was truly a watershed quarter for Europe, where the list of the compliments, including 3% organic growth and double-digit order rates, attrition within target ranges and the successful sale of Spain and Italy, with nominal but positive cash proceeds. Our European management team is executing well and delivering their turnaround commitments. North American Mechanical Lock business also showed excellent progress with 4% organic growth and improving profitability. The business looks to finally be emerging from the challenges of the distribution model change era and is now focused on revitalizing its performance through innovation and commercial excellence. The biggest challenge of the quarter was in our North American Electronics business, where continued gains in vertical markets were achieved at the expense of core growth as the team struggled with the efficient installation of some of the larger, more complex vertical market jobs. These challenges are well understood and being addressed by our new and capable management team. Softness in Asia also cut into security 2Q organic growth and profitability. So, overall, we made some very good operational progress in the quarter with some isolated and manageable issues. We continued to be confident in a positive trajectory for security and remain committed to our assessment of its strategic fit by the second half of 2016. Now turning to Industrial. Industrial had a solid quarter, led by another steady performance from Engineered Fastening and Resilient Infrastructure business, the latter of which is battling significant market headwinds in oil and gas and hydraulics. The net result was a 4% decrease in revenue as 4% organic growth was more than offset by an 8 point negative currency headwind. Margins rebounded sequentially to 19.1% and expanded 140 basis points versus 2014, while operating margin grew by $3 million or 3%. Volume leverage across Engineered Fastening and Oil and Gas, combined with tight cost controls and pricing, more than offset the negative profit impact of foreign exchange. Engineered Fastening delivered a 4% organic performance, led by high single-digit automotive growth, once again outpacing light vehicle production, which was relatively flat. Additionally, we saw solid growth within Electronics. This was offset lower North American Industrial sales tied to a slowing market. So it was an impressive quarter of organic growth and margin expansion despite the translational currency headwinds experienced within the business. Infrastructure which include oil and gas and hydraulics, was up 3%, quite an accomplishment considering the market exposures of these businesses. Oil and gas benefited from a large international equipment sale, which contributed to 11% organic growth for the quarter. We still expect this business to decline organically for the full year, but this quarter's results are a great example of the team\u2019s willingness to drive forward in the face of market headwinds. Growth was moderated by a 13% decline within the hydraulics business, which services demolition markets that are highly correlated to the vagaries of the scrap steel market. All in all, it was a solid operational performance in industrial with organic growth and margin expansion despite soft markets and significant currency headwinds. But as you look at this quarter's performance in the aggregate for the company, it represents another strong quarter with 8% organic growth, record operating margin levels that expanded 70 basis points in the face of 80 basis points of year-over-year currency headwinds. Our management team continues to execute at a high level, overcoming numerous external obstacles, including the strong dollar and dynamic end markets to produce exceptional results. With that, I'll turn it over to Don Allan. Don Allan : Thank you, Jim. Good morning. I\u2019d like to start by spending a little bit time on our second quarter and year-to-date free cash flow performance. For the second quarter, free cash flow was $247 million, which brings us to a relatively neutral performance on a year-to-date basis. The quarterly and the year-to-date declines versus the prior year are explained by carrying higher amounts of inventory compared to last year to service the increased levels of organic growth we are experiencing, primarily within Tools & Storage business. We do, however, continue to realize benefits from applying our core SFS process and principles. And for the second quarter, we achieved seven working capital turns, which was two times of a turn expansion versus the prior year. We are confident that we will deliver a continued improvement in 2015 towards our vision of 10 plus working capital turns for the company. We will continue to monitor the working capital levels closely to ensure they are adequate to support our higher growth expectations for the full year. The core SFS principles require agility to respond when business conditions change such as the strong organic growth we've experienced in the last four quarters. SFS has enabled us to reach working capital on asset efficiency levels that are considered world-class compared to our Industrial and Security peers, but at the same time allowing us to be agile in changing market conditions to ensure we meet our customers\u2019 needs. I\u2019d also like to spend a little bit of time and give you a quick update on our share repurchase program. During the quarter, we executed cash repurchases of approximately $100 million. Taking into account all the actions to date, this brings the cumulative total share actions to the equivalent of approximately $1 billion, which fully achieves our plan announced back in the fourth quarter of 2013. As we reviewed during our Investor Day in May, you should expect us to return over time to a capital allocation of approximately 50% of our free cash flow being deployed to M&A and the remaining 50% back to our shareholders via dividend or the occasional optimistic share repurchase. So let\u2019s move to page 10 and spend a little bit of time on the 2015 outlook. As indicated by John earlier, we are increasing the 2015 EPS guidance range to $5.70 to $5.90 versus the previous range of $5.65 to $5.85. This is due to stronger organic growth as well as additional indirect cost savings, which will be partially reduced by slower margin improvement trajectory within Security. So let\u2019s walk through a little bit of the detailed around these assumptions to provide a level of information that leads to a $0.05 increase to the midpoint of our prior outlook guidance range. First, we expect organic growth to be approximately 6% versus our prior expectations of approximately 5%. This change recognizes the strong organic growth momentum that continues with our Tools & Storage business. Additionally, we are increasing our expectation modestly within Engineered Fastening due to the solid first half trends within that business. These improve growth expectations, combined with all of our other businesses tracking to their planned organic growth rates results in an overall improved performance for 2015. This overall improved growth performance contributes an incremental $0.15 EPS impact over and above the EPS benefit that was included in our guidance last quarter. The next item I\u2019d like to touch on is the work we\u2019ve been doing on our indirect cost savings programs across the company that continue to yield benefit throughout 2015. This should contribute approximately an additional $0.05 of EPS benefit versus our last quarter's guidance as well. So the total of those two items contribute $0.20 in positive momentum versus our April guidance. Finally, we now expect a slower trajectory of margin improvement within Security, due primarily to the North American electronics project mix matter that was described by Jim earlier. This represents a headwind of approximately $0.15 of EPS for 2015 versus our April guidance assumptions. All the other planning assumptions within guidance, including FX, tax rate, shares and restructuring costs remain the same. But I would like to spend a little time discussing FX, but there has been various movements in currency over the past few months. However, based on the present spot rates this week, our current estimate of 2015 versus the prior year is still within our April range of $200 million to $220 million. Significant movements in the British pound, the euro, Canadian dollar and Brazilian real over the past few months have netted to a relatively neutral impact versus that April estimate. A few other key items of note relative to our annual EPS guidance that you should be aware of. The first item is restructuring charges in the third quarter of 2015, will approximate 30% of the full year expectation of $50 million. There is some timing shift from the second quarter into the third quarter for several key actions. The second item is related to the third quarter as well. I have a few comments that I want you to understand related the timing for the back half of the year. First, we obviously expect higher planned restructuring charges in the third quarter versus our April estimate, as well as a higher tax rate in that quarter as well. Combining that with the significant currency headwind, this will result in the third quarter EPS of approximately 24% to 25% of the full year EPS estimate. Another factor to consider when you look at the third quarter is the operating margin rate. It will be relatively flat versus the prior year, as we experienced the largest quarterly impact of currency headwinds during this quarter, which is estimated at this point to be approximately $75 million. Let\u2019s turn to segments on the right side of the page. We expect high single-digit organic revenue growth, solid operating margin expansion year-over-year in the Tools & Storage segment, due to the volume leverage, cost actions, price and other significant positive actions that Jim touched on earlier in his commentary, which will more than offset the significant currency headwind we are experiencing in that business. Organic growth is expected to decelerate slightly in the back half on more difficult comparables but still will be at very healthy levels. Moving to our Security segment, we still expect to have modest organic growth for the full year. The organic growth in Security North America will compliment an improving performance in Security Europe, which continued its good momentum in the second quarter as you heard from Jim. This growth will be partially offset by declines within the China markets, as we continue to see some pressure in that part of the business. Profitability will be relatively flat versus the prior year as Security Europe will deliver solid year-over-year profit growth and North America mechanical will have healthy volume leverage. However, these improvements are being offset by negative North America electronics project mix as well as lower volumes within China. As Jim stated earlier on the call and we have stated previously several times, the multi-year growth in margin rates recovery trajectory of this business will not necessarily be linear. And we will have occasional timing dynamics to work through resulting from the ongoing transformational activities. Now moving to Industrial, we still expect solid mid-single-digit organic growth as Engineered Fastening strengths will be able to move -- to more than offset the declines in our infrastructure business. We also expect margins to be flat to up versus prior year as volume leverage generated by Engineered Fastening and cost controls will more than offset the deleveraging impact of both of our infrastructure businesses due to the sluggish market conditions that were touched upon by Jim. In summary, our revised EPS guidance range demonstrates the impact of our organic growth strength, combined with indirect cost savings, which are more than offsetting the slower margin improvement trajectory within Security. Therefore, we will achieve solid operating margin leverage and a robust organic growth even with significant currency headwinds, which means, we expect earnings will expand 6% to 10% on an overall revenue decline of approximately 1% in 2015. The last thing to touch on this page is related to our free cash outlook for the year, which we still anticipate be at least a $1 billion. However, as I mentioned earlier, we are monitoring the relatively higher levels of working capital experienced in first half of the year to ensure our working capital is adequate to service the higher organic growth expectations for the full year. This dynamic could put modest pressure on our free cash estimates for 2015. So let\u2019s summarize the presentation portion of our call today. We delivered a very strong first half for the year and here are some of the highlights. We are very pleased with another quarter of strong organic growth, our fourth in a row, at or above 6%. The proactive tight cost controls, surgical price actions across the company enabled excellent second quarter operating leverage in the face of $50 million currency headwinds. Progress continues with Security\u2019s multiyear transformation with favorable results in the European electronic and North America mechanical businesses. And then finally, our share count actions we have taken since the start of the fourth quarter of 2014 have effectively satisfied the approximately $1 billion of share reduction plans that we announced in November of 2013. As we communicated during our Investor Day in May, our focus in 2015 and beyond will be leveraging our world-class franchises and brands, strong free cash flow generation and continued shareholder friendly capital allocation. This continues to manifest itself through our focus on accelerating organic growth through SFS 2.0, advancing our Security multiyear transformation, so the portfolio review of this business is fit by the second half of 2016. Continue our disciplined approach to cost and pricing actions to ensure operating leverage is achieved. And ongoing focus on working capital towards our 10 plus returns goal and finally resuming M&A activity likely in the second half of 2015, with a focus on Tools & Storage and our Engineered Fastening franchises. We believe this approach will help position our company to deliver on the 2018 financial objectives we communicated back in May. That concludes the presentation portion of the call. Now let\u2019s go to Q&A. Greg Waybright : Great. Thanks. Thanks Don. Amanda, we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Wojs from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Tim Wojs : Yeah. Hey guys. Great job. John Lundgren : Thanks Tim. Tim Wojs : I guess just starting I guess my question\u2019s more in the Tools & Storage business. Could you just talk about maybe what you are seeing from a DIY and Professional Power Tools end customer standpoint? And you\u2019re starting to see I guess on the professional side -- are you starting to see employment come back in construction? Is that really a multiyear trend that will really benefit growth as we think about the next couple of years? John Lundgren : Yes. Hey, Tim, this is John. It\u2019s a complex answer and that it varies a lot by geography. And I think that\u2019s the only point I want to leave you with. The trends in the US are good. As demonstrated by the numbers that Jim walked you through, we\u2019re seeing more end users, we\u2019re seeing both online purchases, purchases through the two step channel, professional purchases through the big box, all good. You see or large customer\u2019s numbers, at the same time we do. They are nicely 5% to 7%, and of course we\u2019re above double that rate. So we are gaining share. Now that being said, and that\u2019s 50% as you know, or 52% of our revenue is in North America. Europe is relatively flat. So our organic growth in Europe is representing growth of 2, 3, 4 times the rate of the market. It certainly hit bottom. We don\u2019t see it getting any worse. But in Europe, it\u2019s far from robust. And the rest of the world, I think Jim talked about it pretty nicely. There are certain emerging markets, China and Russia way down, China relatively flat, the rest of the world doing okay. But in the North American market, we are cautiously optimistic that the signs are positive. They could be better, but they are certainly more positive than they have been. That shows up in our customer\u2019s numbers and it certainly shows up in our numbers. So that\u2019s helping us maintain a cautiously optimistic outlook. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. The phenomenal performance in tools and storages forces me to a question on security. So North American conversion, can you just elaborate a little bit more on what\u2019s going on there? Is there an issue of not pricing properly for complexity? Or is there an issue of just kind of experience and competency on bigger jobs and kind of a learning curve? Any additional color there would be helpful. Jim Loree : It\u2019s Jim. I think the issue is more of a learning curve issue. It\u2019s also a little bit of an organizational issue in terms of how exactly, how we\u2019re organized and the types of people we have experience, the level of experience that we have with people installing these very complex jobs, because we\u2019re getting into highly engineered solutions with Internet of things and software. And it\u2019s much more complex than the typical historical access control and intrusion type systems that we used to have. So there is a learning curve there and there is also a bit of a talent kind of training and development issue. Now pricing, I think we\u2019re gaining experience on pricing. We are creating a lot of value with many of these solutions and some of the verticals we are doing a really job capturing the price, the value in the form of price and then some of the other verticals. We need to improve it as well. So I think we will see continued progress in terms of the moving up the learning curve, but it\u2019s not an overnight kind of a process. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is open. David MacGregor : Yes. Congratulations on a great quarter as well. In security, you talked last quarter about seeing an increased order rate and then that came through strongly this quarter and now you\u2019re talking about seeing the ordering rate in Europe continuing to grow. I guess the question is really just, what\u2019s the rate of growth you\u2019re seeing in those orders? Does that order growth have a long tail or do those orders come through much more immediately? Jim Loree : The order growth definitely has a long tail. It typically averages about six months in terms of its tail and the backlog is growing in North America and in Europe, it is growing as well, I would say growing even more in North America. The European folks are doing a better job efficiently installing the backlog. North American folks have a growing backlog and have the opportunity to install at a faster rate, but are experiencing some learning curve issues as we just discussed. So it\u2019s all encouraging from an order rate perspective and we just need to do a better job in North America on the installation side. John Lundgren : Yes, David. This is John. Just to add on because it ties into a Jeff\u2019s question earlier and I think Jeff, you are on the right track and Jim I think explained very well what it is. Within that long tail, you have a mix of obviously size of projects as well as margins. And in appropriate world, we installed a higher margin projects first, which is not always an option, obviously given contractual commitments and customer needs. But it\u2019s one of the more difficult businesses when we just look at open orders or backlog to forecast that on a quarterly basis because the sixth plus months of time to get these things install. So Jeff\u2019s earlier question and yours are right on. I think Jim described it is as accurately as we are able to. And we continue to learn more about it everyday and we\u2019re getting better everyday at both prioritization, pricing, cost estimating, and it\u2019s all part of a learning curve to which Jim spoke. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Your line is open. Robert Barry : Hey, guys. Good morning. John Lundgren : Good morning. Robert Barry : I wondered if you could comment on the benefit to industrial revenue and margin in the quarter from the large oil and gas equipment sale. And then more broadly, what is your outlook for the oil and gas or infrastructure business? Thank you. Don Allan : Sure. This is Don. I will take that one. We did -- as Jim mentioned, we did have a large order in the second quarter associated with equipment, which does happen occasionally in this business and particularly in the Far East. We do get an occasional situation whether the large pipeline being constructed and we are just primarily selling equipment and then training them on how to use the equipment effectively in the construction process. Those things range from occurrence from anywhere from 6 to 12 months occasion they happen, but they are very sporadic. And we don\u2019t end to plan for those types of sales. And I think it\u2019s just happened to occur in the month of June, which we\u2019re all very pleased to see. As far as our outlook of oil and gas, I mean which continues to be similar to what we\u2019ve been saying for the last almost year now where the level of activity of construction of pipeline is really on the onshore really not existing at this stage. There continues to be a lot of activity within the industry about the potential kind of ramp up of activity in 2016. We have not seen specific quotes within that nature of the stage that would give us a high level of confidence, but then we\u2019ve also seen a downturn lately in the oil prices as well. So there is still volatility in this space, but ultimately we do feel that we are going to see some type of ramp up in activity in the next 12 to 18 months of pipeline construction, because there is a great deal of pent-up volume that needs to be dealt with and have to take to the stage. John Lundgren : We are also seeing on the oil and gas onshore. It\u2019s the onshore business that looks like it might get some legs next year, because we are doing a lot of prep work with specifications right now. Our concern is and the reason Don is very circumspect about it is, because there is a good chance that these types of projects will get delayed if the oil prices don\u2019t recover. And again, the gas prices are also a factor here because the onshore market is about 70% gas. The offshore market, which is another big piece of our business, doesn\u2019t look to be too favorable anytime soon. So it\u2019s kind of a mixed bag and we expect probably double-digit declines in the oil and gas for the next couple of quarters, and then we will see what happens when the comps get easier and the activity picks up. Jim Loree : The other thing I would want to just go back on the first part of the question just to make sure people don\u2019t get a view that this order was a huge impact to the second quarter. The impact at margin, the profit for EPS was less than $0.02 of EPS in the quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremie Capron from CLSA. Your line is open. Grace Lee : So this is Grace Lee sitting in for Jeremie Capron. Congratulations on a good quarter. We hear quite a broad-based trend in automotives end market. Could you give us a more color around engineered fastening? In which market do you see the strongest growth? And also how would you envision the growth trajectory going forward? Jim Loree : Well, when you say which market, I mean, we generally\u2026 Grace Lee : Geographically. Jim Loree : Yes, geographically, okay. So Asia was -- we\u2019re generally outpacing light vehicle production wherever we are operating geographically. I will say that I think the North American and European markets were a little stronger than the Asian markets in this particular quarter, but it\u2019s all over the map in terms of quarterly -- quarter-to-quarter. So it\u2019s -- I would say that it\u2019s -- our growth is not -- is less market related and more just penetration of platform, lot of platforms as we go here, but we do consider, although overall production was about flat for the global light vehicle. So it wasn\u2019t a particularly strong quarter at all for the market. John Lundgren : And our long-term view of that business answering the second half your question is that we think it\u2019s a business that fits into our long-term organic growth vision of 4% to 6%. And it\u2019s demonstrated a good track record to be within that range. And as it adopts more of the commercial excellence activities and innovation activities, that\u2019s 2.0, we think that will only assist in that ability to continue that on a long-term basis. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Deepa Raghavan : Good morning. This is Deepa Raghavan for Rich Kwas. Two questions. Two parts to it. Oil and gas business, I know you mentioned 11% organic growth spike -- from one-time spike, but could you share with us what the revenue growth for the total industrials would have been on an organic basis ex this spike? And also what the margin number might have been ex this one-time item? I am just trying to squarer up these strong margins you printed this quarter with the forecast. Second one. Don Allan : I will make it very clear. It was $7 million of revenue and $3.5 million of operation margin. John Lundgren : Which translates to less than $0.02 a share due to the large relatively large for oil and gas, it\u2019s less than a $300 million business. So when you get a $7 million order shipped in the quarter, that\u2019s large on a very small base on our $2 billion plus industrial segment base or $1.7 billion engineered fastening base. However, if you want to look at it within oil and gas, it was large; within the segment, it was tiny. Don Allan : And then just for analytical purposes, we understand why you\u2019re trying to get to a run rate, but please don\u2019t think of it as a one-time item because it\u2019s part of the ongoing discussion. John Lundgren : As we said many times as it relates to oil and gas, it\u2019s one of our few businesses, infrastructure in general, and oil and gas in particular where it\u2019s a long cycle business with large lumpy orders, unlike our Global Tools and Storage business and even a security business the way we install and recognize revenue. You get large orders and depending on when they are fulfilled in a quarter has tremendous variations. So it\u2019s one of our few businesses where quarter-to-quarter the numbers can vary dramatically due simply to timing. Jim Loree : And as I said earlier an answer to the first question, we\u2019ve seen this roughly every six to nine months. We have sometimes as large order like this, so it\u2019s not a one-time item. Maybe one time in a specific quarter, but when you look at a year, you can have one to two of these and even occasionally three that happen every year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Liam Burke from Wunderlich. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Liam Burke : Yes. Thank you. In the tools and storage business, you talked partially about the construction. Outside the construction, both on the industrial and on MAC tools, how those markets have been for you? John Lundgren : Well, the markets have generally been good in terms of MAC tools and markets. As you looked at some of the numbers that come out, they\u2019ve been very good. The statistics very recently published in the last 10 years in the U.S., which is overwhelmingly where MAC tools is of course. Car ownership, the average age of cars on the road has gone from slightly under nine to slightly over 11 years, which means cars have been built better, but it also means they\u2019re on the road longer and so there is a generally healthy environment for automotive repair and automotive aftermarket. That\u2019s clearly helping MAC. What\u2019s also helping MAC is just the benefit of it been part of our Global Tools & Storage business with a great product development, product introduction, good sales rhythm, good forecasting. A lot of the newer cars of course require a lot of diagnostics and something where we\u2019re relatively underdeveloped compared to some of the competition. But in general, Liam, those markets are healthy. And we benefited from that, but we clearly believe we are growing faster than those end markets, which implies share gain of course. Jim Loree : On the industrial side, clearly, there is a big differentiation within industrial markets by segment. And so the oil and gas issues within industrial marketplace are weighing on growth. We got ag laying on growth and mining as well and hydraulics. So, mixed bag in industry, I would say the MRO channel is little weaker than it has been, maybe inventories are little higher, we\u2019re not sure about that, but it feels that way. We don\u2019t have great data on the MRO channel. It seems like there might -- won\u2019t call it a correction, but sort of an inventory build maybe going on there. So in general, the industrial markets are a little weaker than they have been over the last year or so. Operator : And next question comes from Stephen Kim from Barclays. Your line is open. Stephen Kim : Yes. Thanks very much guys. Strong quarter. I guess a couple of questions, but let me just ask one. Essentially, this quarter in terms of guidance, you are talking about your year coming in about $0.20 better, due to the, frankly, organic growth and then I guess $0.15 headwind due to the security issues that have been discussed. I guess I'm curious as to what happened in the quarter. If you could give us a sense for how much better the organic growth in terms of cents in that same basis, $0.20 and that was the $0.15. If you could give us a sense for what happened in the quarter in those two buckets? How much better was the organic growth in terms of cents and how much worse was the security, relative to your expectations going-in in the quarter? Thanks. Don Allan : I\u2019ll take that. This is Don. I think our organic growth was about two points better in the second quarter versus beginning of the quarter expectation and most of that was driven as you might imagine in Tools & Storage, a little bit an Engineered Fastening. Our EPS level, how does it play out $0.20 versus $0.15? I mean, the way, my view would be, security was about $0.03 to $0.05 off expectation in the second quarter and you can do the math the rest of the way. But clearly, Tools and Storage outperformance, depending on how you look at our outperformance of the company, we look at the vast majority of that $0.10 as an operational outperformance and a lot of that\u2019s being driven by Tools & Storage. There is some plusses and minuses below operating margin but the bulk of that is next to zero. And really what you\u2019re looking at is a $0.05 to $0.08 operational outperformance, but if you factor that $0.03 to $0.05 in, then Tools & storage was somewhere around $0.08 to $0.10, or $0.12 outperformance. John Lundgren : Tools & Storage plus industrial. Don Allan : Plus industrial. Thank you, John. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Mike Sang : Hey. Good morning guys. It\u2019s Mike Sang for Nigel. A few comments on how the quarter phased? I mean, we\u2019re getting conflicting data points with oil and gas over dipping and [indiscernible] is volatile and I think even construction has been a little bit lumpy. So if you could talk about growth ex in June and how that\u2019s trending to July that would be great? I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for back half of this facility? Thanks. Don Allan : This is Don. I\u2019ll take that one. We -- actually when you look at the second quarter, we saw a pretty balance level of growth across the quarter, especially in Tools -- actually in all our business. As we look at all our businesses, we saw relatively healthy growth in all our businesses in each point of month across the quarter. And so we didn't see an accelerating trend or a decelerating trend in the month of June. Our guidance is reflective. Obviously, we feel good with what we\u2019ve experienced in the first half of the year and the momentum as we exited the first half of the year, which allowed us to increase our organic growth assumption of 5% to 6%. So, we\u2019re clearly seeing trends that make us feel at least, reasonably good about the market. We will be the first one to admit. There is a lot of conflicting data and information out there across the construction and industrial phase as to what might happen in the back half of the year. And as a result, we\u2019ve evaluated that combined with a very healthy organic growth performance in the first half. I think we\u2019ve put forth a very balanced view of the full year. John Lundgren : And just to add briefly do that. I think as Jim pointed out in his piece of the presentation, our largest business obviously is within GT&S, Global Tools & Storage. It\u2019s where we have the best data. Inventories are at or slightly below normal levels that bodes well for the future. That\u2019s partially offset by relatively weak industrial markets compared to what we\u2019d like to see. But simply said, a very smooth quarter and a very good position in terms of inventories at the customer level, which has led to our guiding the second half of the year the way we have versus importantly, if you look at the details, some very, very steep and difficult comps, but keep that in mind as you look forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Wood from Macquarie Capital. Your line is open. Mike Wood : Hi. Congratulations on the organic growth. John Lundgren : Thank you. Mike Wood : My question was on the Security business. You return to the organic growth in Europe. Can you give us some color in terms of what the margin range is now, the improvement in Europe? And is that -- is your decision on what action you\u2019re going to take in security, dependent upon the execution of the business or the valuation kind of how that parses out within family? Thank you. Don Allan : As far as, Europe goes, as Jim mentioned in a nice level of detail that the business continues to progress forward. It\u2019s turned the corner in the sense of organic growth over the last two or three quarters. We\u2019re starting to demonstrate modest level of 3% in the second quarter, which we're pleased with. The profitability continues to improve. It\u2019s still in the range of mid to high-single digits and as it exit this year, it will certainly be at the high single-digit level as it continues to progress in the back half of the year through its transformation. So, we really -- and that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve communicated in the past, so it\u2019s consistently performing with our expectation. As far as, our view as to our decision associated with the fit in the portfolio, it will be a combination of factors to evaluate. And certainly, the one that, probably, drives the most, a largest part of decision will be valuation and if the valuation improves based on a certain outcome that we make related to that decision. And ultimately, we believe we\u2019re here to drive shareholder value over the long-term and if we think whatever decision we make is going to achieve that result that will be a big driver of decision. Certainly, evaluating how its performing is a factor but I don't think it\u2019s the primary one. John Lundgren : Yeah. Let me -- this is John. Let me just add to that. I certainly agree with everything Don said. But as we\u2019ve had a lot of focus again on the 15% of our business that\u2019s performing slightly below our line average specifically. So, I think, Jim pointed out European security and North American conversion. We\u2019re focused on improving the performance. But I think it's fairly important just to note that while it\u2019s -- that subsegment of that segment are performing at a level slightly below our [OM] [ph] average. They\u2019re performing right in the middle of fair way, relative to their peers. This is not a broken business. It\u2019s the business that\u2019s performing not as well as it has in the past. There is some industry trends, as well as some internal executional issues that Jim spoke about I think in great detail. I guess, I just -- we need to be on record. This is not a broken business. It\u2019s a good business. It's been better and it will be better going forward. And our assessment of it will be based on both the trends that as Don said, we\u2019re here to create shareholder value. That\u2019s ultimately going to be the driver this time next year as we zero in on it fit in our portfolio relative to elsewhere. Operator : Thank you. And I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Greg for closing remarks. Greg Waybright : Amanda, thanks. We\u2019d like to thank everyone again calling in this morning and for your participation in the call and obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.

MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC Operator : Welcome to the Third Quarter 2015 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Stephanie and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor & Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin. Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations : Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's third quarter 2015 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself is John Lundgren, Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website, as well as on our iPhone and iPad applications. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 :00 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, John, Jim, and Don will review our third quarter 2015 results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's, therefore, possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 1934 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, thanks, Greg. Good morning, everybody. We are fortunate to be in a position to report another healthy operational quarter featuring strong organic growth as well as margin expansion. You saw in the press release, organic growth was 6% offset by currency which was a negative 8%, and as a consequence, net sales were down 2%, as the foreign exchange headwinds we've talked about on past calls continue at historically high levels. This was the fifth consecutive quarter of organic growth, at or above 6% for the company on a combined basis, with impressive growth once again, from the Tools & Storage business, 9%. Jim will give you a lot more segment detail in just a minute. Our operating margin rate expanded to a post-merger record of 14.8%, which is 70 basis points ahead of third quarter 2014. And we attribute this to volume, with sharp cost focus, price realization in both developed and emerging markets and commodity deflation that, together, delivered robust operating leverage, despite $70 million in foreign currency pressure during the quarter. And we opportunistically repurchased about $200 million worth of shares within the quarter, capitalizing on the recent U.S. equity market declines. So the combination of organic growth and the margin expansion led the third quarter fully diluted EPS of $1.55, which is up 1% versus prior year, as the strong operational performance more than offset tax and restructuring headwinds. Specifically, the third quarter tax rate that Don will talk about, of 24.5% with 540 basis points higher than prior year, while restructuring charges in the quarter were approximately $14 million higher than the third quarter of 2014. So the restructuring charges were about a $0.07 (3:47) EPS headwind during the quarter. As a consequence of our third quarter performance and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we're increasing 2015's full year GAAP EPS guidance range to $5.80 to $5.95, and that's up from our prior guidance of $5.70 to $5.90. So, up 8% to 11% versus the prior year. Not surprisingly, I'm just really pleased with our organization's demonstrable agility in delivering both organic growth and operating leverage in such a dynamic operating environment. Organic growth remained strong, but diving just a little bit deeper into the sources of our growth, it was broad-based. Volume grew 5% and was aided by 100 basis points of price realization, from a combination of efforts to combat the currency headwinds in many of our markets overseas, and the implementation of surgical pricing actions domestically, resulting in a total of 6% organic growth for the quarter. As already mentioned the foreign exchange headwinds remained severe and they detracted 8 percentage points from our performance during the quarter. All geographies grew mid-single digits, with the U.S. leading the pack and Europe growing well above market rates. Our emerging market group in the rest of the world also posted solid growth despite doing no business in Venezuela and softness in Russia, China, and Australia. Interestingly, Japan grew 8% driven by strong STANLEY Engineered Fastening performance in the automotive markets. Let's take a closer look at the segments and Jim is going to walk you through that in a lot more detail. James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : Okay. Thank you, John. I'll start with Tools & Storage. It was another banner quarter for the team in this strong momentum business. Revenue was up 2%, while operating margin grew 8%. We once again set a post-merger record with a 16.7% operating margin rate, demonstrating impressive leverage. Gains resulted from volume related incrementals, modestly positive price, variable cost productivity, continued tight SG&A cost management and some benefit from input price reductions, the combination of which more than offset severe currency headwinds. Organic growth remained strong, up 9%, overcoming a 9% comp in a noteworthy fifth quarter in a row at or above that 9% growth level. All regions contributed with strong performances as North America was up 11%, Europe was up 7% and emerging markets up 6%. Organic strength was prevalent across the global product lines with professional power tools up 9%, consumer power tools up 12%, accessories up 9%, and hand tools and storage up 8%. All categories benefited from strong customer level and new product commercial execution. Encouragingly, this overall performance shows that the Tools & Storage growth in innovation machine can continue to be successful in the face of tougher comps. The combination of the launch of our DEWALT Outdoor line as well as other enhanced products in conjunction with a more normal weather pattern this year resulted in the successful outdoor season that was up double digits for the quarter as well as year-to-date. POS was again robust across the channels, with major big-box customers in the U.S. continuing their recent strength. Aggregate weeks on-hand at retail is in a good place in line with historical levels. The U.S. hardware, lumber stores, STAFDA and online channels were again very strong as construction markets benefited from growth in end-user demand and our own commercial execution took that a step further. Mac Tools growth continued at impressive levels continuing to outpace the healthy North American automotive aftermarket on the strength of new product and a growing franchisee base. Not surprisingly, we did experience softness in our U.S. industrial markets, which was directly attributable to the slowdown in Oil & Gas and mining end markets. Europe continued with its impressive organic growth and commercial excellence, averaging 7% growth over the last 10 quarters in a flattish market. The share gains in the quarter have been broad with almost all markets showing a positive performance. The stream of new innovative products, adding new points of distribution and leveraging our stable of iconic brands is a winning model that continues to reinforce our position as the world leader in Tools & Storage. Emerging market organic growth was again encouraging at 6% as double-digit performance in Latin America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia more than offset steep declines in Russia and a weak performance in China. The mid-price point product rollout, led by STANLEY Branded Power Tools, continued to be timely and effective as end users tend to be more value-oriented in economies under economic duress. And clearly the scale, maturity and depth of our emerging market team, in conjunction with this important initiative, continues to bolster our organic growth and overall developing market performance in a more than challenging and volatile environment. I would like to take just a moment to recognize our Global Tools & Storage management team in both the developed and developing markets. The results speak for themselves. Organic growth averaging 10% over the last five quarters, margins up by 130 basis points year-to-date and at record levels despite about 150 points of FX pressure expected for the year, SFS 2.0 is clearly enabling strong customer execution, outsized organic growth, margin expansion and over 9 working capital turns. And some people have the perception that we are simply riding the U.S. construction and DIY wave, and we are to an extent. However, only about 40% of the Global Tools business benefits from that. What we're clearly seeing is the manifestation of a performance culture grounded in SFS, second and third order benefits from the Stanley Black & Decker merger and the potential of the world's leading Tools & Storage franchise. What is exciting is that there is even more opportunity ahead as the team takes SFS 2.0 to the next level, which we will begin to see in 2016. Now, moving to Security. This was clearly a quarter of advancement for Security, demonstrating the operational progress that we are looking for as we pursue our multi-year plan to transform the business. Execution within Europe was outstanding and both the North American electronics and mechanical locks businesses took encouraging steps forward. Europe, again, had a long list of accomplishments, including 4% organic growth, another double-digit order rate performance, attrition rates within their target zone, and operating margin which improved versus prior year for the fourth consecutive quarter and is now in the high single digits. Commercial execution exhibited good breadth with organic growth achieved in all major geographic markets and signs that we are beginning to move the market share needle into positive territory. In recent quarters, our European management team has demonstrated the winning spirit that comes with consistently delivering organic growth and profitability commitments, while winning in the marketplace. The U.S. mechanical lock business also showed progress with 4% organic growth and improving profitability. Our management team remains focused on specification writing, revitalizing product lines through innovation and driving commercial excellence. North American electronics security had a mixed quarter with more positives than negatives. On the plus side, there was sequential margin expansion, operational stability and financial predictability. And on the other side of the ledger, inorganic revenue decline. While we continue to improve field operational performance, increase order rates and grow a healthy backlog, the opportunity to deliver growth and margin expansion is there in coming quarters. And Security is relatively a small emerging market domain, significant softness in China cut into overall segment organic growth and profitability, once again muting some of the gains across the other businesses. Now, turning to Industrial. Industrial delivered another steady performance from Engineered Fastening and weathered market-related declines within Infrastructure. And that result was a 7% decrease in revenue as flat organic growth was more than offset by 7 points negative currency. Margins were up modestly, as volume leverage in Engineered Fastening, tight cost controls and pricing, more than offset the negative impact of foreign exchange and organic declines in the Infrastructure businesses. Engineered Fastening posted 3% organic growth led by double-digit performance in automotive, once again, outpacing global light vehicle production which was relatively flat in the quarter. Additionally, we saw a solid growth within electronics. This growth offset lower North America Industrial sales tied to weakening market conditions. All in all, it was an impressive quarter of organic growth and margin expansion for Engineered Fastening, despite the translational currency headwinds experienced within the business. Infrastructure, which includes Oil & Gas and Hydraulics, was down 10%, in line with our expectations. Oil & Gas was down 7% as signs of life in the onshore North American market were not enough to offset continued declines and global onshore and offshore pipeline activity. Growth in Hydraulics was down 17%, as volume in our demolition shares is correlated to pricing levels in the scrap steel market. In summary, it was a solid operational performance by the Industrial teams, holding organic growth flat and expanding the operating margin rate despite soft infrastructure and global industrial markets as well as a significant currency drag. So, as we assess this quarter's performance in the aggregate, it represents another strong quarter for the overall company with 6% organic growth and record operating margin levels that expanded 70 basis points despite approximately 150 basis points of currency headwinds. We are now on track to grow EPS 8% to 11% in 2015 despite friction from external obstacles including the strong dollar and dynamic end markets. We are also in good shape for 2016. Our balance sheet is solid and at current exchange rates, our FX headwinds will begin to decrease and we have a series of growth and margin enhancing initiatives, both underway and planned. We also have a solid M&A pipeline and expect to resume our inorganic growth activities in a measured but meaningful way in the near future. We look forward to finishing 2015 at our upgraded EPS guidance levels and entering 2016 with a viable roadmap for revenue, cash flow and EPS growth. We thank you and I'll now turn it over to Don Allan. Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Jim. I'd like to begin with our third quarter and year-to-date free cash flow performance. For the third quarter, free cash flow was $171 million, which was down modestly from last year's results. This brings the year-to-date performance to $174 million. The lower year-to-date results compared to the prior year is mainly explained by higher inventory levels needed in the summer and the fall of 2015, which were required to service the increased levels of organic growth we are experiencing, primarily within the Tools & Storage business. The core SFS principles require agility to respond when business conditions change, such as the strong organic growth we have experienced recently. SFS has enabled us to reach working capital and asset efficiency levels that are considered world-class compared to our industrial and security peers, while being agile to changing market conditions to ensure we meet our customers' needs. We expect that by the end of 2015, we will deliver approximately a 0.5 working capital turn improvement versus the prior year and achieve turns within the range of 9.5 to 9.7 times, which will demonstrate another step closer towards achieving our goal of 10 working capital turns. However, given our strong organic growth performance in 2015 of 6%, the 0.5 working capital turn improvement will not translate into cash flow benefit for the full year of 2015 but, instead, will result in a modest cash outflow. This is one of the benefits of great strong organic growth as it begins to become a bit of a pressure to your cash flow. One other item of note related to cash flow, the improvement of approximately 3 turns from 6.4 turns in Q3 to the end of the year is heavily influenced by the normal Tools & Storage seasonality. For those of you who have followed our business for many years know that this fourth quarter Tools & Storage seasonality dynamic is a regular occurrence given the timing of sales and shipments as they occur within the quarter. This outstanding working capital results, combined with capital expenditure control and our improved earnings outlook will result in the company delivering free cash flow approaching $1 billion in 2015. As John mentioned, during the quarter we also executed opportunistic share repurchases of $200 million. This brings our cumulative total share actions to the equivalent of $1.2 billion in the last 12 months. As we have reviewed during our Investor Day in May, you should expect us to return over time to a capital allocation of approximately 50% of our free cash flow being deployed through M&A, and the other 50% through our shareholders via dividends and the occasional opportunistic share repurchase. Let's move to the next page in our updated 2015 outlook. As indicated by John earlier and Jim, we are increasing the 2015 EPS range to $5.80 to $5.95 versus the previous range of $5.70 to $5.90. We are able to raise our outlook primarily due to strong business performance across several areas of the company, driven by commodity deflation and cost control. In particular, we are starting to see stronger than initially expected benefits from steel, resin and other base metals that manifest themselves in our income statement's result. However, these benefits are partially offset by foreign exchange headwind that is now expected to be at the high end of our previous $200 million to $220 million range, when you use current rates. Most of that impact is related to the weakening of the Brazilian real over the last two or three months. The net result of these changes is $0.07 to $0.08 increase to our midpoint outlook range that I just provided. Moving to the right side of the page and a little bit more detail on the segments. First, let's start with Tools & Storage. We continue to expect high single-digit organic revenue growth within Tools & Storage. This is slightly better than compared to our July outlook. We also expect solid operating margin rate expansion year-over-year in this segment due to volume leverage, cost actions, price, and commodity deflation I just mentioned, which will more than offset the impact of currency. Security remains on track with the forecast we provided in last quarter's guidance. Margins for the full year are expected to be generally consistent with the prior year on relatively flat organic revenue. Industrial will continue to benefit from the momentum in our Engineered Fastening Electronics and Automotive businesses, which will be modestly offset by slow growth and/or pressure in some of the general industrial markets, and infrastructure that Jim touched on. However, this still has us on a path for low to mid-single-digit organic growth for the year with a solid operating margin performance. In summary, our revised EPS guidance range demonstrates a strong year-to-date performance across much of the company, which means we are now on track for 8% to 11% EPS growth, despite currency headwinds of appropriately $220 million or $1.10 of EPS. Before leaving this page, I would like to make a few comments regarding 2016. While it is premature to get into a lot of detail for 2016, the current exchange rates will result in approximately $100 million headwind. This is related to continued devaluations of various currencies, including the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real versus the U.S. dollar, as well as the impact of our 2015 transactional foreign exchange hedges rolling off next year. Similar to what we did in 2015, we are proactively identifying cost reductions, aggressively pursuing commodity deflation, and other pricing opportunities to partially mitigate this impact and will position us to demonstrate continued operating leverage in 2016, as well as reasonable earnings growth. So let's summarize the presentation portion of our call today. We delivered a very strong third quarter performance and here are some of the highlights. We are very pleased with another quarter of strong organic growth, our fifth in a row at or above 6%. The proactive tight cost controls and surgical price actions across the entire company enabled excellent third quarter operating leverage in the face of $70 million of currency headwinds. The third item is progress continues with Security's multiyear transformation, with sequential improvement across most of the operations, and we were very pleased with the result. We were also able to execute additional share repurchases in the third quarter, as I mentioned, bringing the total share count actions we have taken since the start of the fourth quarter of 2014 to $1.2 billion. As we communicated during our Investor Day in May, our focus in 2015 and beyond will be on leveraging our world-class franchises and brands, strong free cash flow generation and continued shareholder friendly capital allocation. This continues to manifest itself and are focused on accelerating organic growth through SFS 2.0, while supplementing that growth with acquisitions, advancing securities multi-year transformation to achieve consistent low-single digit organic growth and 15% profitability by 2018. Also continuing our disciplined approach to cost and pricing actions to ensure we have annual operating leverage as we grow. And finally, an ongoing focus on working capital turns. We believe this approach will help position our company to continue our strong performance trend and achieve our long-term financial objectives. Thank you. And that concludes the presentation portion of our call. Now let's move to Q&A. Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations : Great. Thanks, Don. Stephanie, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer-session. Our first question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to squeeze in two questions here. But Jim or John, could you comment on price as you start to look at 2016 with the deflationary environment? A lot of companies are starting to struggle in terms of pushing through price, like to get your views on that. And then in terms of the near term on Industrial, how do you feel about the landscape right now? There are some pressures in the environment. Have you baked in some cushion around Industrial and the landscape peers as we move out the next few months? Thanks. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Don is going to give you the view on price going forward, to the extent we're going to talk about it for 2016. And then Jim, I think, can give you a little deeper dive on Industrial and our thoughts. James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, Rich. On pricing, I think it's a couple of dynamics. One is, certainly, we've been able to achieve positive pricing benefits because of some of the negative foreign exchange impact we've had in emerging markets in particular, and even a little bit in our European regions as well. So, as we import our products into those particular regions and we are impacted negatively by foreign currency, we obviously try to recoup as much of that as possible through pricing actions in the local market. With us having a continued headwind going into 2016, we will continue to be prudent about our approach in that area and go after specific price actions where it makes sense, given the different dynamics in those markets. So we do think there will be ability to gain some price in emerging markets as a result of that pressure from foreign currency. In more developed markets like the United States, or even Europe where we're manufacturing product and selling it within the region, pricing will continue to be an area that we stay very focused on. We've been heavily focused on specific surgical pricing actions in the last year-and-a-half to two years in those developed markets. We don't see any reason for that to change. I think the commodity deflation impact will be an area that we have to watch closely. It impacts certain types of products and it doesn't impact other products quite as much. And as I said, being surgical allows you to evaluate those types of decisions. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Jim, talk about the three pieces. Obviously, Rich, you're aware that STANLEY Engineered Fastening is the overwhelming majority of our Industrial segment. But they really are responding to some very different market dynamics. James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yes. I think, when you talk about Industrial, it always boils down to the sub-segments both geographically and also just sub-segments within industrial categories. And I think what we see right now in the North American market is a dichotomy between some of the more difficult end markets, such as oil and gas, mining and ag in particular, and then we see continued, I won't call it buoyancy, but maybe continued perseverance in the automotive market. So while automotive kind of chugs on, I think that's driven largely by the kind of the resurgence in consumer and also the ageing fleet. So automotive is very important to Engineered Fastening, about 40% of its revenues or so. And as long as automotive is healthy, that particular part of the business is going to be fairly healthy. And then, of course, electronics is the other big part of Engineered Fastening, another big part, and that continues to be strong as well. And then the general kind of MRO-related industrial, it's a function of kind of the accumulation of the sub-segments. And that is a little bit on the weak side right now in North America. You can see it from some of the results of the distributors that have actually come out; so a mixed bag in North America. We don't see it going negative at this point. It's flattish and maybe slightly up or slightly down, but kind of hovering around the flattish. And then Europe, Europe has been challenged in that flattish kind of a way for a long time, and we see a little bit of negative drag in Europe but nothing catastrophic at this point. I think the weak euro as much as the strong dollar has hurt exports in the U.S. The weak euro tends to have the potential to maybe boost the industrial in Europe a little bit. So I think on balance we do see some pressure in industrial. We have factored that into our thought process, but we don't see recessionary conditions, although industrial production is relatively weak in the aggregate right now. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The only thing I'd add, Rich, and we'll move on, when Jim talked about the North American markets in our sub-segments, he mentioned obviously oil and gas, mining, ag, and the relatively depressed prices in the scrap steel market has had an impact on our hydraulics business. Of course, demolition, as you know, is a very large part of that. So we've got those headwinds in a couple of our smaller businesses, but a modestly healthy environment in Engineered Fastening, both domestically and abroad. I mentioned a bright spot in Japan for us, which was quite encouraging, and the business is doing quite well. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. The question I had was just regarding getting a little bit more granularity with the adjustments to the full-year guidance. If you kind of take the midpoint of the prior FX headwind to where you are expecting today, it doesn't seem like it's that much more, maybe $10 million, $15 million, or $10 million from the midpoint. So just want to understand versus three months ago, what were the biggest drivers of those? And then conversely in terms of the upside stronger business performance combined with better commodity deflation, if you think of like $10 million incremental headwind to get to the guidance range, we're talking about maybe another $25 million of positive roughly speaking. So if that math is right, $25 million, $30 million of incremental positive, how does that break down between the stronger business performance and the commodity deflation? And more specifically, where within the business are you seeing that better performance and what's the bigger weight? John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Rank has its privileges and I'm going to let Don try to tackle that one. There are a lot of moving pieces, Mike. But I think Don can kind of tie a little bit of a bow on it for you. Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. Your math is actually pretty close, so as you think about us raising our midpoint by about $0.07 or $0.08 of EPS, yeah, we probably have about $10 million of new FX pressure. As I said, we're at the higher end of that range; that's about $0.05 of EPS. And then you have about $25 million or so of positive impact from commodity deflation and other indirect cost controls. And the net of those two items gets you basically to $0.07 and $0.08. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeremie Capron with CLSA. Your line is open. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to focus a little bit on the Tools & Storage segment. Margins were very strong. I understand the good volume leverage here, but looks like we're coming in at the high end of that range that you've talked about in the past as being sort of the cyclical high margins that we could expect from this business. Any change in your view here given that at this point you still have 150 points of forex pressure in those margins? Should we envision margins continuing to trend up into next year as long as volumes go up? And the other question, a follow-up on this, is I understand you have very strong share gains across regions. I just wanted to get a better sense of what do you see in terms of the underlying demand trends in North America in particular. James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : Sure. This is Jim. When we think about margins and margins through the cycle, we don't necessarily let the cycle drive the margins, per se. We tend to be much more proactive about it. So at the down part of the cycle, we're taking out cost at a very healthy pace. And as we enjoy the ride up the cycle, we don't back off in terms of some of the things that we do to maintain the upward pressure, everything we can do to maintain the upward pressure on margins. So I think the potential for what you're calling the peak cycle margin rate is quite high. And I think evidence of that is if this whole FX headwind hadn't occurred, we would be at record-margins for the company and the Tool business. So the things that we do are things like continuous productivity, 3% to 4% cost productivity. Every year we have a very, very surgical and data-driven pricing program in this company, which goes across all the businesses, including the Tool business, where we constantly are improving our subject matter expertise and our analytics in pricing and looking at price/volume tradeoffs and making sure that we're optimizing our margins and our overall margin in that regard. And then we have design-to-value which is a more programmatic approach to driving cost out of products. In the design cycle we have a simplification and complexity reduction program, which again drives cost out of the products and we have mix management. We are doing everything that we know how to do to drive margins up. And where that limit is, we don't know, but we constantly try to drive them up. So I think that's kind of the way we think about it. As far as the share picture in various geographies in the Tool business, I have to say that I don't think there is any region in the world, except with the possible exception of China, where we are not gaining share. And this business has implemented a commercial excellence initiative, which has taken the strength of Stanley and Black & Decker's scale, its brands, its products, its innovation, and it is driving that across all geographies in a very aggressive way and it's been very successful and we expect it to continue to do so. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And Jeremie, it's John. Just to add to that, both in terms of our drive for margins and share gain, more from a qualitative perspective, but I think it's demonstrable. In the past two months we've been named category-specific Vendor of the Year by our two largest customers. Never before, at least in our history, I've been here 11 years and Jim and Don 15 years, have we achieved such coveted and prestigious recognition from our two largest customers in the same year. And I think if nothing else, or just anecdotally, that's a tribute to the strength of our brand, the strength of the programs, and the commercial execution that Jim was talking about. And obviously, those kinds of things are leading to share gain and we're pleased with that. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. John, you briefly just mentioned China and I just have a question overall thinking about kind of the dynamics in the EMs and Tools & Storage specifically. A very strong performance as you characterized with strong Latin America offsetting weaker Russia and China. It's being difficult for Latin America to continue to carry that ball with what's going on in Brazil, et cetera. Just wondering if you could kind of give us a little bit more granular lay of the land on how you expect... John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes... Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : ...those things to play out. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Sure, Jeff. Very fair. To give you some numbers because it \u2013 boy, they're all over the place, but Latin America, what we call our Latin American group organically grew 13%. Brazil, which is the largest by far market, we grew 4% organically. But obviously, we're suffering some huge currency headwinds that Don talked about. But we have smaller countries, Venezuela, as I say where we've done zero business essentially for about the last six quarters. We had good performance in Mexico, good performance in Colombia; Brazil as I say, up low-single digits, which gave us low-double digit growth in Latin America. Country-specific, they represent a small percentage of our volume, but Russia was down 30%, China was down 28%. We think that's not inconsistent with the markets in general. The silver lining in the clouds for us particularly in China is the expansion of our mid-price-point product offerings, locally produced by a subsidiary that we control. We think that in and of itself is going to help us a lot, but we we're working off some high comps. The bad news is we're down 25% to 30% in both Russia and China. The good news is those are very small markets and a small base. So $2 million, $3 million, $4 million of improvement will bring us back to where we were. What we're doing about it? I think the simplest way to describe it, we aren't withdrawing, we aren't cutting back, we've stopped adding feet on the street and variable cost resources at the pace we were adding them, but we haven't cut anything, and we're reallocating resources within our emerging market group, Asia, and to a lesser extent Latin America, because we just think those are still huge economies, 45% or 46% of our business is still outside the U.S., that includes Europe, of course, and we're not going to withdraw our support for those markets. So, a long answer to a simple question, but I think the huge volatility in certain countries gives you a flavor for how we're approaching it. It's much more a question we're reallocating resources as opposed to cutting them, because we're in these bit markets for the long haul. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Dahl with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus on the Security segment. You've got kind of diverging trends here. On one hand the previous problem area in terms of Europe is improving and seeing accelerating organic growth, and now it seems like you're seeing some deceleration in North America and emerging markets, I guess, on the electronics side in particular. So just curious, as you look out to \u2013 obviously, you've outlined a path to what you need to see from this overall business over the next year. How are these trends playing into that? Are you more or less positive on the positioning of the business as you see it today versus how you were thinking about it three months or six months ago? John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Fair question. Don will give you a little detail, but I guess from top of the house, I can say we feel as good or better about these businesses as we have in the past. You talked about Europe; they're delivering on their commitments, which pleases us and pleases the folks there. And we think we have the right people in the right chairs. And we think we understand what the issues are within North American Security. Don has been spending a lot of time with that team. So let me have him give you a little more granularity. Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. Thanks, John. So, what John said is exactly correct. And, yeah, we're really pleased, and Jim went through it in a lot of detail in his presentation around the European performance, how it continues to improve, demonstrating a short stretch of time here of consistent organic growth, sequential improvement in operating margin rate. All the things that we talked about a year ago that we wanted to accomplish for that business; we're seeing them really get traction in all those areas. In North America, I wouldn't say that we feel like we're losing traction or slowing down. We definitely know that we had a little bit of a, kind of a blip on the radar in the second quarter of this year because of a large installation that completed itself. It didn't repeat, as you can see, in the third quarter because the third quarter bounced back to our expectations. They're actually slightly better than our expectations around profitability. And we continue to deal with an evolving and changing environment related to our vertical selling solutions, specifically targeting two verticals, retail and healthcare, as an area to really concentrate and help the business grow. The positive in North America that I see is that the backlog continues to grow and the order rates are double-digits and these are trends that we've seen now for two quarters or three quarters, which is positioning us well for next year to demonstrate some organic growth in North America in electronic security and mechanical security, for that matter. The last piece is China. I mean, overall, emerging markets is relatively small for the Security business. And outside of China, it's doing relatively well. But in China, because of the economic circumstances, market conditions, we've definitely seen some of the retrenching revenue declines that John mentioned in China a few minutes ago of double-digit declines, and that's been significant. We think that's more market related. It's not a big part of the business. Like everyone else, I think we all think China will begin to gradually get back on track at some point in the next two quarters to three quarters probably. So we're not overly concerned about that. So our focus now is continued execution improvement in Europe; continued execution improvement in North America, and really hunker down in the emerging markets, get through this period of time in China and then begin to demonstrate growth as we come out of that. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. Good job again in a tough environment. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I just had a bigger picture question on Tools. What inning do you think we're in around some of the adoption of some of the new technology development that's been going on, whether it's brushless or just improved battery performance? And I guess would you characterize this as maybe a technology step function that's similar to what lithium-ion was a few years ago or several years ago? John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I would say, Tim, it's a really good question, and I would say no. Lithium-ion, if you think about it relative to NiCad, it was a better mousetrap, more power, longer run times, better for the environment, and the only issue was cost. And like any technological breakthrough, when you can get the cost in line, it's going to displace its predecessor. What we're seeing now and I don't think is a step function, I think to answer your question, which is a very fair one, and it's only one person's opinion that you're getting. That being said, the leverage for us is going to come from what I think we do best. We weren't the inventors of brushless. We obviously didn't invent, and we were a slow follower on the application of lithium-ion and things of that nature. Where I believe we've excelled, and I give tremendous credit to our global Tools & Storage team, both in the product development perspective, commercial execution, et cetera, is just the application of all of those technologies. The application of brushless, lithium-ion, the way we've been able to get more power, more run time combined with the DEWALT brand, good programs to support it, those are all, I would argue, incremental as opposed to step functions. And that's where our success has come the last two years or three years. Is there more on the horizon? I think, yeah. I think we can see we're cautiously optimistic about what our team has in the pipeline in terms of further advancements of those existing technologies, but I don't see anything in the application of those technologies, but I don't see another lithium-ion, if you will, breakthrough per se in the foreseeable future. But that doesn't mean we're not going to push those hard and get more than our fair share of the market growth by applying the technologies. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Wood with Macquarie. Your line is open. Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Can you give us some color in terms of the North America vertical products in Security, just what the life cycle on the margins look like relative to your more typical products there? If you could just differentiate maybe on the installs, would we expect lighter, is that what we're seeing now and does that become more of a tailwind as you get more to recurring with the vertical products? James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. I'll take that one, Mike. You know the verticals that we're really concentrating on right now are retail and healthcare. And, as you know, the idea of a vertical selling solutions is to really create a solution that offers much more than just security to our customers. Security is certainly a core component of the solution, but are there other things that we can do, such as in retail where we provide certain information and database on traffic flow in and out of the stores, correlating that with POS, et cetera. In healthcare, we're looking at helping productivity within the healthcare environment, the nurses and doctors, and offering solutions in that area to help the customers reduce cost or save money. And so, the model is really to bring forth those types of solutions that give more value, and does that translate into more beyond the installation into certain types of recurring revenue streams. And, that's really the intention of it. At this stage, it's still early development around that. But as we get deeper into these verticals and particularly the two that I just mentioned, I do believe that certain recurring revenue streams will evolve from those types of solutions. So, I think that's something you continue to watch and monitor. It's an area of focus as part of our strategy. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Your line is open. Robert F. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey, guys. Good morning. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning. Robert F. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Just a quick housekeeping first. I wanted to clarify those growth rates John was giving earlier on the emerging markets, if that was for just Tools or the total company. But then, my question was really on SG&A, 21.5% of sales, very good performance. It actually looks like a record, at least, in recent history. Just wanted to unpack a little more what's driving that, how much is structural and how should we be modeling SG&A going forward? Thank you. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'll clarify the first one. The numbers that I gave, the growth rates or lack thereof in some of the emerging markets, were total company. That being said, with the exception of certain Asian markets, that is overwhelmingly Global Tools & Storage. As Don mentioned, Singapore, China, some, we got meaningful Security business, 20% of our total in those markets. But they were total company numbers which were overwhelmingly Tools & Storage. But Don, you want to talk about... Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : SG&A. Sure. Yeah. So the performance, very pleased with the SG&A as a percentage of revenue in Q3 at 21.5% or in that category. But for the year, we do expect us to be somewhere around 22.3%, 22.4% for the total year. We do have some additional costs that do creep into the systems for lack of better word, in the fourth quarter related to some of the promotional activities we do and in-store activities around the holidays that will likely make that number creep up a little bit in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. But we are definitely seeing another step-change in this particular area in 2015. So, in 2014, we were close to 23% as a percentage of revenue, and when we end the year, we'll be somewhere between 22.2% and 22.4% by the time we close out the year. So, that's a significant improvement. Part of that is what we've been doing for the last two years around indirect cost focus and how do we become more efficient, how do we drive more benefits and productivity in the use of those particular dollars. And then also, we've had a little bit of benefit, although it's not huge, from consolidating our CDIY and IAR businesses into the new business called Tools & Storage. So those things together have really helped leverage that objective. And I do think we're at a point now where we can continue to drive that down further. As you know, we talked about \u2013 I specifically talked about it in Investor Day, that we think we can get this number down even further through functional transformation, as well as taking some of those savings that we achieved and reinvest in things of digital excellence, commercial excellence, breakthrough innovation, et cetera. But the net result is really to drive our operating margins to 16%, and a lot of that's going to come from what we're trying to do in SG&A along the way. Operator : Our next question comes from Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Your line is open. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: The Black & Decker brand has been fairly successful in your mid-price point overseas. But how is the Black & Decker brand being positioned domestically? John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, the Black & Decker brand domestically \u2013 I've got to bifurcate, Liam, but just from the perspective of Tools, it's overwhelmingly domestically a DIY brand, and it's performing really, really well. You'll find it in the home centers, but you'll also find it in big boxes like Target, like Walmart and places like that, where it's very, very well perceived. A large outlook for the Black & Decker brand, which I'm sure you're aware of, but I need to be careful to distinguish, it's in the home products, both in the U.S. and in Europe. The overwhelming majority of those products are licensed, as I'm sure you know, and we obviously receive a royalty for the use of that brand on products designed for use in the home and primarily in the kitchen secondarily. So, it's important to bifurcate. But in both cases, it's DIY non-professional, but premium quality for folks who are doing it not for a living, but folks who are serious about the product they purchase. Operator : Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yes. Good morning, everyone. Congratulations on a great quarter. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : I guess the question on engineered fasteners and then just the automotive business in particular. And I realize you're not talking about 2016 yet, but automotive is a business where maybe there is a little more forward visibility because of the platforms. And I'm just wondering about your content per vehicle and how you expect that to grow in 2016, if you can talk about that? John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, our strategy is always to grow our content for vehicle. And as you know, we're selling solutions. We're selling the equipment or the systems as well as the consumables that go with it. I am not going to get ahead of myself or ourselves or the business particularly as it relates to anything proprietary with our customers. But our strategy is always to increase the content per vehicle, and that in and of itself, is a great source of growth. And it's why we've been able to grow in some cases 2 times and 3 times the rate of light vehicle production. And what's playing to our strength there, and I know you understand our business very well, what's playing to our strength there is the lighter that the vehicles become, particularly aluminum, it plays to our strength when you can't well protect for obvious technical reasons, that advantages systems such as ours, so we're looking to grow that content, and that absolutely is the source of growth, all things being equal, above and beyond the growth of light vehicle production. Operator : And that does conclude the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Greg Waybright for closing remarks. Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations : Stephanie, thank you. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call, and obviously please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect. And, everyone, have a great day.",

Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin. Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations : Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Conference Call. On the call in addition to myself is John Lundgren, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, our President and COO and Don Allan our Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and the supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website as well as on our iPhone and iPad apps. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 p.m. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning John, Jim, and Don will review our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results and our 2016 outlook followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today and we direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in the most recent 1934 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. Today we're going to spend just a few minutes reviewing a solid operational fourth quarter that wrapped up a really strong year before we discuss this year's guidance, and then of course take your questions. First for the year, organic growth was up 6% with Tools & Storage leading the way, up 8%. Security was flat while Industrial delivered 2%. Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 14.2% which is a post-merger record for the company. EPS of $5.92 was a 10% improvement versus 2014. Jim's going to provide a lot more detail particularly on the margins and growth by segment when he gets into the segment reviews. Free cash flow came in at $871 million on strong working capital turns of 9.2 times. And in line with our previous commitments, we executed over $1 billion of share repurchase actions in 2015, wrapping up a really strong year in which we overcame numerous challenges not the least of which was foreign currency. Guidance for 2016 is being established with an EPS range of $6 to $6.20 a share or a midpoint EPS growth of approximately 3% versus 2015. Don's going to take you through this in more detail later in the call. Moving to the right on the chart for the quarter, revenue expanded 1% organically with total growth down 5% as the top line impact of foreign currency was negative 6% for the quarter. There was a fiscal calendar phenomenon in the fourth quarter that did have a modest negative impact on organic growth that Don's going to address more in detail when he walks through the quarter, but I think it's an important point. Operating margin rate for the quarter was 14.2% which was in 100 basis point improvement ahead of the fourth quarter 2014. Our margins increased due to continued sharp focus on price realization and some commodity deflation delivering operating leverage despite $50 million from foreign currency pressure in the quarter. EPS with $1.78 was up 30% versus fourth quarter 2014 as the solid operational performance combined with lower tax, share count, and some restructuring less than the prior quarter offset the foreign exchange. Turning to slide five and an overview of the sources of growth for the quarter. As previously mentioned, organic growth remained positive due to the continued strength of Tools & Storage, particularly in the U.S. and the European residential and nonresidential construction markets, and the Stanley Engineered Fastening automotive business, which offset pressure in the Industrial channel, lower emerging market volumes and customer specific volume declines within the Stanley Engineered Fastening electronics business. This growth was offset by foreign exchange headwinds of 6% in the quarter, resulting in total revenue down 5% as previously mentioned. Looking at it geographically, Europe led the way, up 3%, as share gains continued in the region and nearly every market contributed positive growth. The U.S. generated 1% organic growth while solid Construction POS performance has left customer inventories in good shape as we enter 2016. Emerging markets in the rest of the world began to show signs of macro pressure to the top line, contracting 2% and 3% respectively. There was, as always, significant variation among the countries, but China, Russia, and Venezuela showed the largest year-on-year declines. And quickly for the year, organic growth was 6%, 5% volume, 1% price. This growth was offset by 7% currency, netting down to a 1% decline in total revenue, as shown in the box on the left of the chart. We were pleased that geographically the organic growth was shared around the world, spread fairly evenly of course with the U.S. leading the way at plus 8%, Europe plus 4%, emerging markets plus 3%, and the rest of the world plus 3%. Let me turn it over to Jim to get into some more operating detail on our three segments. James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : Okay. Thanks, John. I'll start with Tools & Storage, which wrapped up a banner year with solid fourth quarter performance despite difficult comps, mixed end markets, and a relentless dollar strengthening. Tools benefited from strong execution momentum in all areas : new products, supply chain, and commercial excellence. As for markets, continued strength in U.S. Construction, DIY, and Consumer was a help. However, emerging market and overall Industrial conditions were more than challenging. European tool end markets continued to be flat to slightly positive, and continuing U.S. dollar strengthening, especially against Latin American currencies, presented familiar but increasingly large headwinds for both revenues and operating margin. Organic growth for the segment was 3% in the quarter, with all regions once again contributing. Europe led the way up 6% followed by North America and emerging markets contributing 3% and 1% respectively. Although revenues were down 3% due to a 6 point currency impact, operating margin was up 1% with a 60 basis point year-over-year improvement in the rate. Execution of price, productivity, and cost control initiatives, along with a little help from lower commodity prices, enabled us to more than offset the onslaught from currency pressure. And across the global product lines, Power Tools posted 5% organic growth with contributions from Professional Power Tools up 7%, Consumer Power Tools up 3%, and Accessories up 2%. Our Hand Tools & Storage business was down 2% as strength within Construction Tools and our Mac mobile distribution business was offset by significantly lower sales within the Industrial channels. Innovation continues to generate solid growth across the business with ongoing contributions from DC brushless power tools as well as new product rollouts such as the DEWALT 20-volt and DEWALT 40-volt Outdoor, Stanley FatMax power tools in Europe, and DEWALT Pneumatics. Within North America retail POS performance was again strong in the quarter, wrapping up a record year which saw positive POS in 50 of 52 weeks, growth across every SBU and as impressively across all major brands \u2013 Black & Decker, DEWALT, Stanley, and BOSTITCH. Importantly, retail inventories remain at healthy and appropriate levels consistent with prior year. And in addition, the team continues to drive out-performance in Mac Tools, which closed the quarter with growth in high single digits, delivering its sixth consecutive year and 24th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. And finally, we continued to enjoy robust growth in e-commerce, this time highlighted by success with our rebranded and very innovative Black & Decker consumer products. Europe continues to perform at multiples above the underlying market, posting 6% organic growth in the quarter for a full year total of 7%. This region has shown remarkably consistent share gains in a relatively flat market, delivering approximately 7% organic growth across much of the past three years. Importantly, the growth in Europe continues to be wide-spread across nearly all regions as consistent share gains validate the success of our innovation and commercial excellence initiatives. The emerging market team once again overcame significant market headwinds generating 1% organic growth in the quarter, with contributions from Argentina, Mexico, and Turkey more than offsetting continued pressures in Russia, China, Brazil, and other parts of South America. And meanwhile the timely global release of the Stanley power tools line for emerging markets continues to gain traction in the large and growing mid-price point segment helping to offset regional economic and geopolitical market turbulence. The fourth quarter caps off an exceptional year by our Tools & Storage team, 8% organic growth for the year against a 6% 2014 comp with an operating margin rate up 110 basis points, executing on all fronts, taking share, improving profitability in the face of a volatile backdrop. And at the same time, the team very methodically and successfully positioned the business for more growth ahead. In that regard, we see continued robust growth for Tools in 2016. Our innovation pipeline is stronger than any time since the merger, and our supply chain and commercial teams are operating at very high fitness levels with the SFS 2.0 firmly embedded in our operating culture. These are exciting times for Tools & Storage and we expect the performance level to continue to be very high as we go forward. Turning to Security, progress continued across our Security business with Europe advancing on all fronts and North America showing steady progress in its transformation efforts. Within Europe, the business was up 3% organically, the fifth consecutive quarter in positive territory. Commercial wins were widespread across most countries as we recognized benefits from investments in our regional sales organizations. Profitability continued to improve sequentially and versus prior year with a fourth quarter operating margin rate approaching 10%. Solid order intake and a healthy backlog both up double digits year-over-year combined with stable attrition rates within our targeted range leave us well positioned to continue forward momentum into 2016. While organic revenues were down within North America due principally to a large installation in last year's fourth quarter, the team posted sequential margin expansion due to improved field productivity within the commercial electronics security business as the benefits from the Stanley standard operational improvement initiative began to take hold. Strong orders, a healthy backlog and a growing RMR portfolio position this business well as we head into 2016. Emerging markets were again a modest drag on Security growth and profitability as weak market conditions in China continued. But overall for this segment, profitability was up 100 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially, a solid indicator that our transformation efforts are taking hold within the organization. Turning to Industrial. Industrial saw a 1% organic decline in the quarter as lower volumes in Engineered Fastenings, Electronics and Industrial businesses more than offset strong global automotive revenue and organic growth in our oil and gas business. Operating profit was up 5% with a 210 basis point improvement in the margin rate as productivity gains and cost controls were able to counteract lower volume. Engineered Fastening's 3% organic decline was attributable to weakening within the Industrial channel and lower sales volume in the electronics space as our largest consumer electronics customer unexpectedly reduced production levels on their recently launched smartphone. This more than offset another quarter in which our automotive revenues outpaced light vehicle production. The business was able to anticipate some of the Industrial market's softness and thus benefited from proactive cost actions taken within the quarter. Infrastructure delivered positive organic growth of 2% as oil and gas grew 17% organically, propelled by increased project activity in the North America onshore market more than offsetting declines in hydraulics, which continues to be impacted by depressed scrap steel prices. All in all, an impressive operational performance was registered by the Industrial teams, expanding profitability and margin rates in the face of a choppy and mostly inhospitable end market environment with the exception of auto production. In summary, for the total company, the fourth quarter represented a solid performance wrapping up a tremendous year which included organic growth of 6%, record operating margins, and record EPS. This performance highlights our team's agility, passion to perform, and ability to be proactive and responsive to market condition, balancing investments for growth and taking out costs when necessary, strengths that will serve us well as we head into 2016. As we consider the 2016 outlook, which Don will share with you in a few minutes, our ability to generate outsized organic growth albeit at a slower pace than in the preceding two years will be enabled by the investments we have made and are making in SFS 2.0, which is our transformational business operating system. In early 2015, we launched the next generation of SFS, creating a more powerful mechanism to enable sustained above-market organic growth and margin expansion with high asset efficiency. The expanded SFS 2.0 is transforming the company by focusing our activities in five key areas : digital excellence, breakthrough innovation, commercial excellence, functional transformation, and core SFS. I would encourage serious long-term investors to develop a deep understanding of SFS 2.0 in that this is not an investor relations marketing jargon but rather a carefully constructed and executed framework that enables our organization to extract maximum value out of our world class franchises. We do this through capital efficient organic growth and continuous margin expansion. You have already seen the manifestation of commercial excellence in the organic growth and margin expansion in Tools & Storage and other parts of the company. In 2016, you will see a growing impact from breakthrough innovation, digital, as well as the other elements of the initiative which is now in its second year and gaining momentum. I would also say that we are once again open for business when it comes to inorganic growth. We look forward to supplementing our organic growth with a disciplined approach to M&A that we have deployed during almost 100 hundred acquisitions over the past 15 years, a period of time when we more than quadrupled our revenues and market cap and outperformed the S&P 500's total shareholder return by five times. With that, I'll turn it over to Don Allan. Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Jim. Let's begin with our fourth quarter and full year free cash flow performance. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter totaled $697 million, up almost $50 million from the prior year, resulting in $871 million of free cash flow for the full year. This full-year result is approximately $50 million to $75 million lower than we anticipated going into the quarter and is the result of lower than expected fourth quarter volumes in Tools & Storage and Engineered Fastening, which in turn, resulted in lower working capital liquidation. Nonetheless, working capital turns finished the year at 9.2 times, flat to the prior year, but at a level that many industrials would envy. Overall, our cash flow performance remains strong, a 96% conversion rate for the full year and our leveraged metrics are in line with our year-end expectations. One additional comment on free cash flow as it relates to the other line. As you can see, we experienced approximately $120 million variance versus the prior year in the fourth quarter. This variance was planned and is due primarily to discontinued operation activity in the fourth quarter of 2014 combined with the timing of certain derivative settlements and tax payments. So, let's turn to page 11. I would like to provide you with an updated outlook on our 2016 foreign exchange headwind. Certainly, it won't be news to anyone that the U.S. dollar has continued to appreciate against the vast majority of currencies around the world. This strong dollar has resulted in approximately a 50% increase against the Brazilian real since the beginning of 2015. Also, the British pound, and the Australian dollar are at levels we have not seen since the 2008 credit crisis, and the Canadian dollar has not been this weak versus the U.S. dollar for well over a decade. And last but certainly not least, the Argentinean peso, which essentially has been on a constant decline since the government's default back in 2001, accelerated its correction with a 30% cliff devaluation in December, resulting in another meaningful headwind for us in 2016. The effect of all these moves is that we are facing another significant foreign exchange headwind in 2016 which, at current spot rates, results in a year-over-year impact to operating margin between $170 million and $190 million. This impact is a combination of transactional and translational. However, approximately two-thirds of the 2016 headwind will be transactional, pressuring our margins, while approximately one-third will be translational. The transactional amount is substantially higher than prior year, as we feel the impact of the 2015 derivative hedges expiring in 2016, and this is approximately $60 million of our total currency headwinds. This 2016 currency impact is on top of over $300 million in currency headwinds we faced over the past two years, where our teams focused on significant operational actions which more than offset these pressures in 2014 and 2015. However, given the magnitude of these continued headwinds, we will not be able to completely offset currency in 2016 with price and cost actions. That being said, we will offset approximately 50% of this $170 million to $190 million headwind within 2016. And as we have previously discussed, over the long-term, we will continue to identify opportunities to localize production to help mitigate currency as well as improve the efficiency of our global supply chain. So, let's transition to our 2016 outlook on the next page. As John mentioned, we are guiding to an EPS range of $6 to $6.20 or a midpoint EPS growth of approximately 3%. Let's walk through some of the key drivers in our guide. First, we expect organic growth to approximate 3%, which will contribute $0.45 to $0.50 EPS for the year. As Jim discussed, SFS 2.0 will help fuel this growth in 2016 and beyond. We expect our Tools & Storage business to continue to take market share in most regions. Our innovation pipeline is robust and we believe this business can leverage that to grow in the low to mid-single digits in the face of challenging global macroeconomic environment. We expect progress to continue within the Security platform resulting in low single-digit growth, and we also expect Industrial to have low single-digit growth as the Engineered Fastening and Automotive business will continue to demonstrate strong growth, while the remainder of the segment faces pressures across several end markets including oil and gas, scrap steel, general industrial, and electronic. One additional point related to organic growth before I move on to the next topic. It's worth noting that when normalizing for a 53-week activity, which was included in the 2014's fourth quarter, which is a fiscal calendar phenomena that occurs every seven years. If you adjust for that, the total company's organic growth would have actually been 1.5 to 2 points higher or approximately 3% in the fourth quarter of 2015. This is notable when you consider the fact of 1% organic growth and us guiding to 3% organic growth in 2016. We believe, this, along with the strength of certain markets we operate in, namely U.S. construction, along with global automotive production, combined with our focus in SFS 2.0 gives us confidence in our ability to achieve 3% organic growth outlook for 2016. Continuing to the next EPS driver, you will see another $0.45 to $0.50 of earnings improvement from additional cost and productivity initiatives. We have a solid amount of carryover commodity deflation materializing in 2016 and the business teams have worked hard to identify additional cost reduction opportunities which on top of our normal productivity gains will result in a solid contribution to the bottom line. Also, we see an additional increase to EPS of approximately $0.13 from a lower share base due to the carryover benefit of our 2015 share actions as well as opportunistic buybacks particularly if we continue to see depressed share prices. Working against all of these strong operational actions will be the previously-mentioned foreign exchange headwind which results in approximately $0.85 to $0.95 of EPS pressure year-over-year. Because of the severity of this transactional currency headwind and its impact on margins, we expect the company-wide operating margin in 2016 to be relatively flat year-over-year. To put this in perspective, we estimate that the FX headwinds net of benefits we are receiving from lower commodity costs as well as pricing activities will cause us to lose 60 basis points to 75 basis points of margin rate improvement in 2016. Our three-year financial vision presented at the May 2015 Investor Meeting contemplated a 50 basis points to 75 basis points of margin improvement each year, which assumes a stable foreign exchange environment. So, we believe we're continuing to perform in line with that objective, albeit with our improvements offsetting FX rather than resulting in OM rate expansion that we like to see. A few other items to mention related to guidance are : we expect our restructuring charges and tax rate to be relatively flat to the prior year, and then finally, as we look to the first quarter, we expect our first quarter EPS percentage of the full year EPS to be approximately 18.5%, which is very close to the prior two years' average. Moving to the segment outlook on the right side of the page, I've already touched on most of the drivers behind our organic growth so I'll spend a minute on margin rate expectations. We expect Tools & Storage margin to be relatively flat year-over-year and that is primarily the result of the FX dynamic I described earlier netting against the really impressive operating leverage this business continues to achieve. We expect Security margins to continue to improve modestly versus prior year reflecting benefits from further progress in field productivity, our commercial investments, and the realignment of the cost structure of the business to help drive profitable future growth; another good step forward, as anticipated. Industrial margins are expected to be relatively flat, as productivity gains in cost takeouts particularly within the Engineered Fastening business are expected to offset top line pressure I previously discussed related to key portions of this segment. Before moving on to the summary of this morning's call, I would like to discuss the potential for a recessionary environment and make a few comments on what actions we would take if, and I emphasize if, we are faced with deteriorating economic conditions. At this stage, we believe a U.S. recession is low probability in 2016. However, we have established contingency plans to ensure we are adequately prepared. If we were faced with this type of an environment consistent with our behavior in past similar circumstances, we would execute mitigation plans and they would take the form of head count reductions, investment delays, and further discretionary spending reductions. Specifically, if the environment resulted in us experiencing a flat organic revenue performance versus our current view of 3% growth, we would take cost actions to hold EPS relatively close to our guidance range. Clearly, if a more severe environment were to occur, which appears unlikely at this stage, we would focus on protecting our earnings base as much as possible, similar to the approach we took in 2009. Now, moving on to the summary page. We are very pleased with the business' performance in 2015. We witnessed strong operational execution to overcome a host of external challenges including $220 million of foreign exchange headwinds, which delivered ultimately organic growth of 6% at the top end of our targeted range; a record operating margin rate of 14.2%, which was up 90 basis points versus the prior year; and of course, double-digit EPS growth. We are also encouraged with the progress in our Security business, particularly Security Europe, which really made meaningful improvements on all fronts. As we look to 2016, we are focused on positioning the company to manage through another year of turbulent markets and severe foreign exchange headwinds. As such, we remain committed to our core objectives : maintaining our focus on organic growth through both continued innovation and commercial excellence; ensuring progress within the Security segment to maintain the momentum we saw in 2015; of course, executing on additional cost and pricing actions to help partially offset our FX headwinds; and also being prepared to take further actions as conditions warrant; as always, maintaining our perpetual focus on working capital management and improving that as we move forward; and importantly, leveraging the pillars of SFS 2.0; and to continue driving momentum in 2016 and beyond. That concludes the presentation portion of the call. Now, we move to Q&A. Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations : Don, thanks. Stephanie, we can now open the call to Q&A please. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just one question in line with the rules. Obviously, the Tools & Storage performance in 2015 was exceptional. A big part of that was SFS 2.0 and the innovation pipeline. I'm just wondering how does the NPI look for 2016? And maybe just comment on the share gains in Europe; any categories to call out there? James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : Sure. It's Jim. The innovation pipeline for Tools & Storage is as robust as it has been at any time since the merger. And what we've been focusing on, if you rewind to 2010 when we put the companies together, there was a lithium-ion problem, they were losing share, we inherited that. Fortunately, they had done a fair amount of corrective action that began to manifest itself shortly after the merger and we started regaining share. And then we, after a year or two of that, really came out strong with the DC brushless, a complete redesign of the DC brushless products. And that became the fastest-growing segment of cordless, and we were growing at about 2x and still are growing at a very rapid rate vis-\u00e0-vis competition. And then at the same time, there was a lot of, call it, incremental innovation going on in Hand Tools & Storage in revitalization of the Black & Decker brand and product lines, the Consumer Products and accessories as well. So there's been a lot of, I'd call it, broad-based but relatively small-scale innovation in addition to the lithium-ion gains and then the DC brushless gains. So that's all really what's driven the NPI, that's driven some of the growth here in addition to the commercial excellence that you referred to. Now, what's coming is something more on the order of breakthrough innovation, which is the real SFS 2.0. And without getting into the details of exactly what it is, I think if you stay tuned during 2016, you will start to see some pretty interesting innovation that would be more in the category of breakthrough. And in addition to that, we will continue on with the incremental type innovation and the DC brushless and the continuing progress in lithium-ion. So, it really is a step function increase in innovation that is occurring in the Tools business, and you'll start to see the manifestation of that I think in the second half of the year. As far as Europe, there's a number of things going on in Europe relative to the Black & Decker products, the Consumer business, the brushless, which is a big deal over there, and a number of other things. But I'd say Europe is a combination to the NPI plus just the tremendous thrust into commercial excellence, which, as we've described it or as we describe it, involves a multi-pronged attack into the seven pillars, if you will, of customer-facing processes, which include gaining customer insights, driving innovation, driving brand awareness, being excellent at pricing and promotion, deploying the sales force properly, doing channel and partner programs that are very aggressive and successful, and then finally providing outstanding customer sales and post-sales support. And it's a focus on all those various processes. When you put them all together, that's what's really driving the growth in Europe. And I'd say on top of that, you have what I'd call second order revenue synergies from the Black & Decker merger that are even today manifesting themselves in further growth, customer white space, distribution channel white space, those types of things, brand white space are all helping drive the European growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Your line is open. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Hey, in terms of Tools & Storage, the outlook for U.S. construction still positive. Maybe there and just for the broader company that we're getting this offset now from Industrial, can you sort of frame and provide a little more color on the magnitude of the drop-off you saw there in 4Q and what are your expectations for the drag from Industrial in 2016? John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Shannon, this is John. Industrial markets are slowing down. That's the bad news. The good news is, it represents about 20% of our total business, 25% I guess with Industrial Hand Tools within Tools & Storage. But if I can kind of address, I'll say, the elephant in the room, you're very polite or diplomatic about it, but I think I can answer your question quite helpfully. We strive to grow at two times the rate of the market in our Tools & Storage business over the long term. And we've met or exceeded that objective over the past two years, as Jim just described, as the SFS 2.0 growth initiative started to gain traction. And this being said, I don't think it's realistic to plan such outsized growth each and every quarter from any global diversified industrial. So in the fourth quarter, organic growth was lower than we planned, but the shortfall was in areas you'd expect, and a lot of information from Jim and Don, but to try to summarize it, we did have lower industrial channel volumes in Tools & Storage and Stanley Engineered Fastening. That was a full point of organic growth relative to our expectations, and that's globally across the company. Another full point was lower customer-specific volumes and it's been well in the public domain from a large Consumer electronics customer for our Stanley Engineered Fastening business again within the Industrial segment. But that contributed almost a full point of slower organic growth than our expectations. Something that's not directly related to Industrial channels, emerging markets' softness, if you will, contributed about a point. So, relative to the 1% reported, that's about 300 more basis points. And then lastly, Don talked about the fiscal calendar phenomenon, which was another 100 basis points to 200 basis points. So, looking at it all that way, I think it's fairly straightforward. Without question, the biggest headwind being industrial markets in general and those markets in the U.S., in particular, because they've been so strong. Conversely, as Jim just talked about, Tools & Storage in the U.S., up mid- single digits; Europe, up 6%. But that's driven by construction in retail, even e-commerce, which was way up. Automotive is still strong. We grew 6% in the fourth quarter, which is well above the rate of light vehicle production. And Security Europe, our investments are paying off. It was up 3%. So, I think your question is spot on. Our biggest headwind on organic growth, obviously, that has nothing to do with FX, are the industrial markets. They represent 20% to 30% of our business. And if they're flat, we think \u2013 the markets are flat, we think that's probably as well as they're going to do. And I think you can do the math from there. So, I hope that helps. Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And if I could just offer a little additional insight on the Industrial. It's an interesting situation, because you have very much a sector-specific series of issues with agriculture, mining, and oil and gas or energy. So there's a capital \u2013 a CapEx kind of contraction going on in those industries. And it's sort of spilled over to affect the overall MRO market as well. And then you have industrial markets such as automotive that are more driven by Consumer demand, and those are relatively healthy. So, within Industrial, you have a dichotomy of markets that are flat out on their back, and then you have other healthy markets. And fortunately for us, a good portion of our Industrial exposure happens to be in the automotive. And if that holds up, that will be a very good thing. And we'll just see what \u2013 how long it takes for this ag, mining, and energy, those segments to kind of play out and trough out. And then, at that point, I think we'll be back in good stead with Industrial. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Dahl with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Matt A. Bouley - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. This is Matt, on for Mike. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to ask on the Engineered Fastening business. Wanted to get your thoughts on the customer challenges you mentioned just on the electronics side, specifically. So, how you may be addressing that, how you think that dynamic plays out in 2016, and how that is embedded in your organic guidance. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Don will give you exactly how it's embedded in organic guidance, because it's pretty much arithmetic. But as you would expect, it's a large customer. We don't \u2013 we just have a policy not to mention customers names on our call. But I think it's quite clear who it is, and that's their choosing, not ours. That being said, strategically, it's to diversify our customer base just as we've done over the years in global Tools & Storage, where there was a point in time where the two largest North American big box retailers represented 40% of our business. Today, they're huge customers but they represent about half that amount. The same thing with Engineered Fastening, and then will turn it over to Don. Less than three years ago, OEM automotive was more than 70% of the business. So, it was a conscious decision to diversify the verticals we serve, particularly with a focus on electronics, to a lesser extent, aerospace. And we've done that and it's been pretty successful. So, we've had tremendous growth and then a step back relative to one customer's end market product sales being down. Simply said, within Consumer electronics, we need to diversify our customer base. We think we have as good a product offering as anyone to accomplish that. Of course, it doesn't happen overnight. And then continue the strategic push, as Jim and the business leaders talked about in May, to serve more verticals. But Don can talk to you about the specifics of the one issue in Consumer electronics as it relates to our guide. Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So, our electronics business within Engineered Fastening, as John mentioned, was down substantially in the fourth quarter. They had about an impact of a full point across the entire company, which equates to about $25 million of revenue. And that was a percentage decline versus prior year of close to 30%, 40% with that particular piece of the Engineered Fastening business. We expect that type of pressure to continue into 2016, and we formulated that into our guidance. And that's clearly one of the pressure points that we are anticipating and it's a headwind against the organic growth of 3%. And so, it's one the reasons why the organic growth is at that number versus maybe original expectation, closer to 4% Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open. Timothy R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess my question is just on construction. Curious what you're seeing in the market and kind of what you're embedding around non-res and residential construction in 2016. James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : I'll take that one. So, we obviously have a view that's positive related to construction overall and we think that is an appropriate perspective for 2016 at this stage. And when you look at point of sale information from some of our major customers, we're seeing rates that \u2013 we ended the year with very strong growth rates and what we're seeing and expect that to continue here in 2016. As far as the break between resi and non-res, I think the non-res market continues to show a little bit of life. We watch that closely in a portion of our Security business, in particular, our mechanical lock business is a good indicator of that. That business is demonstrating kind of mid- to high single-digit organic growth over the last year. We expect that type of trend to continue. So, we're not looking for a dramatic increase in that space, but it's a relatively small part of our company, roughly $250 million, 300 million of revenue annualized but it's a good indicator of the non-resi market. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Hey, I want to come back to currency more from a strategic standpoint if you can kind of address kind of the question. Looking at what's going on, obviously, there could be a debate on whether this is now just a cyclical phenomenon or a secular phenomenon. And I just wonder where you stand on that. And really the essence of my question is if you believe it's more secular, what does the investment look like to further reposition the footprint of the company geographically to respond to that on a longer-term basis? John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I'll start, Jeff. You used the caveat, if you believe it's secular, and I'm not sure we do. We could have a long debate about it. But even if it \u2013 we're going to do the same thing irrespective of cyclical. On cyclical, Jim, Don and I have been doing this a long time. You want to talk about the euro; everybody worries about it being on parity. I've done business when it was at $0.85 and we've seen it approach $1.50. That's fairly cyclical. Irrespective whether it's cyclical or secular, what we can do the most, I think two things. We're not going to double down where the risks are high, but we're also not going to walk away from our investments. We're going to stay positioned particularly in emerging markets and 50% of our revenue is outside the U.S. in those markets which will continue to grow albeit slower from a lower base to be in a position to leverage our share and leverage our volume when and if it turns around. But the biggest thing affecting us and I think Don touched on it, we always talk about both translational and transactional. And as the transactional aspect grows to more than 50% of our foreign exchange headwind, what we're working very hard to do is move production and sourcing locally. We have a goal to produce 50% or more of what we do in countries where we sell it. And if you take that to the next step, obviously, everyone knows you can't build a plant overnight nor would you want to nor would you want to put bricks and mortar down if you believe it's secular. But what we can do is a much better job and we're working hard at it, qualifying local both raw materials and more important critical component suppliers. And if you're working in an emerging market, as I think you're aware, many of our components that are critical to quality are either U.S.-based or U.S.-produced or dollar-denominated. To the extent we can qualify local suppliers, protect our IP but produce those critical components locally to be processed locally, that's going to be a tremendous offset or hedge. Don may want to add something to that. Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. I think that particular point, what John said is exactly correct. However, the reality is that at this stage in certain parts of the world, Canada and Brazil being the best example, there's not a great deal of suppliers that are available that we can do that with. So, that's something that we have to think about, is there an Asian company that we're currently working with that would \u2013 they could create a plant within Brazil and allow us to have a supplier locally, that is transacting locally. Those are all things that take time. These are not necessarily things that happen overnight. In the meantime, we're doing things as much as we can that make economic sense over the short-term and the long-term. But I think we do view this as very much a cyclical shift, and if that view changes over time, then obviously, our view of where we manufacture will have to shift as well. Because if you look at the history of Stanley and of course the history of Black & Decker separately, they're both known for pursuing the lowest cost possible and also maintaining the highest quality. And that's not going to change. So as dynamics shift in the markets around the world and costs shift with it, we have to be flexible and agile and make sure that we're doing the right thing from a supply chain perspective. Operator : Our next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Two quick questions; one, John, what are your thoughts about asset prices now for potential acquisitions in terms of what you're seeing out there given some of the broader weakness in the global economies? And then second question, on Industrial margin, I think calling for relatively flat, Don, does that assume \u2013 how much of a decline does that assume in electronics? It sounds like you're assuming a pretty steep decline year-over-year within the guide. But I just want to get the puts and takes and the risks to upside or downside to the Industrial outlook for margin. Thanks. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'll take the asset price. They're becoming more reasonable just as is Stanley Black & Decker. As I think Jim could not have been more clear in his pitch, Rich, that we are open for business in terms of growing this company by a thoughtful strategic acquisition that meets both our strategic goals and our financial hurdles as well as fits within our organizational capacity. And I'll simply say, as multiples come down, I think, and valuations come down, there's more out there that could be attractive to us both domestically and outside the U.S. I don't think \u2013 there's so many bargains out there as we speak that we need to rush to buy something because it's never going to be at a lower price. But our view is always to buy good companies at a fair price. We've had a hard time meeting or exceeding valuation expectations in the last six months, but we see that \u2013 we see it, I think, as you might expect coming more into line, which is that and the fact that we think we have our Security business on the right track, which is why Jim made the point in his piece of the presentation. We are open for business, looking at assets in the three strategic areas that we've previously identified. Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And, Rich, on the Industrial question related to margins, certainly the impact from the electronics business within Engineered Fastening is pressuring margins as we expect significant top line pressure there. We also, within that business, within Engineered Fastening, we have a kind of a general industrial sector that's about at $0.5 billion in revenue on an annualized basis that has been feeling pressure as well similar to the Industrial Tool business within Tools & Storage. For example, in the fourth quarter, that business was down approximately 10%. And we expect that to continue at least into the first half. So those two things are definitely putting pressure on the top line and the margins. Now, offsetting that and going in the opposite direction is what Jim and both John had mentioned about the automotive production business within Engineered Fastening is offsetting that. We expect growth probably in the mid-single digits again within that business in 2016. And we also have cost actions and various other productivity actions we're taking across Engineered Fastening to make sure that the margins are flat and hopefully a little bit better than that as the year goes on. And then the two smaller pieces of Industrial, which is the oil and gas business and the hydraulic tool business, the combination that we call Infrastructure, we expect those to be relatively flat on the top line, maybe down slightly, and then margins flat as well as those markets are pretty slow at this stage. But we think we've gotten through the difficult comps as we go into 2016. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Your line is open. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hi, guys. Good morning. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what's assumed for price in the outlook? And specifically, perhaps if you could unpack some of the moving pieces say price to offset currency, price to get paid for all the innovation versus maybe having to share some of the commodity deflation with the bigger customers. Thanks. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Fair question. Fairly complex to say the least. Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. I'm not sure I can give all that level of granularity for a variety of reasons, but I will give you a little bit of color on this area. We do expect a modest positive in price in 2016, and there's really a makeup within that number. We do see more positive price in emerging market actions. So as we deal with this currency pressure, in particular in Brazil and some of the other Latin countries, but then also in Canada as well, which is obviously not an emerging market, we expect some price increase there. So those are positives. Some of the negatives, we will see a little bit of price pressure in different parts of the mature markets, because we have dealt with some significant commodity deflation; that's been a benefit to us. We don't expect that to be significant, but those are very kind of surgical strategic decisions that our Tools & Storage team is very savvy at managing and working through as part of the overall offering to our customers. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I guess I'll just add to that. I think it is important because the very end of your question was more than fair in terms of getting paid for the innovation. We have a history of, if you will, protecting price or being paid by innovation just for that reason. Specifically, to bring the same product or a minor modest incremental improvement to a customer, even in a flat commodity situation and expect the price increases unrealistic to say the least. Real prices have been declining 2% to 3% a year or 1% to 2% a year for the last 10 years, real prices. So the way to protect price, I think it's probably more important in understanding why Don has confidence that overall we'll see some modest price, is to bring in some cases meaningful incremental but meaningful and in other cases, to Jim's point, breakthrough innovation to the customers. If no one else has it, you can charge whatever \u2013 you can value price and charge what you believe is appropriate for it. So it's far easier to bring a product improvement at a 5% or 6% higher price point, that way you cover your inflation, your labor inflation, or anything else that there happens to be there, the incremental cost of that improvement and you and the customer both win. Because the customer can take his retail price up, you can take your wholesale price up, and thereby protecting margins, and everybody wins and it's a fair trade. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Kim with Barclays. Your line is open. John Coyle - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, guys. It's John Coyle filling in for Steve. Can you maybe talk about the pace of activity over the course of the quarter? Did you see a deceleration as we got later into the year? And then maybe any thoughts on what you see now thus far in January? Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, this is Don. I would say that we didn't see anything that was really indicative of significant market trends. When it comes to our retail business in Tools & Storage, there's a lot of ebbs and flows in the quarter that are really dependent on when customers want products, refilling orders after the holiday season. So from a general market trend, we didn't see anything dramatic within the kind of consumer side of Tools & Storage. On the Industrial side, it was pretty much a consistent trend throughout the quarter, other than electronics. Obviously, electronics shifted to the negative dramatically in the month of November, and that held into December and is holding into the first quarter. So we're not necessarily taking anything as far as market trends in the fourth quarter as a big indicator to the first quarter and beyond, beyond some of the things that we've already discussed such as electronics and general industrial. But you know, I think the only thing that really shifted within the quarter would have been the electronics business with Engineered Fastening. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah and the other thing I'll add to that that I think most of us are aware of, as it relates to our retail customers and the retail business in general, one of the reasons Don said that between 18% and 19% of our earnings take place in the first quarter. January is always a very slow month. As I know you understand, and most people on the call do, our largest customers' fiscal years end in January. It's post-holiday season. They have a very appropriate objective of reducing or minimizing inventories as the year closes. So simply said, whatever happens in January, we don't ever think of it as a good predictor or indicator of how the year is going to start. We need pretty much a full first quarter, particularly on the retail side for that reason to get a flavor for where we are and where we're going. Importantly, Jim pointed out, I think, most important. POS was good in the fourth quarter, so inventories are in a good place. So nothing to suggest dire straits, but it's very early days. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Wood with Macquarie Securities Group. Your line is open. Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Can you talk about the progress you made in North America Security margins related to the vertical markets' learning curve? And where are you maybe just give us an update on the evaluation of the overall Security portfolio within Stanley? Thanks. James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : Okay. I'll answer the second question first, and nothing's changed since we communicated in May of last year at our investor meeting that we would be doing an evaluation that would take about a year. And that we would during that period of time we were going to evaluate the operational performance as well as the strategic issues and opportunities related to the Security business and then we would come out with some sort of a position in the middle of 2016. And that continues to hold. As far as the North American Security business, I mean, I think we're finding that in the verticals, the healthcare vertical is doing absolutely fabulously. It's achieved mid-double digit margins, mid-teens. And the issue with that now is how to grow it faster. So we'll be making some investments to grow it faster, and it could be a substantial contributor to organic growth. The retail vertical I think is still kind of in the early days in terms of trying to figure out exactly where the value proposition could be and how big we can make that, how profitable it can be. And so I'd say we're probably in about the third or fourth inning with the retail. But I would expect by mid to late 2016, we would make a lot of progress on that front as well. I think the other verticals \u2013 and those are the two verticals that we're going to be emphasizing this year, and really get them right, get the healthcare one growing, get the retail strategy fully engaged. And then at that point, we'll decide do we want to add another vertical to our main area of focus. Operator : Our final question comes from Jeremie Capron with CLSA. Your line is open. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks. Good morning. And congrats on a very solid year. I wanted to ask you, Don, about the free cash flow. I mean, it's coming somewhat below initial expectations a year ago. And I wanted to understand what exactly drove the shortfall here. I suspect that forex trends were a significant contributing factor here, and so I'm wondering if we should expect even more of a headwind on cash flow in 2016 given the transactional effects that you called out earlier. Thanks. Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. Yeah, I mean, as I mentioned in my comments, the free cash flow for 2015 came in a little bit lighter than we anticipated. And it was primarily due to less working capital liquidation as a result of the lower organic growth that we saw in the fourth quarter. And it's interesting, the timing of how it played out is usually what happens in our Tools & Storage business in particular is that we have high levels of revenue in October and November preparing for the holiday season as well as doing kind of refill orders after Black Friday. And then we collect a lot of that by the end of December. Because we saw a different trend occur in that particular business and obviously a lower organic growth number than our expectation, the result was that we didn't get the working capital turn that we were anticipating. We were anticipating turns of 9.5 times to 9.7 times. It came in at 9.2 times which are actually fantastic. And at this stage, working capital turn improvement becomes harder and harder. The other dynamic is as we grow organically and you saw the significant organic growth we had in 2015, you have to improve your working capital turns even more to get a cash flow benefit. So even with if we had achieved an improvement to 9.5 times to 9.7 times, we still would have had a slight negative within our cash flow statement for working capital. We would have had to get it much closer to 10 times to see a positive. And that's just the reality of what we're going to deal with going forward that we won't see large working capital benefits in the cash flow statement, and we want to continue to improve working capital and get it over 10 turns over the next few years. And hopefully when we \u2013 as we do that, the amount of impact to cash flow will be modest. It likely will be modestly negative. As a result, our cash flow on a go forward basis will still be very strong. As I said for 2016, I expect the conversion rate to be about 100% which would mean it's going to be somewhere between $900 million to $925 million for 2016. We always look to improve our working capital more than beyond our goals and expectations, so obviously we'll be driving to try to outperform that. But right now based on where we are with our working capital turns, we can't expect large cash flow benefits from that area and really the cash flow is going to come from the earnings performance and operational performance. Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations : Stephanie? Operator : That concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Greg Waybright for closing remarks. Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations : Great. Thanks, Stephanie. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call and obviously please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Kylie and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin. Greg Waybright : Great, thank you, Kylie, and good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker\u2019s first quarter 2016 conference call. On the call in addition to myself is John Lundgren, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, our President and COO, and Don Allan, our Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website, as well as on our iPhone and iPad apps. And a replay of this morning\u2019s call will also be available beginning at 2 p.m. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning John, Jim, and Don will review our first quarter 2016 results and various other matters followed by Q&A session. And consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It\u2019s therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. With that I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren. John Lundgren : Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us, and for those of you who have had a chance to look at our earnings release, it should point out that we remain strongly focused on generating above-market organic growth, meaningful operating leverage, and strong free cash flow conversion. We\u2019ve really got a lot of really good news to report on the quarter, as well as some real excitement looking forward. So I\u2019m going to be very quick through some of the highlights, before turning it over to Jim and Don for more granularity and then of course we\u2019ll get on to the Q&A. Organically, we grew 5% total growth of 2%, the difference being currency. Really robust organic growth in Tools & Storage 8% with significant outperformance in the emerging markets which was nice to see that come back, 9%. Jim will give you a lot more detail on the strong global Tools & Storage performance in just a second. Industrial was down 3%, as we anticipated, and Security was up 1%, as the positive organic growth in Europe continues. It\u2019s a trend that we\u2019ve been very focused on and we\u2019re very pleased to see it carrying on the way it has. Operating margin rate of 13.1% was 20 basis points below last year, the overwhelming majority of that was the impact of $35 million of currency pressure. Security industrial operating margin rates were up 110 basis points and 120 basis points respectively, and Tools & Storage was down slightly in the face of the currency headwinds as most of you are aware the overwhelming majority of our FX does impacts our global Tools & Storage business. That led to diluted earnings per share up 20%, $1.28, up 20% versus prior year, solid operating performance combined with lower share count, lower restructuring costs, which more than offset the currency impact. So on the back of the first quarter performance \u2013 outperformancee, we\u2019re raising 2016 outlook for EPS to a range of $6.20 to $6.40, which is up 5% to 8% versus 2015, and up from our $6 to $6.20 range that we most recently provided. Concurrently, we\u2019re reiterating free cash flow conversion of approximately 100% of net income. Let\u2019s turn briefly to the sources of the growth, during the first quarter. Volume was up 4%, price was up 1%, leading to the 5% organic growth that I already touched on. Currency was a 3% offset, so a total revenue growth of 2%. This compares to 1% organic growth, and a 5% currency driven revenue decline in the fourth quarter 2015, so very, very strong sequential quarterly trend. Turning to the regions, you can see that all markets contributed. The U.S. was up 6%, Europe up 3%, total emerging market group was up 3%, which of course was led by global Tools & Storage, a very strong performance, and the rest of the world was up 1%. So all in all, a really solid first quarter growth performance with strength across virtually every business and in virtually every region, but let\u2019s let Jim get into some of the details on our three segments, there\u2019s a lot of really good news this morning. Jim Loree : Okay, thanks, John. I\u2019ll begin with our Tools & Storage business, which as John indicated started the year off with another strong showing, once again hitting an all cylinders and growing a robust 8% organically in the quarter against a 1Q 2015 comp of 10% growth. The Tools team continued to outperform the market globally as commercial excellence initiatives, supply chain efficiency and a laser focus on innovation and new product development translated into market share gains across product lines and around the world. This is being accomplished against a volatile macroeconomic backdrop, characterized by large and unpredictable swings in foreign currencies, geopolitical unrest and anemic global GDP growth. Total Tools revenue growth was 4%, after absorbing a 4% currency headwind. Currency also impacted operating margin more than offsetting volume leverage, price and modest commodity deflation resulting in a 40 basis point decline and the year-over-year operating margin rate. The consistency of organic growth across the regions and SBUs was particularly impressive with North America leading the way, up 10%, followed closely by very strong emerging markets at 9%, and Europe with a solid 5% growth performance. Regarding the global Tools & Storage SBUs, Power Tools posted 10% organic growth with its underlying product lines : professional, consumer, and accessories, each individually generating 10% growth. The Hand Tools & Storage business delivered a solid performance as well growing 5% organically with NPD and healthy end-markets, fueling 10% growth in construction hand tools. Automotive repair and industrial was a mixed bag with continued robust performance in Mac Tools, a flattish fathom, more than offsetting anticipated, but slightly better than expected negative pressure in North American industrial channels. Skew placement success stories were widespread with our new Porter-Cable cordless Nailer gaining listings in multiple outlets, gains with our mechanics Tools and Mac, high access ratchets and continued momentum within the DEWALT DC brushless and pneumatic products. Within North America, the retail channel posted double-digit gains as strong POS performance was driven by supportive construction and DIY markets, a mild winter, especially compared to 2015 and pervasive new product introductions as well as continued share gains from DC brushless and the made in USA initiative. Targeted conversion efforts and promotional wins led to high single-digit growth in the commercial channel, while a successful Mac tool fair helped to offset aforementioned pressure in the industrial channels, which remained down albeit with sequential improvement in the quarter. Turning to Europe, which was up 5% organically, the story continued with nearly all geographic markets again posting positive performances, share gains coupled with surgical pricing actions delivered above market growth as SFS 2.0 commercial excellence activities continued to take hold. The e-commerce channel was another highlight as innovations in our consumer products group and the implementation of a broader and deeper go-to market approach generated significant year-over-year gains. Last but not least the emerging market team put together an outstanding quarter under the circumstances, posting a 9% organic gain. This progress derived from a combination of innovation and new product launches as part of our mid price point or MPP initiative, coupled with aggressive price recovery actions taken early in the year to combat currency declines where appropriate. Latin America served up a stellar performance in the quarter, achieving mid-teens growth on the back of extensive commercial excellence initiatives in Mexico, Peru, and Argentina, which more than offset ongoing market headwinds in Brazil. High single-digit growth in Asia combined with the LatAm performance more than offset country specific pressures in the Middle East and Africa. All in all, the Tools & Storage business started the year vigorously and remains fixated on maintaining its strong growth momentum. The team is leveraging SFS 2.0 initiatives to continue driving tactical share gains and effecting a digital transformation across the enterprise, and at the same time, they\u2019re preparing for a major new power tool product rollout in the second half as the breakthrough innovation pillar of SFS 2.0 will soon come to life and begin to contribute to our commercial success, stay tuned. Now turning to Security, which continued to progress on multiple fronts in the first quarter. Security posted 1% organic growth, made significant progress on profitability, and improved year-over-year margins by 110 basis points. Within Europe, the business was up 3% organically for the second quarter in a row, achieving its 6th consecutive quarter in positive territory. Higher installation revenues and multiple geographies highlighted by gains in France, the Nordics and Central Europe were the primary growth drivers. Profitability continued to rise as volume leverage, productivity and cost actions all contributed to year-over-year margin rate increases. Solid order rates in the quarter and continued progress on the commercial front positioned us to maintain this momentum. North American Security also made good strides. Operational improvements from field productivity gains, under the Stanley standard field operations initiative, drove the year-over-year profitability increase. While organic revenue declined, it was attributable primarily to lower volumes in the automatic doors business, which has good visibility to rebounding sales in 2Q. The CSS business\u2019 top-line was flat year-over-year, and backlog remained in a healthy position going into 2Q. And overall, Security posted its highest operating profit rate since the first quarter of 2012, highlighting the growing success of turnaround initiatives through improved operating performance. Although work remains to be done, which translates to opportunity, we continue to be pleased with Security\u2019s trends and development. Moving on to industrial, results for the segment were in line with expectations as lower volumes in Engineered Fastening\u2019s industrial and electronics businesses combined with a tough comp in automotive system sales, led to an overall 3% organic sales decline for the quarter. Infrastructure was flat as oil and gas gains stemming from increased onshore pipeline activity, offset continued pressure within hydraulics. Overall, industrial segment profitability improved 120 basis points, as productivity and cost controls particularly within Engineered Fastening more than offset lower volumes. In this regard, the Engineered Fastening business performed well notwithstanding the anticipated top-line pressures. Automotive fastener sales growth remained healthy and outpaced light vehicle production. Productivity gains stemming from an intense focus on cost management and supply chain efficiency through core SFS led to the highest first quarter gross margin rate in five years. The infrastructure business continued to deliver mixed results with oil and gas posting double-digit organic growth while providing good visibility to onshore pipeline projects coming online over the balance of the year and into 2017. Hydraulics on the other hand continued to suffer volume declines due to a persistently difficult steel scrap market and in total both our first quarter results for the company and our ability to guide 2016 upward, was a demonstration of the company\u2019s underlying growth and earnings power. Robust organic growth in Tools & Storage, coupled with profitability improvements in Security and Industrial, leave us well positioned to achieve our upwardly revised 2016 outlook. And before turning it over to Don I want to remind everyone that we\u2019re also continuing to embed SFS 2.0 into the organization to enable sustained above market organic growth and margin expansion along with high asset efficiency. We\u2019re focusing our activities in 5 key areas : Commercial excellence, digital excellence, break through innovation, functional transformation, and core SFS. We have clearly seen the manifestation of commercial excellence in our organic growth and margin expansion and as I said on our January Earnings Call and during my earlier Tools & Storage comments, you will begin to see an exciting and growing impact from break through innovation as the year progresses. You may also see some inorganic activity in the near future, as we have capital to deploy and are actively developing an acquisition pipeline with emphasis on bolt-ons in the tools and industrial segments. These are truly exciting times for our company with outsized capital efficient growth, solid inorganic growth opportunities ahead, and an ever present focus on margin expansion all contributing to the mix. With that I\u2019ll now turn it over to Don Allan who will provide the financial update. Don Allan : Thank you, Jim, good morning. Let\u2019s begin with a look at our free cash flow for the first quarter which was an outflow of $158 million, an improvement of $85 million from the first quarter of 2015. The primary driver of the year over year improvement was a stronger working capital performance, specifically within inventory and accounts receivable. As our working capital turns were up four turns finishing the quarter at seven turns. Higher income in the current year quarter served to offset the majority of increased capital expenditures as well as some negative cash outflows in the other line. The other line items, which were primarily a reflection of timing of pension plan and miscellaneous accrual payments as compared to the prior year. As a reminder the outflow of cash in the first quarter is normal seasonality where our Tools & Storage inventory levels rise to ensure we\u2019re adequately prepared for the Q2 and Q3 demands of our key customers in the developed market. As John mentioned earlier and as you can see here in the take away we\u2019re reiterating our free cash flow guidance at a conversion rate of approximately 100% of net income. So let\u2019s turn to page 10 as I would like to provide you with an updated outlook on our 2016 foreign exchange headwind. By this point all of you are likely very familiar with our currency trends chart which over the last two years has consistently depicted worsening FX headwinds on the back of perpetually strengthening U.S. dollar. For also the first time in what seems like quite a while we actually saw a tempering of the dollar momentum over the quarter followed by an eventual retreat against some of our key foreign currencies. Most notably the Canadian Dollar, the Brazilian Real and the Euro. While on a full year basis we\u2019re still seeing significant currency headwinds weighing on our operating margin of approximately $140 million, this does represent a $40 million improvement from the midpoint of our initial 2016 guidance range, which was $170 million to $190 million. As we established that in late January time frame. As a reminder we assessed our currency headwinds on operating margin at the current spot rate. It\u2019s worth noting that the mix of this $140 million headwind is now comprised of approximately 75% transactional exposure, which pressures our margin rate, and 25% translational exposure, this is a shift from the two thirds one third split we discussed in January. And is driven by the $60 million of carryover currency exposures, which relate to our 2015 hedging activities. While we continue to execute on mitigating actions to offset the $140 million of headwinds it\u2019s important to note that we do anticipate some pressure on planned pricing actions particularly in countries where currencies have rebounded significantly. This will materialize as a slight headwind to organic growth specifically in the second half of 2016. Finally you will notice that on the lower right hand side of the page we have presented our sensitivities for several of our most significant foreign currency exposures. These will be useful guides for you going forward to determine how movements in the FX markets are impacting our 2016 operating margin so for example a 1% increase in the Canadian dollar results in a $2 million to $3 million improvement in the 2016 operating margin on an annual basis. Now let\u2019s turn to the next slide which is an update on our 2016 outlook and guidance. We are raising our 2016 EPS outlook to a range of $6.20 to $6.40 from the prior range of $6 to $6.20. This revised range represents an approximately 5% to 8% increase over 2015. We\u2019re also reiterating our free cash flow as I previously mentioned. The major changes behind the guidance increase are as follows. As you can see we\u2019re now expecting organic growth of 3% to 4%, versus the original estimate of approximately 3%. The primary drivers of the change are an increase in our Tools & Storage growth assumption to mid single digits on the back of a solid first quarter performance, strong POS data and signs of continued strength in resi and non-resi construction markets. However this strength is partially offset by revisions to industrials organic growth outlook, which we now see as relatively flat versus an assumption of up slightly in our initial guidance. This revision is due primarily to lower than anticipated volumes in Engineered Fastening\u2019s Electronics business. As volume expectations for the largest customer in that business continued to decline. Additionally we expect the timing shift around certain oil and gas pipeline projects from the second half of 2016 as they move into the first half of 2017. Finally as I mentioned earlier, there\u2019s also some pricing pressure relative to our initial estimates coming from certain foreign markets that have recently seen significant strengthening in their currencies versus the U.S. dollar. Accordingly we expect all these puts and takes around our organic growth assumptions to result still in a net increase to our EPS of approximately $0.05. The next item which we discussed in length on the previous slide is the approximately $40 million improvement in foreign exchange headwinds, which we expect to translate to an increase of EPS of approximately $0.20 for the full year. Then finally slightly higher than planned marketing costs related to the Tools & Storage product launch that Jim alluded to and discussed briefly a few minutes ago are expected to result in approximately $0.05 reduction to EPS, the majority of these costs will occur in the second half of 2016. These three assumptions changes result in a net increase of $0.20. Turning to the segment outlook to Tools & Storage and industrial segments organic growth outlook, change along the lines I just previously discussed. And Securities organic growth outlook remains low single digit. In terms of profitability, Tools & Storage is the only change from our January guidance, moving to modestly positive year over year, from relatively flat. And the driver of that is the reduction in the FX headwinds primarily. We continue to expect Security\u2019s margin to be modestly positive year over year as operational and field efficiency improvements continue to progress and in the industrials margin to be relatively flat with productivity gains and cost takeouts being able to offset the top line pressures we continue to see. The last point I\u2019d like to make is related to our EPS guidance expectations for the first half of 2016. As you can see we expect first half 2016 operating profits as a percentage of the full year to be slightly above the prior-year period. However, lower planned restructuring as well as lower other net expenses and shares will result in first half EPS being higher as a percentage of the full year than it was in the prior year, specifically first half 2016 EPS as a percentage of the full year will approximate 48% versus 44% in 2015. So let\u2019s move to the summary page. The first quarter was a strong start to the year, with organic growth up 5%, and EPS up 20%. As a result of this strong performance combined with the improved outlooks in the Tools & Storage business, and currency markets, we are raising 2016 guidance for full-year to a range of $6.20 to $6.40 which represents a 5% to 8% increase in the earnings per share versus 2015. As we\u2019ve continued to progress through 2016 our focus remains on the following, driving organic growth across all businesses, and sharing continuous improvement in our operational excellence initiatives, maintaining the momentum behind Security\u2019s margin improvements and as always pushing ourselves to manage our working capital in the most efficient and effective manner possible. That concludes the presentation portion of our call. Now let\u2019s move to Q&A. Greg Waybright : Thanks, Don. Kylie, we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thank you Operator : We\u2019ll now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from the line of Jeremie Capron with CLSA. Your line is open. Jeremie Capron : Thank you, and good morning, gentlemen. Clearly there\u2019s a lot of excitement around new product introductions, I think, Jim, you talked about breakthrough innovation, and we should stay tuned for that hitting in the second half. Can you maybe give us a little more color around that in terms of the scale of those new product launches, and maybe come back to what happened in Q1. Because I think you called out new products as a major reason for the strong performance in Tools & Storage, as well. Thanks. Jim Loree : Sure. This is Jim. The breakthrough innovation initiative is something that we started really started getting into in the early part of 2014, and the concept behind it is that we do a pretty good job in what we call core innovation, and we did this in both legacy Black & Decker and legacy Stanley, and those are the kind of things that are driving the, you know, the organic \u2013 big driver behind the organic growth today and some of the new product introductions that I alluded to in the core innovation area. But those are more things like, in the hand tools business for instance, we introduced a line of FatMax hammers and pry bars and knives and blades, innovative line in one of our large retailers and another large retailer we introduced DEWALT pry bars and pocket knives. And then in professional power tools, compact generation tools DC brushless, some really interesting innovations in the DEWALT Pneumatics line, a Mac impact wrench but you get the idea here. This is sort of the day-to-day innovation that just goes on as a matter of course, but I would say the level of activity in this area, and the freshness of the company\u2019s product lines has never been greater in our recollection. So that goes on, and that drives the kind of growth, the organic growth, along with the commercial excellence initiatives, that you\u2019ve been witnessing now here along with a little help from the U.S. DIY and construction markets. But you can see the growth all over the world. So in Europe which is relatively anemic in terms of its markets we still are growing an average of about 6% to 7% over 2, 2.5 year period. And so there\u2019s something going on there. And it\u2019s really a combination of the core innovation and the commercial excellence. So what is the breakthrough innovation? The breakthrough innovation is a concept where we actually took people out of the mainstream of the core innovation and set them aside, a small group of people, 10 or 15 people in that range, we just said come up with the next major breakthrough innovation for Power Tools. And we gave them a timeframe and we gave them resources, and support. And lo and behold, in a relatively short period of time, they came up with something very, very interesting. What is that? You\u2019ll have to wait and see what that is, but from a scale point of view, we say with the breakthrough innovation \u2013 and this is not the only breakthrough innovation team in the company by the way this was just the first one. We have three more in oil and gas. We have one in hydraulics we have \u2013 extending one up in engineered fastening but we tell them that whatever you come up with it has to have a scale of at least $100 million of revenue to be interesting to us. So I can\u2019t really get into how big this one could be because frankly we don\u2019t know but we know it\u2019s going to be at least $100 million over time and it could be far, far greater. So that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s kind of the background and what you have going on now is the commercialization of that. It will begin shortly and you will see it in stores in a relatively short order. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Ken Zener : Good morning, gentlemen. John Lundgren : Good morning. Don Allan : Good morning. Ken Zener : Given the strength you have in, hand tools picking up, could you \u2013 in a very strong organic growth that you\u2019re seeing in the U.S., could you kind of talk about how the landscape because since it looks like you\u2019re going to be well over $6 this year. Currency is helping but I mean that was a long-term goal when you did the Black & Decker acquisition. Can you talk about how much that landscape has changed on the Power Tools relative to I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s third-party competitors but your high margins that you have are obviously a very different business versus 5 years ago. It seems like you\u2019re just gobbling up market share certainly on a dollar basis if not unit basis. Could you just talk about how that\u2019s really structurally changed again given how strong we were this quarter? Jim Loree : Yes, it\u2019s Jim again. I think what\u2019s really going on here is that the Black & Decker and Stanley integration, the merger of the two companies and the successful integration, was a major home run. I think well beyond anybody\u2019s wildest expectations. I think the cost synergies were just the beginning and we \u2013 I think we signed up for $350 million six years ago and we cut off the analysis at about $550 million of cost synergies and there was a huge outperformance. But the thing we never really expected was the revenue synergies that we also beat what we expected to accomplish but they just keep on coming and it has to do with the fact that the cultures gelled so well and got so focused on innovation, commercial excellence, all the kinds of things that I was just talking about, and really put all the BS from the typical integration politics, et cetera behind them, and focused on the customer, focused on the markets. And then the scale that we achieved by putting those two companies together and going to market with Power Tools and Hand Tools, and going to market with all these incredibly strong brands that we have, just gave us tremendous flexibility and we just continued to benefit from that as time goes on. Don Allan : And I would say a current example of those revenue synergies we touch on here and there is what we\u2019ve been doing in emerging markets where we\u2019ve been rolling out the mid price point products in particularly Power Tools that have the Stanley brand on it. So that\u2019s a great example of continued generation of revenue synergies six years after the merger. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter. Specifically just had a question on the security margins as you highlighted a very good first quarter result, best since 2012. Just was curious if you could help out with kind of getting a little more granular in terms of the margin improvement there, off of the revenues down 1%, and perhaps just giving us a sense of perhaps the bigger components of that, also North America versus Europe and how you see that playing out over the next year or two, and perhaps also you can kind of revisit on a more broad basis just the future of the segment overall as you called it out in your Analyst Day as being, the strategic direction being under review, given the solid progress here, how does that affect that? So sorry, a couple of questions but all around the security progress. John Lundgren : Okay, Mike, this is John, I\u2019ll start. There was I think more than one question there but we\u2019ll try to do the best we can. Let me comment on two things. And then Don will give you a little bit more granularity. As it relates to our assessment of the segment, nothing\u2019s changed. We love this business, and the fact that it continues to grow and margins continue to improve we\u2019ve said on many occasions our single greatest self-help opportunity in terms of margin improvement and earnings growth is restoring security back to its historical levels. We continue that trend and that\u2019s why Jim, expressed the gratification, or encouragement, that that trend\u2019s continued for six consecutive quarters. As you know, margins in Europe in general are lower than the U.S. but the overwhelming majority of the improvement is coming from Europe, albeit from a low base. So we will not forecast margins by sub-segment because, A, it\u2019s very difficult. And B, there\u2019s not much in it for us if we get it right, and a lot of explaining to do if we don\u2019t. But in terms of the assessment of the category itself, we love the business. We review its status with our board every board meeting. That included yesterday and the day before. A year and a half ago, we said in the second half, some time during the second half of 2016, we would be very public in terms of what our plans were. We\u2019re sticking to that and we\u2019re not going to accelerate it. Beyond that, Don, if you want to add a little granularity, please feel free to do so. Don Allan : Sure. So, when you look at the first quarter performance, Jim mentioned that we are very pleased with the profitability of the segments. And really the improvement that we saw was in all three regions of the world, so the big regions really are North America and Europe where emerging markets is relatively small. And then both \u2013 those two large regions we saw really solid improvement year-over-year in the profitability as we continue to execute on the initiatives that we\u2019ve been really discussing almost for two years now of improving field productivity in the electronic security business, in particular in both Europe and in North America. And then in Europe specifically looking at our, SG&A, our selling and general and administrative costs to making sure they\u2019re in line with the revenue of the business as well as the percentage of revenue, we discussed it as a business that probably should be somewhere below 30% of revenue for SG&A and it\u2019s above 30% today so we continue to take actions in those areas to improve the profitability of both businesses, and we\u2019re seeing the benefits of that over the last two or three quarters in particular, as the profitability of the business year-over-year continues to improve. And at this point, based on our guidance for the year, we\u2019re expecting that trend to continue, as we expect modest improvement in profitability of the segment for the full year. Jim Loree : Mike, and just one other point on the business in general, Jim has talked about it on past calls, but it just shouldn\u2019t go unnoticed. There\u2019s been a lot of organizational changes, where we think \u2013 and we\u2019ve been talking about it for a while, but the majority of them have now been in place for about a year, where we think, to use Jim Collins\u2019 often-used term, we think not only we have the right people on the bus, we have them in the right seats on the bus. And it really matters. Everyone knows that, but the fact that we\u2019ve had a stable, capable, tested and proven team, in Europe and in the U.S. supplemented by a couple great new hires in the last six months or so, it\u2019s really, really helped, first of all, stabilize that business, and then ultimately keep both organic growth and margins moving in the direction we want it to. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Brett Linzey : Hi, good morning, this is Brett Linzey on for Jeff. Hey, just want to come back to free cash flow. You guys had a strong working capital quarter and I suspect some of that was inventory drawdown on the industrial side to a line with weaker demand there. But could you just talk about where you guys feel you are relative to that 100% conversion for the year? I mean seemingly there\u2019s a path higher. Is that the case? And is there anything in terms of inventory ahead of this product launch that we should be thinking about? Don Allan : Sure, this is Don. I\u2019ll take that. As I mentioned, we\u2019re very pleased with the start to the year related to working capital. Part of it was due to the fact that we did have a very strong month of March. And so our inventory levels were brought down in line with that performance which was great to see. And we also were very focused on making sure that we collected the cash throughout the quarter so our accounts receivable was down at the right level, as well. So with our company we\u2019re going to have a cash outflow, as I mentioned, in the first quarter every year, because of the way the Tools & Storage business seasonality impacts the company. But yet we really have to try to minimize that to achieve your objectives for the full year, and I think we\u2019ve done this. This is the best performance we\u2019ve had in Q1 in four years, related to Stanley Black & Decker and so as a result I feel very good about our ability to achieve 100% conversion rate, because we started the year in that regard. Now, your question to potentially additional inventory related to the product launch, yes, we will have some additional inventory. However, based on the current sales plans, as the year progresses, we would expect those inventory levels, vast majority of them, to be absorbed and shipped out to many of our major customers and so we don\u2019t expect that to be a challenge for us as the year ends. But it could be a little bit of additional inventory as we go through the second and the third quarter, which we would normally see anyways in our Tools & Storage business. So at this stage we feel good about our ability to hit our objective of 100%, and we\u2019ll continue to look at that to see how we could potentially outperform that as the year goes on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Rich Kwas : Hi, good morning, everyone. Jim Loree : Hi, Rich. Good morning Don Allan : Good morning. Rich Kwas : Good I\u2019m going to speak on a couple questions here. John and Jim, just wanted to get your thoughts on the mechanical business in North America so from a growth standpoint that continues to underperform key competitors out there and curious, John your reference to how you got the people in the right spots. Want to get your level of confidence around getting the growth rate up and going there considering the cycles turning in the favor in terms of non-res. And then quick second question Don in terms of the hedging strategies. Thanks for the sensitivity on the various currencies, but last year you went, you got opportunistic when you had a lot of volatility and just curious if we got volatility over the next few months on currencies? Would you take the same approach and just curious around risk as it relates to the updated guidance with currency and your comfort level with that? Thank you. John Lundgren : Yes, Rich, I\u2019ll take the mechanical piece. I guess in \u2013 excuse me \u2013 and three bytes, margins are good, growth is below what we had expected to be. To a large extent historically that\u2019s been a product issue where we have been behind our own expectations in some of the market. That being said, our sense is it\u2019s going to be offset by two things. One is the leadership in that business, we believe is quite capable. We have a tested and proven individual who actually came from the DEWALT professional industrial channel. Very, very good person to lead, guide the business and focus on growth as opposed to just margins and things of that nature. So we feel good about it in that perspective. And last but absolutely not least, recall we just really completed and embedded the change to third-party or independent distribution model versus the direct model. And Jim has talked about this often on past calls, years ago we thought that was a distinct competitive advantage, and it was for a time. We made the decision, and I think it was the right one, that what we gain \u2013 we lost more than we gained. As a result of that it was a two-year process to, if you will, simply convert our distribution model. That\u2019s behind us it\u2019s beginning to gain traction. So right leader in place, growth-focused executive, and the right distribution model in place, product catching up, gives us cautious optimism that we\u2019ll get that growth back in mechanical because it\u2019s a great opportunity for us. Jim Loree : And let me just supplement that by saying. So as John described the operational condition of the business is good and getting better and we\u2019re pleased with that. The question that we still have to answer is the one \u2013 is the strategic question, and, that we\u2019ll put on hold until we come out in the second half of the year with our Securities portfolio review. So that\u2019s, everything is fair game in security, including mechanical. Don Allan : Yes and then I\u2019ll touch on your question related to currencies. Clearly we always look at opportunities for hedging when we see shifts in currency and we will continue to do that and we\u2019ve done that again this year. Sensitivities give you an indication of if currencies move in certain directions for the remainder of the year, what the impact could be to our operating margin. And we have thought through it, is there a potential for the $140 million to move back towards $180 million? There\u2019s a scenario where that could play out if the Fed starts talking about potential interest rate increases that could actually result in strengthening of the U.S. dollar and a weakening of some of these currencies. However, we also feel like we\u2019ve built contingency plans to address that scenario if that plays out. So we have certain actions that we would take up to $180 million that we believe would be capable of offsetting that, which is why we felt comfortable making this increase to our guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Tim Wojs : Yes, hey, guys, nice job. Don Allan : Thank you Tim. Tim Wojs : I guess just on the Tools business, if we could go back to that for a second. So the full-year guidance is up mid single digits but you\u2019ve got 8% in the first quarter, and then as you go through the year, the comps get a little bit easier in the second half, and you have some new product rollouts. So can you just talk about some of the puts and takes and why maybe we should see decelerating growth in the Tools business this year? Don Allan : Well I think you might want to think about the first quarter performance and just we\u2019ve mentioned some things about certainly the weather was an additional boost to us in Q1, in particular in North America, as we actually had a mild winter here for the first time in \u2013 well a long time for those of us in the northeast. And we benefited a point or two in our Tools & Storage business from that. So if you kind of regulate the growth, saying that\u2019s not going to necessarily repeat itself for the next three quarters, then you\u2019re down to something that\u2019s closer to 6% to 6.5%, roughly. And then we had a fantastic performance in emerging markets in the first quarter, up 9%. We haven\u2019t seen that type of performance in almost 2.5 years. And so we were pleased with that, feel very good about it, but at this stage we\u2019re not necessarily ready to say that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to repeat itself in the next three quarters. We\u2019re clearly focused on trying to maximize that opportunity, but to be able to project that and say for sure that\u2019s going to happen at this stage would probably be a little bit overly optimistic. And those two factors in itself kind of gets you down to a mid single-digit number for the full year, for organic growth. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open. David MacGregor : Yes, congrats on a good quarter and all the progress. There\u2019s a lot of data there right now including Bureau of Labor Statistics data just showing a clear shift in the United States of labour from energy and mining into construction. I\u2019m just wondering if you feel this is having a meaningful impact on tool growth and talk about the extent to which you see that as a factor going forward. Jim Loree : Yes I\u2019ll take it, David. The interest, yes, to quantify it would be very difficult, because it is happening and one of the constraints that we would listen to, some of the homebuilders\u2019 calls as a good example was basically securing enough qualified, capable labor, because so much of it during the financial crisis shifted from construction into energy. As some of that variable labor pool, if I can call it that, shifts back, the answer is absolutely yes. The demand is there, but the qualified capable technically trained or properly trained workers aren\u2019t, it\u2019s going to be a governor on growth. So simply said, yes, it\u2019s having an impact. I think it\u2019s the early stages of that, but that\u2019s clearly helping the North American residential and we think ultimately commercial construction market. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kessler with Imperial Company. Your line is open. Jeff Kessler : Thank you. You\u2019ve been talking, after the limitation of SFS, you\u2019ve been talking, you mentioned it twice in the first, in your presentation. I\u2019m wondering, and you mentioned that the implication and the actual evidence of that is going to be shown somewhere this year perhaps some time in the second half. Could you be a little more specific as to how we\u2019re going to see SFS come out in the not so much in the numbers, but how it\u2019s going to come out in the operations that you\u2019re showing, which in turn affect the numbers. Don Allan : Sure, well I talked about the five elements of SFS. We\u2019ll start with the core SFS which is basically the continuation of the SFS that we started in 2006 that got us to 9.2 working capital turns last year and got us customer-facing metrics, we\u2019re very, very strong in relation to competition and make most of our customers very happy. So that core SFS is at the heart of all this and that\u2019s much more of an operations related initiative and it continues to become deeply rooted ten years into its existence. And now what we\u2019re doing with core SFS is we are taking it to another level, largely through digitizing the supply chain, as well as implementing the smart factory across the company. That\u2019s kind of in the early stages, but nonetheless, it is under way. So if we were at nine turns at the end of the year, and we typically generate about 4%, 3% to 4%, productivity, well our cost productivity a year in our factories, and we would expect that to continue on the basis of these investments that we\u2019re making in some of the things that I\u2019m talking about, as well as gradually push that working capital turns number up towards ten and maybe even someday north of ten. So that\u2019s the core SFS. Then there are three elements that are far more growth-oriented, those are the digital excellence, commercial excellence and breakthrough innovation. Talked about breakthrough innovation, I think at length and I think that\u2019s pretty clear. The commercial excellence is really taking some of the continuous improvement concepts that are very familiar to people in business and applying them to the customer-facing processes that drive growth. And so becoming world-class in some of these elements, like sales force effectiveness, like promotion planning, like pricing, pricing excellence, and so on and there\u2019s a number of these areas that when we apply continuous improvement principles to them in multiple facets, they just have an ability to generate tactical share gains, and also margin expansion. So that\u2019s the commercial excellence. And then the digital excellence is one we will also see some really interesting things in the marketplace this year in the second half. They probably won\u2019t be dramatic revenue drivers, but will clearly be \u2013 ways to kind of enhance the marketing prowess and depth of penetration in our company, and also just contemporize our value propositions, so that we are again leading the marketplace with technology on the digital front, as well as taking digital and permeating it into the organization for purposes of efficiency and effectiveness. So that\u2019s kind of \u2013 those are the various elements. The one I didn\u2019t mention is functional transformation and that\u2019s a very extensive initiative led by our Finance and IT leaders, who are actually taking a clean sheet of paper, after having done 100, almost 100 acquisitions in 12 years, taking a clean sheet of paper and redesigning our processes in Finance, IT, HR, Legal, et cetera, to make sure that they are as efficient as possible. We already believe that they\u2019re quite effective, but we also believe there\u2019s a couple points of G&A that could come out due to increased efficiency when you start with a clean sheet of paper. That\u2019s a long-term initiative. We are not going to see a lot of overnight successes there, but it\u2019s one where we\u2019re making some investments and then over the course of a couple years, we\u2019re really going to start to see that SG&A percent come down as a percent of sales and we\u2019re going to take some of the money that comes out of that and reinvest it in some other growth initiatives. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Mike Dahl : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Say, a question around some of the M&A opportunities that you mentioned at the \u2013 in the initial commentary, looking at the bolt-ons in Tools and Industrials. Just curious with all of the market volatility in recent months, what\u2019s your take on how seller expectations have shifted, if at all? What types of sellers are you hearing from? And again if that has changed over the past six months or so, and then just remind us again of kind of what specific areas you think you\u2019re looking to fill some gaps in within Tools. Thanks. John Lundgren : Yes, sure. This is John. We\u2019re not going to obviously talk specific targets. Never have, never will. And I know you understand and respect that. That being said, I think we\u2019ve been very transparent in terms of where we\u2019re going to grow, where we\u2019re going to acquire. We\u2019re going to continue to consolidate the global Tools & Storage industry, and we really, really like our position and our opportunity to grow our Engineered Fastening business. Having said that, I think importantly our pipeline is quite full and the reason being as you know we\u2019ve been on somewhat of a moratorium, self-imposed for the last 18-plus months. But it doesn\u2019t mean we stop looking at, assessing and in many cases keeping targets warm. So there\u2019s plenty out there in our previously identified areas of strategic focus. In terms of expectations, not a lot has changed. Remember, much of these \u2013 many of these are not public companies, number one, but, there are always multiple expectations. But in terms of what\u2019s out there and competition for target, double-edged sword, not too much has changed. Interest rates with obviously very, very low, which would help financial sponsors as they seek to acquire offset by the fact that most financial sponsors and most of the targets that we\u2019re looking at have limited, if any, synergies. So our opportunity to acquire in spaces where we have a great footprint already, arguably the synergies that we could generate would more than offset. I\u2019ll say lack of leverage given our desire insistent tense on maintaining strong tier investment grade rating. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Your line is open. Robert Barry : Hey, guys, good morning. Don Allan : Good morning. John Lundgren : Good morning. Robert Barry : Wanted to actually touch on our follow-up on the strength in emerging market Tools. I think in your comments you referenced some pricing actions related to recouping currency. I was curious, were those materially higher in 1Q? And do you expect them to benefit future periods as well? And if you could also just remind us what the emerging market margins are tracking at in Tools versus in the developed markets. Thanks. Don Allan : Yes. This is Don. I\u2019ll take your question. Yes, we certainly had a benefit from price in the first quarter, as we communicated early this year back in January. And then we have over the last couple of years as we see these types of movements, we take appropriate price actions where we can to offset that impact at least partially or in some cases close to 100%, and we did do that in the first quarter. And a significant portion of that organic growth we saw was related to price, which is also why, you know, we\u2019re not necessarily thinking this is a business that\u2019s going to grow 9% for the full year, because we are going to see some pricing pressure that I touched on in some of those key markets because of the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus some of those key currencies that just occurred over the last 6 weeks to 8 weeks. So because of that our view is I think prudent, and it\u2019s more reflective of a different pricing market because of the currency shift. You asked about profitability margins in emerging markets for Tools. That\u2019s slightly below line average at this point for our Tools & Storage business, but it\u2019s an area as we continue to ramp up some of the mid-price point initiatives and we continue to grow with the markets and outpace them, most likely 1.5 to 2.5 times GDP growth, that we expect with the leverage opportunity that it will get very close to line average. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Your line is open. Liam Burke : Yes. Thank you. Good morning. John, on the online strategy you have, especially in North America, are any brands doing particularly better or more geared towards online rather than your traditional distribution channels? John Lundgren : Yes, I think you almost answered the question, as you asked it. Brands do well online, and with the two different groups or via e-commerce. The Black & Decker brand for DIY users is extremely popular, both DIY Power Tools, outdoor products, et cetera, but a real driver is DEWALT. It\u2019s the brand the pros go to. It\u2019s available, it\u2019s available online, and we\u2019re very thoughtful in terms of the extent to which we promote it, make it available, push it, because prior to the Stanley Black & Decker merger, DEWALT actually, other than via a retailer\u2019s own online opportunity, DEWALT wasn\u2019t offered online. It is now. It\u2019s doing well. But think of our three power brands, Stanley, DEWALT, Black & Decker, their specific end-user groups and to each and every one, they\u2019re all doing encouragingly well. The biggest single dollar percentage, though, would be DEWALT. Jim Loree : It\u2019s Jim. I\u2019d also just add that very interestingly a couple years ago we did a complete refresh of the Black & Decker brand, and it had really gotten a little bit stale and it had lost a bit of its identity. And when we did the refresh, we tried to bring a millennial sort of focused element to it, and we added some lifestyle elements related to the millennial population, as well as the ECOSMART aspects, which is the sustainability of some of the products and packaging, and so on. And the Black & Decker brand has really made a lot of progress with the millennial population. It is definitely not your father\u2019s Oldsmobile. It\u2019s gone from sort of the mature demographic to the up and coming, so even though it\u2019s not the dollar leader in terms of what we sell in e-commerce, it is, for the medium to long-term, has tremendous potential as the generational shift continues. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman. Your line is open. Dennis McGill : Hi. Good morning, thank you. I just wanted to dig in a little bit on down on the Security outlook where you\u2019re looking for the organic growth slide, the single-digit. The 3% to 4% in Europe seems to be pretty sustainable and consistent with what you guys have done, I assume that\u2019s sort of baked into the outlook. So from the North American side, how do you think about the potential through the year going from the modest declines so far as you progress through the year and the end channel opportunity in general? Are you optimistic that the non-res market is accelerating? Is it more just self-driven to close the gap with the non-res market? Just curious how you\u2019re thinking about that. Don Allan : Sure. I think as the year progresses, and you\u2019re right about Europe, I would imagine it would continue on this 3% trajectory we\u2019ve been seeing for the rest of the year. I think North America, we will see a positive performance in our mechanical businesses in the low single-digits. And then our convergent business continues to be focused on a lot of different activities. And as a result, I do think that they\u2019re behind the market pace a little bit, but as the year goes on, that will continue to improve, but we\u2019ll probably see a little bit of pressure in the organic growth throughout the year. And then the last thing I\u2019d mention is we will continue to see emerging market pressure within Security for organic growth. We definitely experienced that in Q1 although it\u2019s a small part of the total business, I do think that will be a bit of a pressure point, as well. Operator : Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Waybright for closing remarks. Greg Waybright : Kylie, thanks a lot. We\u2019d like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. And obviously please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating on today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC Operator : Welcome to the Q2 2016 Stanley Black & Decker, Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Nicole and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin. Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations : Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's second quarter 2016 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, John Lundgren, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, our President and COO; and Don Allan, our Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website as well as on our iPhone and iPad apps. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 p.m. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning John, Jim, and Don will review our second quarter 2016 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. And consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. As we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 1934 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren. John? John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Greg. Before we get started, it's with both a sense of accomplishment and admittedly some sadness that we're announcing my retirement today as the CEO of Stanley Black & Decker, effective July 31, 2016. I say there is some sadness simply because of how much I've enjoyed leading the company and our world-class management team and employees, since the first quarter of 2004. But, I am pleased to announce that Jim Loree will be succeeding me as Stanley's Chief Executive Officer, and I am extremely confident in the prospects for this organization with Jim at the helm. For those of you who followed our company over the last several years, this transition will not come as a surprise. I, in conjunction with our board of directors, have always viewed the leadership succession plan to be a top priority to ensure consistency and stability throughout the organization, as well as to ensure that we continue to deliver the exceptional shareholder value that our investors have come to expect from this company. And, to that end, Jim is uniquely positioned to deliver on each of those things, given his tenure with the company and his role in leading the transformation that we've executed over the last decade or so. Furthermore, it's important to note that we have as deep and talented a management team today as we've had at any point during my 12 year tenure with the company. There are strong, competent leaders in place across our various businesses and we're not anticipating any major changes to the strategy or to the team as a result of this announcement. I'll be staying on as Chairman of the board through the end of the year, and I'll continue as a special advisor to the company through the end of April next year in order to ensure an orderly transition, and of course, to assist the board, Jim, and the rest of the management team in any way that I can. I'm proud of everything the company has accomplished over the last 12-plus-years, including compounded annual sales growth of 12%, and a total shareholder return of over 300%. And while I've enjoyed my time here immensely, I'm looking forward to the next phase of my career, which will include, among other things, serving on a number of boards as well as continuing my efforts to impact policy in Washington and around the world, to create an environment where manufacturing companies like ours can continue to succeed and to prosper. I'll turn 65 in September. And rather than thinking of this as going out at the top, I think of it more as a long distance relay race where we've built a good lead and I'm passing the baton to a colleague and a management team who are well positioned and fully capable of increasing that lead. And I'm confident that after you listen to this morning's call, you'll share in my belief that our best days still lie ahead of us. So, let's dive into the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Here's some of the highlights during the second quarter. Organic growth was 4%, total growth was 2%. We had robust organic growth in our Tools & Storage business, 8%, that continues an incredible trend with Europe leading the way at 14% growth during the quarter. Security was up 1%, as Europe organic growth \u2013 the trend there continues, Europe was up 3% for the quarter. Industrial was off 6% mainly due to single customer volume pressure in the electronics segment of our Engineered Fastening business, and the well expected lower Infrastructure volumes, as Oil & Gas and Hydraulics remained challenged by the weak energy and scrap steel markets, respectively. Our operating margin rate of 15.8% was up 140 basis points versus same quarter a year ago. That is a post-merger record despite significant foreign currency pressure. That was led by Tools & Storage performance which was up 240 basis points to 18.8%. And Security posted a strong sequential increase to 12.6%, while Industrial declined marginally, but to a very respectable rate of 17%. Second quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.84 was up 19% versus prior year, on strong operational performance along with a lower share count. Our DEWALT FLEXVOLT battery system was unveiled in June, delivering the power of corded and freedom of cordless to professional and consumer end users worldwide. Some of you have seen the products perform and you'll have your own well-informed views. I've participated in several of the major introductions, and the words \"game-changing\" have been a common reaction from our customers. The product will hit the shelves in October this year, and Jim will provide you some more detail on our vision to create the cordless jobsite. Given these results, we're raising our 2016 guidance to a range of $6.30 to $6.50; that's up 6% to 10% versus 2015, and from our prior guidance of $6.20 to $6.40 and, concurrently, we're reiterating our free cash flow conversion of approximately 100%. Let's look quickly at the sources of growth. Both volume and price contributed to our growth, which was broad-based on a regional basis. During the second quarter, volume was up 3%, we got a positive 1% from price, for 4% organic growth, currency was a 2 percentage point offset for a revenue growth of 2%. All regions contributed positively to the total performance across the company. You see the U.S. up 3%, Europe up 10%, emerging markets flat, rest of the world up 4%, for again, total organic growth of 4% for the quarter and 4% for the first half of the year. Don will show you later that baked into our guidance is an increase in organic growth for the year from a range of 3% to 4%, to an estimate of 4%. There were lots of puts and calls within the emerging market group, volatile markets as you know, but our Latin American group was up 9%, with Mexico up 11% and Argentina up 46%, albeit from a low base. The emerging markets were down in the low-teens, Tools and Security growth was offset by Industrial softness in the Engineered Fastening consumer electronics business. But, all in all, really strong growth in the quarter. Let me turn it over to Jim, who's got an update on our game-changing DEWALT FLEXVOLT program as well as some of the details on the segment. James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : Thank you, John. Before that I just want to thank John for being a trusted colleague and a mentor, and a friend, and also for all that John has done for this company and our stakeholders over the years. He and I have enjoyed an outstanding business partnership for over 12 years, teaming up to lead the company through a transformation from a small cap building products company to a large cap diversified industrial. It is no coincidence that John's arrival in 2004 marked the beginning of a growth renaissance period for Stanley. And I'm honored to be named as our next CEO, succeeding John, with a mission to lead us through the next stage of our journey. The company has never been stronger, with all its well-established global franchises, agile and deep leadership bench, and strong and evolving SFS2.0 operating system. Importantly, I want to highlight our world-class management team. This high-performing team to a person is totally dedicated to the success of this company. They have supported me all the way, through both their words and their actions, and have thus enabled us to effect a smooth leadership transition. The impressive results you've seen quarter-after-quarter from this company are a direct result of this team's experience, commitment, and passion for winning. What better way to highlight the immense opportunities present in this next stage of our evolution than to introduce you to the first output from breakthrough innovation, our SFS2.0 initiative. The patent-protected DEWALT FLEXVOLT system is the most exciting innovation in the power tool industry since Black & Decker unveiled the first cordless tool in the 1960s. It has the potential to revolutionize the jobsite. It allows users to switch from 20 volt to 60 volt to the never before seen 120 volts of cordless power, using the same battery pack regardless of the voltage rating. These battery packs are completely backwards compatible with our existing line of DEWALT 20 Volt tools, and when used in these products, the FLEXVOLT battery combines with our market-leading brushless motors to provide significant runtime and performance advantages. FLEXVOLT will ultimately enable professional users to completely eliminate the cord on the jobsite, achieving the freedom of cordless while maintaining all the power and flexibility of corded tools. And at the same time, none of our existing user base is left behind, as the FLEXVOLT battery packs used on their new 60 volt and 120 volt cordless tools will also enhance the performance of their existing 20 volt products. FLEXVOLT is being commercialized as part of our SFS2.0 commercial excellence initiative with the most global, most digitally-enabled, and most comprehensive marketing campaign in our history. We have already demonstrated the technology in person to over 700 customers around the globe, including major retailers, distributors, and other channel partners. We have also introduced and demonstrated the products to the tool subject matter expert blogger community and have created an enormous social media buzz in anticipation of the product's release to the market in October. We have coordinated our digital marketing campaign with our sports marketing assets and we will be conducting a massive end user demonstration effort as the summer proceeds. This type of breakthrough innovation, coupled with commercial excellence, will provide significant organic growth runway, even as we comp up against several years of top quartile organic growth among peers. In the near-term, we will focus on delivering the end user's long held dream of the cordless jobsite, and over the intermediate to longer-term, we will be moving up the power curve, exploiting the rapidly advancing technology of electrification and opening up new markets and growth opportunities. This tremendous accomplishment within our Tools & Storage business is the first example of the output we expect to deliver from SFS2.0, our enhanced operating system. We are currently taking the same approach to breakthrough innovation in several other businesses across the company, so stay tuned. I encourage all investors to take a deep dive into both FLEXVOLT and SFS2.0, as they are essential to understanding what this company will deliver in the form of continued organic growth and margin expansion. Our Investor Relations team is ready to assist those that are interested in that regard. Now moving on to 2Q. I'll begin with the Tools & Storage business, which continued its forward momentum delivering another high-single-digit organic growth performance coming in at 8% and equally as impressively improving profitability by 240 basis points for a segment profit rate of 18.8%. Total Tools revenue growth was 5% after absorbing a 3 point currency headwind. Organic growth across all regions and SBUs was once again positive. Europe led the way, up 14%; followed by North America, up 7%; and emerging markets up 4%. The gains in Europe are particularly impressive, given the flat to very low-single-digit growth environment in those markets and they highlight our ability to continue gaining share on the strength of our pervasive commercial excellence activities, and new product development initiatives such as our DC brushless motor products, which exemplify the importance of our very strong core or normal course of business innovation. This all important core innovation activity has been a key source of organic growth and a hallmark of our culture for quite some time. Core innovation provides a solid base for above market growth, thus enabling SFS2.0 breakthrough innovations to turbocharge an already strong base. Moving to global SBU results, Power Tools delivered another double-digit quarter, up 10% with consistent strength across Professional and Consumer Tools and Tools & Storage posted 2% growth as construction hand tools were up in high-single-digits, driven by our new line of DEWALT and FatMax measuring lasers offsetting pressure in Proto industrial hand tools. Taking a regional look at the segment, in North America, momentum was good across all major retailers, with high-single-digit performance from the group. POS data remained very strong and in the mid-teens for the quarter. Ending retailer inventories were in line with or below historical norms. And turning to Europe, which posted extraordinary 14% organic growth on the heels of two years of 7% compounded growth, the outperformance was widespread. Every major underlying market grew organically, with most up double-digits including a noteworthy performance by the U.K. team, which delivered the highest growth in the region. France also showed unusually strong growth, driven by share gains in Professional Power Tools. And finally, emerging markets were up 4% organically, with Latin America and Asia leading the way, both up in high-single-digits, more than offsetting continued issues in Middle East and North America which was down. Latin America continued to overcome a generally distressed market environment. Within Latin America, Argentina and Mexico turned in strong country performances with growth in our Tradesman segment and continued penetration of our recently introduced Stanley MPP cordless Power Tools. E-commerce and pricing excellence initiatives also contributed to drive growth in the region. Asia also delivered a notable performance with good organic growth in China, South Korea, and Indonesia. And as I noted earlier, we continue to see pressure within Middle East, North America, however efforts are underway to revitalize the businesses in those markets which continue to be challenged by severely depressed macroeconomic conditions, amidst geopolitical turmoil. So, in summary, Tools & Storage continued its strong momentum this quarter, leveraging SFS2.0 to drive outsized share gains, while preparing for the largest product launch in the company's history. Despite the challenging macro in several regions of the world, we remain highly constructive on the growth and margin prospects for Tools & Storage as we look forward. Shifting over to Security, Security delivered its second consecutive quarter of organic growth and its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin improvement, highlighting the solid progress this business has made. Total revenues increased 1% on 1% organic growth, while the operating margin rate improved 220 basis points year-over-year to finish at a healthy 12.6% for the quarter, its highest second quarter rate since 2013. Europe Security grew 3% organically for the third quarter in a row, marking its seventh consecutive quarter of organic growth, and strong performance in the Nordics and Central Europe drove the top line performance and offset mild pressure in the U.K. and France. Order intake was in line with expectations. The unit continues to successfully manage attrition and stabilize the RMR portfolio. Europe Security profitability continues to improve, as volume leverage productivity and cost actions all contributed to margin growth and rate improvement in the quarter. North American Security also made progress, solid organic growth in healthcare and automatic doors was offset by lower volumes in electronic security or CSS. However, CSS is driving growth in its RMR portfolio with orders and backlog in a healthy position heading into the second half of the year and attrition is in line with targets. North America also realized margin growth and rate improvement as field efficiency initiatives took hold. In total, Security improved on almost every front with order rates, backlog, and attrition at targeted rates across Europe and North America and the team is well positioned and motivated to continue driving forward progress. Moving on to Industrial, Industrial revenue was under some pressure in the quarter as weakness in Engineered Fastening combined with anticipated pressure in Infrastructure resulted in a 6% organic decline. Expense de-leveraging on lower volume, combined with negative FX, drove a corresponding profit decline although segment margin continued to be at impressive, well above company line average levels. And within Engineered Fastening, the negative growth was overwhelmingly driven by significantly lower than expected volume with one major electronics customer. The general industrial business was down modestly in line with expectations, and the automotive segment remains solid, with fastener growth continuing to outpace light vehicle production around the globe. Infrastructure was down 11% organically as a slowdown in offshore oil and gas activity, combined with continued weakness in hydraulics end markets, resulted in year-over-year declines. Encouragingly, we see sufficient project activity in our onshore business to enable positive growth for Oil & Gas in the second half of the year. So while Industrial posted an eye-opening negative organic growth number for the quarter, it was caused largely by a decline in sales to one specific electronic fastening customer, partially driven by changing end user demand and partially driven by our strategic decision to remain disciplined on price. Nonetheless, segment profitability remains strong, although the revenue impact of this situation will be felt for a few quarters until it anniversaries. So, in summary, like all multi-national businesses in today's environment of slowing global growth, an unprecedented geopolitical volatility, and an ever more rapidly increasing pace of technological change, we face ongoing challenges across our businesses in many of the markets we serve. We view these challenges as opportunities. Our continuing goal is to achieve outsized organic growth, supplement it with inorganic growth, expand margins, and do it all with a capital efficient approach. SFS2.0, with its sharp focus on breakthrough innovation, digital excellence, and commercial excellence, will continue to enable us to outperform on the organic growth front. We will soon be back on the acquisition trail, and our pipeline is full with solid opportunities to deploy capital to inorganic growth. Today's announcement of 4% organic growth, 19% earnings per share growth, a record operating margin rate of 15.8%, and $418 million of free cash flow underscores the health and earnings power of the company while highlighting the strength and agility of our management team. I look forward to leading the company in the coming months and years as we tackle the challenges and opportunities ahead and continue to drive positive momentum. And with that, I will now turn it over to Don Allan, who will provide a financial update. Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Jim. Let's start with free cash flow for the second quarter, which came in at $418 million for a year-over-year improvement of $171 million. As you can see, the primary drivers of the outperformance were stronger earnings of $44 million and continued improvements in working capital, which generated a positive $58 million of cash in the quarter for a meaningful $108 million of year-over-year improvement. Our working capital turns were 8.2 times at the end of Q2, which was a 1.2 times improvement versus the prior year second quarter. On a year-to-date basis, this leaves our free cash flow $256 million ahead of prior year, again with earnings growth and working capital efficiency explaining essentially all of the improvement. As John noted earlier, we are reiterating our free cash flow guidance at 100% conversion rate. This takes into account the incremental inventory build that we expect to undertake in the second half of the year related to the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system launch. Even with this modest headwind to working capital in the second half of 2016, we still plan to end the year at approximately 9.5 times for working capital turns. Moving to the next slide, I want to take a moment to address the potential impact of the U.K.'s EU referendum vote, or Brexit, on our anticipated business results in 2016 and potentially beyond. As you can see on this page, we are expecting to generate somewhere north of $500 million in pound sterling denominated revenues in the U.K., and more than $1.7 billion in euro denominated revenues across the euro region in 2016. To-date, we have not seen any meaningful reduction in demand within the U.K. and more broadly in Europe. It is likely too early to speculate on the demand side impact of Brexit in both the U.K. and the rest of Europe. What I can tell you at this point is that our plans for the second half of the year continue to contemplate roughly low- to mid-single-digit growth organically in the European region, as we expect our recent share gain momentum to be further augmented by the FLEXVOLT battery system rollout that Jim discussed in detail earlier. As you might expect, we are monitoring this situation very closely and will continue to assess the potential impact as events evolve. We will update all of you accordingly, as a more definitive picture materializes. From a currency perspective, however, we have seen some impact to our operating margin based on the FX movements following the referendum result. At current spot rates for the euro and pound sterling, we see approximately an $8 million additional currency pressure relative to the $140 million of FX headwind we disclosed in our April guidance. The uncertainty created by the U.K.'s decision, both with regards to the mechanics of their exit as well as the future of the European Union as a whole, could result in continued currency related pressure to our operating margin. I'd like to give you an example of that potential impact. If the euro were to go to parity with the U.S. dollar and the pound were to fall to $1.20, the combination of these moves would generate an incremental $12 million of operating margin pressure to earnings in 2016. This is above and beyond the current $8 million of incremental pressure measured at spot rates that I just mentioned. Of course, the longer FX rates hold at current levels, the more muted the impact any future deterioration will have on 2016 results. I believe this provides an adequate range of the potential worst case impact for 2016. On that note, let's move on to page 14, where we provide an updated view on the net FX impact to the company's operating margin across all currencies. As you can see, net FX headwinds have increased by approximately $10 million to $150 million since our April guidance was issued. This movement is primarily driven by the incremental pound and euro pressures I just mentioned as well as further devaluation of the Argentinian peso and Canadian dollar. These negatives are slightly offset by the appreciation in the Brazilian real, which is up about 7% against the dollar since our April guidance was communicated. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone of a statement I made during the April call, where I pointed out that should FX rates again deteriorate in 2016, we have actions and countermeasures at our disposal to maintain our EPS guidance. We continue to have similar plans in place, but as you would expect, the size of the actions we can effectively execute on begins to shrink as the year wears on. As a result, we now have approximately $20 million in contingency plans that can be put into place should they be necessary. One last point on currency : our hedging actions are now primarily focused on exposures in 2017 and beyond. And we will continue our practice of locking in portions of our largest exposures such as the Canadian dollar and the euro to dampen volatility throughout the year. Based on current spot rates and the existing derivative hedges in place for 2017 volumes, we estimate the carryover impact of currency to be approximately $20 million for 2017. Let's turn our attention to the next page and our updated 2016 outlook. As John noted at the beginning of the call, we are raising our EPS outlook to a range of $6.30 to $6.50 from the April guidance range of $6.20 to $6.40. The revised range represents a 6% to 10% year-over-year increase in EPS. At the same time, we are reiterating our free cash flow conversion at approximately 100% of net income. As you can see on the left side of the page, this 10% increase across the range is being driven by an increased organic growth estimate for the full year, moving to 4% from approximately 3% to 4%, which generates $0.07 of additional EPS. In addition, we believe $0.10 of our incremental productivity and cost actions will stick for the full year. Embedded in this amount is modest incremental growth costs related to SFS2.0 initiatives. Specifically, these costs will fund key incremental commercial excellence, and breakthrough innovation activities to help drive above-market growth beyond 2016. These two positive improvements to guidance are partially offset by $0.07 of increased FX headwind and one-time new CEO costs. Finally, note that we are providing some color on EPS for 3Q, with approximately 25% of the full year EPS expected to be delivered in the third quarter. Moving to the right-hand side of the page, you get a better sense of the drivers behind the organic growth increase, as Tools & Storage is now projected to grow high-single-digits for the year on the great momentum we have seen in the first half combined with the impact of the pending FLEXVOLT launch. However, some of these gains are being partially offset by our Industrial segment as we continue to see pressure in the general industrial and electronics businesses, which is now projected to produce low-single-digit declines in 2016. The organic growth guidance for the Security segment remains unchanged, with low-single-digit growth expected for the full year. Finally, we expect the Tools & Storage and Security segments to deliver positive year-over-year improvements to their respective operating margin rates. The Industrial segment's operating margin rate will be lower in 2016 versus 2015, as the impact from lower volume and FX pressure more than offsets the productivity gains and cost actions being taken by the Engineered Fastening and Infrastructure business teams. In summary, the second quarter was another solid performance for the company as a whole. Despite some additional pressures in our Industrial segment, Tools & Storage delivered an outstanding quarter. And the Security businesses continue to make solid progress and take additional positive steps forward. Organic growth for the quarter finished up 4%, and earnings per share were up 19% versus prior year, coming in at $1.84, excellent operating leverage. On the back of this outperformance, we are raising EPS guidance to the range of $6.30 to $6.50, as we expect the improved organic growth outlook and incremental productivity to more than offset certain pressures. In June, we introduced the world to DEWALT FLEXVOLT system, which we expect to revolutionize the construction jobsite, delivering the power of corded with the freedom of cordless to millions of professionals around the world. And finally, we announced the retirement of John as CEO. His tenure has been an era that is characterized by transformational growth and exceptional shareholder returns. Among John's many accomplishments as CEO is the impact he had on building our high integrity, agile winning business culture across our entire executive leadership team and, as a result, we are well positioned to deliver outsized growth and margin expansion going forward. And we have a highly energized organization motivated toward achieving these goals. On a personal note, I have appreciated John's mentorship and thank him for the support over the past decade. That concludes the presentation portion of the call. Let's move to Q&A. Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations : Great. Thanks, Don. Nicole, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the Q&A session. Our first question comes from the line of Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey, guys, good morning. John, best of luck to you going forward and, to Jim, congratulations. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : Thank you. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : I was wondering if you could provide some detail on what your assumptions are for growth in the various verticals within fastening and for industrial infrastructure in the back half or for the year. Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. I'd be happy to do that. So, in the Industrial segment, we were down 6% here in the second quarter. We don't expect the decline to be as severe in the back half of the year, probably low-single-digits, with it being a little larger in the third quarter and smaller in the fourth quarter as the comps get easier, in particular related to the electronics business. When you look at the different pieces, we do feel pretty good about our automotive fastener business in the back half of the year. It's seen a strong performance in the first half, up mid-single-digits as far as organic growth. And then in the back half, we expect that trend to continue as we get over a more difficult comp related to some of the equipment sales that we had in the first half related to the automotive systems business. The electronics business will continue to be a pressure point in the back half, although as the comps will slowly get easier as time goes on. We would expect that to be a rather large negative V in the back half as it has been in the first half and the general industrial business will kind of be a low- to mid-single-digit decline, as well, in the back half. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi, good morning, guys. And I guess congratulations to John and Jim both. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : Thanks. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: On the Tools margins, clearly strong execution this quarter. I think a host of things, productivity and likely price cost included. Can you maybe give us a bit of a trend line? I know you have FLEXVOLT launch costs here in the second half and FX, but maybe excluding those out, how should we think about incremental margins or how should we think about the margin from here and maybe the line of sight beyond some of the 2016 launch costs? Just given the outperformance that we saw in this quarter. Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, I think obviously the second quarter was an outstanding margin performance and organic growth performance, as Jim mentioned, for Tools & Storage. As we look at the back half, we still see very strong margins. We're certainly not going to see 18.8% at this stage because of some of the reasons that you mentioned. We're also beginning to anniversary the commodity deflation that we've experienced over the last year. That's been a strong benefit for the business and will not be a continued incremental benefit on a go-forward basis. And then FLEXVOLT, as you mentioned, is an area that is an initial pressure point to gross margins as we roll that out. Over time, they will be accretive to gross margins as we get deeper into the launch next year, and then we also have launch costs that are specific to this program that will continue out through the remainder of 2016, which means that the gross margins in the back half of the year will be roughly somewhere between the 15.5% to 16.5% range, most likely because of those dynamics. The ongoing margins, however, from an incremental margin perspective will continue to be healthy and consistent with what we've said in the past, that as we see organic growth, incrementally we would expect 30% to 35% drop through in margins, sometimes affected by specific quarter activities where it might be slightly lower if we're making investments or if there's certain types of mix that occurs. But our trend line over the long term for Tools & Storage is still positive. They will likely end the year close to 17% operating margin, if not slightly over. We'll see how the year progresses. And we would expect that they would continue to improve from that on a go-forward basis. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, John, Jim, congratulations. This is actually Evelyn Chow pinch hitting for Joe. Maybe just focusing on the gross margins for the company as a whole. They were incredibly strong this quarter. In your release you cited a few different factors and you mentioned commodity deflation has helped. Can you provide some more color on the relative contributions of the drivers you cited and the sustainability of this kind of expansion? Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, sure, I'll take it. You want to take it Jim? James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, I'll take it because this is something that we work really hard on at this company. You think about the gross margin performance this quarter in light of the FX pressures that we had, which almost totaled $40 million, it is really remarkable that we've been able to achieve this kind of accretion in the gross margin rate and what it really derives from working on everything that we possibly can to impact the margin rate in a positive way. And that starts with productivity and working hard on four wall cost productivity, working hard on vendor productivity, G&A productivity, our functional transformation initiative starting to pay some dividends, the commercial excellence initiative from SFS2.0, we're driving price realization, price optimization, all these things kind of combined, we are very, very focused on managing mix, focused on managing the lifecycle of new products, or products in general, and introducing new products at higher margins as the more mature products kind of margin has a degrading tendency over time. It's a combination of all those things, and we continue to target gross margin improvements over the medium-term, as well, and I think you'll see that over the coming years as a result of everything I just mentioned. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Congratulations and best wishes, John and congratulations, Jim. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : Thanks, Rich. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I'm going to squeeze in a couple here. Just on the inflection in margin and Security. Just thoughts around if this is a true inflection, any puts and takes as we think about the back half, sustained momentum, comments along those, and then on electronics with the one customer being such a headwind, what's the focus on progress in terms of trying to diversify the customer base? Thank you. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Don, go ahead. Let me just say, Rich, you're talking two different businesses : Security and then you're moving to Fastening. We'll get them both. But the sequential consistent improvement in Security, it's real and it's here to stay. In Europe, the team has really embraced the need to grow organically and they've done it consistently in a very tough market. U.S., the focus has been more on operational excellence, field efficiency, and both teams focusing on what we've asked them to focus on and they're doing a great job on both fronts. But I'll let Don answer your question specifically. Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, so, John is absolutely correct that the Security business continues to generate a positive momentum around various initiatives, specific to profitability. We've talked about several of them over the last year or so on different occasions as driving more efficient field productivity, really trying to streamline their SG&A, to achieve certain objectives over the long-term as a percentage of revenue, and they continue to make progress in that regard. And combining that with the fact that they're being much more disciplined around pricing and the new business that they enter into so they ensure the right levels of profitability on new business, have allowed us to continue to increase the profitability. And you just see in the first half, we had roughly 12%, just under 12% profitability in Q1 and then 12.6% in Q2, and we think that's a good indicator of the trend that we'll see in the back half, and for obviously the full year, with hopefully being close to 100 basis points improvement year-over-year in operating margin rate in that business. And the good news is that we're seeing in all three regions. Obviously, emerging markets is relatively small, but in the case of North America and Europe, we're seeing traction in both regions in a significant way, and we see more opportunity for additional upside as we continue this disciplined approach on a go-forward basis. As it relates to specifics to electronics business within Engineered Fastening and Industrial, yeah, I think that's a business that we continue to be very disciplined with, and around pricing, and we're interested in certainly some aspects of that business, but as a result of some of these decisions as well as some of the customer decisions that have been made over the last year, the business has shrunk dramatically and now represents close to $70 million on an annualized basis. And we think, for the long-term, that's probably a reasonable number somewhere between $50 million to $70 million, but we'll see where we go from here but that's kind of how we're viewing the business at this stage. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And also, I'd like to add my congrats to Jim and John. My question is focused around raw materials. If you could just kind of remind us what the changes in raw materials has impacting 2016, if that's changed at all with the move in steel prices, and I know it's obviously very early on right now, but maybe how to start thinking about, with the recent move in steel, how that may or may not impact 2017 and if there's certain hedges or pricing offsets that you think are in your wheelhouse to offset any pressures into next year. Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure, Mike. This is Don. I'll take that. We think this year we're probably getting about $40 million to $50 million of benefit from commodity deflation, and a lot of that primarily is in the first half, as we're really starting to anniversary some of those benefits that we started experiencing last summer. And so, in the back half of the year, we don't expect incremental improvement and we might even see a little bit of pressure in certain commodities as you just touched on a couple of them but we don't expect that to be material in the second half of the year. We have mentioned previously that we had locked into a lot of commodity-based contracts with certain key vendors earlier this year for the remainder of 2016. So that will clearly probably create a little bit of pressure in 2017. At this stage, we think it's a manageable number, below $25 million for the full year, but obviously we'll continue to monitor commodity prices as we always do throughout the remainder of 2016, but that's kind of where we are at this stage. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs of Baird. Your line is now open. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, good morning, everybody, and I'll add my congratulations to Jim and John as well. I guess just quick, a two-part question on Security. First, in North America, that business has organically been declining for the past few quarters, and I noticed that the tone was a little bit more positive on orders and backlog. So, maybe if you can just talk a little bit about when we can see an inflection in growth in the North American part of Security. And then second, just given your improvement in Europe, could you talk about what the margin differential is now between North America and Europe? John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Jim is going to take that. We've had the good fortune of spending a lot of time with both those businesses, Tim, just very recently, so we're really up to speed. And, Jim, why don't you take it? James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : Sure. The simple one is the second question which is about 400 basis points of difference at this point in time. And as far as the volume in North America, they've been working really hard on getting their field execution up to a level where the orders and the backlog can be installed efficiently and in a timely fashion. And I'd say the one thing that gives us the ability to be at what we think is an inflection point is the fact that the field has made a lot of progress in North America, so we actually haven't had that much of an issue generating the orders, and we have the ability to go out and generate even more orders. However, we've been throttling that a little bit as the field was sort of a bottleneck. And so that's really the answer, is the reason we're more optimistic about our ability to generate modest growth in electronic security in North America is because the field execution is improving, and the field capacity is, therefore, improving. Now, just as a side note, there's several components of North America which are doing just fine, in terms of growth, including the automatic door business and mechanical security, so this is the third leg of the stool, if you will, and once we get that moving in a positive direction, I think we'll be in a similar situation that we are in Europe, where we're generating organic growth on a more consistent basis. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, thanks, and congratulations, John and Jim. Wanted to also ask about Security, and it looked like there were some small bolt-on recurring revenue acquisitions in the quarter. So just wondering if you could give a little more color on that, and if we should interpret this as kind of a sign that you feel comfortable enough that this business is on solid footing that you'll embark on \u2013 or you'll re-embark on some inorganic growth initiatives within Security? James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : We actually do feel that the business is on solid enough footing in both North America and in Europe to digest a few small bolt-on acquisitions. And in fact, we are thinking along the lines that these types of bolt-on \u2013 RMR acquisitions, basically, is what they are \u2013 will supplement the installation business in terms of generating RMR, and that one of the keys to success in electronic security is to get the RMR portfolio, that's recurring monthly revenue for those that are unfamiliar with that term, but to get that portfolio sequentially increasing every quarter in both of those geographies. And the combination of installation growth and attrition management and small bolt-on acquisitions \u2013 we almost think of them as if they were CapEx for growth in the Security business. So you'll continue to see small ones. As far as major acquisitions in Security, no, there's nothing on the horizon in the medium-term \u2013 short- to medium-term, for that. We're actually enjoying working on operational excellence and execution in the business to \u2013 at the customer level in particular, to ensure that while all this consolidation is going on in the industry, we are providing the customers with the absolute best value proposition possible. And we think that we can continue to gain share \u2013 we're gaining share already in Europe and I think we can continue to gain share in Europe, and in the North American business I think we can begin to gain some share along the way with that as a strategy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremie Capron of CLSA. Your line is now open. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Hi, good morning. James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : Good morning. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : John, Jim, congratulations and all the best in your new roles. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Jeremie. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Have a question on the Tools business. I think you made some pretty positive comments regarding the inventory situation in some of the large distributors and also point-of-sale data, so if you could come back to those comments and maybe provide a little more color here. And also, I'd like to hear how we should think about quantifying the impact of the FLEXVOLT launch going into the end of the year, and the next year. What kind of numbers and benchmarks are you looking at to measure the success of FLEXVOLT? Thanks. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure, Jeremie, it's John, I'll start and turn it over to Don. In terms of inventories, inventories are in great shape, both from our perspective and our customers'. I think it's important to note that our large customers have done a really, really good job mining data, working with us in a collaborative \u2013 with all their suppliers, but certainly us among their largest, in a collaborative manner, to get weeks at retail down to the 8 to 9 range, when historically 10 to 12 was as well as they could do without being out of stock. So the silver lining in the cloud for us is retail inventory \u2013 for us and our customers \u2013 retail inventories are at about their lowest levels that they've been in years, but despite that sell-off or decline in inventory, we've been able to grow nicely, and from the customers' perspective, in-stock is as good as it's been. Our fill rates are as good as they've ever been. So it's really the power of sharing the data on a collaborative basis, and sell-through remains good. So we see no issues in terms of inventory adjustment going forward. What I'll say on FLEXVOLT so far, and Don will quantify it to the extent he feels comfortable, so far so good. The customers have responded really, really well. We're capacitized to fill a tremendous amount of demand to the extent it exceeds our expectations. But I'm going to let Don quantify that to the extent that he's comfortable doing so. Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, John. So... John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You get the hard ones. Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. I appreciate that. As we mentioned related to breakthrough innovation, just as a reminder to everybody, when we have major programs like this, our expectation is it will generate at least $100 million of revenue over a three year period, and clearly we think FLEXVOLT is going to exceed that, probably exceed it in a very significant way. As we look at 2016, we've had initially very high demand for the product. We expect, as Jim said, for it to hit the stores in late September, early October, and as a result, I indicated previously that I think we'll probably experience here in 2016, as a percentage for the total company, about a half a point of growth when you look at the entire year. And so that would be roughly $50 million to $60 million. That number could creep up as we go throughout the fourth quarter and could become closer to 0.75%, so we'll see how that progresses, but that's kind of the range you should look at initially. As we think about 2017, we would expect this to be probably a multi-hundred million dollar program next year, likely around $200 million, but we'll see as the year progresses and the success of the launch. We think the launch will be very, very successful. What we'd be looking at is the sell-through and how strong the sell-through is in the initial 90 days and how quickly the inventory turns, and we've clearly positioned ourselves through all the things that Jim mentioned around commercial excellence and digital excellence to try to maximize that opportunity. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your line is now open. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yes. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations, gentlemen, to you both. My question was with respect to the European Tools & Storage growth. You talked about new products, you talked about expanded retail distribution. I guess I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the sustainability of that growth and maybe how much runway is left with the retail distribution side of that or just deconstruct the drivers and talk about the sustainability. James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, and anybody that had 14% organic growth in Europe and said it was sustainable would not be credible. So I mean, I think that's a very special performance. And we're on the heels of the two years of 7% comps which makes it even more challenging. But having said that, the European Tools team is literally on a rampage, a growth rampage, and the environment is the big unknown over there and the success of FLEXVOLT is also a big unknown. So it's difficult to say \u2013 peg a number. But I think the one thing that we can say for certain is that whatever the market is, we will continue to outperform it over there and continue to gain share for the foreseeable future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie. Your line is now open. Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi. John, I hope you enjoy your retirement, and, Jim, congratulations. My question is on the innovation in Tools. Is the 1% or so price gain that you've been reporting sustainable and part of your internal goals going forward? And is there any potential for bigger innovation in Hand Tools to move the needle on the 2% growth there that is well below the growth you're seeing in Power Tools? Thank you. James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : Starting with the innovation in Hand Tools, the innovation in Hand Tools is quite robust, actually, and it is really remarkable how much innovation there is in products that are relatively simple \u2013 seemingly relatively simple. The reason the organic growth in Hand Tools is a bit lower right now is not because of any lack of innovative growth because there is a fair amount of that, most notably the lasers in this past quarter. The pressure in the Hand Tools business derives largely from the weakness in the industrial channels, in particular, our Proto branded products are relatively \u2013 have negative offsetting the positive growth in the other area. And then the first part of the question? Why don't you just repeat the first part of the question? John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Probably can't... (54:23) James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : Can you remember what it was? Operator : One moment. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : 2% James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : I think it was more around... (54:31) John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It was just Hand Tools, 2%. Could we ramp up organic growth on Hand Tools, which is 2%, which is below Power Tools. And I think you got it. James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : Okay. I hope so, if not, Mike, obviously you can follow-up with Greg, because I know after your question you didn't have access to speak again. Operator : All right. And our next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates. Your line is now open. Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC : Hi, just a quick two-parter, I guess just on the transition. Jim, is your COO role going to be backfilled either immediately or over time? And then just looking for an update with respect to how you guys would phrase the Security strategy now. I think we're about a year past the initial review. It sounds like status quo, but just wanted to hear how you're thinking about it. James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : I'll answer the first part of the question and then I'll turn it over to Don who will give his regular answer to that question. The answer is, no backfill for the COO role right away. There may at some point in time as the succession plan for me is developed and so on, it may be filled, it may not be, that all remains to be seen at this point. And then, Don, on the Security portfolio strategy. Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, absolutely. So, you're right, Dennis, we made an announcement a little more than a year ago about our evaluation of this portfolio. We, frankly, really began that evaluation in the early parts of this year, with last year more focused on continued improvement of the operational performance across the board and we're starting to see some of the fruit from that labor. And we had a good discussion at this board meeting and we will likely have another one in October, hopefully that will solidify our discussion and we'll be able to announce something post-October. But we've looked at obviously the three options we've discussed previously, which is keeping the entire business, potentially selling or spinning the entire business, or divesting a portion of it and we specifically had mentioned our mechanical lock business as a potential candidate for that. So we continue to evaluate those. I would say that, it's getting very close to the finish line, and I would imagine in the next 90 days to 120 days, we'll have something very clear to say on that. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kessler of Imperial Capital. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : Thank you. And it's interesting \u2013 firstly, congratulations to both John and congratulations to Jim. Keeping the Security questions going, which is kind of unusual for all these \u2013 after all these years, looking at the various components of what makes up the electronic security side of your business, and looking at some of the smaller parts of it, that have been added and you've been showing off at tradeshows such as healthcare, and Sonitrol and tracking, things like that. You're talking still about fairly slow growth, but consistent growth, on the electronics side. Is there going to be a point at which some of these higher-growing areas begin to start affecting the overall growth of electronic security, particularly in North America, or indeed in Europe if they begin to add to that, as you begin to try to start adding more value, and offering more value to your customers out there? John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The answer is yes, but I'll let Jim give you a little more detail. James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : This industry that we're talking about, electronic security, is in very rapid flux right now, as I think most people know. And the IoT, in particular, the cloud, advanced analytics, these types of things are all impacting our industry. And, in fact, our industry is extremely well positioned to exploit some of those technological advances. And we're working very diligently and aggressively on several verticals, including healthcare and retail in particular in the United States, and in Europe we're taking a bit of a different approach where we're working more on specific applications and then trying to market those, generally kind of in the $1 million to $5 million annual revenue range, whereas the healthcare and retail solutions are a little bit higher ticket. The growth from those activities in the higher end verticals, the real key is to create this recurring revenue business model that will provide superior profitability and, therefore, enable us to get paid for the value. That is definitely something that we've been able to accomplish in healthcare, and now, in healthcare, we're really investing in significant growth because the next challenge that one faces in these types of verticals is scaling, and being able to make those significant investments that enable 10%, 20%, 30% growth. And that's challenging in a business that's in kind of a turnaround profitability mode, but we're going ahead and making some of those investments. In fact, healthcare is one area where we're doing it, retail is another one here in the States. Now, the fundamental growth model in traditional electronic security is always very challenging to grow it quickly because of the high recurring revenue content of the total revenue base, which means that \u2013 and also the attrition in the recurring revenue portfolio, which goes back to one of the reasons I think these bolt-on RMR acquisitions are a good idea because it takes some of the pressure off of the installation growth and the attachment of RMR to that installation revenue, and it enables more investment in kind of the high-growth areas. So you will see, over time, an improvement in a more consistent \u2013 in the growth rate and a more consistent growth rate coming out of electronic security, which is one of the reasons that we like the business because it does have that stable revenue stream once you get it moving in the right direction. And that's what we're really attempting to do right now. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : Is what you're doing in healthcare and in retail, is it portable to other verticals? James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer : I would say it's probably 60% to 70% portable. Lots of times there's platforms that and certain technologies like IoT, cloud, analytics that you have those capabilities within the organization, but then there's application-specific activities that have to be tailored to specific applications, whether it's in a hospital or whether we're working on electronic article surveillance in a retail establishment. So that part of it, I'll call it the other 40%, is not portable. John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Jeff, said differently, and you know this as well as anyone, in any vertical about 50% of what we do is standardized across every vertical, but about 50% of what we do in a vertical is unique to that vertical, which is why we go to market that way. But to Jim's point, a whole lot of what we're doing is portable and we're looking forward to leveraging those opportunities. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the call back over to Greg Waybright for any closing remarks. Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations : Great. Nicole, thank you very much. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning, for your participation on your call and your questions and your comments. And, clearly, please contact me if you have any further questions, and thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. That does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Nicole and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin. Greg Waybright - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's third quarter 2016 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself is Jim Loree, our President and CEO, and Don Allan, our Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website, as well as on our iPhone and iPad apps. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 :00 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our Press Release. This morning, Jim and Don will review our third quarter 2016 results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. And consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. As we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our Press Release and in our most recent 1934 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree. Jim? James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. In the third quarter, we continued to perform at a high level delivering modestly above market organic growth. We also achieved another quarter of margin expansion, despite a challenging external backdrop, which included slow global growth, dollar strength, and geopolitical and other volatility. In a few minutes, Don will provide color on each business segment but first here's a few highlights. Total company organic growth was 3% in the quarter and revenues were up 2% net of currency. Tools & Storage led the way, up 5%, with the European team contributing a remarkable second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth up 11%. The securities segment continued to make good progress, up 2% organically with all regions contributing. The North American business delivered a point of organic growth to go along with noteworthy year-to-date margin improvement. Industrial was weighed down by the impact of one major electronics customer, and to a lesser extent, by general industrial market conditions. As a result, the segment continued to experience top-line contraction, in this case 4%. On a very positive note, total company operating margin expanded 40 basis points year-over-year to 15.2%, as a strong operating performance more than offset the impact of currency headwinds and the cost impact of growth investments. Diluted EPS was $1.68, up 8% year-over-year on continued revenue growth with solid operating leverage driven by disciplined price management and cost control, productivity gains, and commodity deflation, among other factors. The third quarter also marked the beginning of the exciting launch of the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system, the first breakthrough innovation coming out of SFS2.0. This introduction has been met with unbridled enthusiasm across our professional customer base. The magnitude of the technological accomplishment in conjunction with the sheer breadth and depth of the marketing campaign has driven strong early momentum. We expect the success of this initiative to continue into the fourth quarter through 2017 and for years to come. In fact, the early returns suggest that this will be the largest and most successful power tool product rollout in our company's history. This success will likely enable us to continue our strong Tools & Storage organic growth track record into 2017, despite having to overcome comps from 2014, 2015, and 2016 averaging 7% annually. And finally, I'm pleased to note that we have raised the midpoint of our full year 2016 EPS guidance by $0.05 from $6.40 to $6.45, and tightened the full year EPS range to $6.40 to $6.50. It was previously $6.30 to $6.50. Don will cover this increase in the midpoint in more detail during his remarks. Moving over to M&A, as many of you know, on October 12 we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to purchase the Newell Tools business, including the Irwin and Lenox brands from Newell Brands Incorporated. I would like to spend a few minutes sharing some thoughts on this transaction. I'll start by saying that we are very excited by the growth and margin expansion opportunities this deal brings. In addition to clearly identified and achievable cost synergies, there is tremendous strategic value here. We see significant opportunities for revenue synergies in both the short-term and the long-term. Opportunities include channel optimization, cross branding of product lines, and geographic expansion. These opportunities are very similar on a somewhat smaller scale to the ones we were so successful in pursuing with regard to Black & Decker, a gift which keeps on giving. And we're fortunate to have the same Tools senior leadership team in place that integrated Black & Decker, and that team is now focused on the Newell business. We also really like the assets. The Lenox and Irwin brands are among the best in their respective categories and are attractive and powerful additions to our portfolio. The product offerings are highly complementary to our existing Tools product line and significantly increased the size of our hand tools and power tools, accessories businesses. Newell Tools also extends our channel presence in the plumbing and electrical trades, which are both attractive adjacencies to our legacy core markets. You can see a breakdown of revenues by region and product mix as well as by brand on the right hand side of the page and this transaction brings top tier positions globally in both the Band Saw Blade and Linear Edge markets where the Lenox brand reigned supreme while also meaningfully bolstering our pliers and accessories product lines, among others. And as we noted on the deal announcement call, this transaction marks the end of our nearly three-year self-imposed M&A moratorium. And over that time, we significantly strengthened the foundation of our core businesses, implemented a new enhanced operating system, SFS2.0, drove gains in organic growth and margin expansion while advancing our incremental and breakthrough innovation processes, all of which position the company for strong performance over the last few years and into the future. And I'm pleased that our first acquisition after this break is a business that lines up so well with our strategic growth framework and our core competencies. In line with that framework in our financial criteria, we expect EPS to be accretive year one, delivering $0.15 a share and growing to at least $0.50 a share in year three, both on an ex-charges basis. The transition and integration planning is now under way with closing expected sometime in 2017, most likely in the first half. And at this point, I'll turn it over to Don Allan who will cover more detail on segment performance, as well as provide a financial update. Don? Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We'll now take a more in-depth look at our third quarter performance across the segment. As previously mentioned by Jim, the Tools & Storage business delivered another outstanding quarter of organic growth of 5% as we saw continued significant share gains in Europe, which was up 11%, and a solid performance in North America, which grew at 4%. The emerging markets were up modestly in the quarter as declines in the Middle East and Northern Africa offset mid to high single-digit growth in Latin America and Asia. Over the last few quarters, we have been adding commercial and leadership resources to the Middle East and North Africa teams and expect that business to swing back to a positive organic growth trajectory in the coming year. In North America, share gains were driven by U.S. retail, up high-single digits, despite inventory reductions by certain retail partners and we had a very strong performance in Canada, also up high-single digits. In the aggregate, this strong performance more than offset persistent weakness in the North American industrial tool channel. Within our U.S. retail channels, POS remained healthy and excitement around the FLEXVOLT launch met lofty expectations, leaving the product line on track to deliver on our 2016 revenue expectations. We have talked quite a bit over the last few quarters about how an incredible technological accomplishment the Tools team has been able to deliver with this new product platform. Developing FLEXVOLT from scratch through our breakthrough innovation process and driving it from concept to store shelves in just under two years. But I also want to highlight how proud we are of the commercial team's effort in coordinating this rollout, which was the first and largest global product launch in our company's 170 plus year history. The excitement and enthusiasm that they have been able to generate globally, while no doubt aided by the unparalleled technological accomplishment of this product has nonetheless been simply extraordinary. This launch also serves as a perfect example of how the digital and commercial excellent pillars of SFS2.0 combined with an enhanced breakthrough and incremental innovation process compounding our engineering achievements through superior marketing, targeting commercial efforts, and paving the way for significant organic growth opportunities. The European team continued their commercialization efforts throughout the region to drive tremendous share gains once again. When you consider the third quarter's impressive 11% organic growth against the backdrop of a 14% gain in the second quarter, and high-single digit organic growth in 2014 and 2015, the magnitude of this achievement comes into focus and is truly extraordinary. Gains continue to be widespread throughout the region within the UK, France and Central Europe, all delivering strong performances from new product development, growth investments, and an ever increasing retail footprint. Turning to the SBUs. Power tools were up 8% on the back of the FLEXVOLT launch and commercial successes that I just discussed. While the Hand Tools & Storage business declined by 3%, as pressure in the Industrial Tool channels more than offset growth in Mac Tools and strong performances in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. From a profitability perspective, the Tools business continues to impress, expanding its operating margin 70 basis points in the quarter and delivering $330 million of operating profit. These results were achieved despite continued currency pressure and while balancing growth-related investments, a clear demonstration of our ability to drive operating leverage as we grow. And I'll just make one final comment in the Tools & Storage business. When you think about the results the team delivered over the last few years in this challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, you can understand more clearly why we are so excited about the Newell Tools acquisition. There is a significant value creation opportunity presented by folding these powerful brands and high quality products into our best-in-class Tools & Storage operation. Moving on to Security, the segment delivered its third consecutive quarter of organic growth, up 2% with all regions contributing. As Jim mentioned, North America posted its first quarter of growth since Q2 of 2015, led by higher volume within the commercial, electronics security and automatic door businesses. It is very encouraging to see the North American team combine the field productivity and profitability improvements they have made over the last two years with budding organic growth as the business continues to progress forward. In Europe, the team continued its organic growth trend, up close to 1.5% in the quarter, making this the eighth consecutive quarter of organic growth. Higher installation volumes and a strong performance in the Nordics and Germany helped to drive top-line growth and offset the pressures that we've seen in the UK, where we are continuing to see some negative impact on CapEx spend and commercial decisions relating to Brexit. We also saw organic growth from Security's emerging markets operation, a positive sign for this relatively small portion of the segment. Margins in the Security segment continued to improve, up 180 basis points in the quarter. The improvement was primarily driven by the North American team's continued success with its field efficiency and productivity efforts as well as continued focus on tight controls over SG&A across the entire segment. Margins were also favorably influenced by more intense rigor over the profitability requirements of our commercial opportunities that we implemented in the past year, the benefits of which are now beginning to see within our operating margin rate as backlog orders are converting to revenue. Let's move to the Industrial segment. Revenues were down in the quarter, as anticipated, as the impact of one large electronics customer and still weak industrial market conditions adversely impacted Engineered Fastening volume. This decline more than offset the mid-single digit growth in Infrastructure resulting in an overall 4% organic decline for the segment. Within Engineered Fastening, the organic revenue decline was largely expected; however, the global automotive business continued to perform well with solid growth in Europe and Asia, which outpaced light vehicle production. This growth more than offset some slowness that we've experienced in the North American automotive business in Q3. The impact associated with the volume declines tied to one large electronics customer had a significant impact on Engineered Fastening, as well as the overall segment's organic growth for the quarter. If you exclude this impact, Engineered Fastenings' organic growth would have been slightly positive and the Industrial segment's organic growth would have been 1% for the quarter. Infrastructure posted organic growth of 5%, driven by higher Oil & Gas and onshore project activity, which more than offset continued weakness in the Hydraulic Tools business; however, that's beginning to show some signs of stabilizing. Finally, while profitability in the Industrial segment declined by 40 basis points year-over-year, the segment still managed to achieve a very healthy 17.4% OM rate as a result of significant productivity gains and cost control actions, which managed to largely offset the negative margin impact from the top line decline. So let's move to slide 7 and talk about our free cash flow, which came in at $169 million for the third quarter in line with our prior year performance. The year-over-year improvement in net income of $21 million was offset by a slightly larger expansion in working capital and a higher CapEx investment of $10 million each. However, and very importantly, working capital turns in the quarter improved by 0.7 turns to 7.1 times, as the slight increase in working capital dollars covered a greater year-over-year revenue base. Year-to-date free cash flow performance remains very strong, coming in at $428 million through the third quarter as higher earnings combined with significantly lower expansion in working capital of approximately $200 million have absorbed $42 million of additional CapEx investments to deliver a solid $254 million outperformance versus the prior year. The working capital discipline has been particularly impressive, given the strong organic growth we have seen throughout 2016, not to mention the inventory builds related to the FLEXVOLT launch, which commenced in Q3. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are reiterating our free cash flow guidance at approximately 100% conversion rate. As in the past, we expect to generate significant free cash flow in the fourth quarter on the back of solid earnings growth and the seasonal working capital liquidation we experienced within our Tools & Storage business. So let's shift to guidance on slide 8. As Jim noted at the beginning of the call, we are raising the midpoint of our EPS guidance and tightening the range $6.40 to $6.50, from the previous range of $6.30 to $6.50. The revised range represents an 8% to 10% year-over-year increase in earnings per share. This raises our third in as many quarters for 2016 and is representative of the continued strong performance by Tools & Storage and solid improvement in our Security segment profitability profile. These outperformances have more than offset a difficult performance in our Industrial segment. As you can see on the left side of the chart, the $0.05 increase in the midpoint of our guidance is driven by improved operating performance, primarily within Tools & Storage. These improvements relate to continued indirect cost controls and slightly higher levels of cost productivity than originally estimated. Please note that this guidance does exclude any potential acquisition costs which could occur in the fourth quarter related to the Newell Tools deal. Let's shift to the segment outlook on the page. Tools & Storage is still expected to generate high-single digit growth for the full year as we see continued share gains across the globe combined with the FLEXVOLT launch in the second half of 2016. We are still estimating the revenue impact of FLEXVOLT to be slightly under $100 million in 2016. Security is expected to grow low-single digits, as momentum in North America and emerging markets offset some modest pressure we are seeing in Europe, related primarily to Brexit dynamics within the UK which is impacting certain large financial customers. Finally, we now expect the mid-single digit full year decline in Industrial revenue as our Engineered Fastening business continues to work through the lost revenue from the previously mentioned major electronics customer, which, by the way, will anniversary in Q4, and additionally may experience market-driven headwinds within the general Industrial business. Another set of factors to be aware of in Industrial is that we expect the North American automotive business to reflect the slowing market as we end 2016, combined with a weak Oil & Gas pipeline construction market in Q4. Turning to operating margin rates, all segments remain in line with previous expectations as Tools & Storage and Security's profitability improves year-over-year and the Industrial segment declines, driven by top-line contraction. Our operating performance in 2016 has been strong with EPS growth expected to be 8% to 10%, despite absorbing another year of significant currency headwinds, which totaled $150 million or approximately $0.75 of earnings per share. We are very pleased with the team's performance to-date and now are squarely focused on wrapping up a great year highlighted by a strong performance on both organic revenue and earnings growth. In summary, the third quarter was another solid performance for the company as organic growth finished up 3% and earnings per share up 8% versus the prior year. Tools & Storage delivered another outstanding performance, likewise the Security segment continues to progress, driving both organic growth and margin rate expansion. Based on this quarter's performance or outperformance, that is, we are raising the midpoint of and tightening the EPS guidance range to $6.40 up to $6.50 from the previous range of $6.30 to $6.50. The third quarter marked the anxiously awaited launch of the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system, which was met with tremendous excitement from professionals, tradesmen, and tool enthusiasts around the world, our first of what we believe will be many successful breakthrough innovations in the future. On October 12, we ended our nearly three-year self-imposed VD (20:40) moratorium with the announcement of our agreement to acquire the Newell Tools business, including the iconic Lenox and solid Irwin brands, a highly strategic and financially attractive transaction. Lastly, we are continuing with our review of the Security business. As we have previously noted, we expect to provide an update at some point during the fourth quarter reporting period. There are a number of exciting things happening at Stanley Black & Decker today. The opportunities presented by the FLEXVOLT launch and Newell Tools transaction are significant and robust. As we look ahead into 2017, we remain committed to delivering solid organic growth and EPS operating leverage consistent with our three-year annual financial objectives previously communicated. That concludes the presentation portion of today's call. Now, let's move to Q&A. Greg Waybright - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Don. Nicole, if you could, we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Greg Waybright - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Morning. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Going to squeeze in a couple here but just one for Jim, one for Don. Jim, in terms of future M&A, obviously the Newell deal announced and we're going to get some kind of resolution with Security here relatively soon. What's the appetite to do further M&A as you go deeper into 2017 and is this more of a function, a barometer around ability to execute versus opportunities out there? And then, for Don, as we think about 2017 in terms of margin expansion and how you're thinking about that preliminarily, what are the puts and takes? You've had a pretty good year here in 2016 and would seem like with commodity prices moving up a bit that maybe some more headwinds as we think about 2017? Thanks. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Okay. Well, I'll start. This is Jim. As far as M&A goes, we're \u2013 historically, if we go back 15 years or so, and we look at the capital allocation of the company, we've taken almost exactly 50% of our excess capital and allocated it to M&A, and the other 50% we've given back to the shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases. And during that timeframe, we more than quintupled the size of the company and gave back a lot of cash along the way, and returns to shareholders were very, very solid, 400%, 500% over that timeframe. So we like that formula, and when we took the break it really was an opportunity to digest many of the acquisitions that we did over that timeframe. And now, we're back and we intend to kind of continue with that 50% allocation of excess capital to M&A and it's not an organizational bandwidth issue. I think Newell, despite it's relatively significant size, is really a bolt-on acquisition for the tool business. So, I'm not underestimating the importance of getting that integration right at all. It's top priority for us, but there are other businesses in the portfolio, and there's also some other activity going on in the tool industry that might lead to further consolidation, which we would intend to be a part of. So we'll do more deals as we go forward and it will be a contributor to our growth. We expect our organic growth to be 4% to 6% over the long-term, and we expect acquisitions to contribute another 5%, 6% annually above that. Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yeah. And I'll address your second question, Rich, which is about kind of our views of 2017. Maybe what I can do is, build upon my comments at the end of the presentation and give a little bit of a framework of our current thoughts related to 2017. As I presented back in our Investor Day in May of 2015, we gave kind of a three-year perspective, annual objectives for three years is basically what it was and we said organic growth had a profile of 4% to 6%. Organic EPS growth would be 6% to 8%, so really demonstrating that operating leverage. And then, obviously acquisitions, we presented something in excess of 10% EPS growth if you included acquisitions. Our thoughts right now is that we think we're in that range. We're probably on the organic growth side at the low end of the range, which should be similar to the profile that we've experienced here in 2016, around 4%. We think that's probably a good proxy at this stage for next year. And then, the EPS number is probably in that \u2013 around that midpoint of that range I just mentioned at this stage. The other thing to keep in mind is as you start to look at the different segments for organic growth in particular, our Tools business will probably grow about 7% this year by the time the year is done. Our Security business will be around 1% organic growth, and we'll see mid-single digit declines in Industrial. Keeping in mind Industrial does have that kind of difficult comp that it's been dealing with a major customer. If you exclude that impact, it's probably down about 2% today. I think that's a good framework, frankly, for next year with maybe Tools being a little bit lower from that 7%, but we'll see how positive the impact of FLEXVOLT is. It's still early days, but as Jim mentioned, it's very positive at this stage, so we'll see if that is a little bit higher than our expectation. We previously communicated that we think it will be $200 million roughly of revenue next year. And the one factor we don't know yet is the cannibalization impact. And then, the other two segments, I think you'll see 1% to 2% growth probably in Security and a modest decline most likely Industrial continuing, as we probably work through continued difficult Industrial market. But I think that's a good framework to start with, and we'll see how the year ends. We haven't provided specific input around currency and commodities. But at this point, based on current rates, currency is probably a $20 million to $30 million pressure next year, and commodities is probably a similar amount at this stage. So we don't see that as a major headwind going into 2017, which is why we still think we can achieve reasonable operating leverage. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you very much. Just a little bit more color on FLEXVOLT if you can or if you're willing. Just wondering if you've achieved full channel fill at this point? And anything else you could tell us about kind of promotional costs and how those could influence margins not only in the fourth quarter but maybe into the early part of next year as you continue to push forward? James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yeah, this is Jim. The channel fill has been fairly comprehensive. It's still in process. So it continues, but it's on track. And as Don said, we'll be in the $100 million range for the four months, September through December, which meets our expectations. And I'd say there's probably more customer demand growing as we fill the channel and they start to see the early signs of their end-user pull. And so, we're expecting a pretty good growth as we go into 2017, as Don mentioned. And as far as the margin elements, I'll have \u2013 Don, you can tackle that one. Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yeah. So as we initially discussed, I think back in July, the second half definitely has a little bit of margin pressure related to the launch of FLEXVOLT, both on the gross margin side and then some of the activities we're doing in SG&A around the digital marketing programs and commercialization activities. That's going to continue most likely into the first quarter. We don't see that as a major pressure point. As you see the business had 17.4% margin in the third quarter, very strong and up 70 basis points year-over-year. And so, we don't see it as a major drag, but it's certainly-- when you look at it sequentially versus Q2, as an example, it's one of reasons why we're at 17.4% versus 18.8% in the second quarter. But as we enter the back half of next year, margins will regulate and we get to more line averages or above, depending on which FLEXVOLT product category. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning, Gents. Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Hi, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, so, Don, great color on 2017, and I'm just wondering if you're factoring anything into your sort of 2017 EPS, sort of math regarding any potential dilution from a potential Security portfolio decision. And then just a calculation on that, that would be great. And then on the Industrial \u2013 lots of moving parts there. Oil & Gas you've alluded that that starts to weaken in 4Q. Hydraulics you said is stabilizing, and your Apple is forecasting growth in 4Q. So, I'm just wondering if maybe you could give us a little bit of a roadmap on how you see the moving parts for Industrial tracking into 4Q and 2017? Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yeah, so let me start with thoughts about 2017 as it related to Security. In those comments that I made, we are not factoring in any decision related to Security because obviously there are different things that are being evaluated. However, if you look at the three options we discussed, one is obviously keeping the business, which would have no impact. The second option was to do something with the entire Security business, which would obviously have a significant impact to what I described. And then the third option was an evaluation of our mechanical lock business and determining potential divestiture of that. If that was the choice that we chose, then there would be, what I would say, a modest dilutive impact to that. However, the proceeds of the money we received could partially be used to do a buyback to minimize that dilution. So, our view is we don't think \u2013 under that scenario we don't think it would be \u2013 it would have a large impact on the numbers that I described. So that gives you a little bit of framework on our thoughts there. On the kind of the Industrial breakdown, you said Apple had growth in the fourth quarter. I think you were referring to Apple the company, not our business, but we're not projecting growth in our business, so that's probably part of your question. But what I said was that we are seeing \u2013 we saw slowing in the North American auto business in the third quarter. We expect that to continue as we're starting to see especially with the big four, a little lighter production schedule for the fourth quarter. So we're going to probably continue to see pressure there. The current projections for next year for light vehicle production are still positive, although they're very modest at just over about a 0.5% year-over-year. So, North America right now appears to be a modest growth number for light vehicle production, which we tend to outperform. We'll have to watch that very closely as the year ends. Looking at Oil & Gas, it is weakening and it's weakening primarily because there is a large project in the Dakotas of the U.S. that has been dealing with protesters and other activities that have shutdown a lot of that pipeline construction and that's impacted us modestly in Q3 but we do see that as a larger impact in Q4. And so, those are two factors that we're seeing in Q4 that are creating our view of guidance and why we have not raised our guidance beyond the $0.05 kind of drop through of what we outperformed, or a large part of what we outperformed in Q3. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Jeremie Capron of CLSA. Your line is now open. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks, good morning. Question on the Security business. I see you had a small acquisition here. Can you remind us what's going on exactly? I think you referred to buying some of the franchises in the Electronics Security business. So any color on that is appreciated. Thanks. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yeah, there's an element in growth in the Security business, which is supplementing our RMR portfolio, our recurring monthly revenue portfolio. And, so we will buy small bolt-on acquisitions, typically in the $20 million to $50 million kind of range. It's almost like CapEx. It's a bit of a steady state but it helps supplement the recurring revenue growth because, as you can imagine, when you have a recurring revenue portfolio and there's attrition in the 7% to 12% range, depending on the type of portfolio that you have to originate all that just to keep the recurring revenue portfolio even, and then you have to originate more to grow the recurring revenue portfolio. So growing the recurring revenue portfolio is assisted by supplementing it with small acquisitions but it's really not a very material amount of money to the overall corporation that we're spending on them. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Your line is now open. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, Don, you talked a little bit about the FLEXVOLT being part of the sequential step down in margin this quarter, but as it applies to sequentially into 4Q what accounts for maybe a further step down in margin, and I mean you're launching FLEXVOLT around the holidays. It doesn't really seem like much of a holiday item, but how do I think about the kind of the 4Q sequential margin dynamics relative to what we just saw in 3Q? Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yeah. The fourth quarter normally has a sequential decline because there is a significant mix shift that does happen in Tools & Storage in Q4. Because of the holiday season, you do have a higher level of Black & Decker-branded products that are being solid, a little bit of promotional activities. And that historically has been, depending on the year, it can be anywhere from 40 basis points to 80 basis points of a drop when you look at Q3. If you factor in the FLEXVOLT activities, that most likely would be another 30 basis points to 50 basis points on top of that. So, the other thing that we're seeing is that we are seeing a little bit of modest commodity inflation as we exit the year. It's not dramatically impacting the rates, but that could be a 0.10 point as well with our 10 basis points. That kind of gives you a little bit of granularity around that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the lined line of Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, good morning, and thanks for all the great detail, as always. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning. Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Just wanted to dial into FLEXVOLT just a touch more. I know obviously it's very early on in the launch and that launch continues in 4Q, but I think earlier you said that you kind of referenced to the $200 million sales impact for next year without commenting on cannibalization. But as you're starting to see the orders at least coalesce at this point, I was just curious if you had any updated read on what the revenue impact would be in 3Q, 4Q, and if there's any upside. I think you said there was possibly some upside to the 200 next year. And also any sense potentially of that, any cannibalization? James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Okay, well, I'll let Don comment on quarterly revenue splits, but I don't think I'll say too much. But I'll talk about next year and the possibilities related to FLEXVOLT. And again, we don't know about cannibalization, so that is the big unknown. However, we feel like the order momentum is pretty good and the receptivity of the end users is excellent. So we are really paying attention to how much capacity do we have if this does become a much bigger program than $200 million in 2017. And right now we're hovering in the $400 million range for total capacity, and we're working to ensure that if it were even stronger than that that we could deal with the bottlenecks, but I don't imagine we could go too much beyond that. So, I think we're probably ring fencing it in the $200 million to $400 million sort of range. Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yeah. And as far as this year's third and fourth quarter, we don't really like grind into that detail, but as we said, it's a $100 million for this year, slightly under $100 million. I think you can reasonably assume that the split is pretty close to 50/50. It's not dramatically different than that. It's a little bit more in fourth quarter, a little less in third quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Wood of Macquarie. Your line is now open. Michael Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: High, congratulations continuing to drive the outgrowth. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Thank you. Michael Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: I wanted to ask you on the 3% hand tool decline. Just some more color there on how much is explained by the declines in Industrial Tools, what the sequential trends have been there and when you're anniversarying that weakness. And is this primarily on the CRC-Evans business, I'm guessing? Just more data on the Mac Tools growth, as well. Thank you. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yeah. So when you look at our hand tool business for Tools & Storage, it's \u2013 as I mentioned, it's pressured. It was down 3% organically in the quarter. The pressure is coming from what we call the Industrial Tool business, which are the brands of Proto, Facom, our Storage business, which is under Vidmar and Lista, and then the Mac Tool business is in that category; however, they're serving primarily the automotive aftermarket and they continue to demonstrate kind of low to mid-single digit organic growth. And that's been a trend that they've been on for a while. So we're seeing pressure in those tool channels that's been since it started in probably the early part to the mid-part of fourth quarter of last year that pressure continues. It anniversaries, obviously, in the fourth quarter. We're not expecting to see growth in that profile in the fourth quarter, but certainly the amount of retraction should be much smaller. And hopefully we can move beyond that into next year and it doesn't become a pressure point. It's more of can it go beyond flat and how do we gain share and maybe demonstrate some modest growth in that space. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey, guys, good morning. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : How should we think about the price cost spread given you're starting to plan for some inflation next year? Which, I guess, is really a question on being able to raise price here, since I think you indicated earlier that you're planning for, what, $20 million to $30 million of commodity inflation next year? Thanks. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yeah. So this year we're going to show about a point of positive, and that was in a market that was primarily, a good part of the year was more of a deflation commodity situation, although the amount was not really significant, so we don't -- we were able to -- I get a lot of this price from two different areas. One, we certainly are getting a lot of price benefit to offset the currency pressure that you're seeing primarily in emerging markets. That was by taking those price actions. That's a big part of what that 1% is. And then there's what I would say the normal ongoing activity that we do in all our businesses and have been doing for quite some time, which is around what I typically call surgical or strategic pricing actions, which is really looking at different products, different product categories, looking at the competitive pricing dynamics, look at the value proposition and the differentiation we might have in these categories, and then really setting a pricing that we think is more appropriate for the value that we provide to the consumer or the customer. And we've been doing that, we continue to do that, and that's something that I think even in a modest commodity inflation environment next year -- and it will be modest. Remember, my comments were not \u2013 our expectations are that this is not something that's going to be a significant commodity inflation market. I just don't think the demand is there to really stimulate that type of activity. But that being said, these surgical marketing or pricing approaches are things that we will continue to do. And so, although we'll probably see a little bit of price pressure here and there on certain products because of what we experienced with commodities this year, having a modest inflationary environment actually is helpful when you're having some of these surgical price initiatives. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Hello? Operator : Again, Joshua, your line is now open. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: I guess we answered his question. Just move on the call. Thanks. Operator : No problem. Our next question comes from the line of Liam Burke of Wunderlich. Your line is now open. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, Jim. Good morning, Don. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning. Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Jim, on the Newell acquisition, would you be picking up additional distribution or is there a lot of overlap in the channel? James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: There is definitely some incremental distribution that we're picking up, particularly in the plumbing and trades and electrical trades, and we really like that kind of distribution. It's very dependable kind of favorable type of both end market and end channel. So, that would be in the, kind of in the (44:47) channel and some of the other \u2013 those types of channels outside of the home centers and mass merchants. But then, there's a lot of overlap too. So it's kind of a nice balance. We pick up some incremental distribution, but we also have the ability to consolidate within our existing channels and gain synergies and so on. Operator : Our next question comes from Saliq Khan of Imperial Capital. Your line is now open. Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC : Hi, good morning, guys. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning. Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Morning. Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC : Yeah, one quick question for you is : with your increasing presence within the emerging markets, what are you hearing right now from your distributors and the channel partners, both about the state of the economy over there? But also, what it is that you can do to improve the relations that you have with them to be able to better penetrate the market? Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Okay, well, I'll take that one. We have excellent, excellent coverage of the emerging markets. I think the Stanley Black & Decker merger positioned us to be able to really blanket the markets with distribution coverage. And in addition to that, we've organized in a way that enables us to both get intimate local market knowledge and coverage, and at the same time be able to introduce products and make marketing moves across the entire universe of the emerging markets. So an interesting walk around them, Latin America, which is pretty significantly over-indexed for us and has been pretty difficult over the last few years for reasons that relate mostly to political instability and also the commodity bust, and the impact that that had on those markets, and of course, the FX that came along with those problems, the currency pressures. But in any event, what we see in Latin America in general is some pretty positive indications. Nothing robust at this point of time, but I would \u2013 if I were betting, I would bet that the Latin American markets are going to be, in general, better in 2017 than they have been in recent years. In the sense that Argentina with Macri and some of his reforms are starting to take root, and then you have the long drawn out Brazilian political drama with the scandals and so forth that have unseated the leader. That all is going to, I think, ultimately result in more stability and more reforms as we go forward. And then some of the traditional, stronger \u2013 the ones that have been traditionally stronger in recent years, such as Mexico, will probably continue to chug along at the rate that they have been. Don't see any major dislocation there. And then, as commodities have stabilized, the Western countries in Latin America, like Chile and Peru, seemed to have stabilized as well. So, on balance, I think the Latin American situation is pretty bright for us as we go forward. If we move over to Asia, the non-Chinese developing markets in Asia, in general, are stable to slightly positive. China is a big question mark. We don't have a tremendous amount of volume in China, but the market itself is very questionable. I think right now it's hard to really believe the data that comes out related to GDP. And what we see is Industrial is very weak in China and we see no real reason to become bullish on Industrial in China. So it's quite negative. And sooner or later I think the chickens may come home to roost in terms of the reality in China, would be my guess. And then, we just take some of the other countries like Russia, that's pretty much a crapshoot in terms of what's going to happen there. Comps are very easy right now in terms of as we go forward. But then again, what does the future portend I think the political situation there is very questionable. And then, the same is true as you get into Turkey and some of the other Middle Eastern countries. And so, that's \u2013 in India, again, we don't have much in India, but India is a good place to be right now from an economic perspective. So hopefully that's helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor of Longbow Research. You're line is now open. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Morning. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : I guess, I wanted to ask you about Europe and the 11% organic growth, pretty impressive as you pointed out against the year ago compare. Can you just unpack what's going on there for us and help us understand some of the drivers behind that? And also, maybe just talk about the extent to which expanded distribution is growing that versus same-store sales? Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Sure. Excuse me, I'll take that one. As both Jim and I mentioned in our comments, we're very, very pleased with the organic growth profile that we've seen in Europe. And frankly, this is a trend that's been going on for almost three years now. We've seen really consistent anywhere from mid to high-single digit organic growth. This quarter was 11%, so even better, and low double digits. And, I think when we look at it, it started out as some revenue synergies that came out of the Stanley and Black & Decker merger that we really were leveraging and having a positive impact in that region. Then we started getting deeper into SFS2.0 and some of the commercial excellence efforts, now we're getting into the digital components of that with digital marketing and more E-commerce activities over there. And then, you combine it with the fact that with new technologies, like Brushless as an example in the cordless power tool space, innovation that we brought to the marketplace, we've created an opportunity to fill a lot of white space within certain base of our customers. And so, we've been able to fill that white space and put forth different products. Now, the other item that I did mention was also putting the Stanley FATMAX brand on mid-price point power tools in Europe. And so, that was another opportunity that was leveraging the effect of synergies of the two companies. And Europe is probably the best example, and then maybe emerging markets after that, of a combination of the revenue synergies from the merger and then the great benefits that we're starting to see in the first couple of years from SFS2.0. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: And also, the talent. The talent that we've picked up when we did the merger with Black & Decker. I'd put my European team in Tools up against any team in the company in terms of just their passion, their commitment, their competency, and their ability to perform. So, that's a \u2013 human element is part that too. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill of Zelman and Associates. Your line is now open. Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman and Associates : Hi, good morning. Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Morning. Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman and Associates : I was hoping if you guys had a chance, on the Security side, I guess maybe particularly electronics just give us an updated view on where you think you are on some of the operational improvements, good margin this quarter and I think a good trajectory. But not sure, Don, if you kind of want to just think through not necessarily to next year but over the next couple of years. How far into the operational improvements are you? And then, if you can maybe split the comments between North America and International that would be helpful. Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Sure. So, I think we're \u2013 if you equate it to a baseball game, I think we're probably still in maybe the fourth inning at this point, related to our progress. We're very pleased, as we mentioned in our comments, mine in particular, about the progress that we're seeing in North America. Europe made great progress over the last few years, but now Europe's kind of hitting the threshold of being close to 10% profitability, and then taking it to the next step, which is closer to the low to mid-teens. That's hard to work and it takes more effort and you also have to have a continued top-line organic growth performance to get some leverage effects as well. But I think each region has made great progress. The Europe journey, the improvement has been going on a little bit longer than in North America, but I still see at this point we're probably going to end the year close to 13% profitability for the segment. Probably just under 13%. And at this stage, we still see a path for it to get to close to 15% as we communicated back at our Investor Day in May of 2015. And we're probably two to three years away from achieving that objective because we're continuing to do a lot of heavy lifting and one of the value proposition items that we see in electronics Security is the ability to really differentiate with customer service and that's what the teams have been focused on for the last year or two. But we still see a world of opportunity in that space to make it better and better, which is only going to enhance our productivity as time goes on. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Chan of Baird. Your line is now open. Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, good morning, Jim and Don. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning. Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning. Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Morning. Just wanted to ask about the retail sell-through at the Tools & Storage business, maybe excluding the FLEXVOLT launch. Some of the companies that kind of sell to the same customers have kind of noted a slower July and then trends improving as the quarter progressed. Just wondering what you saw in terms of POS and if you have any comments into the first couple of weeks of October? That would be great. Thank you. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Sure, well, our POS at large retail has literally been spectacular in the beginning of the year. Close to the 10% kind of zone for a period of time. And then as the year went on -- so let's say beginning sometime in the second quarter started to sequentially get lower, and it never really got really low and it was always positive, but it was definitely trending sequentially lower up until the FLEXVOLT launch. And at that point we've seen it begin to track sequentially higher. And where we stand on weeks of sale in total is the weeks of sale are substantially lower right now than they were last year. And, I think part of that has to do with good sell-through and increasing sell-through, maybe even beating expectations of the retailers. But, I think also there is an element of structural change that's going on with supply chains at some of the major retailers. So hopefully that gives you some color on POS and sell-through. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the call back over to Mr. Greg Waybright for any closing remarks. Greg Waybright - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Nicole, thank you. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. And obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2016 Stanley Black & Decker Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Andrew and I will be your operator for today\u2019s conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin. Greg Waybright : Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker\u2019s fourth quarter and full-year 2016 earnings call. On the call, in addition to myself is Jim Loree, our President and CEO; and Don Allan, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website, as well as on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of this morning\u2019s call will also be available beginning at 2 :00 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim and Don will review our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. And consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. As we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 1934 Act filing. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree. James Loree : Okay. Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter performance put a ribbon on a great 2016, during which the company continued its above market organic growth trajectory and delivered record operating results for EPS, cash flow, operating margin rate, and working capital turns. Before I cover the highlights for the quarter and the full-year, I want to take a moment and recap what turned out to be a tumultuous year in the external environment, characterized by some of the most profound geopolitical and economic developments around the world that we have seen in quite sometime. You might recall that, we entered 2016 in a low growth and slowing world, albeit with a relatively healthy U.S. construction market and a solid global auto market. The remaining U.S. industrial backdrop was negative. Europe was anemic, emerging markets were slowing, and increasingly volatile. We witnessed extreme government turmoil in Brazil, Venezuela, South Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines among others, a failed coup attempt in Turkey, and increasingly hawkish Russia, people continued in the Middle East, the UK voted to leave the EU, and negative interest rates were experienced across a large part of the developed world. Global currency devaluation cycle persisted, where the U.S. dollar rising to the highest level we have seen in 14 years, not to mention a brutally divisive political season here at home, amazing, and that was the abbreviated list. Against this backdrop, we delivered a record-breaking year by almost all measures. From operating margin rate to EPS to free cash flow and working capital turns, this organization reached new heights in 2016. On top of that, we rolled out the largest and most successful product launch in tool industry history the DEWALT FlexVolt system. We executed a seamless CEO transition and significantly reshaped the business portfolio towards high growth and profit expansion opportunities through the pending acquisitions of Newell Tools and the Craftsman brand. Actions which will bring with them exciting prospects for the future, which I\u2019ll touch upon shortly. But first, I\u2019d like to thank every member of our management team for their outstanding contributions and performance, while navigating through these challenging times. It is our people to whom we attribute these accomplishments and successes. It is our extraordinary dedication, passion, teamwork, and sheer will to win that makes this company so special. We entered 2017 with a great deal of optimism for what lies ahead despite the obvious uncertainties and challenges that accompany these times. Now, I\u2019ll take a moment and provide a brief recap of our fourth quarter results. Revenues were $2.9 billion, up 3% with solid organic growth of 4%, partially offset by a point of currency pressure. Tools & Storage continued to lead the way posting 7% organic growth, with positive contributions from all major geographies and SBUs, as well as a healthy boost from the rollout of FlexVolt. Security wrapped up a solid year of overall performance improvement with another quarter of margin expansion. And finally, although industrial revenues were down 4%, this was slightly better than expectations, given that our Engineered Fastening business continues to be impacted by lower volumes associated with one major electronics customer. Excluding that impact, industrial organic revenues were flat. Don will provide you with a deeper dive into business level operating performance during his remarks. EPS for the quarter was a $1.71, down 4% versus a very strong 4Q 2015, and as anticipated, higher restructuring costs, growth investments, and currency pressure more than offset good organic growth, a strong operational performance and a lower tax rate. Now, let\u2019s turn to the full-year highlights. 2016 represented another year of progress toward our long-term strategic and financial objectives. Full-year revenues were $11.4 billion, up 2% and 4% organically. Our operating margin rate expanded 20 basis points to a record 14.4%, with a strong performance, which overcame $155 million of pre-tax FX headwinds. We achieve full-year EPS of $6.51, a 10% increase over 2015, and a new high watermark for Stanley Black & Decker. Our team delivered an outstanding free cash flow performance, generating $1.14 billion in 2016, with a record 10.6 working capital turns for a free cash flow conversion rate of 118% of net income. And for those of you who have followed us over the long-term, you know that double-digit working capital turns has been a stretch goal for, at least, a decade, with legacy Stanley Works, nearly hitting the mark prior to the Black & Decker merger, and after that, we redoubled our efforts and are pleased to have reached this goal in 2016. There\u2019s logic to our fanatical drive to increase working capital turns. I\u2019d make this observation. When we began the Stanley Fulfillment System or SFS in 2006, our trailing revenue was $3.3 billion and our working capital was $700 million. If our turns should remain constant over the ensuing years, we would have begun 2017 with $2.6 billion of working capital and $11.4 billion of trailing revenues. Instead, we had only $1.1 billion of actual working capital tied up at year-end 2016. Thus, through core SFS, we freed up approximately $1.5 billion of cash over the years, about half of which was returned to shareholders and half reinvested in productive growth assets. And finally, during 2016, SFS 2.0, our enhanced operating system, which we introduced early in 2015 broke into full execution mode. Through SFS 2.0, we drove significant growth, cost efficiency, and digital transformation, the working capital performance I just mentioned and a successful global launch of FLEXVOLT, our first of its kind breakthrough innovation. The FLEXVOLT launch has been extremely well received by customers and end users, with revenues exceeding our initial plan and delivering slightly more than $100 million of revenue in just four months of 2016. We expect to more than double this in 2017 with a full-year of revenue as well as more FLEXVOLT tools to be introduced this year. And although, this is not a point forecast, we are capacitized to over $400 million in revenue. So you could expect us to be somewhere between 200 and 400. 2016 was a tremendous year for the company by almost all accounts, and 2017 is shaping up to be another one, particularly in light of SFS 2.0, as well as our recent portfolio announcements. It\u2019s been a brisk return to M&A since I took over, beginning with our acquisition of Newell Tools announced in October. We followed up in December with the announced sale of our Mechanical Locks business and then followed that a few weeks later with the agreement to purchase the Craftsman brand from Sears Holdings. I\u2019d like to take a moment now to review the acquisitions, highlight the outstanding opportunities for revenue growth and EPS accretion that this portfolio is reshaping and capital redeployment have created. The Newell Tools acquisition with its Irwin and Lenox brands and the Craftsman deal will result in the addition of three extraordinary brands to our already strong portfolio. It will extend our reach in the plumbing and electrical trades, as well as the auto mechanics channel, the power tools accessory space, and the outdoors products in garage storage markets. The net result will be a significant revenue growth opportunity through investing in the brands, innovating the products, and leveraging our global manufacturing footprint, and commercial capabilities. You can see the baseline financial impact on the chart in the lower right hand corner. We anticipate that these deals will drive a significant increase in EPS over the next 5-plus years, as they are fully integrated. They are accretive from the start and will contribute well over a $1 per share by year five. One point that I do want to address is around our current portfolio weightings and the reality that these deals increase our weighting in Tools & Storage. I stressed that from a strategic perspective, our intent is to continue to drive the overall company business model as a high-performing diversified industrial. And to that end, these transactions do not signal a deviation from that intent, but I\u2019m more reflective of the timing around when they came to market. The Newell Tools business and the Craftsman brand are highly attractive and we\u2019ve had our eyes on it for many years. And while we may have preferred that they came to market with a little more daylight between them, you played a hand that you don\u2019t when it comes to deal actionability. And accordingly, we tapped into our strong financial position to acquire these assets even if it meant being slightly overweight in Tools for a period of time. And when you think about it being overweight and a business performing on all cylinders is a kind of problem that you\u2019d like to have more of. These transactions and the exceptional growth and profit opportunities they represent, along with the existing strengths of our business, such as SFS 2.0 and FLEXVOLT, make it easy to get excited and bullish on the future here at Stanley Black & Decker. We have positioned the organization for success with a deep and seasoned leadership team, a long-standing strategic vision guiding the way, and an enhanced operating system SFS 2.0 driving improvements in organic growth and cost and asset efficiency. The combination of which leaves us poised to deliver differentiated performance in the future just as we have done in the past. And now, I will hand it over to Don Allan, who will walk you through segment performance, overall financials, and 2017 guidance. Don? Donald Allan : Thank you, Jim. Let\u2019s transition to our segment performance for the fourth quarter. Tools & Storage delivered another stellar quarter posting organic growth of 7%, with all regions and SBUs contributing. North America led the way up 8% on the back of strong performances in the retail and commercial channels, primarily driven by the continued success for the DEWALT FlexVolt roll out, as well as other new product introductions. We also saw some upside in the industrial channels for the first time in a few quarters, with a group delivering low single-digit growth due to a solid performance by Proto and several meaningful wins within our storage business. Europe delivered another quarter of above market growth coming in at 4%, which is slightly below the high single-digit trend we have been seeing from the region, but still a very healthy performance for that part of the world. Almost all European markets contributed positive growth as the continued success from the DEWALT FlexVolt launch across the region, coupled with ongoing robust commercial excellent actions within the markets, such as the relaunch of the DEWALT brand in France. We also had continued key customer wins in the UK and enhanced e-commerce initiatives across the region, that contributed to this top line performance. The emerging markets team delivered a strong quarter as well, with 7% organic growth fueled by gains in Latin America and Asia, which more than offset continued pressure in the Middle East and North America \u2013 North Africa. The Asia team posted mid-teens growth in the quarter to wrap up a year of double-digit gains and outstanding performance, as commercial excellence actions and major wins with our Stanley branded MPP power tool offerings continue to drive growth in the region. Latin America finished the year strong up high single digits, as growth in Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil more than offset the continuing pressure in Peru and Colombia. While it is probable that 2017 will bring continued volatility in emerging markets, we are encouraged by the team\u2019s performance on the ground, and their ability to execute actions quickly and effectively when presented with challenging macroeconomic conditions. We\u2019re also excited about our continued digital investments across the entire Tools & Storage business, which are well underway. As we leverage the digital excellence pillar within SFS 2.0 to enhance our connectivity to and experience with end users around the world. The Tools & Storage operating margin rate was down as expected about 40 basis points in the quarter, as currency mix and growth investments more than offset the favorable benefit of volume leverage, price, productivity and ongoing cost management. In summary, the Tools & Storage organization delivered an outstanding fourth quarter and full-year performance in 2016. We greatly appreciate their efforts and are pleased how they have positioned themselves well to maintain this momentum and repeat the success in 2017. Moving on to Security. Security wrapped up the year of meaningful forward progress, posting flat organic growth in the quarter, while continuing to improve its operating margin, up 30 basis points over the prior year quarter and up a 140 basis points for the full-year. This improvement in profitability as a result of a more disciplined approach to new commercial opportunities, coupled with continued progress and field efficiency and effectiveness. The North America and emerging market businesses grew organic revenue modestly by strong performance in emerging markets combined with solid performance in automatic doors more than offset lower commercial electronic security volumes. The business continued to improve field efficiency and profitability in the quarter and we are pleased with its continued positive trajectory. Security Europe\u2019s organic revenues were down slightly in the quarter, as installation volume declined in France and the UK, more than offset continued growth in the Nordics, Germany and Ireland. The UK continues to be impacted by a slow installation market in the financial services industry. 2016 was a year of strong operational performance for the Security segment, as a whole. The teams combined to increase the operating margin rate to approximately 13%, which was a 140 basis point improvement year-over-year. Additionally, the segment delivered a point of organic growth, as it continued to make progress towards becoming a consistent organic growth contributor. We also concluded our strategic review of this segment, paving the way for further progress toward our mid-term goals of delivering consistent low single-digit organic growth and mid-teens operating margin. Our industrial segment performed slightly ahead of expectations, down 4% organically in the quarter with our Engineered Fastening business down 2 points organically on the back of continued comp pressure from a major customer in the Electronics segment. However, absent that customer, the business was up a strong 4% in the quarter, as automotive remains healthy and the industrial business swung back to positive growth. The infrastructure platform was down 12% as pressure within our oil and gas business more than offset a solid organic performance within hydraulic tools. This is the first growth quarter in Hydraulic Tools that we\u2019ve seen in quite some time. In total, top line pressure in the industrial segment and the associated deleveraging led to an operating margin rate contraction in the quarter versus the prior year. However, the business did an admirable job of driving productivity and cost reductions to partially offset the top line declines throughout the year, bringing a healthy full year 16.5% operating margin rate despite the large macro and top line pressures experienced through 2016. All-in-all the segments wrapped 2016 in solid fashion with tools and storage exiting the year on a throughput, security reinvigorated to continue its forward progress, and the industrial segment is well poised to manage the likely lingering market and customer pressures in 2016. On top of this strong P&L performance, we were able to drive significant working capital improvement resulting in a record free cash flow performance for the year. Our full-year performance was excellent. And you can see that we generated a record $1.14 billion of free cash flow in 2016. This was driven by significant improvements in net income and working capital, which were up $83 million and $155 million respectively. With the positive impact from the timing of various other miscellaneous payments captured in the line referred to as other, more than offsetting an increase in CapEx spend. This performance resulted in a conversion rate of a 118%, well above our expectations for the year, underpinning this outperformance, for working capital turns of 10.6 times, up 1.4 turns year-over-year and a significant milestone accomplishment for the organization as we exceeded 10 turns for the first time in our company\u2019s history, a goal we had established almost a decade ago. We have a laser like approach to managing working capital within standby Stanley Black & Decker. It was a core component of our long-standing SFS operating system and it continues to be a key pillar of our enhanced SFS 2.0 operating system. On that note, we are very excited about the opportunity to drive working capital improvements within the pending Newell Tools acquisition. This will create additional cash flow benefit opportunities from working capital in the coming few years. Now let\u2019s move on to our outlook for 2017. We are targeting approximately 4% organic growth in 2017, very similar to what we experienced in 2016. And we expect our earnings per share to be from $6.85 up to $7.05, which is approximately a 7% increase versus the prior year at the midpoint. And we expect the free cash flow conversion to approximate a 100%. Note that these earnings estimates exclude the impact from our recent portfolio announcements. As these transactions closed during 2017, we will adjust our guidance accordingly. However, at this time, we believe the most appropriate view is the one we presented here today. You can see on the left hand side of the page that we expect the organic growth of 4% to generate approximately $0.45 to $0.55 of the EPS accretion. The next guidance factor is related to commodity inflation and currency headwinds. We estimate commodity inflation to be approximately $50 million to $55 million and currency headwinds will approximate $50 million based on current spot rates. These two headwinds combined are approximately $0.50 to $0.55 of EPS pressure. In terms of operating margin sensitivities for 2017 relating to our top key currency exposures, which are the Canadian dollar, the euro, the British pound, Brazilian real, and the Argentinian peso, they are actually relatively consistent with those that we just published in mid-2016. And then finally, we expect the net impact of various cost and productivity actions, which will be partially offset by higher share count to result an accretion of $0.45 to $0.50 per share, rounding out the $6.85 to $7.05 guide. I would also like to review three miscellaneous guidance matters. First, we continue to anticipate approximately $50 million of core restructuring charges, which is very close to our running average for the last few years. Second item is we are forecasting approximately 151 million of shares outstanding for 2017, and finally we expect the first quarter earnings to be slightly below 17% of the full-year performance, which is below the prior year percentage, but that is due to higher level of restructuring in the first quarter, higher currency, and higher shares as well. So let\u2019s turn to the segment outlook on the right side of the page. We expect tools and storage to post mid-single-digit organic growth in 2017. This will be driven by strong geographic performance in most regions around the world with share gains expected to continue in the U.S., Europe, and Emerging Markets. We anticipate that the DEWALT FlexVolt battery system will continue to be highly successful in 2017 accounting for approximately 1.5 points for the incremental growth. As it relates to profitability, we expect the tools and storage business to deliver an improvement in its margin rate year-over-year in-spite of the previously mentioned commodity inflation and FX pressure that will predominantly impact this segment. The security segment will continue its positive performance trajectory in 2017 hosting low single digit organic growth, and driving its operating margin rate higher through operating leverage gains, cost containment, and productivity actions. With the strategic review concluded for this segment, the business teams are looking forward to continuing their performance momentum into 2017 and beyond. We expect to deliver profitability improvements in both Europe and the U.S., while also making solid progress on the organic growth front. Over time as we have previously stated, we believe that this business has the potential to be a solid and consistent organic grower, approaching the low end of our 4% to 6% total company target range, while delivering a mid-teens operating margin rate. 2017 should be another year of progress towards that goal. Finally, we expect the industrial segment to post a low single-digit organic decline for the year and to improve its operating margin rate through cost actions productivity and strategic SG&A management. While the overall automotive business within engineered fashion remains healthy, we still have some residual comp issues related to one major electronics customer, and we expect some continuing modest pressure within the industrial channel to content with. Within the infrastructure platform, we expect that slight improvements within the hydraulic tools business will be more than offset by top line pressures in oil and gas, which continues to see little to no new activity in the offshore space and limited projects onshore in 2017. We hope this deal of the business and improves based on some of the recent actions, which have occurred at the federal government level. In total, we expect the sum of these performances to translate into a slight top line decline with room to the upside should one or more of the underlying markets rebound in 2017. I want to spend a minute now going through some additional details related to the recent business development activities that Jim touched on earlier. As I stated earlier, the financial impact of these transactions is not included in the guidance I just provided. In October, we announced the acquisition of Newell Tools, including the highly priced Lenox and Irwin brands for a 1.95 billion purchase price. This deal marked the end of our nearly three-year M&A hiatus, during which time we significantly enhanced our operating model and organizational capacity, while driving meaningful improvements in organic growth and profitability. The Newell Tools transaction materially enhances our presence in the power tools accessories space, while also expanding our footprint in the plumbing and electronic trades. These areas are core adjacencies for Stanley Black & Decker and there is a rich opportunity to drive significant cost and revenue synergies in the near term by leveraging the same operating techniques that made the Black & Decker deal so incredibly valuable, albeit, this will be on a smaller scale. The transaction has cleared HSR review in the U.S. and is pending certain non-US regulatory approvals. It is expected to close within the first quarter. EPS accretion, excluding charges is expected to be approximately $0.20 to $0.25 in 2017 assuming this closing date occurs in the first quarter. In December, we announced the conclusion of our strategic review of the security segment. We decided to retain the commercial electronic and automatic door businesses and sell the majority of our mechanical lock business to dormakaba for $725 million. This reflects the healthy EBITDA multiple of approximately 14 times. The transaction will be extremely tax efficient with net proceeds expected to be approximately $700 million. As we noted at the time, we believe there is tremendous opportunity to grow and innovate within the commercial electronic and automatic door spaces. These businesses have a very natural and organic fit together with the latter providing an important vehicle to host certain technological innovations, which are a key component of our differentiated electronic monitoring value proposition. In addition to the otherwise attractive and under penetrated market it serves. However, given the suboptimal side and sale of our Mechanical Locks business the value it attracted in the market and the tremendous business development opportunities at hand it became fairly obvious to us that redeploying this capital was the best way to maximize value creation for our shareholders. Once we made that decision we went to work very quickly to ensure that successful achievement of that outcome. We expect the sale to close in the first quarter of 2017 and to be dilutive to 2017 earnings of approximately $0.15 to $0.20 EPS. Assuming Q1 closing for both of these transactions, on a combined basis they will be accreted by $0.05 to the 2017 EPS guidance I just communicated. Finally, we kicked off 2017 with the exciting news that we have reached an agreement with Sears Holdings to purchase the iconic Craftsman brand. This deal gives us the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and sell Craftsman brand of product in all non-Sears Holdings channel worldwide. The purchase price is comprised of two cash payments one at closing and one at year three a $525 million and $250 million respectively. Plus it has a series of annual payments from year 3 to year 15 for an estimated total present value of purchase price of approximately $900 million. We expect this transaction to drive approximately $100 million of average annual growth or between 50 basis points to 100 basis points of organic growth year end and year out for the next decade. The closing is expected to occur during 2017, EPS accretion will be approximately $0.10 to $0.15 in year one, excluding charges and then increasing to approximately $0.35 to $0.45 by year five and then eventually to approximately $0.70 to $0.80 by year 10. One final point on the Craftsman deal, we have received a number of questions regarding the limited lifetime warranty that customers of Craftsman products enjoy today. Our intent to keep this warranty intact assuming we are successful with our purchase of the Craftsman brand. So as you can see there\u2019s a lot to be excited about going into 2017 and beyond. And with that, I\u2019ll hand it back over to Jim, for the summary. James Loree : Thanks, Don. Yes warranty is a big part of the essence of the Craftsman brand and it will continue to do so as you point out in the future. So in summary, 2016 was a really good year for Stanley Black & Decker. Solid organic growth of 4% and a strong operating performance combined to deliver new records for EPS cash flow operating margin rate, and working capital turns. The DEWALT FlexVolt launch is a great story and it is still early days. All signs point to that momentum growing throughout 2017 and well into the future. In addition to the organic successes we reentered the M&A sphere in a decisive and exciting way announcing the acquisitions of Newell tools and Craftsman. We adhere to our strategic principles by objectively evaluating our security business ultimately deciding to divest Mechanical Locks. We executed a tax efficient transaction to do so at a great price enabling us to monetize the asset and redeploy the capital into higher growth profitability activities. Finally we\u2019ve established 2017 guidance for EPS within a range of $6.85 to $7.05, a 7% increase at the midpoint on a solid 4% organic growth outlook. And that is without any net accretion from the announced transactions, which will be significant and additive when the deals close later in the year. And I\u2019d like to make the point that much has been made of the FX and inflation headwinds that we are facing in 2017. Our view is that this is the best setup that we\u2019ve had in three to four years the time when we overcame $400 million to $500 million of FX headwinds. And during that period we have maintained a consistent record of meeting or beating expectations and we see that record continuing in 2017. We expect to maintain the momentum we built in 2016 as we carry forward into this year with a FlexVolt launch still in the early stages, the security business reenergized and moving forward SFS 2.0 in full swing and the anxiously awaited additions of Newell Tools and Craftsman. 2017 promises to be another inspiring and rewarding year for Stanley Black & Decker. We remain humble and committed to driving exceptional shareholder value again in 2017. Thank you for your support and Greg we\u2019re now ready for questions. Greg Waybright : Great, thanks, Jim. Andrew we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen the question-and-answer queue is now open. [Operator Instructions] First question for the day will be coming from the line of Tim Wojs from Baird. Your line is open. Timothy Wojs : Hey, guys good morning. Nice job on a quarter. James Loree : Good morning. Donald Allan : Good morning. James Loree : Thank you. Timothy Wojs : I guess just on the Tools business, could you start just by helping us a little bit with the teams through the year. I know you have a little tougher comparisons in the first-half versus the second-half. And how we should think about FX in the raw material inflation kind of hitting margins through the year? James Loree : Sure. We\u2019ll start with the organic revenue kind of \u2013 if you prefer to do a cadence by quarter, I won\u2019t go quarter-by-quarter. But I think if you think about, kind of a mid single-digit organic growth for the full-year, we actually think that the first-half will be pretty strong and be slightly above that 5%, as we have things like positive momentum on FlexVolt and some other introductions and innovations that are occurring. And then as we get closer to the end of the year, fourth quarter, particular the number probably would be slightly below 5%, that\u2019s probably a directional trend that you can look at. As far as currency, we see a lot of that currency happening in the first-half and a much lesser amount occurring in the back-half of the year. And then the commodity side of things will be more evenly paid throughout the year. We\u2019ll have less lumpiness to it, because a lot of that is really things that are \u2013 trend that we\u2019ve seen emerge in the back-half of 2016 and then based on the way that a lot of our contracts are laid out that we\u2019re rolling off in the first-half of the year. So I would say more of an even facing of that, but maybe a little bit of a tick up in the back-half. Timothy Wojs : Great. Well, good luck on 2017. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeffrey Todd Sprague : Thank you. Good morning. James Loree : Good morning. Donald Allan : Good morning. Jeffrey Todd Sprague : Jim, I\u2019d like to pick up towards the end of your closing comments, which were kind of more strategic portfolio in nature. These tools assets obviously are in the sweets spot and that you wanted to think that makes them look so attractive here. And it sounds like some of your stuff was on your radar screen, as you think about what we said about diversifying the portfolio or kind of going down other portfolio vectors, do you have a good sense of where you want to go, not expecting to name assets. But are there things on a chess board somewhere in your office so to speak that are a little bit of a roadmap, or is this something that would be more opportunistic over time? James Loree : Well, I\u2019d like to think it was as sophisticated as a chess board. But yes, we have some ideas. The first thrust is to continue to strengthen the franchises all three of the major franchises that we have, so security, industrial and tools. And that\u2019s \u2013 logically why we \u2013 these assets and tools came up, we pounced, because they do make tremendous sense as consolidating transactions for us, and in effect, particularly the Newell Tools been kind of a bolt-on type \u2013 and the Craftsman being more of an organic growth machine. So when \u2013 part of this is when transactions become available in the segments that we\u2019re in, we take serious looks. And so, for instance, in Engineered Fastening, we love to acquire something. We love that business. We don\u2019t particularly like the \u2013 how the electronics part of it has played out. But that\u2019s relatively small piece of it and that will be \u2013 and getting smaller as the days go on. But the automotive piece and then there\u2019s an Aerospace segment within Engineered Fastening that we are very underweight in. That \u2013 these types of businesses that are similar to Engineered Fastening same or similar to an Engineered Fastening. So a lot of application engineering upfront, good high value added for the customer base, recurring revenue stream, and in some cases even an after-market. That that type of a business model is something that we said that we like a lot. And so if something were to come up in Engineered Fastening or on the periphery, that would be quite interesting to us. In oil and gas, the \u2013 I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever see oil and gas as a large percentage of the company. But there are some assets in oil and gas that might be attractive, especially to the extent that they enable us to diversify using some of the technologies that we are in today to diversify outside to \u2013 into process industries and maybe repair and service for some of the infrastructure in oil and gas and related areas. So that could be interesting. I think other theme that you\u2019ll see over time is, as we develop that flexible technology, it\u2019s going to become obvious that there\u2019s some acquisitions that enable us to really as we go up the power curve to exploit that technology to its fullest potential So those are all things that we think about and we\u2019ll see. We have a pretty ambitious growth goal here to double the size of the company by 2022. And we\u2019re going to need something on the order of $5 plus-billion worth of acquisitions supplement to the organic growth to get there. And so I think you\u2019ll see not, not anything in the near-term, because we\u2019re in the process of digesting what we\u2019ve already done here. But as we get into 2018, 2019, and so on, you\u2019re liable to see something in one of those areas that I just touched upon or more. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Jason Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and nice quarter. James Loree : Thank you. Good morning. Michael Jason Rehaut : My question is around Newell. I believe, you laid out in the presentation $0.20 to $0.25 of accretion in 2017 and that\u2019s assuming the first quarter closing, I\u2019m sorry, yes, first quarter closing. And I believe that\u2019s better than your initial guidance of $0.15 for the full first year. So I was wondering if you could talk about what was driving that, if I have those numbers right? And also if I could sneak in a clarification on how Mac Tools did growth wise during the quarter? Thanks. James Loree : Sure. So, yes, there\u2019s a change in the Newell Tools estimate. It really has to do with the financing-related activities primarily. And we \u2013 in the initial estimates, we had assumed some longer-term debt that we would put in place, short-term debt as well. But given some of the things that have occurred and how strong our free cash flow performance was exiting the year and our view on cash flow for 2017, we don\u2019t see the need for the long-term financing right now. And therefore, the interest costs related to that transaction will be dramatically lower, not only in 2017, but on an ongoing basis. So it really kind of jumpstarts the accretion in year one and gives us an extra $0.05 to $0.10 related to that particular item. As far as Mac Tools goes, they had a solid quarter with mid single-digit organic growth, and was pretty much in line with our expectation. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O\u2019Callaghan from UBS. Your line is open. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Good morning, guys. James Loree : Good morning. Donald Allan : Good morning. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Hey, just on the industrial business, obviously, a lot of \u2013 on the top line a lot of moving parts there going into next year with, I guess, still a little bit of electronics drag, curious when that kind of finally ends. And then what are you assuming, I guess, in the plan for Dakota, given \u2013 how much of a drag have you baked in, and does it assuming it comes back at all? And then maybe just comment on the fourth quarter margins there \u2013 were down pretty sharply year-over-year? Thanks. James Loree : Yes. So the \u2013 I would say, if you start with the Electronics business and Engineered Fastening, yes, we\u2019re probably going to see, it\u2019s about a $20 million drag here in 2017 on revenue from that business and specific that customer that we referred to get down to a number on an annual basis around $50 million, maybe $45 million in that kind of range. So, as Jim mentioned, it\u2019s becoming a much smaller component of that business on a go-forward basis, which from our perspective is a good thing. The other thing I would say a little bit and the other topic, your question you had on oil and gas in Dakota, we\u2019re pretty much done. We don\u2019t have any really any new revenue opportunity associated with that. We were part of the pipeline constructed leading up to what occurred over this summer and to the fall. And so there\u2019s really not a lot of new revenue opportunity for us on that particular pipeline. And then you meant, you also had a question of profitability of the overall segment. It was really impacted by what I touched on, which was clearly there\u2019s a deleveraging effect of the top line impacted, just we\u2019re not able to take enough actions to offset that impact and that\u2019s really the main driver of it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeremie Capron from CLSA. Your line is open. Jeremie Capron : Thanks and good morning, all. James Loree : Good morning, Jeremie. Jeremie Capron : I wanted to ask about your import situation in the U.S., we talked about that on the call following the announcement of the Newell acquisition that gives you a little more leeway there probably to shift some production into the U.S., but as we try to quantify your net importer situation into the U.S., can you help us understand what it amounts to today? Thank you. James Loree : Yes we import a lot into the United States, there is no question about that. That\u2019s pretty much the standard model in the tool industry, which is an important model into developing countries for the most part. Now, we have differentiated ourselves over the past few years by ramping up our U.S. presence much more aggressively than our competition has. And so today we have 3,000 employees manufacturing tools in the United States and 11 plants and we\u2019ve always had a fairly significant manufacturing infrastructure in the U.S. selling into the U.S., but it is getting bigger and it\u2019s going to get even bigger because whether or not any of those proposed concepts are implemented or not, it\u2019s making more sense to have that U.S. presence because in the market the folks that are buying the tools, the end-users really like those tools that are made in the United States for US tradesmen and so on. So you\u2019ll see a continued growth in our U.S. manufacturing base with the Craftsman deal, we\u2019re going to open up a new plant in the United States location to be determined, it\u2019s going to be very highly technologically equipped so that it can produce the highest quality tools at the best cost in the world, and we\u2019re excited about that, it will become a showcase plan and when you look at the competition in the industry they are all going to play catch up. There is one other company, I mentioned this on the Craftsman call that is a competitor of ours, but not in the core of our business, but in the auto mechanics and industrial business, they compete with us. They also have a great U.S. manufacturing infrastructure. The rest of them are going to be playing catch up. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo, your line is open. Rich M. Kwas: Hi good morning. James Loree : Good morning. Rich M. Kwas: Two quick questions. Jim strategic, kind of follow-up to Jeff\u2019s question as you think about M&A, a lot on your plate here, as we think about 2017 and 2018 what are the chances that we see kind of smaller bolt ons added as we get later in the year and early 2018, how would you couch that and then Don, question on productivity in terms of the savings from restructuring that have been done over the last couple of years are those included in that $0.45, $0.50 of savings for this year and then the other quick question is buyback, what\u2019s \u2013 the 1.51 is a little higher than you are looking for, I assume there is some incremental buy back that could occur over the course of this year, but any additional thoughts there? Thanks. James Loree : Well let Don start with the two questions that you gave him and then I\u2019ll hit the acquisition question. Donald Allan : Yes, we will start with the cost actions and productivity. And as I had mentioned in my comments, we have had about $50 million of restructuring charges per year for almost last three years now, and so yes there certainly is, when you look at the $0.55 and $0.60 of positive accretion from cost actions and productivity there is a carryover effect to that. I would say it\u2019s probably 10%, maybe of that number, 15% in that range, it\u2019s not a large part of it, but I would remind everybody that we have been very proactive in our cost reduction programs for quite some time and in particular over the last two years as we dealt with all this currency pressure, and Jim mentioned the number close to 400 million over the last two years. We certainly got some price benefits, offset to that, but it was only about a third of how much we are able to offset. So, we had two thirds of all that that we had to find a way to more than offset to grow our earnings and a lot of those where through cost actions that we\u2019ve done either through continued productivity actions in our supply chain and getting productivity levels up to 5%, 6% in some cases depending on the business and then just ongoing SG&A what I would call healthy restructuring that occurs. And then this year, we\u2019re going to continue that activity like we have been doing because we\u2019ve got nice momentum. We\u2019ve also got functional transformation occurring that will begin to reap some benefit benefits of that here in 2017, something we started talking about almost 2 years ago now. And so that is a positive, so, and the $50 million of restructuring that we\u2019re going to utilize in 2017 will help drive some of those benefits as well. So, I think we\u2019ve positioned ourselves well over the next three years to be focused on balancing where we take cost out and then where we also implement cost to make investments to stimulate more growth and that\u2019s really what you\u2019re seeing here. On the second question related to shares outstanding, we have not assumed any type of buyback in our number at this point. The increase reflects the impact of the hybrid that matured in the fourth quarter of 2016 about 3 million of share impact year-over-year. We will see how the year progresses, as far as cash flow, but at this point we think our cash is pretty much focused on paying for the M&A activity and we don\u2019t have a lot of excess cash to focus on share repurchase, but if we do a little better than we expect there is certainly an opportunity for us to do that. James Loree : Okay and then as it relates to bolt-ons, as Don said there isn\u2019t all lot of cash to start with left after the \u2013 capacity left after the deals that we\u2019ve announced, but I would say if we were to see some bolt-ons \u2013 smaller ones as you point out aggregating no more than 100 to 200, you know that might be a possibility that would be played against the buybacks so that\u2019s kind of where we are. We think our our culture as bold and agile, but yet thoughtful and disciplined and I think we\u2019ve demonstrated the bold and the agile part and the thoughtful part and the discipline part as it relates to the negotiation of these transactions and the deal execution and now we need to demonstrate that as it relates to the integration part of it. So, it will not make a whole lot of sense to do anything in addition to what we\u2019ve done this year in a large scale, and we\u2019ll get the integration is right, we\u2019ll get the Newell Tools safely assimilated into our company, and providing the accretion we will get Craftsman get that growth trajectory going that we\u2019ve committed to, and then in 2018, and thereabouts 2019 whatever the right time is we will be back with something bigger in all likelihood. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley, your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks good morning guys. First of all, I want to say congratulations on getting the $0.10 that there aren\u2019t too many manufacturers at that kind of level, so really well done there. James Loree : Thank you. Nigel Coe : So, I guess I\u2019m asking this question on FlexVolt, sounds like from your guidance you gave on, we are on track for $100 million of incremental sell-in in 2017, can you maybe just mark us on what you achieved in 2016, and then maybe some commentary around where we are on the launch geographically and by products, and any early reads on how the launch is impacting the potential conversation of quarter products and pricing commentary would be helpful as well? James Loree : Yes Nigel it is Jim. I\u2019ll take the bigger picture part of that and if Don wants to supplement it with some commentary that would be fine. The flexible initiative, so as you pointed out sold a $100 million in four months and a lot of that was selling, but there was a fair amount of sell-out to, and it\u2019s been extremely well received by the end user community and this is all about speed to establishing an install base as it relates to the competition because the tools, the batteries are backwards compatible in the DEWALT tools, so it\u2019s complementary to our installed base. And where we are really trying to attack is at the competitors install base. And so think of FlexVolt as a battery system that is establishing an install base as aggressively and quickly as possible that requires DEWALT tools to operate and then think of every year a wave of new tools skews coming in that will enhance the substitution of coated products and the ability for us to substitute coated products in the higher voltage, higher power requirements, higher duty cycle type skews. And if you think of it that way, I think it\u2019s helpful because then you will understand it really is, well there is going to be some cannibalization of our own coated tools, it really is a market share gain mechanism that has enormous potential event at the voltage levels we are at today. And we haven\u2019t even talked about going up the voltage curve or the power curve, which we have the capability to do as we develop this technology. And that breakthrough innovation that we\u2019re working on will have some more surprises I\u2019m sure, positive surprises in the future. Don? Donald Allan : Yes, I would just add that related to 2017 your comment is correct Nigel, we do see another $100 million of incremental revenue that is included in our guidance. Jim however did discuss in his comments that we have capacity up to $400 million. So, in total we have $200 million in our numbers with incremental of a $100 million next year so there\u2019s capacity to take on another $200 million. The $100 million makes sense to us right now based on it\u2019s too early to really know what the cannibalization is going to be. And that\u2019s something we\u2019ll watch closely, but if the cannibalization is not as high then there\u2019s certainly a possibility that we\u2019re somewhere between that $200 million to $400 million number as the year progresses combined with some of the factors that that Jim just mentioned. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Your line is open. Robert Barry : Hey, guys good morning. James Loree : Good morning. Robert Barry : So, I wanted to begin to the tools growth and the outlook, it feels like the growth outlook keeps creeping down a little bit. I think at 3Q it was a little below seven and a conference in December five to six that\u2019s now mid-single, which feels like five to me. So, I\u2019m curious what\u2019s driving that, what sounds like incremental caution. And maybe it helps to comment on 4Q and just clarify, if you sold a $100 million of FlexVolt in four months, I\u2019m assuming three quarters of that would be in a 4Q that\u2019s about four points of growth there. I think right I mean doesn\u2019t seem like it leaves a whole lot of room for organic ex-FlexVolt on what was a fairly easy comp, so maybe some color there on the growth outlook in tools. Thanks. Donald Allan : Yes, I\u2019ll give you some color on the outlook, remember back in October earnings call, I gave a framework for 2017, which was total growth of 4% for the company. And I gave a little color by segment with, I indicated tools of mid-single digit. So that would be whatever you want to be somewhere between 4% and 6% that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve been seeing for the last 100 plus days. And so I don\u2019t \u2013 not sure what you\u2019re referring to specifically other than the 7% was our performance in 2016. And so that\u2019s certainly, maybe there is a an aspect of that that I\u2019m just clarifying, but we feel pretty good about that and our view going into the year that\u2019s the right place to be at this stage. As far as FlexVolt, yes we had about $50 million, $60 million of FlexVolt in the fourth quarter. And as Jim said part of that was booked the continued loading, but part of it was also sell-through. And so there\u2019s the combination of factors there so that certainly contributed to the 7.3% organic growth that we saw in the fourth quarter, but there\u2019s still a very strong underlying growth excluding that as well that\u2019s been driven by all the other activities that I mentioned in my comments related to Tools & Storage segment. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks, good morning guys. James Loree : Good morning. Donald Allan : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : So meaning to sign a parse out 1Q a little bit more yes it\u2019s helpful to get the buckets. But can you quantify the year-over-year impact from higher restructuring in FX in 1Q. And then secondly if you realize commodities are going to be a headwind for a lot of industrial companies in 2017, but maybe talk a little bit about what type of pricing you think you can get as well as we progress through the year? Donald Allan : Yes. So Q1 I would fear for your modeling purposes for restructuring I would say, I would use about half of the $50 million in Q1. So, we expect to move a fair amount of activity to get really to help drive some of the benefits that I talked about in guidance of the cost reduction and productivity action. So that\u2019s certainly is a large number that impacts the EPS in Q1 and why it\u2019s a lower percentage for the full-year. I would exclude that and kind of look at the underlying performance without that effect that\u2019s more just based on decisions they we\u2019re making and not operationally focused. The other thing is on a currency it\u2019s very close to $20 million incremental impact in Q1 and so those two items combined with a little bit of pressure from the shares, higher share count in the first quarter is why you\u2019re seeing that type of EPS number for Q1. And pricing actions, we are always looking for surgical pricing actions. We\u2019ve been doing that for over a decade now in our company. It take in our Tools & Storage business that team is very much focused on what they can do at a very specific level or at the product level or product family level depending on the situation and we make decisions on what the right pricing decisions are that are both price increases in some cases on occasion price decreases that might be necessary for certain products. But overall, looking how they get a price increase. Commodity inflation certainly offers up an opportunity to talk about price increases, but the reality is $50 million to our whole company in a full-year is really not large enough at this point to make a large case for a broad price increase. But it certainly is something that we utilize and we go through and do the surgical analysis of pricing by product to help make the decision of what is the right price point for a specific product. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is open. David MacGregor : Yes, good morning and congressional on a good progress. James Loree : Thank you. David MacGregor : The question is on Craftsman. And I wondered if you could just talk about the white space opportunity, and any reference you can make to sizing would be helpful? And also, how much control do you have over what Sears does with the brand with respect to pricing promotion? James Loree : We have zero control over what Sears does with respect to pretty much anything. And that\u2019s part of the rationale for why we think this is a deal that is pro-competitive and should be able to pass through the competitive review. So as far as the growth trajectory, we start off with $100 million or thereabouts of business that we actually acquire as part of the transaction and then the rest is up to us. So there are \u2013 we have a tremendous commercial capability in this company that can span all the channels in the Tool business. And Craftsman is kind of a unique brand in the sense that it plays in the auto mechanics channel, the industrial channel, the professional tradesmen, the DIY type of user, it\u2019s \u2013 the \u2013 one of the broadest brands in Tools. And so, our approach is going to be to partner up with our big box customer \u2013 partners and make sure that we exploit that channel. We are going to try to partner up with a large e-commerce company and make it available broadly through e-commerce. And we think that\u2019s an exciting growth opportunity. It\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s one customer that I\u2019m referring to will tell you that Craftsman power tools is the single biggest unfulfilled search that it has. And so, we\u2019re excited about that. And then we have our automotive repair channel nut tools that we would expect to carry the Craftsman brand on in some form at some point. So lots of different approaches what we\u2019ve committed to in the pro forma was $100 million a year of growth. So over a ten-year period, getting to pretty much a straight line \u2013 on a straight line basis getting to a $1 billion over that period and we hope that we can do better than that. But we think that\u2019s a very, very doable development curve. Donald Allan : I would just enhance Jim\u2019s comment on what control we have, we did, is right, we have zero control. But they do need to meet certain quality standards for use of the brand. And so that is part of the band license, so it\u2019s not to say control, but it is a standard that we wanted to have in place to ensure the quality of the products are at the right level. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Your line is open. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning, guys. James Loree : Good morning. Donald Allan : Good morning. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Just to pull the thread on FlexVolt a little bit more, I think you\u2019ve spoken many times about, getting over the curve in terms of factory utilization. And when should we think about the bridge to that being accretive to the total Tools margins versus, I would pursue still just based on the way you\u2019ve laid out the cadence for EPS probably still dilutive in the first-half of the year? James Loree : Yes, it is. I mean, so based on our \u2013 what\u2019s in our guidance that would be dilutive in the first-half, gets \u2013in the back-half still probably marginally dilutive based on the current forecast. Now, if we start getting levels above $200 million, and we\u2019re approaching $400 million, that\u2019s going to change the margin picture dramatically. So that that\u2019s a factor that we have not assumed in our guidance. So it\u2019s a bit of a double positive that we get the extra revenue impact that we\u2019d also get the leverage impact of somewhere \u2013 going somewhere between $200 million to $400 million in revenue. Joshua Pokrzywinski : And I guess related to that, what is the expectation for sell-in versus sell-through in that incremental $100 million this year? James Loree : Well, the vast majority of it, we would expect it to be probably sell-through and \u2013 but we\u2019ll see as the year progress. We certainly have a little bit of a load in happening here in the first quarter. But where is the stage now, where we\u2019re restocking and we would hope that that a lot of that would be sell-through. Donald Allan : Yes, the skews will be sell-in and some... James Loree : That\u2019s a good point later in the year. Donald Allan : But our new skews would be sell-in. James Loree : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Liam Burke from Wunderlich. Your line is open. Liam Burke : Thank you. Good morning, Jim. Good morning, Don. James Loree : Good morning. Donald Allan : Good morning. Liam Burke : Jim, you highlighted that in the hand Tools & Storage business, the industrial had a good quarter. You \u2013 in the Q&A, you discussed that Mac Tools was up single digits, mid single digits. Mac Tools though has been strong for the last several quarters. Is there anything else industrial that perform particularly well? James Loree : Well, the industrial business itself showed \u2013 within Tools showed signs of life, really had a positive quarter in a long, long time, two years. So I think that that goes under the Proto and the FACOM brands. They did quite well. And so it does look like we potentially have hit an inflection point with the \u2013 with that kind of MRO type markets. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this now concludes our question-and-answer session for today. So I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Waybright for closing remarks. Greg Waybright : Andrew, thanks. We would like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call, and obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for your participation in today\u2019s conference call. This now concludes the program and you may all disconnect at this time. Everyone have a great day.",

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chelsey and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin. Greg Waybright : Thank you, Chelsey. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. On the call in addition to myself is Jim Loree, our President and CEO; Don Allan, our Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, our Executive Vice President and President of our Global Tools & Storage Business. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website as well as on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 :00 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim and Don will review our first quarter 2017 results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session and consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. As we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree. Jim? Jim Loree : Thanks Greg and good morning everyone. As you saw the first quarter was an excellent start to 2017. All our businesses came out of the gate strong with each contributing to our robust 5% organic growth for the quarter. Revenues were $2.8 billion, up 5% versus prior year on strong organic growth. Tools & Storage continued to lead the way up 6% in the quarter with all regions contributing. Industrial posted a large positive top-line surprise with 4% organic growth on strong automotive system sales in Engineered Fastening and solid performance from the Infrastructure businesses which are finally beginning to see signs of life in their various end markets. This is an eight point positive sequential swing for the segment. And while it's still too early to conclude definitively, we're cautiously optimistic that we may begin to see the positive trend continue as the year progresses. Don will provide some more color on that when he goes through the segment details and our updated 2017 outlook in a few minutes. Finally, our Security business started the year off right posting 1% organic growth in line with our expectations. It was good to see the top-line expansion driving impressive operating leverage throughout the P&L expanding our operating margin rate by 110 basis points to a record first quarter rate of 14.2% excluding M&A related charges. This reflects our consistent focus on operational excellence as evidenced by a 160 basis point increase in our gross margin rate overcoming an adverse impact from currency and some commodity inflation. Diluted adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.29, as strong operating performance, more than offset the aforementioned currency and commodity headwinds, higher restructuring charges as well as an unplanned event based environmental charge related to a pre-merger closed facility. On top of these excellent financial results, we also closed three major capital allocation transactions in the quarter. Finalizing our acquisition of new tools, our acquisition of the craftsman brand, as well as the divestiture of our commercial hardware business, which I'll address in more detail in just a moment. Finally, based on the strong start and our improved outlook for the Industrial businesses, we are raising our 2017 full-year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 to $7.08 to $7.28. This is inclusive of the previously disclosed impact of the three transactions I just mentioned and will be covered by Don later during his remarks. Turning to our recent portfolio activity and what made for a very busy quarter here, the Newell Tools acquisition with the iconic Lenox and Irwin brands closed on March 10, the day after the Craftsman deal closed. As you would expect our experienced integration teams are up and running full speed on the Newell integration and building out the Craftsman brand. On Craftsman the majority of our efforts are now focused on supply chain activities to initially support sales into non-Sears Holding channels. In parallel, we are developing commercial strategies for the brand and remain very excited about the potential growth opportunities. We continue to see a clear path towards annual growth of approximately $100 million a year for the next decade. Our initial conviction has only been reaffirmed since closing, as numerous customer interactions continue to substantiate our growth assumptions. This is reinforced by the powerful name recognition and consumer buying intent associated with the Craftsman brand. Suppliers are also positive about the opportunity to participate in reinvigorating the growth of this iconic brand. As expected, there is a lot of excitement and positive energy around our stated intention of bringing manufacturing for the Craftsmen brand back to the United States. Our plans for a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility are starting to take shape, so look for more to come on this front in the coming quarters. And as previously we expect the Craftsman brand transaction to generate approximately $0.08 of earnings accretion in 2017 excluding charges buildings of $0.35 to $0.45 accretion by year five. On Newell Tools our focus is now on integrating employees, suppliers, and customers into our existing operations. The team is focused on achieving the substantial cost synergies identified during due diligence. And as a reminder, we expect to achieve $80 million to $90 million in cost synergies with this deal, and will also soon begin tapping into the significant revenue synergy opportunities. Overall customer feedback has been extremely positive with many customers voicing a desire to expand the relationship and add new product lines. Work is well underway to accommodate these expansions including new distribution channels for the Lenox and Irwin brands into previously underserved markets where Stanley Black & Decker has a strong and established footprint. We continue to expect Newell Tools earnings accretion of approximately $0.24 per share in 2017, excluding charges, building to approximately $0.80 by year five. So as you can tell, we are excited about the prospects for these acquisitions, both for the strategic benefits as well as their financial impact. Regarding the total company, we believe we are set up well for a strong 2017. As always, we benefit from our deep and agile leadership team, our commitment to and focus on operational execution and our robust SFS 2.0 operating system. We're also benefiting from relatively stable exchange rates and for the first time in four years, we are not facing escalating FX headwinds at this stage of the year. The result is a healthy start to 2017 with a focus on maintaining the momentum behind our organic growth and margin expansion efforts, while also tapping into the significant value opportunities presented by Newell Tools and the Craftsman brand acquisitions. I'll now turn it over to Don for a more detailed discussion of first quarter results. Don? Don Allan : Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. I would like to take a deeper dive into our business segments, which all performed very well in the first quarter. Tools & Storage revenue was up 9% in the quarter, as 6% organic growth and four points of acquisitive growth were offset by a point of currency pressure. The operating margin for this segment was up an impressive 16% year-over-year to 16.4% operating margin, as the Group achieved strong operating leverage and a solid top-line growth. Each Tools & Storage region and SBU posted positive organic growth in the quarter. On a geographic basis, North America led the way and was up 8%. This strong performance was due to our U.S. commercial and retail channels which were up low-double-digits and high-single-digits respectively. Additionally, Canada posted solid organic growth of around 10%. New product introductions and successful field conversions drove growth in the commercial channel. Strong e-commerce volumes and continued momentum from the FlexVolt launch, field growth in the U.S. retail channel as we did overcome some modest channel inventory tightening. We expect the momentum surrounding FlexVolt which by the way did meet expectations for the quarter will be maintained and bolstered by our commercial teams launch strategy, which has a well-designed roadmap of promotions and new FlexVolt tool and accessory SKUs hitting the shelves regularly over the next few years. North American POS data remains healthy throughout the quarter, as it was up high-single-digits. This is particularly impressive given we were comping a mid-teen POS growth rate in the first quarter of 2016. The above-market growth trend in Europe continued in the quarter, with the region posting 6% organic growth. The outperformance was widespread across the region with almost all markets contributing. The European team continues to provide picture perfect examples of commercial excellence at its finest driving mid-teens growth on average among its top 10 customers in the quarter. Additionally, in the first quarter, we continue to see customer wins in the UK and strong market share gains in Italy and Iberia. Finally, the emerging markets were up 1% organically, as solid performances in Latin America and Asia were weighed down by continuing but improving pressure in the Middle East and North Africa. We are undergoing a transition to a direct model in Turkey which will weigh on growth within that region for the first few quarters but should ultimately provide a much better mid to long run opportunity in that country. Performance in Latin America was mixed with double-digit growth in Mexico, Brazil, and Ecuador more than offsetting declines in Colombia and Argentina. Asia delivered strong performances in Korea and Japan which more than offset pressure we saw in Thailand and in the Philippines. The diligent pricing actions that we've been taking as well as the ongoing MPP launch across the developing markets is continuing to drive growth. Just one last comment on emerging markets. We are really beginning to see a lot of excitement from our customers around the potential future Irwin and Lenox rollout, more to come on that later this year. Within the SBUs, all lines were positive in the quarter. The power tools and equipment group was up 9% led by power tools and home products, both of which benefited from new product rollouts and continued strong commercial execution. Our hand tools, accessories, and storage organization delivered 3% growth on a strong performance within hand tools and storage, which benefited from a bounce back in industrial end markets. The overall industrial businesses within Tools & Storage were up mid-single-digit. In total, the Tools & Storage organization continued its momentum in the first quarter delivering solid above market organic growth and robust operating leverage driving 110 basis point margin expansion, while at the same time accelerating integration and commercialization efforts around the Newell Tools and Craftsman brand acquisitions. Let's move to Security. The Security segment had a nice start to the year as well, coming in right on top of our expectations posting 1% organic growth. North America, organic growth was up 2%, its highest organic growth quarter since the second quarter of 2015 led by higher volumes within automatic doors, which continues to perform very well as well as solid healthcare growth. Europe was flat organically in the quarter with mixed results across the markets as gains in the Nordics and UK were offset by declines in France and Central Europe. In terms of profitability the segment contracted 120 basis points year-over-year but was relatively in line with our expectations. The sale of the Mechanical Locks business which was finalized in the quarter drove approximately 70 basis points of that contraction, as this was an above line average business. The rest of the operating margin rate decline is a combination of channel mix and strategic investments within the sales organizations of Europe and North America. On the whole, the Security segment delivered a solid quarter starting the year on the right foot from an organic growth perspective, at the same time executing seamlessly on the Mechanical Locks divestiture. Additionally, they had a strong orders trend in the quarter and therefore backlog is positioned well going into the second quarter. Now turning to Industrial. We are extremely pleased with the segments outperformance this quarter as both the Engineered Fastening and infrastructure businesses delivered positive organic growth in excess of expectations. This top-line performance generated significant operating leverage and drove a 180 basis point improvement in operating margin rate for this segment as volume, productivity, and cost action more than offset currency headwinds. Engineered Fastening delivered 4% organic growth on a strong performance from the automotive business up low-double-digits, which more than offset lower electronic volumes, which were down 20% for the quarter. Auto fasteners sales continued to outpace light vehicle production numbers globally by a ratio of about 2 to 1. Additionally auto system sales were also a highlight in the quarter, up significantly versus the prior year on the back of previously won business beginning to translate into new model production. The Engineered Fastening team posted a record operating margin rate in the quarter in the low '20s as top-line growth combined with recent cost out actions delivered significant operating leverage. The infrastructure businesses posted a solid quarter as well in their own rights, up 2% organically. Our hydraulic tools business which has been revamping its commercial execution and go-to-market strategies for the last year or so is starting to see some momentum build posting its second consecutive quarter of organic growth due to higher volumes across all regions. Meanwhile, oil and gas was flat in the quarter but also ahead of expectations as this industry begins to experience accelerated onshore pipeline construction activity within North America. However, this is being offset by a continued low offshore project activity factor. While there is still lot of risk and uncertainty in our operating environment today both geopolitically and economically we are very encouraged by the collective performances across the portfolio in Q1. As we move deeper into 2017, we will remain focused on driving outsized organic growth and operating leverage, while also integrating the Newell Tools and Craftsman acquisitions into our world-class Tools & Storage franchise. Now, let's briefly take a look at the quarter's free cash flow performance on the next page. We were down slightly year-over-year mainly attributable to higher working capital as the large swings in net income and other were primarily driven by the gain on Mechanical Security divestiture. As a reminder, the outflow of cash in the first quarter is normal seasonality for our Tools & Storage inventory levels rise to ensure we are adequately prepared for the Q2 and Q3 demands of our key customers in the developed markets. However, keep in mind working capital turns in the quarter were up 0.9 turns versus the prior year when you exclude the impact of the portfolio move, a very solid start to the year. We remain on track to deliver 100% free cash flow conversion for the full year. Just a reminder, this guidance is excluding the impact of the gains on the recent divestitures. Now let's turn to our 2017 guidance. As Jim mentioned earlier, we are raising our adjusted EPS outlook for 2017 to a range of $7.08 to $7.28 which is an increase of 9% to 12% versus the prior year. On a GAAP basis, this results in a range of $7.95 to $8.15 earnings per share, inclusive of various one-time charges and also the gains from the first quarter divestitures I previously mentioned. This $0.10 increase to our outlook comes through as a combination of slightly higher organic growth within our industrial-related businesses which contributes approximately $0.08 and incremental cost and productivity actions of $0.10 primarily within Tools & Storage. In the aggregate, this more than offsets the previously mentioned one-time first quarter environmental charge of $0.08. Additionally, we are maintaining our combined FX and commodity inflation headwind estimate at $100 million to $105 million. Additionally, we still expect $50 million of core restructuring for the year. However, keep in mind that $50 million is inclusive of the $12.5 million charge we took in the first quarter relating to the settlement of a legacy Canadian defined benefit plan. Finally, note that we expect second quarter EPS to be approximately 27% of the full-year 2017 guides. Turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page organic growth within Tools & Storage is still expected to be mid-single-digits as healthy construction markets in the U.S. combined with a relatively stable Europe and a still volatile emerging market setup should allow us to continue to take share around the world. That top-line growth will translate into improved margin rate year-over-year. We are maintaining the organic growth view on Security as well up low-single-digits in 2017. Note that the margin rate for the segment will be down year-over-year as we begin the process of lapping comps inclusive of the Mechanical Locks business just divested this quarter. Excluding that sale however, the margin rate for the year will be flat to slightly positive. Finally, we are raising the top-line outlook for our industrial segment from previously down low-single-digits to now relatively flat. It's still little too early in the year to make any more aggressive predictions in this space, but we are seeing some positive signs, both in the Engineered Fastening end markets as well as within the infrastructure businesses. We continue to see operating margin improvements in this segment driven by the previous identified cost actions, but also due to the improved revenue outlook. As I noted before, there is still quite a bit of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty across our operating landscape in 2017. However, we remain cautiously optimistic as we are seeing signs of growth across all segments of the business in the first quarter and we believe we have a solid path to delivering the full-year revised guidance and outperforming the broader market from an organic growth and margin expansion perspective once again. We will remain focused and disciplined in our pursuit of that goal, particularly as we integrate and begin building momentum within our newly acquired tools businesses. With that, I'll turn it back over to Jim to summarize this morning's call. Jim Loree : Thank you, Don. Well as you've heard Stanley Black & Decker is hitting on all cylinders. The first quarter represented a solid start to the year as we continue to build on the momentum underlying our organic growth and margin expansion initiatives. As a result of the strong operating performance and a reasonably favorable operating environment, we raised guidance excluding charges and the gain on sale of the Mechanical Security business to $7.18 at the midpoint, a 10% increase on a year-over-year basis. Apart from our focus on organic growth, we're very excited about the opportunities to drive value within the Newell Tools and Craftsman brand acquisitions. And as I mentioned earlier, integration activity is well underway for both transactions and we received nothing, but positive feedback from all constituencies. And finally, I want to remind everyone that we will be hosting an Investor Day in the morning of May 16 in New York City. This will be a great opportunity to communicate our strategic and financial objectives and discuss the next chapter in the Company's evolution. We're also looking forward to showcasing numbers of our business unit and other key functional teams and we look forward to seeing you there. We're now ready for Q&A, Greg. Greg Waybright : Great, thanks Jim. Chelsey, we can open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Chris Belfiore with UBS is online with a question. Chris Belfiore : So I guess I just wanted to kind of -- kind of touch a little bit on the strength you guys in industrial -- in Industrial segment the Engineering -- the Engineered Fastening business with the automotive systems performance there. Is this something that can kind of be like lumpy through the year? Just kind of, I know you said you're kind of looking to see well how things are going to play out and that's why the organic pressure is still at relatively flat for the year. But I mean that wouldn't kind of imply that it could be may be more first half weighed than second half weighed just getting to like the -- the annual guidance there. So is it kind of a lumpy thing or is it specific like a project. Don Allan : Sure, this is Don. It is somewhat lumpy in the year where we do have like we experienced in the first quarter, we'll probably have a similar dynamic in the second quarter around system sales within Engineered Fastening but in the back half right now, we really don't see a lot of those types of system sales occurring as a lot of the new model launches are happening here in the first half of the year, back half of the year. Right now, that's not the case so that's part of the reason that we're being a little more prudent and balanced in our view of the full-year for that particular business. Those dynamics can change a little bit every once in a while, but at this stage, we think that's the most appropriate perspective of the full-year. Operator : Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities is online with a question. Rich Kwas : Hi, two questions. One, I guess Don on just a follow-up on the industrial question from a mix standpoint what are you assuming for auto for the back half of the year when you look at from a production standpoint, there is some concern with North America and may be even China, that things slowdown. And then just a broader question for Jim around the manufacturing facility for Craftsman how are you looking about the expansion into the U.S. with the new facility, given that there seems to be increased uncertainty regarding the VAT and that sort of impact on your manufacturing position. Are you -- how committed you are or do you, are you committed to what I should say, and then any implications from anything that doesn't go on tax wise? Don Allan : Okay. I'll start with the first question, Rich, and continuation of the previous question, which on the automotive business with Engineered Fastening, we do see a really some strong growth here in the first half of the year, just like we experienced in the first quarter. But right now, we do see light vehicle production slowing in the back half in particular North America but even slowing in some of the other regions compared to what we expect to experience in the first half. So that's part -- that is really what's kind of factored into our guidance when we look at first half versus second half in the industrial business, in particular, we have a combination of the -- the auto systems, and then you have a secondary factor of just a slowing of production in the back half of the year versus the first half based on current projections. Jim Loree : Okay. And then on the second question, and just to reiterate how committed are we to our USA manufacturing strategy related to Craftsman given the uncertainty, but certainly the lower probability of the implementation of a border adjustability tax. And frankly we just comment on that that it's good just see that the government seems to be coming around on that one and understanding that that is not a good idea for the United States of America and many, many companies within the United States as well and really pretty much everywhere. So offsetting that aside for a minute as it relates to the facility expansion plans there was never a contingent on a VAT being implemented, it was really a function of the strategy for re-Americanizing Craftsman and just so everyone is aware we manufacture about 30% of all tools that are sold in the United States of America today and we are able to cost effectively do that with today's manufacturing technology and our intent is to increase that for the total tools business including Craftsman but in particular Craftsman. We have 11 tools plants in the United States and those tool plants, probably the majority of them will be expanding capacity in addition to the facility that we've discussed. And in the end it maybe -- it maybe more than one facility in the U.S. we will have to see how it all shakes out, but we're looking at various scenarios, so answer to your question we're very committed to manufacturing in the U.S. for Craftsmen and for the rest of our United States sales. Operator : Saliq Khan from Imperial Capital is online with a question. Saliq Khan : Yes, with the increasing strength in your Tools & Storage metrics, what are you hearing right now from your distributors and your channel partners about the state of your product offerings. But also have you've been able conduct a review of the talent as well as the temperament of all the employees within the recent acquisitions. Jim Loree : Would you repeat the first part of your question, please? Saliq Khan : Sure. If you take a look at the strength that you have within the Tools & Storage business what you've been hearing from the distributors and the channel partners about the state of your product offerings? Jim Loree : Okay. We're going to have Jeff Ansell tackle that one since he is right on the job. Jeff Ansell : Thank you. To this point that the response that we received from both end-users and trade customers globally has been outstanding, they want favorability on the Craftsman news was 90%. From Irwin, Lenox or Newell Tools perspective similarly positive feedback from customers and employees. So they want to be onboard 3,200 employees to our system seamlessly and we spoke with over 1,000 customers in the first 48 hours of the integration and the feedback has universally been great brands, great opportunities they have struggled free acquisition Newell Tools they struggled to serve their customers in terms of availability of products, service levels. And that's the number one thing, the customers have said to get that right and we can grow this business. And I'm pleased to say that in the first -- less than the first month of ownership, we've improved that backlog position reduced it by over 70%. So we've met the number one objective of the customer. So the feedback from our customers has been outstanding globally and from employees as well and we think it really strengthens our portfolio and opportunities to serve our customers unlike anyone in the world. Operator : Jim Ritchie from Goldman Sachs is online with a question. Evelyn Chow : Hi, good morning. This is actually Evelyn Chow on for Joe Ritchie. How is it going guys? Jim Loree : Great, Evelyn. Evelyn Chow : I was hoping if you could just give us an update on your gross margin performance, which has been incredibly strong not just this quarter but really for the past four, is there anything kind of significant happening at anywhere internal actions, mix, maybe just any other items that are kind of driving that kind of year-over-year expansion? Don Allan : Sure, I will take that. But there's nothing unusual, I think it's a continuation of all the things that we do under the SFS 2.0 operating system model which is focused on appropriate pricing actions, driving cost productivity, transforming our back office et cetera, et cetera all those different things, commercial excellence where we're really trying to make sure that we're providing new products at the right price points to gain market share all that that entire operating model is really what drives that on an ongoing basis. So when I look at the first quarter in particular, you've got that dynamic of just continued trend of trying to drive operating leverage as we grow. And so the way that we drive operating leverage as we grow is that we look at various things excuse me that I just described but then we also try to reinvest along a portion of that along the way, so we can continue to stimulate future growth. And so we don't necessarily let all the leverage drop through but we had a large part of it drop through along the way. And the only way you're going to get operating leverage is to do the things that I just described, which is focused on pricing mostly focused on cost reduction, driving productivity for the supply chain offset any inflation that you're experiencing et cetera, et cetera. So you combine that with a factor that this is the first year we don't have $200 million of currency pressure. We have a number that's 50-ish roughly on an annual basis at this point, all those factors combined with that are resulting in a continued trend of strong gross margin. Jim Loree : And Jeff why don't you tackle that same question and give them a little insight into how you think about it in the Tools business as well? Jeff Ansell : Sure Jim, thank you. Inside of Tools, if you look at last year's period this time last year, we had grown about 8%. This quarter in the emerging markets, we grew another 7% in total 6% and as you know Tool P&Ls volume are very volume-dependent. So with that volume growth, it's given us a lot of degree to freedom inside of our supply chain, it's driven great productivity, while at the same time, tremendous quality improvements drove -- lowering our warranty return rates and the volume growth that we've had has been profitable growth meaning we targeted specific promotional opportunities in specific categories, seasonally adjusted for the right retail environment around the world and we've been successful. And in addition to that, we fought around the world with all this currency pressure we faced now for four years to be very, very frontal facing there. And if you look at places like the UK, we grew 16% this quarter, 8% was volume, 8% was price given what's going on there. And so if you take all those things into account, we better served our customers and in the same time been more reliable and more profitable while we've grown the business at unprecedented levels. Jim Loree : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Tim Wojs from Baird in online with a question. Tim Wojs : I think I was on mute there. Good morning guys. Nice job. Jim Loree : Good morning, thank you. Don Allan : Thanks, Tim. Tim Wojs : Hey just on I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on the discussions that you're having with customers just around Craftsman and the distribution strategy there now that you guys know that asset, maybe where the most interested and just how do you leverage the entire Stanley Black & Decker portfolio to really benefit kind of drive the maximum benefit for the total company? Jim Loree : Jeff? Jeff Ansell : I will take that. So it's really too early, early to declare the commercial strategy, we are that is not to say we're not working on it. We're working on it feverishly and we have been since March 9. But what we could tell you early read from this process is, we have an incredible demand for the Craftsman product across our U.S. customer base even in some other international geographies like the UK and Australia but in particular in the U.S. In terms of its opportunity within our stable of brands, if you look at our absolute share today although we are number one by all accounts and growing faster than the market, we still only we own about 20% of the total global market. So 80% of it is still out there for us to go after across 10 or 11 different marquee brands. And if you -- if you look at Craftsman in particular, it still represents nearly a couple of billion dollars in the marketplace today. And while we have grown our Tool business from $600 million to over $8 billion that Craftsman franchise has survived and that tells you what a loyal installed base that is, the customer however says that they would much prefer to find that brand in a lot of other more convenient locations. So our opportunity to take an installed base we've unable to dislodge make it available across other -- other retail options is exactly what the customer is asking for and we'll give a little more clarity May 16 but not full, we are working feverishly on this and as soon as we are able, we will tell you more about it, we can't wait to get started. Operator : Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan is online with a question. Michael Rehaut : Couple of quick -- couple of questions if I could squeeze them in, first if you could give any update on the M&A landscape particularly in terms of what you're seeing from a pricing standpoint, what people are asking and if you still see valuations are reasonable and should we think about timing that 2017 and perhaps some of your other segments are something that's possible or if you know you're going to be focusing mostly on Tools & Storage. And then just secondly on the breakthrough innovation front, any update there as you look at your other segments augmenting what you've done so far in FlexVolt. Thanks very much. Jim Loree : Hey, Mike. First of all on the M&A landscape we just spent $3 billion or almost $3 billion and are integrating feverishly as Jeff says, two major acquisitions in Tools. So this is going to be a year of digestion for the most part and I think everybody should understand and can understand why that would be both from a financial balance sheet point of view as well as an operational bandwidth point of view. So having said that, I would say the pipeline for M&A is about as robust as we've ever seen it with valuations and in its own, I think is manageable with good synergies not cheap by any stretch, but some really interesting strategic assets out there that are of a decent sized, decent enough to move the needle. So we're coming through those right now and doing a lot of analysis and thinking strategically about what makes the most sense. We may do some very small acquisitions yet this year but there won't be -- there won't be anything which I would call material in size but be on the lookout in as we get into next year for something in all likelihood in one of the other segments, other than tools wouldn't rule tools out, but I would say that in all likelihood, it would probably be in either industrial or security which is where we see the action today. So that's the M&A picture, we can talk more about that at the Analyst Meeting for people that are interested. As far as breakthrough innovation I have never been more excited about the opportunities that we see across the company and we have about 10 teams up and running. We have every business in the company has at least one team and our emerging markets group has a team and we're all using all those teams are using the same formula that we use for FlexVolt under the global Tools & Storage model that we have identified as part of SFS 2.0. So you'll see more information about that at the Analyst Meeting, but I can tell you that we don't expect a 100% batting average on these. But I would think that if we have 10 teams up and running and have been up and running now for us anywhere between a year-and-a-half to six months in that timeframe, there will be some innovations coming out of those teams that we've already seen some. One of the challenges for us will be some of those require commercialization in places or in ways or channels that we don't necessarily have access to today. So another one of our challenges related to breakthrough innovation will be getting some channel access to for some of these innovations that are a little bit out of the fairway, if you will. And I think you see a combination of human resources additions to tackle those challenges as well as some integration of M&A activities with our breakthrough innovation activities and synergizing up both of those. So really exciting times here at Stanley Black & Decker as far as breakthrough innovation goes. Operator : Dennis McGill from Zelman and Associates is online with a question. Dennis McGill : Hi, thank you guys. I was hoping you could may be expand a little bit on the first quarter margin within Tools & Storage I think going into the quarter extracting both currency and brand investment to be some pressure on margin and a very strong margin performance there so little color there. And then as you look at the full year the positive year-over-year some different factors going on, especially with the acquisitions specific to Craftsman can you just maybe put some numbers around it given the royalty payments and things might impact margin there and how we should model that business? Don Allan : Sure. So let's start with the first quarter gross margin, which was, as I said, very strong. We clearly did experience commodity inflation in the quarter, we experienced some year-over-year FX pressure as well, but we did have some nice pricing benefits Jeff mentioned some of things that we've done in particular in Europe and some other markets around the world that have been positive for us, he is referring more the last year, but we also some saw some of the impact this year in the first quarter. And then we also had focus on cost actions and productivity that came in very nicely throughout the quarter and then we -- we put a little bit investment back into the P&L. So I think the probably difference was as we didn't put quite as much investment back in the P&L as we originally were anticipating at the beginning of the quarter, but frankly, the rate was not dramatically better than we anticipated it was just modestly better. As far as Craftsman goes this year as we said it about $0.08 of EPS impact for us. The margin impact will be relatively modest, not a big number. There is a, which many of you're aware of their accounting aspects related to the royalty stream or the free royalty basically that we provided to Sears that does have an annual impact. This year that will drive frankly a large part of the operating profit here in 2017. And then as we move into 2018 and beyond it will be more about the activities associated with driving organic growth, driving more profitability in the business through our supply chain in our manufacturing etc cetera, etc cetera. And so I wouldn't expect a large number here in 2016 -- 2017 I'm sorry based on what I just described and also just keep in mind, a large part of the operating margin will come from that accounting dynamic. Operator : Robert Barry from Susquehanna is online with a question. Robert Barry : I had a question on Tools margins, I guess in two parts. I mean big picture up over 100 basis points in 1Q. I mean do you think you can maintain something close to that degree of kind of year-over-year progress, a lot of those drivers, you mentioned seem like they could carry forward. And I think you were expecting even better performance in the back half due to lower launch costs. And then just kind of a sub-question related to Newell synergies what's the cadence of that $80 million to $90 million of cost synergies. I think that was by year 3. How much is coming in 2017 versus in 2018 and 2019. Thank you. Don Allan : Yes, so the gross margin, yes the trend I expect. I expect the trend to continue throughout the year. Can I guarantee every quarter will be perfect based on what we did in Q1? Absolutely not. But because there is timing of when we make investments and various other factors, but the Tools & Storage business right now, although they have some headwinds, the headwinds aren't quite as large as what we've experienced over the last few years. Currency is much lower number; commodity inflation right now is a reasonable number. We'll continue to watch that as the year progresses. But in total, those numbers are about $100 million to $105 million with a large part of that, probably 80% of that hitting the Tools & Storage business. So when I think of the business trend and as I mentioned as I went through guidance I think the trend is going to continue to be accretive year-over-year as we go throughout this year. And I want to say be of the same magnitude every quarter based on what we had in Q1. So we definitely expect solid accretion. As far as Newell cost synergies we as Jeff mentioned, we've just started that process and about 30 days good news is we had a fair amount of planning, leading up to the closing over about a 90 to 120 day period of time. So we were ready to go day one, and which was -- which is always great to be an acquisition, and so this year, we think we're probably going to get about $20 million to $25 million of cost synergies from Newell in 2017. And the rest of it will kind of pace a little evenly over the next three years. So that would be what you should expect for 2017. Operator : Liam Burke from Wunderlich is online with a question. Liam Burke : On the industrial tools side of the business Jim, you mentioned strength was that across the board or were there any particular verticals that did well? Jim Loree : I'll let Jeff tackle it since he has got industrial tools under him. Jeff Ansell : We were up strong mid-single-digits about 7% in the industrial business that was pretty pervasive across all of our industrial tools businesses. The Tier 1 folks were up double-digit in the -- in the quarter. So that recovery looks -- looks promising and we believe our growth in that market certainly with a share gain more than just a market improvement although the market did improve concurrent with our Q1 results. We did -- we did see some, some industrial tools folks actually exit the market, which we very quickly converted over to our brands, which was fantastic. So things like that as well as the flexible introduction in those industrial channels has been really high, really well done well accepted in that technology really performing in that marketplace so all those things come together for a market that has improved a little more than we expected and our growth is greater than that market itself. So that's kind of the way we see it going forward. Jim Loree : So Jeff while you're on the topic of FlexVolt may be you could just expand a little bit on the program right now. I know there is a little skepticism out there from a couple of people who probably have a vested interest and skepticism. So why don't you just tell give them the ground fruit about FlexVolt right now. Jeff Ansell : What tends to be in this marketplace competitors are violent and if your competitors don't have a response they tend to -- they have a negative view on what you -- what you're doing and how it's performing. The reality is we couldn't be happier with FlexVolt and if you think of 7% growth in this first quarter 8% in North America, 6% in Europe. We're very pleased with that. But half that growth came from FlexVolt half came from the core, so what it says, our core business vibrant we comped a very big quarter from last year and grew the core at the same time while allowing FlexVolt to provide the other half of the growth. Our retail execution of FlexVolt is now more than double-digits ahead of what the customer expectations work, which is fantastic. And the uptick and uptake in industrial channels every bit is good if not better. So if you consider those things and you look to the fact that we are loading new flexible products as we speak in this quarter and we will continue to load new introductions throughout 2017. And as Jim said, in the next several years that has been the real, the real driver behind what you do with this breakthrough innovation team. We have to continue to keep this fresh and we feel that we are quite, quite nicely doing that. The last point I would tell you is, while it takes time to introduce new systems and power tools the fact that this does leave the old system behind has led to a much faster adoption than most new power tool platforms. As such, our growth in FlexVolt, the ramp in FlexVolt is 10 times faster than the ramp in brushless as an example. So we couldn't be more pleased and we are we know it's a competitive advantage and the average of five stars. The average user rating of FlexVolt is 4.9, so if you get the product right for the user everything else takes care of itself. So we feel great. Operator : David MacGregor from Longbow Research is online with a question. David MacGregor : Yes sir, good morning and congratulations on a good quarter. Jim Loree : Thanks, David. David MacGregor : Yes, thanks. Just around FlexVolt if you could may be go back to Jeff and just talk about the development of 16 and 120 volt cordless tools and then how should we think about kind of the growth performance and the timing of those products? Jeff Ansell : Well, the beautiful thing about FlexVolt is we are able to develop 20 volt tools where they're appropriate, where the max watt outperformance is appropriate. At the same time, develop 60 volt tools where the max watt outperformance is required and obviously there is a cost difference right the 60 volt tool is more expensive proposition for the user and for us that delivers unprecedented performance, at same time the user wants the right tool for the right job, at the right cost. So all those things come together and what you'll see over the next 36 months we'll be presenting this to Jim and team in the next few weeks and then you'll see some of it at the May 16 session, you'll see fresh introductions of both 20 volt and 60 volt tools coming within the FlexVolt range and I will tell you that the users pick up on them has been equivalent. The user likes what they can do with FlexVolt batteries under 20 volt system but they really have also embraced the 60 volt performance. Circular saw in particular is absolutely killing it. The portable you mentioned 120 volt, the portable products like miter saws which are 120 volt absolutely killing it. So the user has embraced all those various platforms and because it gives them the performance of coated in a cordless package. So more to follow but yes we are very, very active in development of 20, 60 and even 120 volts going forward. Operator : Robert Wertheimer from Barclays is online with a question. Robert Wertheimer : Congratulations on getting all the deals done, obviously a lot of work and rapidly done. On Craftsman is there and what's your sense of scenarios and contingencies if Craftsman at Sears declined for whatever reason faster than expected. Do you have a current channel to absorb it; do you think that the additional channels you might add are going to be in place in the near term? Jim Loree : I think we're planning for a more rapid ramp than $100 million a year over 10 years. We can probably handle a ramp with our current planning at about 2X rate of that clearly that's hypothetical at this point in time and it's a contingency but it's certainly definitely something that we are planning for in the event that that were to occur. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Greg Waybright for closing remarks. Greg Waybright : Chelsey thank you. We would like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call and obviously please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Morgan Tim Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Robert Barry - Susquehanna International Group Chris Belfiore - UBS Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research Ken Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Michael Wood - Nomura Instinet David MacGregor - Longbow Research Operator : Welcome to the second quarter 2017 Stanley Black & Decker earnings conference call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being is being recorded. I would now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's second quarter 2017 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Greg Waybright, Vice President of Investor Relations. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website, as well as on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim and Don will review our second quarter 2017 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. And as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our president and CEO, Jim Loree. James Loree : Okay. Thank you, Dennis. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As you saw from this morning's news release, Stanley Black & Decker reported a strong second quarter and thus a solid first half as well. Each of our business segments contributed to robust organic growth, which was an impressive 7% for the quarter. Our team's continued focus on delivering top quartile financial performance, innovative products and solutions for our customers along with outstanding execution, resulted in a revenue increase of 10% to $3.2 billion. Results included a full-quarter contribution from the recent Newell Tools and Craftsman Brand acquisition, which supplemented our strong underlying organic growth. Tools & Storage led the way in total growth, up 17%. Up 8% organically. We believe about 2x the market with all regions once again contributing to the continued growth and share gain. The FlexVolt battery system continued its steady march to 300 million, making it the largest, fastest-growing cordless launch in our industry's history. Our tool business keeps delivering and exceeding expectations through commercial and operational excellence, including outstanding core and breakthrough innovation, while at the same time integrating two major transactions. 2017 is shaping up to be another superb performance by the entire global Tools & Storage team. The Industrial segment also delivered a significant outperformance for the quarter. Organic growth accelerated to 9% on the heels of 4% growth in the first quarter. In Engineered Fastening, we continued to see strong automotive system sales, in addition to higher industrial volumes, which supported an impressive 6% organic growth for the quarter. Our other industrial businesses, oil and gas and hydraulic tools \u2013 or infrastructure \u2013 each delivered 19% organic growth, outstanding performances, as commercial actions plus positive underlying markets benefited both the project and inspection activity within oil and gas and expanded hydraulics tools volumes. And finally, our Security business grew 2% organically, slightly ahead of our expectations. North America Security generated 4% organic growth on stronger installation project activity within the commercial electronic security and automatic door businesses. It is rewarding to see the commercial and operational efforts from the North American Security team manifested in the results. It is noteworthy to point out that this is the highest quarterly growth performance for Security North America since the fourth quarter of 2014. Our overall company operating margin rate remained robust at 15.7% excluding M&A related charges, relatively flat to the post-merger record rate in the second quarter of 2016, and a nice step up of 150 basis points sequentially. The benefits of operating leverage and productivity enabled us to essentially offset modest inflation in price and currency, while we continue to make focused investments on our operating system, SFS 2.0. These investments will support future innovation, organic growth and margin expansion.  Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $2.01, which is a 9% expansion versus prior year. It was fueled by strong operational execution by our business teams. So, a really great quarter and an excellent first half of 2017. And I want to thank all of our teams around the globe for their energy, enthusiasm and engagement as well as their passion for high performance and results. Based on the company's first-half organic growth performance and our confidence in the outlook, we are raising our 2017 full-year adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.10 to $7.18 to $7.38. Now, turning to an update on the recent acquisitions. Importantly, our progress on integrating the Lennox, Irwin and Craftsman brands into our portfolio is progressing nicely. We remain on track to meet our expectations, both from a financial and integration execution perspective. Specific to Newell Tools, there were some notable accomplishments in the quarter as we continue to assimilate employees, suppliers and customers into our existing operations. In this regard, we are deploying core SFS principles into the production facilities and have begun moving order fulfillment into our Tools & Storage distribution centers, which included a major retail customer implementation in the second quarter. The Lennox and Irwin teams are embracing SFS and are energized now to be part of a larger, highly committed tool business. Our commercial teams are in the process of building plants to support revenue synergies and remain optimistic that a meaningful contribution in that area is ahead of us. In fact, during the second quarter, we have already begun realizing a modest amount of revenue synergy within the emerging markets. And finally, as always, the business teams are working diligently to plan and execute the cost synergies. In this case, $80 million to $90 million. Turning to Craftsman, we're hard at work developing commercial strategies for this iconic powerful brand and remain confident in our ability to achieve approximately $100 million a year in incremental annual revenue growth for the foreseeable future. Our customer discussions are continuing and are going well as we plan for a mid-2018 Craftsman launch outside of Sears. From a supply chain perspective, we have started up a new distribution center in Charlotte, North Carolina and are aggressively moving supply and customer fulfillment into this facility to support the Craftsman business. As you can tell, there is a large amount of momentum and continued enthusiasm for both of these transactions as the theoretical strategic value of these assets becomes more tangible and more real with every passing day. One last item I'd like to call your attention to is last week's dividend announcement. We increased the quarterly dividend by approximately 9% to $0.63 a share. I\u2019m proud to say that this will be our 50th consecutive year of increasing the dividend and it is a reflection of our continued commitment to deploy approximately half of our excess capital to shareholders and half towards M&A over the long term. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Don for a more detailed assessment of the second quarter results. Donald Allan, Jr. : Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll now take a deeper dive into our business segments, which delivered another strong performance in the second quarter.  Starting with Tools & Storage, revenues were up 17% in the quarter, due to 8% organic growth and an 11-point contribution from acquisitions which were partially offset by 2 points of pressure from the combined impact of currency and divestitures. The operating margin for this segment was robust at 18.1% as the benefits from volume leverage and productivity were more than offset by growth investments, price and inflation, resulting in a 70 basis point decline in rate versus last year's quarterly record rate. Once again, each Tools & Storage region and SPU posted positive organic growth in the quarter. On a geographic basis, North America led the way, up 9%. This strong performance was broad-based as we saw high single-digit growth in our US industrial and commercial channels and low double-digit growth within US retail, which includes our e-commerce customers. Additionally, Canada posted solid organic growth of 7%. The growth continued to be supported by new product introductions, which includes contributions from FlexVolt. I will provide a bit more color on FlexVolt in a few minutes. North America POS data was up mid-single digits, which is very impressive as it comped against mid-teen POS growth rate from the prior year. Additionally, inventory within our major customers were at or slightly below prior year levels, which gives us confidence that our growth has been supported by strong sell-through in the channel. Europe delivered another above-market performance, with the region posting 8% organic growth. Nearly, all markets contributed with double-digit performances in the UK, Benelux, Iberia and Eastern Europe. The European team continues to be the model in our company for commercial excellence. The team has found ways to leverage our broad stable of brands and manufacturing footprint to deliver differentiated solutions for our customers. Finally, the emerging markets were supported by solid performances across Latin America and within Russia, India and Africa, which contributed to overall organic growth of 3% in the quarter. As noted last quarter, we have completed a transition to a direct model in Turkey, which in future periods should no longer be an inhibitor to growth. If we exclude the Turkey transition, organic growth would've been 6% for the emerging markets in Q2. Performance within Latin America varied as double-digit growth in Mexico, Brazil and Ecuador more than offset declines in Colombia, Chile and Peru, a trend we have seen throughout most of 2017 and it's reflective of unique country market conditions. Diligent pricing actions as well as the ongoing MPP launch across the developing markets are continuing to drive growth. Additionally, we have seen the e-commerce channel increase its share of the market and become a larger contributor to our growth within emerging markets. As you know, we have what we believe to be leading positions in e-commerce and in developed markets and we are leveraging that know-how as our emerging markets teams work to develop this critical channel for the times. Within the Tools & Storage SBUs, all lines were positive in the quarter. The power tool and equipment group was up 10%, led by professional power tools as well as contributions from the outdoor and home products segment. This SBU also benefitted from new product innovation, including FlexVolt, and continued strong commercial execution. We had another strong quarter for the FlexVolt products, with approximately $60 million. Based on year-to-date results and planned second half FlexVolt product launches, we believe that we are on track to deliver revenue, approaching $300 million from FlexVolt in 2017. When factoring in cannibalization, however, this represents $200 million of SBD revenue or $100 million of growth versus the prior year. Our hand tools, accessories and storage organization delivered 5% growth on new product introductions and benefitted from a strong performance within the North American industrial end markets, led by our Mac Tools business. So, in summary, the Tools & Storage organization continued its momentum in the second quarter, delivering strong above-market organic growth along with robust operating margin of 18.1% as this is an acquisition execution around the Newell Tools and Craftsman Brand, as Jim referenced earlier. Now, moving to the Security segment, Security had a solid second quarter as well, posting 2% organic growth. North America organic growth was up 4%, led by higher installation volumes within the commercial electronic security and automatic door businesses. Europe was flat organically in the quarter as gains in the Nordics and the UK were offset by declines in France. In terms of profitability, the segment contracted 150 basis points year-over-year, which was in line with our expectations. The sale of the mechanical locks business drove approximately 120 basis points of this contraction. The remaining 30 basis point decline was attributable to higher levels of installation growth within the quarter, country mix within Europe and a modest level of investment to support future growth. The Security team is maintaining its focus on commercial and operational effectiveness to position this business for future growth and margin expansion. Finally, the Industrial segment had an impressive quarter of outperformance as both the engineered fastening and infrastructure businesses delivered strong organic growth, well in excess of expectation. This topline performance contributed to a 240 basis point expansion in operating margin rate due to the benefits from volume leverage, productivity and previous cost actions. Engineered fastening posted 6% organic growth as the automotive business up low double-digits and a return to our growth in our Industrial business more than offset lower electronics volumes. From an automotive perspective, the growth was led by shipments of our self-piercing rivet and stud welding systems to support our customers' new model launches. Auto fastener sales outpaced light vehicle production by approximately 300 to 400 basis points, showing that we continue to deliver content gains. Finally, the Industrial business delivered approximately two points of organic growth, slightly more robust market growth and commercial actions executed within the business. As Jim mentioned, the infrastructure businesses posted an exceptional quarter, up 19% organically. Our hydraulic tools business is reaping the benefit from its revamped commercial structure and go-to-market strategies, with the backdrop of modestly higher prices in the scrap steel market, which does benefit our product lines. Hydraulics posted 18% organic growth in its third consecutive quarter of organic growth, with higher volumes in all regions. Meanwhile, oil and gas also generated 19% organic growth in the quarter, well ahead of expectations as the industry benefits from an acceleration of onshore pipeline construction activity within North America in the first half of this year. This is being offset by continued low offshore project activity. While the results of the oil and gas business are encouraging, our expectation is that without resumption of approvals by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, also known as FERC, we will see a return to lower level of project activity in the second half of this year. We are pleased by the performances across the portfolio thus far in 2017. We will remain focused on driving outsized organic growth and operating leverage, while integrating the Lennox, Irwin and Craftsman brands within our Tools & Storage franchise. Let's take a look at the quarter's free cash flow performance on the next page. For the second quarter, free cash flow was $134 million year-to-date performance to use of cash of $76 million. The quarterly and year-to-date declines versus the prior year are predominantly explained by carrying higher amounts of working capital relative to the outsized level of organic growth we are experiencing primarily within the Tools & Storage business. From a working capital turn perspective, we delivered 7.1 turns in the second quarter, which is a decrease of 1.1 turns versus the prior year. This decline is primarily due to the impact of our recent portfolio activities, specifically the acquisition of Newell Tools and the Craftsman Brand. Excluding these acquisitions, we were down 0.3 turns versus the prior year. We are confident that we will deliver strong cash flow generation in the second half of the year, given our core SFS processes and principles, combined with focused execution on reducing working capital levels in line with Q4 seasonal activity. In addition, we will continue to ensure that we maintain an adequate amount of working capital to support our growth expectation. As a reminder, in 2016, we improved our working capital turns from 8.2 times up to 10.6 times in the second half of the year. In 2017, we expect a similar working capital turn improvement within the second half, from 7.1 times up to approximately 9 times by the end of the year. Therefore, we are reiterating our commitment to deliver 100% free cash flow conversion, supported by this expected strong second half cash flow generation. As a reminder, this free cash flow conversion guidance excludes the impact of gains on divestitures.  So, turning to our 2017 guidance on slide seven. As Jim mentioned earlier, we are also raising our adjusted EPS outlook range for 2017 to $7.18 up to $7.38, which is an increase of 10% to 13% versus the prior year. On a GAAP basis, this results in $8.05 to $8.25 earnings per share range, which is inclusive of various one-time charges and the gains from the first quarter divestitures. The $0.10 increase to our outlook range is the result of higher organic growth than previously expected, about half of which was delivered by the businesses in the second quarter and the remaining half is expected to occur in the balance of the year. Additionally, we are maintaining our combined FX and commodity inflation headwind estimate of around $100 million to $105 million. While currency pressures have reduced since the first quarter, we are seeing increased pressures in commodities, namely steel and some purchase components. I would also like to point out that we expect third-quarter EPS to approximate 25$ to 26% of the full year 2017 EPS guidance. Now, turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page, organic growth within Tools & Storage is still expected to be mid-single digits, but modestly improved versus our last outlook. We see healthy construction markets in the US, combined with continued stable European environment and a modestly improving emerging markets set up to continue through the remainder of the year. This should provide the backdrop for share growth, when combined with our commercial actions. We continue to believe that top line growth will translate into an improved margin rate year-over-year. We are maintaining the organic growth view on Security, up low-single digits in 2017. Note that the marginal rate for the segment will be down year-over-year due to the divestiture of the mechanical locks business, which occurred during the first quarter. However, excluding that sale, the margin rate for the year will be flat to slightly down as we expect the impacts of mix and investments to support growth have the potential to be modestly dilutive to the full year rate. Now, finally, in the Industrial segment, we still expect organic growth be relatively flat, but modestly higher than our previous expectation. While we did see outperformance in both engineered fastening and infrastructure again in Q2, as I discussed in the April earnings call, there are market-related pressures which are expected to emerge in the second half. These pressures fall into three areas. One, North America light vehicle production is expected to soften; two, automotive systems which support customer new model rollouts will be lower in the second half of 2017; and three, expected lower project activity in North America for oil and gas, as I discussed earlier. We continue to expect operating margins to improve in this segment, driven by previously identified cost controls, as well as the impact from the first half performance. We believe we have a solid path to deliver the full-year revised guidance and outperform the broader market from an organic growth and margin expansion perspective. We will remain focused and disciplined in our pursuit of that goal, in addition to successfully integrating our newly acquired tools businesses.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Jim to summarize this morning's call. James Loree : Okay. Thanks, Don. So, to recap, the second quarter built upon the strong start to 2017. We continued to deliver above-market organic growth and robust operating performance. And as a result of the continued momentum, we increased the EPS guidance and continue to be excited about the opportunities to deliver value from the recent acquisitions, which are on track. And as we move into the second half now, our deep and agile leadership team is leveraging SFS 2.0 to deliver organic growth with operating leverage, continuing to integrate the Lennox, Irwin and Craftsman brands into our portfolio and generating that strong free cash flow. And we're encouraged by the results through the first half and we're encouraged by our ability to raise the outlook for the full year. We're also vigilant in the pursuit of our three overarching themes, to become known as one of the world's leading innovators, to deliver top quartile financial performance, and to elevate our commitment to corporate social responsibility, all of which supports the company in achieving our 2022 vision. Thank you. And we're now ready for Q&A. Dennis Lange : We can now open the call to Q&A please. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. You may begin. Nigel Coe : Good morning, Jim and Don. Interesting comment about the cannibalization on FlexVolt $3 million growth, $100 million of cannibalization. I\u2019m just wondering if you can just provide bit more color in terms of where you're seeing that cannibalization, what kind of margin mix you're seeing FlexVolt versus the products that are being cannibalized. And then maybe just second half this year and into 2018, how the product rollout [Indiscernible] rollout looks for FlexVolt? James Loree : Sure. So, as I mentioned in my comments, we see a path now for FlexVolt to be approaching $300 million before cannibalization. And cannibalization impact will bring the number down closer to $200 million net overall for Stanley Black & Decker. What we're seeing is that, as we've been communicating probably now for three to four months, is that we started seeing cannibalization in the spring, early springtime related to certain products that we were replacing on the corded side with FlexVolt technology. So, we still offer those particular products. However, when someone goes in to make a decision about 120 volt product or a 60 volt product, that is now something that can get through FlexVolt, they have a choice to make between the FlexVolt technology or the corded D\u1d07WALT technology. And so, as we anticipated, we expect to have a little bit of cannibalization and that's what we're experiencing. And we hope, as we end the year, maybe the cannibalization won't be as large as what we projected, but right now that\u2019s kind of what we feel the trend will be at this stage. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. You may begin. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. James Loree : Good morning. Jeffrey Sprague : Good morning. Just a question on Tools & Storage margin and really kind of a two-part question. First, I was wondering if you could just decompose in a little bit more detail the drivers, product spending and promotions, et cetera, in the quarter. But then, bigger picture, Jim, I was also wondering, clearly, you\u2019ve got a balancing act between revenue growth and OP margin dollar versus margin rate. I was just wondering if you could put that in perspective for us, how you'd think you'd balance those two and maybe what is normalized margin trajectory for the Tools & Storage business? James Loree : Yeah, I\u2019ll have Don tackle the first part of your question, which I\u2019m not sure he can add too much more color to, but we'll have him address that in a minute. I'll just take kind of a philosophically or from a big picture perspective. When we are pulling those levers on price promotion and margin optimization, trying to figure out where the sweet spot is, I would say, we tend to go in cycles sometimes. The needle will move from one side of the spectrum to the other a little bit. And I would say in the second quarter, in particular, we probably were a little bit more aggressive on price than normal, and so you saw the negative 1% price for the tools segment. That is not something that I necessarily see as a sustainable approach, but it was more of a \u2013 a bit of experimentation, especially since our regular promotional activity in the second quarter was a little bit lower. So, we had a fantastic margin performance in the tools business, 18.1%. Somebody was commenting early, before the call, that wow, it's down 70 basis points. Well, it's down 70 basis points versus our highest margin ever in the tools business. So, I wouldn\u2019t get too concerned about it. We have the flexibility to do some experimentation we did. I think you'll see a little bit more of a shift as we get into the second half, particularly the third quarter where we have more traditional type promotions as opposed to price-related promotions. And all of that price activity, I would say, is driven more by us in the driver seat as opposed to responding to anything in the marketplace. Don? Donald Allan, Jr.: Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t dramatically add anything to what Jim just said about price. I think that was right on the mark. But I will reinforce that this is probably \u2013 if not the second or third highest profitability quarter tools has ever had \u2013 I think it\u2019s the second highest they have experienced after last year's second quarter of 18.8. And so \u2013 and we just have to keep that in mind and recognize that we're also experiencing some commodity inflation pressure as well, and yet we're still able to achieve that level of profitability. [Indiscernible] and that we don't turn it into something any more significant than what it is, which is relatively insignificant. I do want to make a comment \u2013 I didn\u2019t answer Nigel's second question about the profitability related to the shift of cannibalization in FlexVolt. And really, it's not much of a significant impact. It's a little bit of a negative initially here. As we have said before, the FlexVolt margins are a little bit lower than line average throughout this year. We expect as we go into next year for that dynamic to change as we've increased the volume and we also will likely have lower promotional activity as well. But the impact overall is relatively minor and you can see that in the overall operating profit rate of 18%. James Loree : This is Jim. I'd also like to say that \u2013 congratulations to the operations team in Tools & Storage. They\u2019ve done a fabulous job with productivity. We had a series of years where we had design-to-value initiative going, which is now pretty mature. But at this point we're starting to get in pretty significantly into industry 4.0. And that basically involves creating smart factories and then embellishing them with robotics and 3D printing and these types of things. We're far from the robotics and 3D printing phase of it, but we're definitely making a lot of progress in making the factories more data-driven, more real-time in their execution. And what we're seeing is that we're getting above average, above historical average productivity out of this and we expect to continue that as we go forward. So, that's really helping boost the margins as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. You may begin. Richard Kwas : Hi. Good morning, everyone. James Loree : Good morning. Richard Kwas : How are you doing? A couple of quick ones for me. On Security, you talked about investments relative to the beginning of the year and the underlying margin. Was there any change in the underlying performance? I know most of the decrease is coming from elimination of mechanical locks, but if you provide some more color on what's changed since the beginning of the year in terms of incremental investments for future growth versus underlying performance organically? And then the other one real quick is, as you look at the second half of the year, you have a big industrial electronics customer that is coming out with a new product. How should we think about impact to the top line as we think exiting 2017 and into 2018? I know that business has been under pressure for some period of time. Thanks. Donald Allan, Jr.: Yes. As it relates to Security initially, no major changes to our thought process around investments. As we said at the beginning of the year, we're investing a little bit of funds within our Security business to develop a more consistent organic growth profile over the long-term. And we think we are starting to feel a bit of the benefits of that as we saw a quarter with 2% organic growth here within the second quarter, but there's more work to be done in that regard. So, no major shift. I would say there was certainly a little bit of mix pressure this quarter that maybe had a tenths or two-tenths of pressure on the profitability in the segment as we saw a little bit higher mix of installation revenue in the United States and then the country mix over in Europe also was a little bit of a negative, but nothing major. So, I wouldn't say there was anything really underneath that was kind of causing a major shift that's something that\u2019s permanent or ongoing. It's just more of a unique second-quarter type of situation. As it relates to Industrial and electronics, that business for us has gotten down to a relatively small number here in 2017. So, in the second quarter, it was about $6 million of revenue. It's a very small component of that business at this stage for that particular customer. We don\u2019t expect to participate in a significant way in the launches in the back half. We have a minor role with that customer on an ongoing basis and we actually like that position, given the volatility and the profitability of the business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes Michael Rehaut with J.P. Morgan. You may begin. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. James Loree : Good morning. Michael Rehaut : Just a quick clarification and then my main question. The clarification is just on the Tools & Storage. I was just curious. On the growth investment in basis point impact on margins, just trying to get a little better sense of kind of like the underlying core margin, let's say, in that business as growth investments eventually will moderate as, I guess, you get other \u2013 FlexVolt and your other acquisitions more fully running. And then, just on the main question, though, on the \u2013 little bit more detail, hopefully, on the change in \u2013 what's driving the change in sales growth guidance. You mentioned Tools & Storage and Industrial a little bit better than the last time. Sorry if I missed it, but just a little bit more of where that's coming from in both segments? Donald Allan, Jr.: Sure. So, I mean, I think on the growth investment side for Tools, that's not a simple number to quantify because there's a lot of different investments across the tools business that are made to stimulate growth in the core business, to stimulate FlexVolt. So, it's difficult to really say how much new growth investments are. And what I would say is that there continues to be areas that we want to pursue, to make investments for future growth and to experience the type of growth that we've had in this business at high-single-digits \u2013 anywhere from mid to high-single-digit organic growth on a consistent basis, we have to be making some investments along the way to ensure that that type of trend continues, at least in the midterm. And that's really what you're seeing in the business.  Now, that being said, to all the points we made earlier, the profitability of the business continues to improve. And so, we would expect that when we look at the year-over-year performance of tools here in 2017 versus 2016, we will probably see 40 to 50 basis points of improvement in the margin rate year-over-year, while we're making investments, while we're making other decisions because of some of the things Jim mentioned around productivity, because of other cost management in different areas outside of growth investments, all those different things allow us to manage the business in a certain way and get to a certain result. James Loree : That\u2019s a really important point, Don, because that's philosophically what we're trying to do, is that we're trying to achieve top quartile organic growth and fueling that with investments and at the same time driving margin expansion. And that's not easy to do, as Don points out, but that is really philosophically what we're trying to do. Donald Allan, Jr.: Yes. The other question was related to change in the organic growth guidance assumption. Yes, we have tweaked our \u2013 as I mentioned in my comments in the call, we have tweaked our assumption for Tools & Storage up a little bit versus what we said in April. And the same thing would be for Industrial. Now, Industrial's reason is more because we saw a stronger performance in the second quarter than we were thinking in April. Tools is more of a continued trend of modest outperformance in their organic growth versus expectations and then slightly \u2013 certainly, as we get to July every year for our tools business, we get a really nice view of the back half of promotional activities, the beginning of the holiday season, and so that gives us something that we can get a better sense of what we think organic growth will look like. So, based on those various factors is why we tweak those numbers up. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. You may begin. Tim Wojs : Hey, guys. Good morning. Nice job. James Loree : Good morning. Thank you. Tim Wojs : I guess my question is really on Craftsman. I was just wondering, Jim, if you could talk a little bit about maybe the scheduled launch in the middle 2018, a little bit of color on maybe which product, any sort of dialogue you're having with customers. And then maybe more broadly, any change to how you guys or your customers are thinking about e-commerce at this point? James Loree : There's a lot of really good things going on relative to Craftsman. I don't want to get into too much detail because it is a competitive situation, but I will tell you that we are working on designing a complete comprehensive product line that spans all categories that it will be a high-quality product line that is high quality, high-value for the customer and will take some of the best attributes of our high-value products from across all our brands and incorporate them into the designs. The channel discussions, the customer discussions are going very well. The interest level is very high. We haven't really changed too much in terms of our strategy. There will be some decisions made in terms of how we expect to go to market from a channel perspective in the late third quarter, early fourth quarter. And then it will be all systems full speed ahead for a mid-2018 launch. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may begin. Joe Ritchie : Hey, good morning, guys. James Loree : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : So, maybe just kind of touching on the FX and commodity headwinds of $100 million to $105 million that you forecasted for the year, maybe if you could talk a little bit about whether the pressure you saw in 2Q was more or less what you anticipated.  And then, I'm just a little surprised that we are keeping that at the same number just given that FX has probably moved more positively for you as the years progress. So, any comment on that would be helpful. Donald Allan, Jr.: Sure. I will take that. Yes, so we started the year with an estimate of around $100 million in total for those two items as a headwind. And at that time, it was about 50-50. So, 50% for FX and 50% for commodity inflation. Back in April, it had shifted more to 60%/40%, 60% being commodity and 40% being the FX. In the second quarter, that shift continued, where now we think based on current rates, we're probably around $25 million of that $100 million is currency. And the remaining $75 million is commodity inflation. And so, we've seen a continued trend of commodity inflation creeping up through the first six months of the year. We feel like, at this stage, for the remainder of the year, we have our arms around that with various contractual situations with key suppliers that we think we can manage that through the remainder of the year within a relatively small number. So, we don't expect that trend to continue. And if FX continues to go in the direction it has been, there might be a potential for that $100 million to be a little bit smaller by the end of the year, but we'll see how things progress at this stage. So, that gives you a little bit of the evolution and the history and where we are today. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. You may begin. Robert Barry : Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning. James Loree : Good morning. Robert Barry : Just I guess a couple of questions on tools volume and to reference your comment earlier on pricing experiments. How much volume do you think you picked up in tools this quarter with the price picking down one? And then, just a follow-up on the FlexVolt comments, it seems like the broader tools business is doing better and the momentum there is better. It seems like the outlook for FlexVolt should be kind of sharing in that, to the extent that end markets helping there. Any comments there on just how you're thinking about that outlook for FlexVolt versus the broader tools market? James Loree : We haven\u2019t changed our outlook for FlexVolt pretty much all year. We've been consistent with that, $300 million minus the $100 million for cannibalization. And feel good about that. We have a whole family of new SKUs coming out here in the next couple of months that\u2019s going to support continued growth in FlexVolt against comps that begin to get tough as we start to get into the September, October, November, December time frame. So \u2013 and Don, I think, hit the cannibalization subject pretty hard earlier. So, I think FlexVolt is a good story. It's going to be really good. And it's going to be supportive of the $300 million number growth. And we'll see what happens when the new SKUs come out. If they're really successful, that will be \u2013 it will be great. And then we have the fact that we have no answer yet in the marketplace to FlexVolt and we're almost a year in now. So, this is about building an install base. A battery system is about an install base. And getting that install base built means that it creates the foundation for future growth and future expansion. And if you recall, the whole concept of FlexVolt is eliminate cords from the job site. And the more speeders [ph] we can come out with over time where people use that battery system will be a definite competitive advantage here as we go forward. So, we're very excited about FlexVolt. We're thankful that the innovation was protected well enough, so that it could not be leapfrogged in short order. And I think it would be foolish to think that, sooner or later, a competitor or competitors won't come out with an answer of some sort, but the answer we've seen so far, which is 9 amp hour, 18 volt clearly has not been the answer to FlexVolt. Going to the \u2013 how much did the 1 point of negative price drive volume in tools? I think the volume has been pretty steady in kind of that 5% to 7% range all year. And frankly, for quite some time. And I think it's probably safe to say that maybe we got a point out of it or something like that at most. And so, the conclusion we've drawn is that the business runs nicely at a 5% to 7% kind of threshold or range of growth. And when we start pushing it up into the 8% to 9% range in total, it starts to put strain on the factories and the supply chain and freight and cost and things like that. So, we're probably better off running it in the 5% to 7% range to the extent we are able to do that without any significant pricing kind of promotion in that regard. So, I think that's pretty much about what we can say about the experiment. We're excited about the third quarter promotional calendar, which is something that we normally do in the second quarter. So, stay tuned. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Belfiore with UBS. You may begin. Chris Belfiore : Good morning, guys. Yeah, I just kind of have a follow-up to that kind of comment there and question. I mean, in terms of just the back half for Tools & Storage, I mean, a little bit better than mid-single digits, just trying to figure out where \u2013 it seems like it needs to kind of slow down from a volume standpoint. But, like, you just said there's promotional things going on in the third quarter. So, kind of how like price and like volume kind of pare out in the second half, any color on that? Donald Allan, Jr.: Yes. So, certainly, the comps are getting tougher as we get into the back half of the year. So, we've got to keep that in mind. But based on our current outlook, you're probably looking at a second half that\u2019s going to be around 6% organic growth for Tools & Storage. And so, it's kind of right in the middle of that \u2013 Jim just described, the sweet spot of the business currently today. Runs very well in that range of 5% to 7%. It might have a slight slam to 7%. We'll see how the year ends up, but it's kind of in that range of 6%, maybe up to 7%. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Wolfe Research. You may begin. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning, guys. James Loree : Good morning. Josh Pokrzywinski : Yeah. Not to beat FlexVolt to death, but, I guess, could you just, Jim, run us through some of the thoughts on cannibalization, just given that the dollar mix or I guess the price point is so much higher for FlexVolt versus corded. And I think even on the battery line, much higher as well. And maybe try to weave some of the commentary by inventory turns in that. I think a lot of what you saw last year and even in the early part of this year has been mostly channel fill versus turns. So, just how are those turning through the market and I guess, like I said before, how is that factoring into the price mix on FlexVolt relative to that cannibalization number? James Loree : First of all, let there be no confusion that the sell-through on FlexVolt is excellent. And really, it's not about growing inventory in the channel. The early first month or two obviously was sell-in as a result of a startup of an initiative. But the sell-through has been excellent and continues to be very strong. So, let me just put that one to bed. I think the one point that you really \u2013 you hit it on the head with FlexVolt is this is about share of wallet when it comes to cannibalization. And you have two wallets. You have the end users' wallet and you have the channel wallet. And that\u2019s what makes it so difficult to really predict what the cannibalization will be because, at the end, there's only a finite demand for power tools and there are competitive power tools out there and then there are power tools and there's FlexVolt. And we can't really analyze at this stage and may never be able to fully analyze what the impact is on cannibalization because of those various share of wallet items. And I think that you hit on the head was FlexVolt is more expensive. So, to the extent that people are buying more units of FlexVolt, they are more challenged to buy 20 volt or 18 volt type products in the marketplace. So, I don't think there's any clear or easy answers to the question, but what we're to monitor this is we're actually looking at point-of-sale in the non-FlexVolt areas, corded and cordless. And we haven't seen any dramatic decreases at this point in time, but I think we do see some decreases at the margin, and that\u2019s all we can really quantify. So, we'll keep an eye on it. We'll report back as we learn more and more, we do more analysis over time. But it's going to take several quarters before we can really pin down exactly what the impact is. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. You may begin. Ken Zener : Good morning, gentlemen. James Loree : Hey, Ken. Ken Zener : Taking that same line of questioning and adjusting a little bit, given your comments and that's a finite universe in terms of the SKUs, redefining the market is something Stanley has done very well and D\u1d07WALT in its history did very well. And ever since your analyst day, I\u2019ve been just constantly referencing back to Jeff Ansell's discussion around what FlexVolt is and where can it go. The idea that you're targeting small gas engines is something that is resonating with me. Not only because that\u2019s a new market for you, but also because of the savings you generated through the Black & Decker acquisition. Your margins today are nearly double a lot of your peers. So, are you too busy with Newell, with Craftsman to consider that proposition? What are your limits, I guess, because that's the real story behind Stanley is going into new categories, leveraging your operating platform versus others and acquiring a brand that\u2019s already established? James Loree : First of all, I would say that Craftsman brought many positive elements to the table. One of them is that it's complementary to exactly what you're talking about because prior to Craftsman we did not have a large gas engine or small gas engine lawn equipment power initiative. We did have the string trimmers and those types of things, but they were electric. So, this gets us into gas. And we're learning a lot about lawn and garden, as we speak, and we are experimenting with the application of DC brushless electric motor technology to lawn equipment. And we do think that there is a big future. But there are some technological breakthroughs that will have to occur relative to the cost of doing that. And so, there's a lot of work going on there. And the answer to the question, are we too busy with Craftsman? Actually, this is part of our busyness with Craftsman. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Redner with Bellman & Associates [ph]. You may begin. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. James Loree : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : I had two quick questions on the Tools & Storage segment. First, on the Newell side, I think you guys alluded to a retail load-in. And I just wanted to clarify that the prior guidance had no revenue synergies embedded in it. And then secondarily, your largest domestic customers, at least their stock prices have been impacted by some of the e-commerce plays that have unfolded in the home-improvement category.  Given that you guys sell to e-commerce as well as these large retailers, I was just curious to get your view on \u2013 if you think the pie in power tools as well as overall home-improvement is big enough for an e-commerce entrant as well as the legacy home centers to survive as you look out? James Loree : I\u2019ll take part two. Don can figure out a little bit more about part one and probably ask one clarification on that. But let me cover part two. So, we as the largest tool company in the world, and as Don mentioned earlier, have taken a pretty aggressive stance in terms of making sure that we participate in the e-commerce opportunity and I\u2019ll call it a transformation. And, of course, e-commerce has its limitations. However, we would be foolish to think that it's not going to be a substantial part of the market in the years to come. It already is a substantial part of the market. And as was mentioned earlier, we, back in 2010, elected to enter the e-commerce market in the US and we did it not only with traditional e-commerce players or player, but also with our traditional customers, especially the home centers. And the traditional home centers are forces to be contended with as it relates to e-commerce. My guess \u2013 I would never ever comment upon the health or survival of our large customers, but I would say that both home centers embrace e-commerce. And I think they have certain advantages and certain advantages relative to the pure e-commerce players. And therefore, without getting too much into those, but you think about omni-channel and the advantages that brings, and you look at the recent purchase of Whole Foods, and you scratch your head and say why did that happen, I think if you start to envision how omni-channel could play an important role in e-commerce. You could see an unfolding scenario that says there can be successful pure players and successful omni-channel players. And maybe it all gravitates towards omni-channel at some point. So, I think there probably are going to be lots of changes as time goes on. We are really well-positioned, largest e-commerce player in the tool industry by an order of magnitude, probably as much as an order of magnitude. And have developed skills and capabilities that we share readily with all our customers that are interested and now, as Don mentioned earlier, also internationally into the developing countries in Europe and the other developed countries in the world and the developing countries. And I think in the developing countries, what's interesting about e-commerce is that it will enable us in certain areas, such as China, where we don't have number one market share to take a fresh look at how does one go to market in that type of \u2013 with that type of an opportunity to leapfrog maybe traditional distribution channels. So, very, very interesting space. We've done a lot of analysis and review of e-commerce in the last year or so. We're very comfortable with our strategy there. And we look forward to that being a major growth driver for us as we go forward across our customer base. Donald Allan, Jr.: Yeah. So, the first question you had I think was around \u2013 Jim made a comment in his opening remarks about Newell and moving certain inventory from one DC to another, and that was really just part of the integration plan. There was no load into a customer. You might have misinterpreted those comments. It was really moving from one of our DCs to another to improve the service fill rate levels because when we initially acquired Newell, fill rates were much lower than what we would want them to be. And so, we've been aggressively \u2013 the Tools & Storage team has been aggressively working on this since the first day of acquisition and has made significant progress in that regard. But there hasn\u2019t been any load in or anything into our customers related to new products. It's simply part of the integration, something that we had on the plan before the closing occurred. If that doesn't answer your question, feel free to call Dennis and Greg and they can clarify anything else you had. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet. You may begin. Michael Wood : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019ll just shift gears to Security. Now that you\u2019ve made your strategic decision there for the segment, just curious if there is opportunity to tweak any country by country exposure or are you with that portfolio now? And also, if you can just give some comment on the 2% of the acquired recurring business, if that was opportunistic or we should expect that to continue going forward? Donald Allan, Jr.: Yes. So, I'll take that one initially and Jim can add new color on the first part of your question. Right now, we actually feel pretty good about the country makeup of the Security business. We don't see any countries that are major concerns for growth and profitability. We do watch that on an ongoing basis and evaluate it every year as part of our strategic update planning process. There are a few small countries in Europe that over time we have to decide, can we build a level of substance in infrastructure within those country that make them a player, whether either number one or number two in the marketplace, because we have a few smaller ones right now that are not in that position. If that didn\u2019t play out the way we wanted to, then that could be something we evaluate in the future. The second part of your question, yeah, we occasionally do these opportunistic RMR acquisitions in our security \u2013 electronic security business where we see them as nice additions to the portfolio, that integrate right into our infrastructure, and we will continue to look for those at the right price and the right financial returns. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. You may begin. Michael Wood : Yeah, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the good quarter. James Loree : Thank you. Michael Wood : Just to pick up on the European \u2013 on the Security business, I was wondering if you can just talk about the European security business in particular. And you provided some outlook through 2017.  But looking further forward in 2018, can you just talk about your growth prospects and has perhaps something changed competitively? And then, if I could just add one quick one on \u2013 you called out Mac Tools as a source of strength. I know you added some storage product initially there. Was that what was driving the growth or you\u2019ve seen something else that\u2019s driving Mac's strength? James Loree : Yeah. On Mac Tools, this has been an ongoing, multi-year, steady execution, improvement. We have a difficult relative market share position. So, it makes it that much more challenging. But we've added trucks. Our sales per truck, every year there, they're are improving dramatically. And it's just a kind of a more slugfest over time. A steady slugfest. And even with all that, we're getting kind of mid-single digit growth. We had a pretty good quarter this quarter, a little better than usual. But it's basically three yards and a cloud of dust in Mac Tools. That\u2019s the way that businesses is for us. We love it, but it's not going to be an 80-yard wide receiver touchdown in one quarter. So \u2013 and with that, I\u2019ll have to \u2013 Don, you can tackle the first part. Donald Allan, Jr.: Yeah. So, Security Europe, specifically around organic growth, we had said for Security in general, and it applies to Europe, is that we believe it's a business that right now based on its current makeup, it can grow organically 2% to 3% on a consistent basis. And Europe had demonstrated that type of trend up until this year, where they\u2019ve seen a little bit of pressure in France, which is one of their larger markets that we think is just more market related and one time in history in the sense of \u2013 it's just really impacting this year. But we still think that\u2019s the right growth prospects for the business both in Europe and globally. But more importantly, as you\u2019ve heard at our investor day back in May, we have to continue to work on the next evolution of Security, which is getting into other areas that are very unique solutions that specialize touch to a customer at higher value and ultimately add to more positive mix to this business over the journey of the next three to five years plus. And so, we need to do both of those things. But I think that\u2019s the type of thing that maybe could move the business beyond 2% to 3% organic growth. But right now, that roadmap is not completely defined, but certainly well underway. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. End of Q&A: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thanks for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's third quarter 2017 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, Executive Vice President and President of Global Tools & Storage. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to on the call, are available on the IR section of the website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim, Don, and Jeff will review our third quarter 2017 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. And as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree. Jim Loree : Thanks, Dennis. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. As you saw from this morning's release, we delivered a strong third quarter continuing our track record of a solid execution. In fact this is the 16th consecutive quarter where we have met or exceeded expectations. Tools & Storage and Industrial led the way, once again contributing a robust organic growth performance which was 7% for the quarter. Total company revenue growth came in at 14%. Acquisitions delivered nine points of growth which includes the offset from the impact of the mechanical security divestiture. Tools & Storage delivered 22% total growth, including 9% organic. All regions contributed to the continued growth and share gains of this franchise. And of note was the acceleration within emerging markets which produced 16% organic growth in the quarter and mid-teens growth in all three regions Latin America, Asia, and the rest of the emerging world. The tools folks are executing superbly by leveraging our SFS 2.0 operating system to deliver core and breakthrough innovation with operating margin expansion, at the same time integrating the Lenox, Irwin, and Craftsman brands into our portfolio. This was an outstanding effort by Jeff Ansell and the entire Tools & Storage team. Jeff, as mentioned, he is with us today on the call and will be providing some more color. And looking forward, we expect to benefit from a series of growth catalyst in Tools, including DC brushless, FlexVolt, the Newell Tools acquisition, and beginning in mid-2018 the Craftsman brand. The Industrial segment delivered a significant outperformance for the quarter continuing its 2017 trend of strong results. Organic growth at 8% was impressive. And in Engineered Fastening, we continued to see robust automotive system sales in addition to higher industrial volumes which supported 6% organic growth for the quarter. Our infrastructure businesses delivered 15% organic growth, an outstanding performance as commercial actions, plus positive underlying markets benefited both project and inspection activity within oil and gas and expanded hydraulic tools volumes. Our total company operating margin rate remained healthy at 15.3%. Excluding M&A related charges, a 10 basis point expansion versus the third quarter of 2016, we continue to focus on investing in future growth, while generating meaningful operating leverage. In this thing, productivity execution and other cost actions enabled us to offset increasing commodity inflation, while expanding our gross margin rate by 60 basis points. The strong innovation fueled growth positioned us to continue to make a series of targeted investments to support future innovation, growth, and margin expansion. Diluted adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.95, 16% above prior year reflecting strong operational execution. So I want to thank our teams around the globe for their dedication and results driven work that produced this great quarter and year-to-date performance. And based on the above market organic growth and our confidence in the outlook for the balance of the year, we're once again rising the mid-point of our previous 2017 full-year adjusted EPS guidance this time by $0.10 with a new range of $7.33 to $7.43 or between 13% to 14% growth. And now I'll turn to an update on the acquisition of Lenox and Irwin businesses, as well as the Craftsman Brand. In a nutshell, we remain at or ahead of our expectations both from a financial and integration execution perspective. Specific to Newell Tools, we continue to execute on our plans to integrate employee, suppliers, and customers, into our existing operations. We remain focused on and confident in our ability to capture the $80 million to $90 million of cost synergies associated with this transaction. We're deploying core SFS principles into production facilities and are in the late stages of moving order fulfillment into our own distribution centers. We're happy to report that our actions to improve customer service levels across the Lenox and Irwin product lines have been successful and we are now experiencing fill rates commensurate with the strong performance of our legacy brands across the portfolio. In addition our commercial teams around the world are building detailed plans to support future revenue synergies. And we remain optimistic that a meaningful contribution in that area is achievable in 2018 and beyond. Now turning to Craftsman. We are hard at work bringing our vision for this great brand to life. We continue to make progress on Craftsman product development, supply chain deployment, and commercial strategy. We have now extracted all of our Craftsman supplier management activities from Sears and are fulfilling orders through a new distribution center in Charlotte. Importantly, in the last few weeks, we reached agreement with a major U.S. retailer on a program which features a 2018 rollout for the new brand. Jeff will provide more color on this in a few minutes. We are excited about the opportunity ahead as we re-Americanize this iconic brand and are looking forward to it coming to life beginning in mid-2018. So as you can tell there is a growing momentum and continued enthusiasm for both of these transactions as catalysts and we continue to find ways to deliver significant and sustained value to our customers and in turn our shareholders. And I'll now turn it over to Don for a more detailed review of the third quarter results. Don Allan : Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. I'll now take a deeper dive into the results of our business segments which enabled the company to deliver another outstanding performance in the third quarter. Starting with Tools & Storage, revenues were up 22% in the quarter as 9% organic growth, 13 points of acquisitive growth, and one point of currency combined to more than offset one point impact from divestitures. Pricing was slightly positive for the quarter. The operating margin for this segment was robust at 17.8% as benefits of volume leverage and productivity more than offset growth investments and commodity inflation, yielding a 40 basis point rate expansion versus the prior year. Importantly, the organic growth and related share gains were experienced across each Tools & Storage region and SBU. On a geographic basis, North America was up 9% organically with strong performances across all channels, U.S. commercial and retail channels posted high-single-digit growth, while our industrial and auto repair markets generated mid-single-digit growth. Additionally Canada contributes solid organic growth of 10%. North America's growth continued to be fueled by new product introductions across the portfolio and strong commercial execution. POS was up low-double-digits while inventory within our major customers was in line to slightly below prior year levels, giving us confidence that the strong selling was supported by strong underlying demand. Europe delivered another solid performance with 5% organic growth. Nine out of the 10 markets grew organically with double-digit performances in Iberia and Central Europe and solid mid-single-digit performances in the UK and France. The team continues to leverage our portfolio of brands and expand our retail relationships to produce sustained above market organic growth. Finally, as Jim mentioned, the emerging markets delivered an outstanding 16% organic growth. With mid-teen growth across all regions, diligent pricing actions as well as the ongoing MPP launch across the developing markets continued to support growth. We continue to see the e-commerce channel increase its share of the market and become a larger contributor to the business. Latin America was very strong headlined by double-digit growth in Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, and Peru, while Mexico and Chile delivered high-single-digit results. In emerging markets outside of Latin America, we experienced strong performances as well. For instance, our change to a direct selling model within Turkey and Russia are now paying dividends as both delivered exceptional growth within the quarter. Also India and China posted double-digit growth in Q3. This emerging market performance is quite impressive considering the team overcame challenges relating to natural disasters and geopolitical events yet still delivered broad-based share gains in the quarter. Within the Tools & Storage SBUs, all lines demonstrated positive growth in the quarter. The power tool and equipment growth was up 10%, led by professional power tools as well as continued strength on the outdoor segment. This SBU also benefitted from new product introductions reflecting core innovation and FlexVolt and combined with strong commercial execution. Regarding FlexVolt, this breakthrough innovation continues to deliver growth aligned with our expectations. Based on year-to-date sales and new product launches, we remain confident in our ability to deliver revenues approaching $300 million in 2017, as we discussed last quarter. We believe the impact of cannibalization on our corded products has been minimal and the program has carried positive benefits across the D\u1d07WALT brand. This is evidenced by above market growth on our corded products as well as our base 20 volt system. This bodes well for the Tools team's ability to deliver ongoing share gains. Our Hand Tools, Accessories & Storage organization generated 7% growth on new product introductions while benefiting from strong performances within the construction and industrial end markets. This team continues to deliver a stream of core innovation, while leading the integration activity for our Lenox, Irwin, and Craftsman brands. So in summary, an outstanding quarter for the Tools & Storage organization continuing its momentum by delivering solid above market organic growth along with operating margin expansion of 40 basis points, an outstanding quarter. Turning to the Industrial segment which had another impressive quarter of outperformance as well as both the Engineered Fastening and infrastructure businesses delivered strong organic growth well in excess of our expectations. This top-line performance contributed to 120 basis points expansion and operating margin rate which was driven from volume leverage, productivity, and cost control. Engineered Fastening posted 6% organic growth during the quarter fueled by strong automotive and industrial results up low-double-digits and mid-single-digits respectively. Within automotive, growth was led by higher than expected system shipments to support new model launches primarily in Europe and Asia. Spare system orders were also stronger than expected driving the overall automotive outperformance. In auto fastener, sales delivered content gains and outpaced light vehicle production by approximately 500 basis points which was better than our long-term assumption of approximately 300 basis points to 400 basis points of growth ahead of this type of production. Finally, industrial fastener growth reflected positive market conditions and enhanced commercial actions with our industrial focused customers. Moving to the infrastructure businesses, they posted a solid quarter up 15% organically. Hydraulic tools grew 37% as they continue to see the benefits from the execution of a successful commercial action as well as an improved market environment. This performance reflects commercial excellence and in action as all regions contributed to the businesses fourth consecutive and highest quarter of organic growth. Meanwhile oil and gas generated 8% organic growth in the quarter driven by onshore pipeline project extensions in North America and increased global inspection activities. The inspection business continues to outperform as the team's commercial efforts have grown this business over 60% organically year-to-date. All of these activities more than offset a continued and expected decline in the offshore project activity. Finally, the Security segment delivered flat organic growth for the third quarter as gains in Europe were offset by a decline in North America. Europe organic growth was up 1%, as strength in the Nordics and UK were offset by anticipated ongoing weakness in France. North America organic growth was down 1% as strong healthcare related growth was more than offset by the impact of customer directed project delays and hurricane disruptions within the commercial electronic security business. The impact of these external headwinds approximated three points of organic growth for the North American business. Our expectation is that these are timing issues which will resolve themselves over the coming quarters. In terms of the profitability the segment declined 240 basis points year-over-year. The sale of the mechanical lock business drove approximately 100 basis points of this contraction. The remaining 140 basis points decline was attributable to the previously mentioned customer driven project delays and modest levels of investment to support long-term growth. The Security team remains focused on innovation along with commercial and operational effectiveness to position the business for future revenue growth and margin expansion. Let's take a look at the quarter's free cash flow performance on the next page. For the third quarter free cash flow was $266 million which brings our year-to-date performance to $190 million. The lower year-to-date results compared to the prior year relate primarily to higher levels of working capital required to service the stronger organic growth we are experiencing particularly within the Tools & Storage business. From a working capital term perspective we delivered 6.4 turns in the third quarter, a decrease of 0.7 turns versus the prior year. This decline reflects the impact of our recent portfolio activity, specifically the acquisition of the Lenox, Irwin, and Craftsman Brands. Excluding acquisition and divestures turns were flat versus the prior year. We remain confident in our ability to deliver strong cash flow in the fourth quarter given our core SFS principles and focused execution on reducing working capital levels in line with Q4 seasonal activity. For those that have followed our business for the past several years, you know that the fourth quarter Tools & Storage seasonality dynamic is a regular occurrence, given the timing of the sales and the collections that occur within the quarter. We expect by the end of 2017 that we will deliver a 2.5 working capital turn improvement up from the 6.4 turns reported this quarter. This working capital result will generate $575 million of cash flow benefit in Q4 which will enable us to approximate and approach 100% free cash flow conversion. As a note this conversion rate excludes a net gain from divestitures. So now let's turn to our 2017 guidance on the next slide. As Jim mentioned earlier, we are raising the 2017 adjusted EPS midpoint by $0.10 and tightening the outlook range. Therefore our revised guidance range is $7.33 to $7.43, which is an increase of 13% to 14% versus prior year. On a GAAP basis this results an $8.20, $8.30 earnings per share which is inclusive of various one-time charges and the gains and losses on the sales of business. The increase to our outlook range is primarily the result of higher organic growth, now approaching 6% for the full-year, offset partially by increased other net expenses, primarily related to foreign exchange losses and certain balance sheet positions caused by the recent volatility in currency markets. Turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page organic growth within Tools & Storage is now expected to be high-single-digits given the solid year-to-date performance and outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect healthy construction markets in the U.S. combined with continued stable European and emerging market environments to continue for the balance of the year. We believe the top-line growth will translate into an improved margin rates year-over-year as well. We're maintaining the organic growth view on Security of low-single-digits in 2017. The margin rates of this segment will be down year-over-year due to the divestiture of the mechanical locks business which occurred during the first quarter, along with the impacts of mix both geographic and customer mix as well as the growth investments. Finally in the Industrial segment we expect organic growth to be up mid-single-digits, modestly higher than our previous expectation. While we did see outperformance in both engineered fastening and infrastructure again in Q3 there are market related pressures which will impact the fourth quarter. These pressures fall into three primary categories. The first declining North America light vehicle production, second, less automotive system sales due to lower new model introductions, and three, expectations for lower North American oil and gas project activity in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect operating margins within the Industrial segment to improve for the entire year which will affect the solid year-to-date performance. So in summary we believe we have a solid path to deliver the full-year revised guidance which contemplates continued above market organic growth and margin expansion while our businesses remain focused on working capital turn improvement in Q4 and acquisition integration. We also believe we are taking the appropriate actions to position the company for earnings growth, margin expansion, and strong cash flow in 2018 consistent with our long-term financial objectives. With that I would like to turn the call over to Jeff for a brief update on Tools & Storage and some exciting news related to Craftsman. Jeff Ansell : Thank you, Don. 2017 is shaping up to be a strong year for global Tools & Storage. We delivered organic growth at every region, every strategic business unit, and with all of our top customers. In fact, we've received vendor awards for more than 10 of our largest customers this year. Our brands continued to perform well on a global basis. With brands like Black & Decker, Stanley, Porter-Cable, and Mac Tools, all up single-digits while brands like Proto, Vidmar, and D\u1d07WALT all grew double-digits. Innovation is a clear differentiator using D\u1d07WALT as an example; we've posted 3% growth this year in the declining corded power tool market simply based upon our Made in USA strategy. Add to this, over 20% year-to-date growth in our world's largest and best 20 volt cordless range, which continues to expand with our cord innovation focus. Finally add over 100% growth in our technologically superior flexible range. All in all it's a formidable share gain machine from top to bottom as demonstrated by at least two times market POS growth. All of this has occurred concurrent with the integration of the second and fourth largest acquisitions in our company's history namely Irwin, Lenox, and Craftsman brands. With this as a backdrop, I'm pleased to provide an update on an initiative that will be a catalyst for further organic growth to Craftsman brand. Over the past six months, we built a completely dedicated team to bring our vision of a new re-Americanized Craftsman delight. This team is responsible for the development of a best ever craftsman product pipeline to reinvigorate the iconic Craftsman brand. As Jim mentioned earlier, we continue to make great progress on Craftsman product development, supply chain deployment, and commercial strategy which includes the full support of Ace Hardware through their 2,800 stores supporting Craftsman. Today, we're also pleased to announce that we will roll out the Craftsman brand in the second half of 2018 with Lowe's in the home center channel. We have been more than impressed with the level of commitment and support afforded by Lowe's for the Craftsman brand. We continue working with other channel partners to continue to provide them with successful programs to facilitate their growth as well. With this said, I would like to turn the call back over to Jim to wrap up today's presentation. Jim Loree : Thank you, Jeff. Another extraordinarily strong quarter for Tools & Storage and an exciting development in connection with Craftsman brand. To recap for the total company, we delivered strong third quarter results maintaining our trend of above market organic growth and robust operating margin performance. Facilitated by our continued strong operating results, we increased EPS guidance for the year excluding charges and the gain on the sale of mechanical security we up guidance to $7.38 at the midpoint, a 13% increase over the prior year, and we continue to be excited about the opportunities to deliver value from our recent acquisitions. And as I mentioned earlier, both the Newell tools and Craftsman brand integrations remain on track and the experienced integration teams are energized to deliver our financial and customer commitments. Our deep and agile leadership team along with our entire employee base are focused on closing out 2017 with a good set up for 2018 leveraging our SFS 2.0 operating system to deliver strong free cash flow, organic growth with earnings leverage and continuing to successfully integrate the Lenox, Irwin, and Craftsman brands into our portfolio. We're encouraged by our results thus far in 2017 as we continue to position the company for a strong 2018. A little over one year into the role as CEO I could not be more pleased with the energy and enthusiasm from the team as we remain focused on delivering top quartile performance becoming known as one of the world's great innovators and demonstrating our commitment to social responsibility. These are all enablers to achieve our 22/22 vision and to be a great human centered diversified industrial company. And on a final note, I would like to thank Greg Waybright for his many years of dedicated service as our VP of IR. He is retiring at the end of this month to be succeeded by the very capable Dennis Lange. All the best Greg in your retirement and we're now ready for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Dennis Lange : We can now open the call for Q&A please. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. You may begin. Jeff Sprague : Good morning. Just looking for a little bit more detail on Craftsman if you could share it, if you have any preliminary thoughts on what channel fill or year one revenue could look like? And also I think you were planning on marrying this with the Craftsman specific e-commerce strategy and I wonder if you flush that out anymore yet? Thank you. Jim Loree : So the advantage of being able to talk about Craftsman at the level we did is that it enables our partner loves to be able to report what could be a material item to their -- in connection with their releases and so forth. It really we would have preferred actually not to have to disclose as much as we actually did right now just from the standpoint of competitive intelligence, protection of our competitive strategy, and so forth. So it makes it very difficult to go into too much more detail. But with that I will turn it over to Jeff and he will give you whatever else he can. Jeff Ansell : Thanks, Jim. I guess the view would be Craftsman is a broad-based brand across North America, plays across so many categories and channels. And given that we serve every geography well over 50,000 discrete customers, we're very proud to announce this partnership with Lowe's in the home center channel. We are concurrently working through the commercial process across other channels which includes e-commerce. We do well know that Craftsman is the number one search term in e-commerce -- in e-commerce space; it also is a great brand across MRO spaces et cetera. So a lot of good work to be done as Jim reported, we announced everything we could to this point but Craftsman continues to be a good opportunity across many different customers and channels. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. You may begin. Nigel Coe : Thanks, good morning. Greg congratulations. I just want to say Greg has been -- was one of the best IRs and big loss but Dennis is awesome, so I think you're good. So just want to clarify your FlexVolt conversation, you had previously said $3 million of growth, $2 million in that. Are we now closer to $300 million net for the year? So if you can just clarify that. My question is really on just a follow-up on Jeff's point on Craftsman; I think your original kind of plan was for 2020 sales of $300 million to $400 million for Craftsman. Given the conversations you've had with your e-commerce and big-box partner, where do we stand there now? I'm assuming it's higher than that but any sense there would be helpful? Jim Loree : I'll start the FlexVolt and then kick over the Craftsman question to Jeff. But FlexVolt as I indicated we're approaching $300 million for the full-year of 2017. We do not believe we are seeing very much cannibalization I said minimal, probably minimal close to zero and therefore from that perspective, the net number would be $300 million. Jeff? Jeff Ansell : In regard to Craftsman second question was I guess at this point there is still much work yet to be done. We build a dedicated team of well over 100 folks to do the really good work of building out as we call it a re-Americanized best ever Craftsman platform and what that means is we're starting with a parcel of land overlooking the ocean with no structure on it as an example. So much work to be done. But the great news is you take a 90-year emotionally charged brand like Craftsman, and you can build it from the ground up very rare that you have that opportunity. So there is so much to be done with thousands of products in development that I think that 2018 looks like really a labor of love to us at this point with much great work to be done. But we remain on track probably for the second half of next year and we feel really confident about the guidance we previously presented around Craftsman growth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. You may begin. Ken Zener : We've recently done a piece on the tool industry noting the consolidation of brands over the last 30-plus-years and obviously think you are well positioned within that environment. Given the success that Black & Decker merger ultimately provided you're high margins to hand drills indicate that's still an upward trajectory this year and now Craftsman and I walk into Ace Hardware it's pretty much just you all. And with Lenox and Irwin I mean you\u2019re now into that accessories business which is very well, it's been very okay now it's consolidating. What do you think your appetite for bringing in perhaps another power brand into your portfolio as you look to move into gas; I think that's probably that Jeff touched on at the Investor Day. You have the brands to get into gas today. Jim Loree : Yes. So let me just sort of circle back and talk about what our strategy is from an M&A perspective and I think that will help put things in context. So the first element of our strategy is protect the core. And I think you've seen as assets have become available, quality assets in the tool business which is part of our -- significant really most significant part of our core, we had been agile and made some moves that have been designed to not only protect but also enhance the core. And I think one of the things that's hard for people to understand and I think maybe you got a little bit of it from listening to Jeff is the absolute amount of effort that goes into integrating something like even like a Lenox or a Irwin but when you talk about Craftsman starting from literally nothing more than a brand, a history, and three people which is what we got with that that is an enormous undertaking and we're so pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making along the way here to do the design work and the supply chain work and the commercialization and so forth. But it is very consuming for the organization and I have never seen including at the time that we integrated Black & Decker and Stanley, I have never seen the organization work so hard, so diligently, and produced so much and so right now it is almost impossible to imagine we get further on down the pike, probably another year, year-and-a-half something like that, when the organization has more bandwidth to think about doing something else in Tools whether the Lawn & Garden which has now become essentially part of the core as a result of the Craftsman acquisition or whether it be some other assets that might be out there available in the future. And then so the second part of our strategy is really to make sure that we continue our progress to invest in some other areas outside of Tools in -- that are also parts of our core, important parts of our core. So things areas such as Industrial and in Security and we fully intend to be feeding those segments or those businesses, franchises with capital and allocate the acquisition capital into those segments where it makes sense. And so one of the nice advantages of being a diversified industrial company is that enables us to direct capital in different parts of the portfolio based on availability of assets but also bandwidth of the organization and financial capacity of the company to absorb. So hope that's helpful but I think it basically says that it will be a while before we endeavor into something like Lawn & Garden or some other tool areas. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. You may begin. Rich Kwas : And Dennis, look forward to continue to work with you. Just on Craftsman as we think about the next couple of years with limited detail around revenue contribution et cetera and no detail around revenue contribution but as we think big picture incremental for Tools & Storage, should we think about dampening effect at least in the initial years of the launch because of cost and integration, et cetera, and getting up to speed from a marketing standpoint? And just broad, Don or Jim, around how we should amount [ph] of incrementals over the next 12 to 18 months within the segment? Don Allan : Sure, I will take that Rich. It's a very good question and a good point. The -- as Jeff and Jim both articulated very well, we're probably excited about this relationship and it's one of many steps as we continue to build out the plan for Craftsman. But as we enter into the execution of Craftsman, it will clearly be margins that will be below line average initially for various different reasons, we will not be manufacturing a lot of the product initially, we will be using sourcing model in the first year or two, then we will begin the ramp up manufacturing in that same timeframe. That will help margin and continue to improve them, we will also have launch cost like to do with all major initiatives that will pressure margins as well. So we don't think it will be major dampening impact in the Tools margin but it certainly will have a modest negative impact in 2018, and likely in at least the first half of 2019 if not the full-year of 2019. Difficult to quantify the impact at this stage as we're still working through as Jeff mentioned -- exactly how the launch and the timing and what products will go in with Lowe's and with other customers still to be determined. But over time we will provide more clarity as we get deeper into providing guidance for 2018 and then further into 2018 throughout the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Wolfe Research. You may begin. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just on the Lowe's launch, trying to dig in here on may be some of the opportunity set in ring-fencing that $300 million to $400 million target you have a couple of years out. Given that I think DIY U.S. for you guys and individual big box retailer would be something north of a billion, one would think that just given some of the limited overlap particularly on Lawn & Garden that you could have a pretty big number initially, just with channel sale, I mean is that an unfair way to think about it or is that the price point so much lower in Lawn & Garden versus Power Tools that it shifts the curve I guess I'm surprised that that number might not be bias to the upside, just given the magnitude of even one big DIY launch? Jim Loree : I think Jeff said it all, it's early days here and the amount of specifics even as it relates to the Lowe's conversations, our TBD in terms of a lot of work still to be done, so it's hard to really come out and answer that question with anything specific other than say that when we put the $1 billion over 10 years out there on the -- when we announced the acquisition and when our board approved the acquisition on that basis, we really didn't really fully know how the customer conversations would evolve. So I think it's fair to say that we thought we were being conservative when we put those numbers on the table. But as it relates to the timeframe, the profitability, the ramp, all these types of things, it's just too early but we will keep you posted as we get more clarity as time goes on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Saliq Khan with Imperial Capital. You may begin. Saliq Khan : Hi, Jim, kind of getting away from Craftsman looking at the Security business, could you provide us a bit more detail on what the free cash flow profile looks like and what are some of the efforts and progress that you have in place to help you drive this in new markets and new customer segments, so you can better leverage the channel partnerships particularly as you look into the next year? Jim Loree : Well it's always; Security is always a great cash flow business for us because we're in the commercial security business and in commercial security the customer pays for the installation as opposed to residential security where historically the vendor, if you will, has paid for the CapEx upfront. So cash flow is a great stream and the recurring revenue is a dependable stream as well. So the existing business we will call it the core commercial security business, it's a good business but what's happening in the digital world and I think as everybody knows is the advent of Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, I could go on we all are familiar with the laundry list of new technologies that are facilitating great value creation for customers be that commercial or otherwise, but in this case I think the fact that they would be commercial is relevant. And I think we have a really, really great asset that we can leverage to become an integrator for those types of technologies in specific applications, specific areas, and not only that but to also develop recurring revenue streams that are differentiated -- the value proposition are differentiated and recurring revenue streams will continue. So I think we will end up with a core commercial security business that we have today that will be enhanced through innovation and sustainable for a long period of time. And on top of that, I think we will start to see the emergence of a growth oriented higher technological content business that is scalable and will develop an ecosystem. That will take some time but we are doing everything on our power to accelerate that and to make sure that as the market unfolds that we have a position deployed in that market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Belfiore with UBS. You may begin. Chris Belfiore : Good morning guys. Greg, thanks for all your help, it's been a pleasure. And I look forward to working with Dennis again. So just kind of wanted you to kind of go talk a little bit on pricing especially in Tools and business -- in Tools & Storage business just lot of the other headwinds you're seeing out there some of the distributors that we cover but it's been relatively flat year-to-date you had commodity headwinds continues, so just kind of a little color on the pricing environment and then maybe kind of how we can expect that to the price cost equation to kind of see as we kind of move into next year? Don Allan : Sure. I will start and then we will pass it over to Jeff to provide a little more color but we had a third quarter that was slightly positive for price in Tools & Storage. Within that if you kind of break it apart; you have a North American business that had kind of a normal promotional activities that occur in the quarter. So there was some negative price, a lot of close to a point in North America. And then outside of North America we had positive pricing actions that offset that due to various different things such as commodity inflation, currency movements et cetera. And so the net result was a slight positive. So that's just to give you a little more detail. As we go into next year, we actually see a fair amount of commodity inflation coming into the mix. As I've mentioned before we had about $100 million, it looks like, next year. Now the number looks to be closer to $150 million of commodity inflation. And we're in the process now of looking at what additional pricing actions we can take in response to that. If you look at our history we probably get anywhere from 60% to 70% of price recovery in year one but we're looking at how we can be more aggressive and make that number much closer to 100%. But as you all know it's a process that takes quite a bit of time working with our customers. Jeff any additional color? Jeff Ansell : Maybe the only thing to add would be bit on the process. So when it comes to an inflationary environment from a commodity perspective, as Don just described, our first action is to do everything possible inside of our network to drive productivity to attack those costs and the things that we can cover we certainly pass along in the way of price. So we work with our customers in that regard. We also get smarter as time goes on. So clearly the second and fourth quarter are the biggest promotional periods for any tool company, but probably 25% of all the programming that we do annually is eliminated in one year and change for the next. So we learned what worked, what didn't work, where we'll spend money, whether we had a good payback on that. And at least a quarter of what we do every year changes as we get smarter get more experience et cetera and we will continue to work those things so that we get the best possible payback for the investment of price that you mentioned. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. You may begin. Rob Wertheimer : Hi good morning. A lot of things happening that seem to be going quite well at once. Jim could you maybe give an overview of how you think about the process and progress in the breakthrough innovation centers, would you consider the staging whatever the next innovation it might be just given all the opportunities you have at Craftsman maybe there is something at Craftsman I don't know just maybe give us an update on that where I know that is lot percolating behind the scenes? Jim Loree : Yes. Well I'm actually quite thrilled with the innovation that's come out of our breakthrough innovation teams obviously FlexVolt was pilot and it really was major homerun. Some of the other innovations, a good portion of the other innovations are a little bit more on the periphery of our core. So an example would be the connected job site that we have put together. We have the world's best tech connected job site which brings Wi-Fi to construction projects and then it brings Internet of Things to projects and then construction sites and then brings intelligent analytics and interfaces with architectural design systems and even integrate things like augmented reality and so forth. Very exciting innovation they had worked really hard on it, it\u2019s been piloted three times unsuccessfully on different major construction sites. And so now it's time to scale it. And that's where I would say our biggest challenge comes in and what we're needing to do with this to make sure that we scale it appropriately is to create a more exponential oriented organization. So in the traditional organization in this case just came out of the power tool business. So you have power tool commercial people who have a history of great success commercializing power tools and now we're trying to sell connected job sites. Well it's a different skillset, the customers are the same but it's a different skillset and so we need partners, we need different skillsets in our own organization and we also need to liberate them, so they can go spend more money to scale it faster to the extent that we can afford that in our very measured kind of investment management ways that enables us to both achieve operating leverage on one end at the same time, make investments. I know there were some people on the phone this morning before the call, some of the analysts were saying well why didn't you get more operating leverage in tools, while we spent more money on investments for the future in tools and that's one of the big reasons and so that's kind of the challenge is really gauging from a financial standpoint but getting them enough capital and expense to liberate them to go often and scale appropriately when they created a great thing like the connect job sites. And then just providing a little different organizational model which we will talk more and more about in the coming quarters but we're doing some work with breaking out some exponential organizations from the traditional organization and I think that's going to be one of the key elements of the success in commercializing the breakthrough innovations that are not let's say necessarily right in the middle of the fairway. The FlexVolt is a battery system, the power tool commercialization people know how to commercialize battery systems, and the digital marketing folks from the digital accelerator down at Atlanta were very helpful in enabling that digital marketing approach for that project and it was just a fabulous combination of leveraging our existing resources. And some of the other innovations and not all of them, probably two or three, four of them are really into core and you will see them coming out over time in the traditional organization, but I think some other ones probably see a little different approach more of a silicon valley like approach to commercializing. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. You may begin. Robert Barry : Actually, just, first, had a quick follow-up on that prior question on price. I know last quarter you had talked about these pricing experiments switching price a little harder and then adjusting the volume impact. I'm just curious if that continued this quarter and then my question though was really on the core growth outlook, I mean last quarter you raised 50 bps that added $0.10 to EPS, I must say it was a little anti-climatic to see 150 basis points rise this quarter largely offset by this other net. Can you quantify and provide more color on what's going on there and then how did that line in the model track next year, would that be expected to step down materially in 2018? Thanks. Jim Loree : Okay. I will answer the part related to your question about the experiments, the pricing experiments then I will turn it over to Don. So I have promised myself and actually I promised my team as well never to say the word experiment in connection with pricing again after the brouhaha it created after the last call. So pricing is an iterative process and I think Jeff kind of addressed it already that Jeff is there anything else you want to say about that before we turn it over to Don for the second part of the question. Jeff Ansell : No, sir. Jim Loree : Okay. Then Don? Don Allan : Okay. So I will walk through a little of the detail. We had very good operating leverage in the quarter. So if there is a confusion on that we would be happy to walk through it after the call in more detail. But if you look at the revenue outperformance versus our operating margin outperformance we're pretty much in line with what we previously communicated if we have a point of revenue better than expected, what would drop through to O&M. So that conversion rate pretty -- which is pretty much in line with what we communicated which is anywhere between 25% and 35%. What happened in other net which is low operating margin is as I mentioned in my presentation was that we had some currency positions related to balance sheet items that sometimes as they get settled throughout the quarter based on currency movements you experience as gain or losses. In this case we had about $7 million to $10 million of losses in the third quarter from that activity. That put a little pressure on the additional EPS flow through but still $0.10 outperformance versus expectation versus may be $0.12 to $0.14 expectation, I still think that's an heck of an operating leverage performance. As far as what it means for next year, I continue to believe that we will grow in line with our long-term financial commitments and objectives, we have 4% to 6% organic growth, 10% to 12% EPS growth, and 100% free cash flow conversion. Those have been our long term financial objectives and I think next year at this stage even with $150 million of commodity inflation coming in to the mix next year with offsetting pricing actions of some magnitude I believe that we can hit those objectives. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. You may begin. David MacGregor, your line is open. Please check your mute button. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Redner with Bellman & Associates. You may begin. Scott Redner : Wanting to go back to LatAm, our emerging market growth in Tools & Storage, I was hoping you guys give a little bit more color kind of what in terms of distribution change was it kind of a one-time bump versus what's it go-forward rate just realizing that that business saw such trend this quarter? Jim Loree : Yes, it's more of an ongoing growth initiative than a one-time bump because the reason we made these changes is absolutely for the purpose of driving share gain and organic growth in Turkey and in Russia. So if you think about the approach that we used to have, we had a couple of major distributors and that was it. And I think it was one in Turkey and then a couple in Russia. And instead of blanketing the market with sales reps, end user demand stimulating activities and distribution, physical distribution centers. So we've gone from a kind of half baked approach to a full-frontal attack on those markets and so that it is a very sustainable approach and we should expect some pretty good growth out of those in regions notwithstanding any geopolitical turmoil that may occur in those very volatile regions in the years to come. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Shannon thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thanks for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

Baird Scott Redner - Bellman & Associates Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research Mike Wood - Nomura Instinet Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research Ken Zener - KeyBanc Capital Market David MacGregor - Longbow Research Operator : Welcome to the Fourth Quarter Full Year 2017 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's fourth quarter and full year 2017 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, Executive Vice President and President of Global Tools & Storage. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to on the call, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim, Don, and Jeff will review our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. And as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8K that we filed with our press release and our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree. Jim Loree : Thanks Dennis and good morning everyone, thank you for joining us. As you saw in this morning\u2019s press release, we delivered a solid fourth quarter performance bringing closure to an impressive 2017. The company continued is above-market organic growth trajectory and developed operating margin rate expansion, strong EPS growth and very good free cash flow conversion. This solid performance highlight the power of coupling our very developed organic growth machine with a return to acquisitions. We are encouraged and we believe that this trend will continue in to 2018.  Moving to the fourth quarter numbers, revenues were 3.4 billion, up 17%, with organic growth of 8%. Acquisitions added 9 points of growth and currency contributed 3 points. These factors were partially offset by the mechanical security divestiture. Tools and storage continued its strong contribution accelerating to 11% organic growth and 26% total growth.  With strength in all major geographies and business units, this performance reflects a vibrant series of growth initiatives around the globe and a stream of innovations that we have brought to the market place including FlexVolt.  As expected, industrial decelerated in the quarter to a still positive 2% organic, just ahead of our expectations. All three industrial businesses delivered growth in the fourth quarter, which was enough to more than offset anticipated declines in engineered fastening electronics business, as well as lower self-piercing rivet system sales. Security ended the year with 2% organic growth including modestly positive performances from both Europe and North America and Don will provide you with a deeper dive in to business level operating performance during his remarks.  Our total company operating margin rate excluding M&A related charges remained healthy and expanded 30 basis points versus prior year. EPS for the quarter was $2.18, a 27% expansion as strong operational execution was coupled with lower restructuring cost. Also noteworthy, we reached agreement in late December to purchase the industrial focused business of Nelson Fastener Systems for $440 million in cash.  The agreement excludes Nelson\u2019s automotive stud welding business and is a write down to fairway bolton for engineered fastening. Nelson increases our presence and the general and industrial end market expands our portfolio of highly engineered fastening solutions and will deliver significant cost synergies relative to its size.  Nelson\u2019s LTM revenues were approximately 200 million. The company employs about 700 people and operates 11 manufacturing sites. We expect that transaction to close in the first half of 2018 and look forward to integrating Nelson and adding scale and capabilities to engineered fastening.  Now let\u2019s turn to full year highlights, 2017 was a year of impressive financial performance, strong execution, and progress towards our strategic objectives our 2022 vision. Full year revenues were 12.7 billion, up 12% including a 7% contribution for organic growth, as well as a 7% contribution from acquisitions.  Our operating margin rate expanded 40 basis points to a record 14.8%. Productivity and cost reduction initiatives supported a 40 basis point expansion in gross margin despite nearly a $100 million of currency and commodity headwinds.  2017 was a case study of SFS 2.0 in action, innovation, commercial excellence and digital excellence fueled above market growth and margin expansion. That growth along with cost and asset efficiency from functional transformation and fuller SFS enabled us to continue to make targeted investments to support future innovation, growth and margin expansion, all-in-all a highly virtuous circle. Ex charges, diluted EPS for the year was $7.45, a 14% increase and a new record for Stanley Black & Decker. Free cash flow remained robust at 976 million and cash conversion came in at our target of approximately 100%.  Turning to portfolio strategy, 2017 was a year in which we executed several significant portfolio moves. The year began with a $725 million tax efficient mechanical security divestiture which was followed by the acquisitions of the Craftsman Brand and Newell Tools, which combined, totaled approximately $2.9 billion. In doing so we added three iconic brands, Lenox, Irwin and Craftsman, with a far greater future growth potential. Specific to Newell Tools, we continue to execute plans to integrate employees, suppliers and customers in to operations. We remain focused on and confident in our ability to capture the $80 million to $90 of cost synergies.  Our commercial teams continue to refine plans to pursue revenue synergies as well. In that regard we will move to global execution mode this year and begin to drive meaningful results in that area.  And turning to Craftsman, we continue to make great progress on product development, supply chain deployment and commercial strategy. The Tools & Storage folks along with our customers are in full bore execution mode of internally and with our partners and are confident that the mid-2018 rollout will be a successful relaunch of this incredibly strong brand, and additionally we made further substantive progress on the commercial strategy. And Jeff Ansell will provide some more color on that in just a few moments.  So as you can see, we remain on or ahead of our plans, as it relates to the integrations. In summary, 2017 was a really great year for Stanley Black & Decker. What a special performance by our 57,000 employees around the globe. I thank them for their dedication, agility and a will to win. Because it is our people to whom we attribute these great accomplishments. They live our purpose everyday with incredible passion.  2018 looks to be shaping up to be another strong year, as we celebrate our 175th year in business on a high note. We have generally supportive market conditions, with a few minor exceptions with in industrial, a strong pipeline of acquisitions, and organic growth initiatives developed in accordance with SFS 2.0. We have a cost and productivity focus that supports margin expansion and is the bedrock of our operating system as well as a host of new opportunities related to our innovation activities. And as always we have to navigate known headwinds such as commodity inflation and other unknown pressures that may arise.  We feel that we position the company for a successful 2018 nonetheless. And now I will hand it over to Don Allan, who\u2019ll walk you through segment performance, overall financials, and 2018 guidance. Don? Don Allan : Thank you Jim and good morning everyone. I will now take a deeper dive in to our business segment results for the fourth quarter. Starting with Tools & Storage, revenue were up 26% in the quarter, with an impressive 11% organic growth, 13 points of acquisitive growth, and 2 points of currency. The operating margin rate for this segment was robust ta 16.7% as benefits of volume leverage and productivity more than offset growth investments, commodity inflation and price to support normal holiday promotion, yielding a 50 basis points expansion versus prior year.  A strong organic growth and related share gains were experienced across each Tools & Storage region and [SBUs]. On a geographic basis, North America was 8% organically, with strong performances across all channels. The US commercial market generated double-digit growth, US retail channels close to high single digit growth, and their industrial and auto repair markets generated mid-single digit growth. Additionally Canada contributed solid organic growth of 8%.  North America\u2019s growth continue to be fueled by strong commercial execution and product introduction across the portfolio, including contributions from FlexVolt. We continue to see very little cannibalization impacts from both FlexVolt launch, and are seeing more positive indication that this is stimulating incremental demand for our DeWalt 20 volt cordless power tool system, while also not competing growth in corded products. Our shipments continue to be supported by strong demand in that channel, as North America POS was up mid-single digits and inventories within our major customers were also in line with prior year levels. Europe delivered another outstanding performance with 17% organic growth. 10 out of 10 markets grew organically with double digits performances in eight of the markets including the UK, France, Siberia, and Central Europe.  The team continues to leverage our portfolio of brands and expand on our retail relationships to introduce sustained above market organic growth. This performance exceeded our recent trend in mid-to-high single digit performances, as the region benefited from a strong holiday season.  Finally, emerging markets delivered in other center an outstanding organic growth of 17%, with all regions delivering double digit performances. Diligent pricing actions, continued e-commerce strength, and the ongoing [NPG] launch across the developing markets continue to support growth.  Geographically, Latin America was very strong, headlined by double digit growth in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, while Peru and Chile delivered high single digit results. Our change to a direct selling model within Turkey and Russia continued to fuel exceptional growth for those countries. In addition, Korean, Japan, Indian and China posted notable double digit growth.  Within the Tools & Storage SPUs all lines showed high single to double digit growth in the quarter. The Power Tool and Equipment group was 13% organically, whereby professional Power and Tool at 15%. This SPU also benefited from new product introductions reflecting core innovations as well as (inaudible), along with continued strong commercial execution.  Our hand tools, accessories and storage organization generated 9% across our new product introductions and strong performances within the construction and industrial and markets. The accessories segment was up 14%, while hand tools and storage delivered 8% growth. Another nice performance from this team, while they are also successfully continuing to integrate Lenox, Irwin and the Craftsman brand. So, in summary, truly an outstanding quarter and an outstanding year for the tools and storage organization. Jeff will provide some additional color on the full year in a few minutes.  Turning to industrial, this segment delivered 2% organic growth as Jim mentioned, slightly ahead of internal expectations. This topline performance contributed to an 80 basis points expansion in operating margin rate from volume leverage, productivity and cost control. Engineered fastening posted 1% organic growth during the quarter, with mid-single digit growth in automotive and industrial, which more than offset lower electronics volume. Within automotive, growth was led by continued penetration gains within fasteners, enabling organic growth well in access of light vehicle production. This more than offset the expected impact of lower self-piercing rivet system sales due to lower model rollover activity at our automotive customers.  Finally, the growth within general industrial fastener market reflected supported market conditions and enhanced commercial actions, and they won share gain within our customer base. The infrastructure businesses posted a strong quarter of 8% organic growth, hydraulic tools grew 19% as they continue to see the benefits from the execution of successful commercial actions as well as the support of market environment. This team continues to raise the bar for commercial excellence as all regions contributed to growth. Meanwhile, oil and gas generated 3% organic growth in the quarter, driven by North America auto wells and inspection projects activities which more than offset a continued and expected decline in offshore project activity.  The North American inspection business has been a relatively new driver for organic growth and our performance for oil and gas. The teams commercial have grown this business from approximately 15 million in 2016 to nearly 50 million this year.  Finally, the security segment delivered 2% organic growth during the quarter. North America organic growth was up 2% due to higher installation activity within conversion, security systems and higher product volumes within healthcare. Europe\u2019s organic growth was up 1% that strengthen the Nordic and UK was offset by anticipated ongoing weakness in France.  In terms of profitability the segment declined 200 basis points year-over-year. The sale of the mechanical lock business drove approximately 90 basis points of this contraction. The remaining 110 basis points decline was attributable to mix and modest levels of investment to support long term growth. The mix impact came about due to higher mix of installation revenues within CSS, lower software sales within healthcare and then [country mix] within Europe. It is important note, that this operating margin was consistent with the performance of the business over the last two quarters. Security team remained focused on innovation along with commercial and operational effectiveness to position the business for revenue growth and margin expansion in 2018. Let\u2019s take a look at free cash flow performance on the next page. In addition to the strong P&L performance, we were able to drive significant working capital improvements during the quarter. Our full year cash flow performance was strong as we generated 967 million in 2016-17. First in 2016, cash from operations declined 66 million, however this included a $261 million investment in working capital, which was $318 million higher than 2016 to support the strong, very strong level of organic growth, most notably within tools and storage. This impact was partially offset by higher cash earnings from the business.  In addition we saw our capital expenditures increase by 96 million in 2017, as we made investments to expand our manufacturing and distribution capacity, as well as investments to support acquisition integrations. This performance resulted in a free cash flow as a percentage of net income to be approximately a 100% when excluding the net gain on divestitures right in line with our stated financial objectives. On a working capital term perspective, we delivered 8.9 turns in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 1.7 turns versus the prior year. This decline reflects the impact of our recent portfolio activity, specifically the acquisition of both Lenox, Irwin and Craftsman brand. Excluding these acquisitions, turns were 10.6 times, consistent with our record 2016 performance.  Working capital management remains a key pillar SFS 2.0 operating system. We continue to drive working capital improvements across the company, with heavy focus on improving the performance of our recent acquisitions such as Newell Tools. We are confident in our ability to now bring our working capital turns back about 10 in the coming years. I would now like to take a minute to provide some comments regarding the recently enacted US tax legislation and its respected impact to the fourth quarter 2017 and fully year of 2018. We expect these changes to deliver a positive impact for the US economy and are very supportive of the improved worldwide cash mobility that comes with the territorial tax system, and finally encouraged by the benefits that come from the lower effective tax rate.  In the fourth quarter, we recorded a one-time $24 million net tax charge which is reflected in our GAAP EPS. This includes an estimated liability of $466 million to reflect the new territorial tool charge. As you know, this is payable over the course of eight years heavily weighted to 2022 and beyond. Partially offsetting this is the positive impact from re-measuring our net deferred tax liability positions at these lower tax rates. Keep in mind the regulatory guidance surrounding this new tax bill continues to be refined and the fourth quarter charge is based on current estimates. We finalize the overall impact during 2018 as we receive refined guidance from the US Treasury Department.  Now turning to the impact of the 2018 effective tax rate. The full benefit of the decrease in the US tax rate from 35% to 21% is estimated to be approximately five points on our effective tax rate. This benefit however is mitigated by approximately three points of tax costs on certain new provisions in the tax law as well as reduced benefits from previously allowed deductions.  Our guidance for 2018 will be based on the tax rate of approximately 18%, which is a $0.20 EPS benefit versus 2017. Hence the overall estimated impact from the new legislation is a two point benefit to our effective tax rate in 2018.  Now let\u2019s move deeper in to our 2018 guidance. Before I start this outlook is based on the first quarter adoption of two new accounting standards with respect to revenue recognition and pension accounting. For financial modelling purposes, we released a supplementary 8K this morning to provide the impacts of operating results and business segment information for 2016 and 2017. The impacts from these changes has a modest negative impact on our operating margin rates and is relatively neutral to EPS. We are targeting approximately 5% organic growth in 2018 which will result in an adjusted earnings per share range of $8.30 up to $8.50, which is an increase of approximately 13% versus the prior year at the mid-point, and we expect our free cash flow conversion to approximate a 100% again in 2018. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $7.80 up to $8, inclusive of various one-time charges related to M&A. You can see on the left side of this chart, we expect the benefits from organic growth to generate $0.50 to $0.60 of EPS accretion. This will be partially offset from $0.25 to $0.30 of net commodity inflation which includes approximately 150 million of commodity pressure, which will be offset by the impact from pricing actions that will begin to be reflected in the P&L as we move in to later stages of the second quarter. Across the full year this reflects a 60% to 70% price recovery.  Next we expect the net impacts of cost and productivity actions, acquisition accretion and a higher share count year-over-year to deliver a positive $0.45 to $0.50 in EPS. As previously mentioned, we expect a tax rate of approximately 18% and 80% which will deliver as I mentioned $0.20 in EPS secretion.  A few other housekeeping items I\u2019d like to review that we referred to other miscellaneous guided matters. The first of which we continue to anticipate approximately 50 million of core restructuring charges, which is consistent with the last few years. Second, we are forecasting approximately 155 million share outstanding for 2018. Finally, we expect the first quarter\u2019s earnings to be approximately 16% of the full year performance. This is about 130 basis points lower than last year.  The primary factor driving a lower percentage of full year delivery is that we continue to expect elevated levels of commodity inflation particularly in tools, but do not expect to see the price recovery benefit until we get in to the later stages of the second quarter and beyond. The net priced cost headwind for the first quarter is expected to be approximately $50 million. This impact is somewhat mitigated by lower below the line expenses year-over-year, due to one-time environment and pension charges that were taken in the first quarter of last year.  Now let\u2019s turn to the segment outlook on the right side of the page. Organic growth within Tools & Storage is expected to be mid-single digit in 2018. There are multiple organic growth catalyst including core innovation, continued benefit from flex fold, the start of Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies, emerging market growth and perhaps most exciting, the Craftsman Brand roll out in the second half of the year. Another positive factor is that we are generally seeing supportive markets across most geographies that we serve. We believe the topline growth will translate in to margin rate year-over-year. As many of you know the rollout of the Craftsman brand will have somewhat of a governing factor on how far we can push margins forward in tools next year, as it will begin at the low line average profitability. This dynamic is due to heavily relying on our outsource providers as we ramp up in the market place and overtime we will improve profitability as we enforce production.  In the industrial segment, we expect low single digit decline in organic growth, with an easier fastening expect to see relatively flat organic performance. We will see above market growth within automotive and industrial fasteners, but that will be offset by lower automotive system sales due to a decline in model rollovers at our automotive customers, and the residual comp issues within electronics most notably in 1Q. In oil and gas we expect to see a double digit decline due to lower onshore project activity across the pipeline market. And then within hydraulic tools we expect to see continued growth from our successful commercial action. With the teams proactive cost and productivity focused, we expect industrial operating margins to improve in this segment for the year.  Finally in the security segment, we are expecting the organic to be up low single digits in 2018, as the team continues the commercial momentum from 2017. This should translate in to improved operating margins year-over-year, as we drive our cost and service productivity focus.  So in summary, we believe that we are taking the appropriate actions to position the company\u2019s earnings growth and margin expansion in 2018, which is consistent with our long term financial targets. We remain focused on free cash flow generation, acquisition, integrations and the rollout of the Craftsman Brand. So as you can see there\u2019s a lot to be excited about in 2018.  With that I would like to turn the call over to Jeff for a few key full year Tools & Storage highlights and then a brief update regarding (inaudible). Jeff Ansell : Thank you Don. 2017 was a special year for our Tools & Storage business, including expansion of operating margins, while delivering 9% organic growth and 19% total growth. This translates to $1.4 billion in growth with approximately half coming from organic initiatives and half from acquisitions, an accomplishment that used to take years rather than months to achieve.  We delivered market leading innovation, quality, and commercial excellence, and as such we are recognized with vendor awards from the largest customers across every channel and every geography. We expanded our exclusive FlexVolt system which offers the user the power of corded with the freedom of cordless. This innovation spearheaded and accelerated dual growth across corded products, 20 volt cordless products and across the FlexVolt range itself.  The Volt was the only provider with growth across corded products as well as low and high voltage cordless products concurrently. Our stable of brands continued to perform well on a global basis. With Stanley Black & Decker, MAC Tools all up single digits, while [Turdo], Vidmar and DeWALT all expanded double digits. All of this occurred in consort with a successful integration of our second and fourth largest acquisition in our history, namely Irwin, Lenox, and Craftsman. To close the book on 2017, we delivered growth across every region, every channel, every strategic business unit and with all of our top customers. We integrated a complex carve-out in dual tools and build Craftsman from the ground up, all concurrent with delivery of our largest organic growth year in history.  Looking to 2018 and as I Jim mentioned earlier, I\u2019m also pleased to provide an update on our plans for the Craftsman brand going forward. During our October earnings call, we provided an update on the development of our Craftsman distribution strategy. That update included confirmation that Ace, we\u2019d support Craftsman across the hardware channel, and Lowes would support Craftsman across the home center channel. As we continue to develop and fine tune the strategy, we are pleased to confirm that we will also make Craftsman available via Amazon. With support from leading companies like Lowes, Ace and Amazon, we expect to make Craftsman available to far more users than any time in its 90 year history. Overall the support of the iconic Craftsman brand today is overwhelming.  Now I will turn the call back to Jim to wrap up today\u2019s presentation. Jim Loree : Thanks Jeff and great year, lots of exciting news and for the total company in summary 2017 was another strong year of execution and financial performance. And just to reflect one last time, 7% organic growth, 7% contribution from acquisitions, a 40 basis points expansion in operating margin rate, a record 14.8% and 14% EPS expansion.  We reshaped the portfolio with divestiture with mechanical security, purchase of new tools and the Craftsman brand and these transaction as Jeff said are on track and some of the exciting benefits from them are just on the horizon. And \u201918 is shaping up to be another strong year with 5% organic growth, 11% to 14% EPS growth and we are encouraged by the many, many organic growth catalyst across the company catalyzed by SFS 2.0 and a great execution team and also arising through our recent acquisitions.  And I\u2019d like to thank my senior management team, our 57,000 associates and all our stakeholders including the investment community for your strong support as I reflect back on 2017, my first full year as CEO. Our deep and agile leadership team along with our entire employee base remains focused, committed and supportive as we tackle 2018 to deliver strong, above market organic growth, with operating leverage and continue to successfully integrate these acquisitions and generate strong free cash flow. And additionally, we are energized, our team is energized by our company\u2019s purpose for those who make the world to achieve our 2022 vision and to strife to become known as one of the world\u2019s leading innovators to deliver top quartile financial performance and to elevate our commitment support with social responsibility. And Dennis we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis Lange : Great. Thanks Jim. Shannon we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. You may begin. Rich Kwas : Jim on Craftsman first of all, can you shed any light on timing. How we should think about this as the rollout in terms of timing. And then second, Don I didn\u2019t see anything with regards to FX assumptions within the guidance and then which are comfort level with commodity cost at 150 that\u2019s unchanged from what you talked about November and metals prices have gone up here recently, so just some additional thoughts there. Thanks. Jim Loree : On Craftsman there\u2019s a lot of variables on Craftsman. It\u2019s interesting when you think about Craftsman, we brought a brand and maybe like three people along with it, and the work that the team has been doing and consumed for the last year or so is an incredible execution project, multi-dimensional etcetera. The relationships as Jeff pointed out are going extremely well. On the commercial side, the supply chain is going extremely well and frankly we are super excited about it, as I am sure you can appreciate it. As for timing I\u2019m going ask Jeff to comment on that, because he\u2019s managing all these, juggling all these cause at the same time here. And I\u2019ll turn it over to you for a moment there Jeff on that one. Jeff Ansell : Thanks Jim. The answer to the question, we\u2019ve built a dedicated Craftsman team and split them up so that the core business continues to accelerate even while we build Craftsman from the ground up. So we are developing all the new products to go with the brand that we acquired, and until that is complete we really can\u2019t affectively do capacity planning, which is just beginning as we speak.  While we are committed to launching Craftsman in the second half of the year, customer roll-on plans will be dependent on completion of the customer demand plans along with our capacity plans to ensure supply. As stated earlier the support of this iconic brand is overwhelming, and our teams engage to support as much demand as soon as possible. However, we\u2019re just clear at this point that we will have greater demand than supply in 2018. Jim Loree : I\u2019ll take the second question that Rich tuck in there. On the commodity side of 150 million at this stage that would be representative of current prices. But our view is that would impact our P&L. We\u2019re like always we do contingency planning and we\u2019re focused on if another 30 million or 50 million of commodity inflation came our way, how would we react. So that is factored in to our top process and we are continuously planning.  The FX question for a long time it was a modest negative. It slipped to a modest positive in particular because of what\u2019s happened with the euro and the pound and it strengthened against the US dollar. So we have seen a little bit of an offset in emerging markets where the dollar has strengthened against some of the key emerging market currencies. But right now it\u2019s, day to day or week to week it\u2019s kind of swinging between the net positive and a net negative. So relatively minor impact at this stage and that\u2019s really something we\u2019re calling out as a major assumption or guidance. But clearly it\u2019s something we continue to focus on for contingency planning. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. You may begin. Michael Rehaut : I also just wanted to hit on a couple of short questions if possible. First in terms of the guidance, focusing on the share outstanding and the amount of free cash flow conversion, obviously you announced the acquisition which would take a portion of that. But I was wondering around your thoughts on share repurchase, is that something that you do on and off, and with the strong free cash flow in 2018 absent, any additional acquisitions. Is that something that we should be thinking about as you get in to the year end? And then just secondly on Craftsman, when should we expect sort of a shift towards insourcing some of the production that could cause a lift to the margins in that sales bucket. Jim Loree : Sure. It\u2019s Jim, I\u2019ll take the first question and I\u2019ll ask Don to tackle the second one, and you may get a little color from Jeff about that. So on repurchase; let\u2019s just jump a kind of a little more in altitude to capital allocation in general. And over the courses, as long as Don Allan, Jeff Ansell and I have been part of this company, we\u2019ve had a capital allocation strategy, and giving 50% of our excess capital back to shareholders and then taking the other 50% and reinvesting it. And when you look at the dividend today is running a little over $300 million. Again we\u2019re throwing off 1 billion and that\u2019s a growing number now.  So there\u2019s definitely, when you look at that long term framework, there\u2019s definitely room for repurchase and we historically have repurchased and we\u2019ve done at times when we thought the stock was severely undervalued in general and occasionally we\u2019ve also from time to time used it to manage the share count to kind of a neutral as employee benefit types of dilution occurred or also when we have significant stock price increases and that might create some additional share count.  So we\u2019ve done all of that, but I think right now, with the acquisitions that we\u2019ve made and recently now another 440 million in the pipeline that is really, really strong in the acquisition area. In fact we\u2019re executing integrations as effectively and quickly as we can in order to begin to create some organizational bandwidth for bringing some more acquisitions on. So with all that going on, repurchases are fairly low on our list of capital allocation priorities. But that could change. We think of that over the long term and then we operate tactically in the short term based on a myriad of different observations and considerations. And so with that I\u2019ll turn it over my colleagues here. Don Allan : I\u2019ll start and just remind people of what we\u2019ve said in that past about Craftsman and pulling that in to our supply chain and our manufacturing plants, and then I\u2019ll let Jeff give a little more color around what we\u2019re thinking over the next few years. But since what we\u2019ve said, that really would be kind of a three year program of insourcing a large amount of these Craftsman products in to our, not all of them, but a large amount of them in to our manufacturing and supply chain, and it would be something a bit of a gradual impact over that three year time horizon. Jeff commented this morning that we still have a lot of work to do around capacity planning and we\u2019re in the process of doing that. So we don\u2019t have all the answer to it, but we do believe it will be a multi-year transition period. But Jeff why don\u2019t you put out a little more color on that? Jeff Ansell : So if you consider what we have to do in the core business, side by side with that we are doing concurrently in the fastening business, we\u2019ll launch about a thousand new products at our core business every year and we\u2019ll make about 85% of all those products that we sell around the world. So we are the most innovative tool company in the world and also we make the highest percentage of what we stock. That won\u2019t change and it can\u2019t change because our core business have to continue to perform well. Concurrent with that we have to bring up several thousand Craftsman products. So imagine this, we launch a thousand products at our core, we have to launch 2000 Craftsman product around at the same time, and we\u2019re capable of doing that.  At the same time, we want to repatriate Craftsman manufacturing as much as possible for United States. So we made an acquisition in 2017 of the pre-eminent metal tool manufacturing Waterloo that is a dedicated Craftsman manufacturing facility which is one of the things we committed to. So we will bring up that manufacturing of Craftsman products. We will make more than half of those products in year one, and we\u2019ll make probably more than half of these products in United States year one.  But as Don said, it will take probably a 36 month period before we can get to the point where we are making the same percentage of the Craftsman product as we make in our core. But I think over a three year period we can certainly get there and we can repatriate much of that to the US to stand behind the Craftsman Brand. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with UBS. You may begin. Chris Belfiore : This is Chris for Steve. Just kind of back to the Craftsman topic, originally you guys have said that it was going to generate a $100 million of incremental sales every year. I\u2019m just kind of curious, like with a lot that\u2019s going on in this year\u2019s brand, clothing stores, how do you guys think about that number now in terms of the expectations going forward? Jim Loree : We still feel like the opportunity is very significant. It\u2019s very difficult to gauge at this stage any change that we should make to that assumption. That assumption was based on what we believe are very reasonable factors. As we get deeper in to this tiny process that Jeff just described a few minutes ago, things will come to life when we indicate how quickly this ramp will go. But we are at a very early stage of this process and so at this point we are not looking to change anything around those assumptions. But as we get deeper and as those roll up, and when Amazon goes online at some point at this stage, we\u2019ll probably provide an updated view on what we think the Craftsman brand will do. But it\u2019s far too early. We\u2019re sitting in January to really alter those assumptions. Operator : Our first question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. You may begin. Tim Wojs : Nice job on Q4 and \u201917. I guess just turning may be to the margins a little bit. I was worried if you could maybe give us a little bit of color on just the cadence within the tools business just given the price cost headwinds maybe in the first quarter and then how should we think about tools margins as you go through the year thanks. Don Allan : Sure. The first quarter clearly would be pressure because of that 50 million of kind of net to price commodity cost segment I mentioned. So for the tools business you will see a rate decline year-over-year in the first quarter because of that. And we also had an outstanding first quarter last year from a rate perspective for tools, and so you have a difficult comp and then you have this dynamic I just described. So it will be down a little bit year-over-year because of that.  But as the year progresses, you\u2019ll see that get better and better and probably modestly down in the second quarter, and the it will start to show improvement year-over-year in the third and the fourth quarter. And it\u2019s really because of that dynamic of commodity, inflation, hitting us pretty hard in the first half without the price recovery not coming until the later stages of the second quarter and back half of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Redner with Bellman & Associates. You may begin. Scott Redner : My question was on the mid-teens POS noted at your large retailers in Tools & Storage, so for everyone to answer that. It seems like that that\u2019s been a little slower than the prior quarters. So just curious if you guys could provide some context there, whether there was significant comp last year or kind of how you guys are thinking about that relative to the optimistic commentary. Don Allan : What I said was mid-single digit POS, not mid-teens, although we would love mid-teens, but it was mid-single digits. And I look at POS, you can\u2019t really go crazy analyzing it quarter-by-quarter, you have to look at it over a multi-quarter period of time. And if you look at the North American business because I was commenting about POS and North America for certain customers, it was a little bit lower than the performance in North America, a couple of points. However, when you look at it over the entire year, it\u2019s very much in line with the performance of our revenue performance for North America versus the POS for the year.  So that\u2019s the best way to look at. The other thing to remember is that we had really strong performance outside of some of our retailers in North America in the fourth quarter, low double digit performance in the commercial channel. So you have to keep that in mind as well, that\u2019s really pushing that number up in a positive way. So truly those two factors, and again like we mentioned before, quarter-to-quarter POS is an important statistic to look at, but its more about the trend that you\u2019re seeing and what you\u2019re experiencing over multi quarters. And Jeff is going to answer on that. Jeff Ansell : In addition I would say we look at this, as Don said over a four quarter and time a rolling four quarter basis. And when looked at that way you can see clearly we\u2019ve outgrown the market 2x. And the other feedback that we\u2019ve received is from the customers the largest of our top 10 customers; we received Vendor of the Year Award because our POS would outpace their overall growth in the category. So what that would tell me is that POS is greater than the market, it\u2019s greater than our largest customers, and weeks of supply are in line with prior year. So that says the things that we\u2019re putting are going through the other end of the process in POS and we feel very good about global POS in total as much as we can gather. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Wolfe Research. You may begin. Josh Pokrzywinski : On the Craftsman commentary and Don not really deviating off that $100 million of incremental revenue a year. I guess as I look at your organic growth guidance and the EPS associated with that it seems like incremental margins knowing that raw material are different line items are a little light versus where you\u2019d be historically. If I assume that 100 million comes in at virtually no profitability, it still seems like it\u2019s at league average or not. Is there an indication that as Craftsman ramps up this year that the launch cost chips away that profitability in a more material way or I guess just kind of help us bridge how that base incremental margin looks a little lighter than usual. Don Allan : I think the best way to think about it is that, the leverage that we put in our guidance has a couple of factors in it. Clearly one is, when you\u2019re describing there\u2019s a little bit of launch cost and the cost associated with Craftsman that has to be factored in in to that at lower profitability, and they certainly will be nice component of our organic growth in 2018. The other thing to consider is that we have been on a steady program of investing for future growth in general as a company. And so as we get growth organically, we look at what investments we want to make in certain areas to continue to drive this growth over the mid-term and long term. And so therefore the leverage numbers you see are a little bit lower because of that as well. So it\u2019s really those two factors that are driving that dynamic that you\u2019re describing. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Wood with Nomura Instinet. You may begin. Unidentified Analyst : This is Mason on for Mike. Can you give us an update on FlexVolt sales, how many FlexVolt skews have now been rolled out and what are the initial number of FlexVolt product expected in 2018? Jim Loree : As I indicated in my presentation, I\u2019ll kick this over to Jeff for additional commentary. We were in line with our expectation for FlexVolt. FlexVolt will be a contributor to our guidance next year in our organic growth at 5% in the company, and it continues to be a very positive performer for us. I\u2019ll as Jeff to give a little more color on that. Jeff Ansell : Yes, we couldn\u2019t be happier with FlexVolt performance. If you look at the adoption rate, it\u2019s still running at about 10x in terms of speed of adoption versus key technologies like brushless, which are fantastic. So that\u2019s a great endorsement of what it does for the user. At this point we average about 4.9 stars on ratings around the world and that\u2019s 18 months or 15 months in to the process. That\u2019s the highest ratings we\u2019ve ever achieved. So tremendous reviews, and what we\u2019ve seen occur is as I kind of intimated in my remarks that we\u2019ve seen our coated product that we make where we sell, which is a differentiator for us. We\u2019ve seen that up mid-single digits, as the category was down about mid-single digits.  Our 20 volt range has grown faster than any time in history. At the same time, FlexVolt itself has grown dramatically. So if you add those three things together it says that there is a cannibalization to us there may be in the market, but its someone else\u2019s cannibalization.  We launched key new products in the fourth quarter and the second half of last year. Things like cordless FlexVolt compressor that is revolutionary, its doing incredibly well, our new FlexVolt worm drive style saw that is absolutely converting corded products for the first time in history to cordless, with more follow in 2018.  The point I would make there though is, as we continue to launch FlexVolt, we will launch more and more industrial products as we can get more and more output and capacitites from these products. But if you consider the fact that in the last year putting our FlexVolt batteries in to market to drive cross country a 150 times if it were an electric car, we are incredibly proud of what FlexVolt has done for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. You may begin. Rob Wertheimer : Question is on 4Q margin Tools & Storage, and obviously you guys have got a lot going on under the (inaudible). Sequentially maybe it was a little bit lighter that we might have thought and you got commodity, and I wanted to ask if commodity was the driver of that. If there\u2019s any excess freights, any production tangles or just inefficiencies some extreme growth here seen or whether it\u2019s just an investment? Jim Loree : We were very pleased with the margin performance of Tools, as I mentioned 50 basis points improvement year-over-year, an incredibly strong organic growth. However, there\u2019s a little bit of pressure on the margins for some of those things you mentioned. Commodity inflation continues to be something that we experienced in the fourth quarter that rolled on to this year with really no price recovery in the fourth quarter. And then I would say that was modest rate increases associated with the high levels of organic growth, but nothing that really dramatically moved the needle in the business. But I think the major factor was more in the commodity (inaudible). Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital Market. You may begin. Ken Zener : The cannibalization, I think that\u2019s the most incremental piece of information you\u2019ve communicated today beyond your execution, might I say that. Well FlexVolt, if you\u2019re growing to walk it almost means you are extending your brand awareness and your product is other people envelop your portfolio tools not someone else\u2019s. Why do you think and Jeff you gave us these numbers. But why do you think that\u2019s happening, why didn\u2019t you anticipate it, and most importantly what are the implications as you continue to kind of drive core battery in to what have been corded and/or what will be (inaudible) eventually. Jim Loree : The FlexVolt program has been a tremendous brand development and brand halo that had an effect on what was already an amazingly strong brand in the professional but guaranteed tough kind of segment, and plus it just takes it to another level. So that\u2019s one thing. I think the second thing is, and I\u2019ve said this before the installed base that we\u2019re developing of batteries that work on 60 volt to FlexVolt tools and 20 volt tools.  The FlexVolt battery obviously works on \u2013 is backwards compatible for the 20 volt. So when you start to develop this installed base of batteries and all of a sudden you have the functionality, the user has the functionality to be able to run the tool effectively three times longer of a 20 volt tool that is a real kind of value driver and value proposition advantage for FlexVolt. So I think that was sort of one of the things that we wondered how effective that impact would be. And I think what we\u2019re finding out is it\u2019s probably very, very significant. That\u2019s my (inaudible) and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff and see if you have anything more you want to add to that. Jeff Ansell : If you back in time to when Stanley Black & Decker\u2019s came together, you would look at the volt which was a fantastic brand franchise that probably believe was in a period of decline given the technology change where it offered (inaudible) and the world had moved to lithium.  Fast forward to where we are today and a couple of stats for you. We now make the volt in the United States which the competitors cannot do in power tools. We expanded that the volt brand promise to tremendous hand tools to storage products, lasers, all great products. We introduced our lithium ion answer in 2011 and \u201912 and a stat that you wouldn\u2019t be aware of; we\u2019re now three times bigger than lithium that we ever were at our peak in [non-caths]. So that is an awesome statement.  We\u2019ve introduced brushless at the same time. Brushless is now bigger than [non-cath] ever was. And on top of that we\u2019ve improved our reliability, highest reliability in the industry, greatest number of innovations and excellence going on top of that, and you\u2019re seeing what happens. The user who always loved the volt now has so many more reasons to love, embrace and endorse it, and we\u2019re seeing the level commitment to the volt has never been higher and we\u2019re pleased with that. Operator : Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. You may begin. David MacGregor : If I could just pick up for a clarification on Ken\u2019s question, I wanted to ask another question on FlexVolt. But regarding the cannibalization are we at a point where you can assume that the FlexVolt growing forward is largely incremental or is there a reason to believe that cannibalizations could be a future threat and emerge in some of the future points. And my question more on the margins was, the FlexVolt is running below tool segment average, is that due to launch cost and heavier promotional expense etcetera. And once we get beyond the large percentage margins on FlexVolt or expected to exceed the segment average or is this line expected to be at or below segment average margins for the foreseeable future. Jim Loree : I\u2019ll give the margins question to Don, but the way I\u2019m thinking about FlexVolt at this point, it\u2019s going to be a steady contributor to our organic growth as time goes on, and at this point it\u2019s hard to really understand FlexVolt, versus 20 volt, versus (inaudible) and what are all the dynamics other than we know what\u2019s already been said which is, it\u2019s a positive mix of effects and in that regard I think it\u2019s going to continue to be a real catalyst for above market organic growth for Stanley Black & Decker\u2019s and for (inaudible). Don Allan : On the margin question on FlexVolt, I would say that we did have that period of time where we were below line average. It probably extended a little longer than originally projected because some of the investments we were making in our marketing in particular to really make sure that people understood the technology and how tactful it is and clearly some of the comments you\u2019re hearing from Jim and Jeff would indicate that added the chase.  So as we go in to 2018, we would expect it to be right around line average margins and it\u2019s not something that would be negative to the margin or a dramatic positive at this stage. Operator : This concludes the Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Shannon thanks. We\u2019d like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thanks for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

Morgan Chris - UBS Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research Mike Wood - Nomura Instinet Jason Makishi - Barclays Robert Barry - Susquehanna International Group David MacGregor - Longbow Research Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates Operator : Welcome to the Q1 2018 Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chrystal and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Chrystal. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's first quarter 2018 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, Executive Vice President and President of Global Tools & Storage. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our Web-site. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim, Don, and Jeff, will review our first quarter 2018 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree. James M. Loree: Okay. Thank you, Dennis. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. As you saw in this morning's press release, we delivered a strong start to 2018. The Company posted solid revenue growth and earnings per share expansion, overcoming approximately $50 million of commodity headwinds, as we expected. Revenues were $3.2 billion, up 12%, with organic growth of 4%, acquisitions added 6 points of growth, and currency contributed 4. These factors were partially offset by the Mechanical Security divestiture, which we executed in February of last year. Tools & Storage led the way with 17% total revenue growth and with 6% organic. All major geographies and business units in Tools contributed. This performance reflects a series of growth initiatives with great commercial excellence, aligned with SFS 2.0, a healthy global pipeline of market-leading innovations, and FLEXVOLT, our first breakthrough innovation. Industrial achieved better-than-expected results with flat organic growth. The team overcame anticipated headwinds from lower project activity within Oil & Gas and declines in Engineered Fastenings, consumer electronics, and automotive systems business. Security posted total growth of 2% as bolt-on acquisitions and currency offset a 1% organic decline. EPS for the quarter was $1.39, a 7% expansion, as strong execution, acquisitions and lower expenses offset the significant impact from inflation. Don will provide you with a deeper dive into business-level operating performance during his remarks, and Jeff, as he will cover shortly, Tools' acquisitions continue to be on track and we are working diligently and successfully to complete the second half rollout of the Craftsman brand. We also executed in equity derivative transaction in the first quarter that hedges the price of a future 3.2 million share repurchase for three years through March 2021, and that supports our long-term strategy to return approximately 50% of our excess capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. So in summary, 2018 is off to a good start and looks to be another strong year as we celebrate our 175th anniversary. On that note, 175 years ago, Frederick Stanley opened the Stanley Bolt Manufactory in New Britain, Connecticut. 10 years later it was incorporated at Stanley Works, and in 2010 it was merged with Black & Decker Corporation to create Stanley Black & Decker. Frederick was quite an entrepreneur and innovator and was also very involved in the community, and that spirit of entrepreneurship, innovation, high-performance, and social responsibility, was core to who we were 175 years ago, and is alive and well today. And as you might expect, we are proud of this remarkable past and equally excited about our future as we celebrate 175 years. When Frederick Stanley founded the Company in 1843, I'm sure he could not have anticipated that his Bolt Manufactory would someday grow to a $13 billion revenue company with a market value approaching $25 billion and approximately 58,000 employees across the globe. It's a remarkable feat when you think about it and even more so when you consider that approximately 80% of the revenue growth and 90% of the market value creation has occurred since the year 2000 and just 10% of the Company's history as measured in years. We are seizing the opportunity and building on this recent growth spurt. Leveraging SFS 2.0, we are executing on a series of growth catalysts that will keep the growth coming in 2018 and beyond. FLEXVOLT has enjoyed the fastest adoption for a new product launch in power tool industry history. This high-powered innovative battery system is a growth driver today, it was in 2017, and it continues to be, and it's also stimulating demand for our 20 volt cordless offerings. We will continue to expand FLEXVOLT in the future with the ultimate goal of eliminating the need for cords on job sites, making a dramatic and positive impact on worker safety and efficiency. Moving to Craftsman, the Craftsman transaction gives us the rights to develop, manufacture, and sell Craftsman branded products in non-Sears channels. In 2017 we successfully established retail partnerships with a major home center, a major co-op hardware retailer, and a leading e-commerce player. We are working with passion and excitement to enable the iconic Craftsman brand, with its proud history to soon reclaim its rightful place in American homes, garages, factories, and automotive shops. Stay tuned for a big launch in the second half of this year. The Newell Tools integration continues to proceed on or ahead of plan and we expect to meet or exceed targeted cost synergies and are now working to capture the significant organic growth benefits associated with expanding the Lenox and Irwin brands that we acquired with that deal. And now, I'll hand it over to Don Allan, who will walk you through the segment performance, overall financial results, and 2018 guidance. Don? Donald Allan, Jr.: Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. Let's take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the first quarter. Starting with Tools & Storage, revenues were up 17% in the quarter, with 6% organic growth, 8 points of acquisitive growth, and 3 points of currency. Price was slightly positive as we took actions in several emerging markets. The operating margin rate was 14.3% versus 15.9% in the first quarter of 2017 as benefits of volume leverage and productivity were more than offset by anticipated commodity inflation and modest growth investments. The strong organic growth and related share gains were experienced across each Tools & Storage region and SBU. On a geographic basis, North America was up 3% organically, with growth across all channels. This performance included overcoming a slow start to the outdoor season due to extended winter conditions as well as planned customer inventory reductions which occurred in the retail channel ahead of the Craftsman launch. We estimate these two factors combined reduced the North American growth by approximately 3 points in the first quarter. The Craftsman transition impact was included in our plans as we prepare the marketplace to accommodate this exciting launch in the second half of the year, which you will hear more about from Jeff later in the call. The U.S. commercial and industrial markets, both generated mid-single-digit growth, and Canada contributed solid organic growth of 7%. Sharp commercial execution, new product launches, and a supportive tool market continued to fuel North America's growth. Additionally, inventories within our major North American customers remained at normal levels during the first quarter. So, in summary, both the underlying market and our performance still remains robust in North America as the two previous mentioned transitory factors are muting this region's performance for the quarter. We expect the growth to return to higher levels as we move through 2018. Now, Europe delivered another solid performance with 7% organic growth. 9 out of 10 markets grew organically, with double-digit contributions from the U.K., Iberia, Germany, and Central Europe. The team continues to set the standard for commercial excellence as they leverage our portfolio of brands, deliver a stream of innovation to the marketplace, and expand our retail relationships to produce sustained above-market organic growth. The European performance continues to be a stellar example of how to effectively apply the pillars of SFS 2.0 to drive sustained outsized organic growth. Finally, within Tools & Storage, emerging markets delivered another quarter of outstanding organic growth, up 15%, with all regions delivering great performances. Diligent pricing actions, continued e-commerce strength, and the ongoing MPP launch across the developing markets, continue to support growth. Geographically, Latin America was very strong, headlined by double-digit growth in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Peru, while Chile delivered high single-digit results. Our change to a direct selling model within Turkey and Russia continued to fuel exceptional growth for those countries. And in addition, India, Korea, and Southeast Asia, were up double-digits. Now let's shift to Tools & Storage SBUs, where both businesses showed strong growth in the quarter. The Power Tools & Equipment group was up 5% organically, led by Professional Power Tools which was up low double-digits. Partially offsetting this growth was the consumer power tool group which was down in the quarter as the previously mentioned outdoor and Craftsman transition impacted this portion of the business. The Power Tools & Equipment SBU benefited from new product introductions, reflecting market-leading core innovation as well as the expansion of the FLEXVOLT system, along with the continued sharp commercial execution. FLEXVOLT continues to perform nicely as shipments were on plan for the quarter and we saw double-digit growth in both the North American retail channel and within Europe. Our Hand Tools, Accessories & Storage SBU generated 8% organic growth [indiscernible] new product introductions, strong performances within the construction and industrial end markets, and the contribution from Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies. Hand Tools and Storage was up 6%, while Accessories delivered an outstanding 13% growth, another excellent performance from this team. So, in summary, an outstanding quarter and a strong start to the year for the Tools & Storage organization in the face of significant commodity inflation. Now, turning to Industrial, this segment delivered flat organic growth, which was better than internal expectations. Similar to the theme from Tools & Storage, operating margin rate declined year-over-year to 16.4% as productivity and cost control were more than offset by commodity inflation and modest growth investments. Engineered Fastening posted flat organic growth during the quarter as strong commercial activity was able to offset the expected decline in two areas; one, automotive systems due to lower model rollover activity from our customers; and two, in the consumer electronics business. The automotive business grew mid-single-digits as continued fastener penetration gains more than offset the automotive systems decline. The fastener organic growth of high single-digit was well in excess of the 1 point decline in global light vehicle production. Additionally, the industrial fastener business continues to deliver value-added solutions to their customers, which enabled mid-single-digit organic growth in the quarter. All in all, a good start to the year for Engineered Fastening. The Infrastructure businesses posted organic decline of 1% for the quarter. Hydraulic Tools grew organically more than 20% as they continue to see the benefits from the execution of successful commercial actions as well as the support of market environment that benefits from higher scrap steel prices. Meanwhile, Oil & Gas posted a low double-digit organic decline in the quarter, as expected, given the lower pipeline project activity versus the prior year. While North American inspection project activity did provide growth, it was not enough to offset the declines in both the on and offshore pipeline businesses. And then finally, the Security segment saw a 1% organic decline in the first quarter. North America organic growth was flat as higher automatic door volume was more than offset by lower healthcare volumes. We did expect to see slightly better performance from North America but customer timing did cause a shift in inflation and project volume to future quarters in 2018. Europe organic growth was on plan, but down 2% organically, as strength in the Nordics and U.K. were offset by anticipated ongoing weakness in France. In terms of profitability, this segment declined 100 basis points year-over-year. The operating margin was impacted by targeted investments to support organic growth and the sale of the mechanical locks business which occurred last year at the end of February. The Security team remains focused on innovation with a particular emphasis on the application of digital technologies and advanced data analytics to their business model, along with commercial and operational effectiveness to position the business for sustained revenue growth and margin expansion in 2018 and beyond. I would now like to take a minute to provide some comments on commodity inflation and tariffs. The table on the left is a reminder of our direct material purchases. We continue to see elevated commodity prices and as a result now expect inflation headwinds to approximate $180 million in 2018, which is up $30 million versus our previous outlook of $150 million. Steel, batteries, and base metals are the most significant commodities generating this headwind. As you will see when we turn to guidance, we will be taking additional price, cost, and productivity actions to offset this increased inflation. Now let's shift to tariffs. First I will address steel and aluminum tariffs under Section 232, which is included in our guidance release this morning. We now expect an annual impact from these tariffs of less than $3 million. This impact has been reduced from our previous comments on this topic, as the country exclusions from Canada and Europe mitigated a majority of this potential impact. Good news on that front. As we look at our exposure for the initial 50 billion of tariffs imposed under Section 301, we estimate a maximum annual headwind of approximately $40 million to $50 million, if implemented. These tariffs could potentially impact componentry and some finished goods imported to support the U.S. market. However, there is significant uncertainty as to how this will play out, but at this stage we believe these risks are at a manageable level for our Company. We believe there are several mitigating factors which could reduce this exposure to $10 million to $30 million annually, including proactively reviewing our global supply base to identify actions at the lower cost as well as taking priced actions, clearly a number that we believe is manageable in our Company size. Please note that any impact related to the first 50 billion in Section 301 tariffs is not included in our guidance, given the uncertain nature of these tariffs and whether they even will occur. So, with that, let's head into 2018 guidance. We are reiterating our 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance which calls for approximately 5% organic growth, and adjusted earnings per share range of $8.30 to $8.50, up approximately 13% versus the prior year at the midpoint. On a GAAP basis, we now expect earnings per share to range from $7.40 up to $7.60, which is inclusive of various charges related to M&A including Nelson Fasteners, and the refinement of the one-time tax charge in the recently enacted U.S. tax legislation. Keep in mind, the regulatory guidance surrounding the new U.S. tax bill continues to be issued and our estimate will continue to be refined throughout 2018 as we receive more information. Now diving into a little more detail on our 2018 adjusted EPS outlook, you can see on the left hand side of the chart, we expect the benefits from incremental price, cost, and productivity actions, as well as the modest contribution from the Nelson Fastener Systems acquisition to generate approximately $0.15 of EPS accretion. This will however be offset by higher commodity inflation, which includes the aforementioned $180 million of expected commodity headwinds in 2018. We continue to anticipate approximately $50 million of core restructuring charges and approximately 155 million shares outstanding for 2018. And then lastly, we expect second quarter earnings to be 24% of the full-year performance. This reflects the price/cost dynamic we spoke about last quarter where we will start to realize benefits from our price increases late in the second quarter, but we will not experience \u2013 and we will not experience a significant benefit from these increases until the third quarter. Now turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page, organic growth within Tools & Storage is still expected to be mid-single-digits in 2018. We believe that the generally supportive market conditions in addition to several significant organic growth catalysts support an above-market performance in Tools. The team is leveraging core innovation programs, FLEXVOLT, Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies, emerging markets' growth initiative, and the rollout of the Craftsman brand in the second half of the year. We continue to believe that top line growth will translate into improved margin rate year-over-year, even with the modestly diluted impact on the Craftsman brand rollout and the elevated commodity inflation being somewhat of a governing factor in 2018. Now, in the Industrial segment we continue to expect low single-digit decline in organic growth. While the business performed above expectations in the first quarter, the market related pressures within the automotive system rollovers and the lower levels of project activity within Oil & Gas will offset nice levels of growth within other parts of this segment. With the closing of the Nelson Fastener Systems acquisition, we are revising our segment margin expectation to be down modestly year-over-year. Nelson currently carries below segment average margins, but with cost synergies we will get these margins up to line average over a reasonable period of time. Also, it is important to note, excluding this acquisition, we still expect the operating margins in Industrial to be flat to modestly positive for the year. Now finally in our Security segment, we are expecting the organic growth to be low single-digits in 2018. We continue to believe that the business can deliver a modest improvement in operating margins year-over-year as we maintain focus on cost and service productivity. We also are reiterating our free cash flow conversion rate of approximately 100%. While we didn't cover first quarter free cash flow in detail, we did show some modest pressure year-over-year. The primary driver of that pressure was higher levels of inventory in Tools & Storage to support new product launches, including Craftsman. For those that have followed us for a while, having a free cash outflow in the first quarter is relatively normal due to our working capital seasonality. Working capital management remains a key pillar of the SFS 2.0 operating system and we are confident we can continue to drive working capital improvements across the Company with a heavy focus on improving the performance of recent acquisitions. So, in summary, we believe we are taking the appropriate actions to position the Company to deliver a robust 5% organic growth with 13% adjusted EPS expansion, which is overcoming approximately $180 million in commodity inflation. In addition, we remain focused on free cash flow generation, of course price realization, acquisition integrations, and the rollout of the Craftsman brand. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jeff to provide some comments about our Tools acquisitions and the Craftsman rollout. Jeff? Jeffery D. Ansell: Thank you, Don. The Irwin and Lenox integrations continue to progress smoothly with cost and revenue synergies on track. We have successfully executed distribution center integrations in all regions. Notably, we completed the Irwin North America transfer into our North Carolina distribution center in February. These moves have improved service levels to the mid-90s from pre-acquisition performance in the low 80s. Additionally, we have completed warehouse migrations into our U.K. and Belgium facilities, and with several warehouse moves now complete, the vast majority of Irwin/Lenox product is now in Stanley Black & Decker facilities. From a commercial perspective, we are seeing great traction globally with the Irwin and Lenox brands. We are excited to announce an Irwin brand revitalization partnership with Bunnings, the largest home improvement retailer in Australia. In addition, we are delivering revenue synergies in global emerging markets, led by countries like Brazil and Mexico. Lenox is also generating momentum. As an example, our Lenox band saw business is up double-digits. Regarding the Craftsman integration, the legacy product lines are demonstrating growth with existing customers like Ace. In addition, we acquired Waterloo, the preeminent manufacturer of domestic metal storage products, in July of 2017, and are leveraging it to produce a full range of Craftsman made-in-the-USA metal storage products that are now ready to ship. As you could see, the acquisition integrations are proceeding nicely, with much of the remaining milestones to be completed by mid-year. Importantly, all brands, namely Irwin, Lenox, and Craftsman, delivered mid-single digit pro forma growth in Q1, consistent with our mid-single-digit core business growth. Shifting to an update on the relaunch of the Craftsman brand, we have over 1,000 new products in development for the second half 2018 rollout. To build awareness and excitement for the relaunch, we will begin to promote a portfolio of 30 Craftsman relaunch products, which includes mechanic's tool sets, portable storage, metal storage, flashlights, and more. At Lowe's, you could already see the first Craftsman relaunch items available online, and they are delivering strong performance. Additionally, there will be in-store promotional support for Father's Day. As planned, the broader set of over 1,000 Craftsman products will begin the rollout process in the second half of 2018, with completion in the first half of 2019, as planned. Ace will continue to support legacy Craftsman range until the second half of 2018, when they will begin to transition to the new Craftsman offerings, which will be completed during 2019. Ace will also participate in promotional support for Father's Day. Regarding Amazon, Craftsman metal storage products are slated to roll out in latter 2018 and our plan is to have the broader product portfolio added during 2019. While plans and projections remain on track with these customers, we continue to pursue additional channel opportunities across the globe. User and customer excitement remains high. With that said, now I'd like to turn it back to Jim to wrap up today's presentation. James M. Loree: Thanks Jeff. That detail you just shared on Craftsman I think will really open up people's eyes as to how real this really is in the second half and how enthusiastic we are about the prospects for that. But getting back to the total Company, to recap, the first quarter was a solid start to 2018 with a 12% revenue growth, the 4% organic growth, and 7% EPS expansion, despite those commodity headwinds. And as you heard from Jeff, the Tools' acquisitions are progressing well, we are on track with Craftsman in a big way, and as Don mentioned, we are navigating successfully through the price/cost and other dynamics of 2018. And we are really fortunate to have on this call three management speakers, each of whom have 19 years of experience with this Company. And sure, we have been through all the cycles, inflationary, economic, and other, before and we know how to manage through them successfully. Thus we position the Company for a successful year and have reiterated our guidance for 2018, 5% organic growth, approximately 13% EPS growth. We are focused and remain focused on day-to-day execution, operational excellence including delivering above-market organic growth with operating leverage, successful price realization and completing the integrations of our recent acquisitions, and all the while generating strong free cash flow. And we are taking action strategically as well to continue to pursue growth looking forward as we pursue our 22/22 Vision and seek to become known as one of the world's great innovative companies to deliver top quartile financial performance and to elevate our commitment to corporate social responsibility. With that, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis? Dennis Lange : Great. Thanks, Jim. Chrystal, we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Wojs from Baird. Your line is open. Tim Wojs : I have a two-part question, if I can try to sneak you in. I guess the first one, just on Craftsman and then Lenox and Irwin, I was wondering if there is a way to maybe quantify relative to the mid-single-digit growth for the overall Tool segment this year, what you might be expecting from those three things individually or combined? And then my second is just more of a modelling question. As you look to the ramp-up of Craftsman in the back half of 2018, anything we should just keep in mind in terms of any sort of cost in the second quarter or maybe any sort of product destocking or anything like that would be helpful. Thanks. Donald Allan, Jr.: Okay, I'll take that. This is Don. So, I'm not going to say anything specific about the impact of Craftsman throughout the year, but what I can tell you is that as we go throughout the year, and I think we talked about this back in January as well, the organic growth for Tools will improve a little bit in the second quarter versus the first quarter. So when you think about it kind of incrementally, 6% performance in Q1, you see a bit of improvement in Q2 as some of the Craftsman products start to roll out, although modestly. And then you'll start to see it improve again in the third quarter incrementally versus the second quarter. And then the fourth quarter will probably be a little bit down from the third quarter but not significantly. So, if you think about that kind of trend and how this rollout is going to work, a lot of the rollout may be more third quarter weighted than fourth quarter weighted, but we'll see how that plays out. So, think about the trend that way and a lot of that's being driven by the impact of Craftsman combined with, as a reminder, the cannibalization that has to happen during the second and third quarter as well as the fourth quarter. So there's product going in from Craftsman and there's some product coming out of some of our other brands. But I think that's the best way to think about that trend. There's no real unusual cost per se. We have baked in into our margin profile for the four quarters really the impact of this shift in products from Craftsman and we are moving some of our other brands which we have previously mentioned will have a modest dilutive impact on the Tools business in the Company from a margin perspective. You also have the dynamic of commodity inflation as I mentioned that as a result you'll see margins in Tools & Storage will be down again year-over-year in the second quarter but not as significantly down as it was in the first quarter. And as we migrate to the third quarter, you'll see some incremental year-over-year improvement in margins and then a more significant improvement in the fourth quarter as all the full pricing actions go into place. So, I think that's the best way to think about it at this stage. Operator : Our next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Richard M. Kwas: One for Jim, one for Don; Jim, on the M&A front, recent deal in the professional space here a couple of days ago, curious on how you are thinking about incremental M&A timing, et cetera, number of opportunities, and what you think of the market? And then for Don, cadence of earnings, so first half of the year based on your Q2 guidance, low 40s as a percentage of full year. That's only below what you normally had, usually mid-40s for the first half or better. I know there's a lot of things going on here but could you just give us some feel for comfort levels around hitting these higher numbers in the second half of the year as a percentage of full year and what we should watch for? James M. Loree: Great. Okay, I'll start with the question on M&A. I assume what you are referring to in terms of a recent transaction was the sale of Greenlee and some other tool brands to Emerson which was announced this week for $810 million. It's probably the first tool transaction in a long time that we haven't actually closed on. So, I appreciate the question. I can tell you that we think Greenlee is a good asset with a certain value. When we got into the process of looking at it, the value, given some other attributes of the particular asset, of $810 was just a bit more than we had an appetite for. So, very, very good asset and we wish Emerson all the best with that, we don't have to own everything, but we are very disciplined when it comes to value, price, et cetera, on these types of things. Pipeline itself is very good, very good, and our digestion of what we have already acquired is going well. So, you can only imagine that sometime in the not-too-distant future you will continue to see acquisitions from Stanley Black & Decker, and as we said in the past, you can potentially see those anywhere in the portfolio because we really believe that if we own an asset or we own a particular business and it's part of the portfolio, then that should indicate that we should be willing to invest capital in it because it has a future and a bright future. So, pipeline is robust and we are selective though, and I think that Greenlee is a good indication of that discipline. Donald Allan, Jr.: And on the second question related to the first half/second half, which is a very good question to ask, and clearly this year is a little bit different from a profile view, and when you think about really two factors that are driving that. The first half of the year will have roughly 40% to 41% of our full-year EPS performance in the first half. Historically it's probably closer to 45%. So that's roughly $0.35 to $0.40 of EPS that's shifting. The biggest driver is commodity inflation. And so, we have significant commodity inflation. Jim mentioned $50 million in the first quarter, really no price recovery on that $50 million of any significance. We'll have some partial recovery in the second quarter, but still we'll have a significant component of it that will not be recovered. And then you have the added dynamic of the Craftsman rollout in the back half where you're getting a nice benefit of that rollout not only on the organic line but also in dollars of OM and in EPS. So it's really those two factors that are driving first half versus second half when you compare it to our traditional trend. And we are very confident in our pricing actions that we have laid out there. We have really two ways of them. We had 150 million of commodity inflation that we started the year. We said back in January that about 60% to 70% of that would be recovered in the year. We still feel good about that. So that's roughly $100 million of recovery that starts to be implemented in the second quarter and fully executed in the third quarter. Now there is a new wave of 30 million of commodity inflation that's happening, and we still feel the same about recovery. We actually think we can get 60% to 70% of that in 2018. However, those actions won't begin to be implemented until sometime in the mid to second stage of the third quarter. And we feel pretty confident in our ability to do that because we've been focused on different surgical things that we can do in the area of pricing. As we mentioned before, these usually are not broad-based price increases. Occasionally we do that to certain categories where we think it's appropriate, but the vast majority of this price increase across the Company is more surgical where we see opportunity because of the inflation but we see opportunity because of our pricing versus our competitors. James M. Loree: And I'd like to make an additional comment on pricing because there is a lot of discussion surrounding pricing and whether we have pricing power in some of our industries, et cetera, and the reality is, when inflation is incremental and very modest but significant, it is somewhat difficult to get price in some of our markets because there isn't a significant story to go to the customers with and the channels with. When we get big slugs of inflation, like we've got this year, those conversations aren't easy but they are successful in general because it's just the reality of the situation. We are in business to make money and in order to do that we have to achieve price increases to offset some of that inflation. And I think the other thing to mention is that every year we generate 3% to 4% productivity very reliably. And so, to the extent that price does not necessarily cover all of the inflation, it is still possible to have margin accretion in this business because of the productivity that we consistently generate as a result of SFS 2.0 and other activities that we are pursuing. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Mike Rehaut : I'm going to stick to actually one question, as you asked at the beginning of the call. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about Nelson and give us a little bit of sense to how that fits into the portfolio. It seems like in terms of the $0.15 offset to the commodity inflation that the acquisition accretion, seems like it's a slight, is a minority of that $0.15 given, Don, you said 60% to 70% of the 30 million could be offset this year through price. So I just wanted to make sure I'm thinking about that correctly. And just more broadly, as you talk about Nelson, maybe you can also talk about the broader M&A pipeline and how that fits across the Company as well. Donald Allan, Jr.: So, we actually like the Nelson Fastener acquisition. Obviously we think it's a great addition to our industrial fastener business. So, within Engineered Fastening, we have the automotive piece and we have industrial fasteners. This fits very well to that particular part of the business and it brings some nice additional products and technology that really is a great addition to that particular business. So, a great addition to the portfolio, a continued expansion of really our niche expertise within fasteners that we can add value to our customers. On your question related to the accretion and the impact from Nelson, it is modest, and so the bulk of the positive accretion of that $0.15 is coming from price. The next significant piece is a little bit of productivity and other cost actions. And then the smaller piece or the third piece of it is the Nelson contribution, because we do have interest cost associated with funding it and obviously we do have intangible costs as well. So, in particular in the first year, it really offsets a lot of the OM accretion that we're going to experience with that business, but as we go into next year, we'll see a nice uplift from that. James M. Loree: Yes, keeping in mind that it's basically a $200 million revenue bolt-on acquisition, it does not have a dramatic impact. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Winoker from UBS. Your line is open. Chris: This is Chris. So, I just kind of want to dig into Craftsman a little bit again. So with regard to Craftsman, the original expectation was for about $100 million of incremental sales each year from that business. And as I understand, the distribution through Ace Hardware is already achieving that sales number. So, how should we expect this number to change as you kind of filter Lowe's and Amazon through? Does the Ace piece kind of go away or does that cannibalization of other product that you guys are taking off the shelf offset that? And then just kind of part of this is just in terms of margin, like where are we, like what inning are we in, in terms of like the margin improvement of that business? James M. Loree: I'll have Don answer the margin part of the question, but I would start by saying that when we acquired Craftsman, the assumptions that we utilized were based on a fair amount of uncertainty as it relates to how the commercial conversations would go with customers. We had a sense that they would be positive, but a sense that they would be positive versus actually having an agreement, there is a pretty wide kind of variability between those two things. And as I think most people have gleamed by now, the conversations have materialized into some pretty good results for the commercial agreements. And therefore, I guess going back to when we gave the guidance and the parameters for what we expected, we said it would be a billion-dollar deal but it would take 10 years. With all that uncertainty, obviously we were very cautious and careful in terms of the timeframe. You can all come to your own conclusions about how that timeframe might be changing because the success of the conversations have gone so well. From our perspective, it's premature to change what we've said previously, but I can assure you that the directional aspects of this are favorable, and there will be more granularity coming out as the programs develop. Donald Allan, Jr.: Yes, just a reminder, back in January I made the comment that as we go through the year and probably in the back half of the year, we'll give a little better sense of how we think that program is going to play out in light of what Jim just said. On the margin side, yes, the margins of Craftsman, as we said, are below line average and that's something that we recognize. We think through the things that we're going to do related to innovation and then bringing in the products in our manufacturing system, but I'll ask Jeff to give you a little more color on that particular program and how that's proceeding in our plan over the next three years. However, it's beginning in a situation that will be pressured to our margin. However, we do believe because of the size of our business, our Tools & Storage business, that over the time horizon we will continue to be able to grow margins even with that pressure and that [indiscernible] have any impact here in 2018 and likely in 2019 as well, but innovation will help us improve the margins and then the manufacturing strategy as well, and I think Jeff can give us a little more color on what our manufacturing strategy is and the status of that. James M. Loree: Yes, but just for clarity, on the margins we're talking specifically about margin rate, and the margin dollars will be significantly [indiscernible]. Jeffery D. Ansell: Thanks Don. In terms of manufacturing strategy around Craftsman, so we acquired an existing legacy business that had existing legacy products. The launch that begins this second quarter promotionally across Lowe's, across [indiscernible], and then replicate it promotionally with both of those customers and with Amazon in the fourth quarter, those will be relaunch products, ground-up Stanley designed, Stanley manufactured products, and so far it's going really well, 1,000 products in development, but 30 of those products are manufactured at this point, but they include products that we are really good at manufacturing. So, hand tools manufactured in the United States, metal storage products and plastic storage products manufactured in the United States, power tools manufactured in the United States. So, all of those things look really promising and rollout plans look really good. We will improve the margins from what we acquired. The legacy margins of Craftsman were much worse. But as Jim and Don said, in the early stages they will be dilutive to our line average margins. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your line is open. Rob Wertheimer : Could you comment on the competitive landscape in Security for a moment? ADT seems to be moving more in the commercial. Maybe that's different niches or different target areas than what you have, but did you see any change in commercial security yet and is there any sort of separation between what you might see them doing and what you do? James M. Loree: I would say the change has been occurring over a longer period of time and the competitive intensity has gradually increased. But in terms of short-term changes, it's pretty much business as usual in the commercial industry. The industry still remains incredibly fragmented despite the fact that we have a very large, one very large player and another one that's increasingly getting into commercial. So, nothing really notable there. I think there is a more strategic issue that we're dealing with and we'll deal with as we go forward, which is how do we reshape the value proposition of the business to make it even more differentiated than it is today. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Wood from Nomura. Your line is open. Mike Wood : Wanted to ask you about price recovery from the commodity inflation, can you just give us a sense, historically how large productivity typically plays a role in keeping price cost neutral or do you eventually recover the commodity inflation with price alone just with the lag? Thank you. Donald Allan, Jr.: So, I'll take that. As we look at history, inflationary times, the 60% to 70% that I mentioned for this year in 2018 is actually consistent with history in the first year. Then we obviously have a carryover effect into the next year of that impact. I would say that we never really fully recover all the commodity inflation, but we get pretty close, maybe 90% recovery when you look at it over a two-year period of time, maybe 2.5 to 3 years depending on the cycle that you are going through. And so, history would say that that's probably what's going to happen and I think what we're doing here in 2018 and 2019 probably be very similar to that. Productivity is something allows us to offset that 30% or so or 35% that we have in the first year, then anything remaining, 10% or so, that occurs in the subsequent year over that two-year time horizon, we utilize that. I mean, our productivity continues to be significant and it's something that we drive throughout our supply chain on an annual basis, as Jim mentioned. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open. Jason Makishi : This is actually Jason Makishi on for Julian. Just to the scope of that $180 million inflation guide, just wanted to check to see in the context of the visibility that you typically have particularly in Tools & Storage around price cost dynamics, if there was scope for that maybe to come up as commodity inflation persists. And then on the other end of that, what would the incremental price actions look like and would those be sort of difficult to push through just given the number that is already planned for? James M. Loree: I mean the bottom line is, we are confident in getting the price level that we've talked about, and the expectation that we would get more is probably unrealistic and that productivity will do the job that we have talked about. So, I wouldn't bet on more price percentage recovery than has already been indicated, but if more inflation comes, you can stand confident that we will continue to offset that in proportion to previous recovery increases that we have talked about. Donald Allan, Jr.: And just a reminder, we haven't had an inflationary cycle like this in quite some time. But if you do look at our history and you want to go back that far, you will see that our approach that we are taking this year is very, very similar to what we've done in the past. And we believe given where we stand in the market with the brands that we have and the products that we have and the innovation associated with that, we have the ability to take these actions and be successful because we do it, as I described earlier, in a surgical way, in a way that we really can be targeted to where it makes sense to do versus doing broad-based price increases. James M. Loree: Yes, and I would say the linkage also between our supply management organization and our commercial organizations in terms of understanding what the impact is as it's happening in real time, making that connection with the commercial organization and coming up with tactics in the strategy and the tactics that are required to recover the price with the help of the financial organization, I think is a very tight process here and one that's been refined, as I mentioned, over the years. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Your line is open. Robert Barry : I had a question on Industrial actually, and then maybe just a quick Mechanical question. So you still see low single-digit decline there. I thought most of the pressure was expected in 1Q. That came in much better. So I'm just curious where the pressure is going forward. Maybe you could give us some color on what's expected for the components within Industrial. And then just a quick question on this capped call transaction, just curious, it's a little atypical why you kind of chose to do the repose that way. Thanks. James M. Loree: Actually I'll take the capped call question and then Don will answer the Industrial question to the extent possible. But the opportunity at this level to lock-in what we view as a very favorable share repurchase price was something that we elected to take because we really feel that the future of the Company is very bright, and therefore locking in at today's levels is a sensible thing to do. Now why did we not just buy the stock, I guess is the question with that as the context. And the answer is, I mentioned earlier the M&A pipeline is fairly robust. So, when we make trade-offs between should we buy a very, very significant quantity of stock at this moment or should we lock in the price and wait to buy it in the future because we have a few things in the M&A pipeline that might come to fruition, all that goes into the thought process that ended up in the result of doing what we did with respect to the derivative. Donald Allan, Jr.: And I would just add that a capped call, based on what Jim just said, really gives us a lot of flexibility and that's the benefit of doing something like that at what we would view as a very reasonable price. So, on the Industrial question, there's two factors driving our view of the segment for the full year. The automotive systems impact will be ongoing throughout the year. So that will be a pressure to Engineered Fastening that might subside in the fourth quarter, but it's likely to continue throughout the entire year. And then the second dynamic is Oil & Gas. As I mentioned in my commentary, we continue to see low level of activities associated with pipeline construction, and as a result we expect pressure to their business year-over-year. As they saw a really nice performance last year, certain pipelines were constructed here in the U.S. or North America. We don't see the same level of activity right now. So, there's those two large dynamics that are driving that throughout the remainder of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is open. David MacGregor : A couple of questions quickly on the emerging markets business, you have put up some mid-teens growth in Tools, which was pretty impressive. I guess, how should we think about the pace of growth over the next year or two given the new products, the e-commerce penetration, and the expanding distribution? And also, how should we think about the incremental profitability of that incremental emerging market business? James M. Loree: The emerging markets is a major growth theme for us. It's something that we have invested heavily in over the last three or four years, something we have developed strategies for the emerging markets that involve several elements, including expanding our feet on the street, beefing up our management structure, undertaking some pretty significant product development over time to create MPP products and hand tools, corded power tools and cordless power tools, and just all-in-all really taking SFS 2.0 and driving it into the emerging market world and with great success, some of which has been masked over the past few years by massive foreign exchange headwinds that we've had which totaled hundreds of millions of dollars over the past four years and have now subsided. So, now what you're seeing I think is the confluence of all those operational things that I talked about as well as the abatement of the FX headwinds, and the growth is excellent. The market share increases are taking place. It is almost pervasive across most of the emerging markets. There's a few areas that we are still kind of working to get to perfect the equation, but all in all it's a great story and it's something that I appreciate you asking the question because we don't talk that much about it, but I think you'll find that that will fuel growth here in the future. As far as the margins, the gross margins are surprisingly consistent with the line average. The operating margin tends to be just a little bit lower because we are investing heavily in what I talked about. So, to the extent that we invested a little less heavily, which we have the flexibility to do if and when we want to do that, the operating margins will be very consistent with the line average. In the meantime, we are investing in growth. Operator : And our final question comes from Scott Rednor from Zelman. Your line is open. Scott Rednor : I was hoping you could talk about the outdoor business. Don, I think in prior conferences or calls you described it as maybe a $300 million business. So, could you maybe just conceptualize how that would phase I guess through the year and if you guys are seeing it come back in April at all? Jeffery D. Ansell: This is Jeff. I'll take the question. The outdoor business for us is just a little less than 5% of the total Tools business, obviously seasonal. So, we did see pressure in that business in the first three months of the year, probably like every company that participates there, based on weather pattern. So, what we thought was the coldest March in four years and it comps against what was a pretty good first quarter last year for most seasonal companies. So, with that said, our listings remained very good, lot of addition, so new Black & Decker innovative items as well as new DEWALT innovative items. So the placements looked quite good. We do expect it to come back in the second quarter. What you do tend to find with outdoor is that just because of the compact nature of the season, it doesn't come back 100%, there's just not enough time for that to happen. So, we do expect some recovery in the second quarter in the guidance we have provided, not a full recovery, but again, it is a relatively small percentage of the total business, and we continue to do quite well in that area. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for any closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Chrystal, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker\u2019s second quarter 2018 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, Executive Vice President and President of Global Tools & Storage. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning\u2019s call will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. The replay number and access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim, Don, and Jeff, will review our second quarter 2018 results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It\u2019s therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree. Jim Loree : Thank you, Dennis and good morning everyone. As you saw from our press release, we delivered an impressive second quarter under the circumstances and reaffirm total year EPS guidance, up 13% at the midpoint. In doing this, we fended off a significant array of exogenous headwinds, which included input cost inflation, FX and most recently, tariffs. Our ability to do that was a result of an outstanding growth performance, which provided both incremental volume and volume leverage as well as tight cost controls, especially on the SG&A line. And while we had telegraphed in our April release that these headwinds would create short-term margin pressure, we also expressed confidence in our ability to substantially offset them through pricing actions and productivity, albeit with a brief timing lag. And as it turns out, our pricing options are progressing according to plan as evidenced by our actual price realization, which was a full point in the quarter. That number will continue to grow in Q3 and Q4 and there will be substantial price carryover into 2019. The short story behind our success in the quarter was agile management that provided real-time visibility into the issues, leveraged our growth momentum and included a rapid and decisive response to headwinds with pricing options and cost controls tools. Tools & Storage and Industrial both exceeded our growth expectations and all three segments contributed to a robust 7% organic growth performance for the overall company. Acquisitions contributed 3 points of growth and the total company revenue increased 11% to $3.6 billion. With tools and markets remaining healthy in most areas around the globe, we continue to see strong underlying demand and share gain in Tools & Storage which delivered an outstanding 10% organic growth in the quarter. In Tools, we are utilizing multiple levers to deliver consistent above market organic growth even in the phase of tough comps. We remain focused on commercial excellence, completing the integration of our acquisitions, program managing the Craftsman rollout, and delivering strong gains in emerging markets and e-commerce. Moving to Industrial now, where we also outperformed expectations once again. Total segment growth was 14%, with an 11 point contribution from the Nelson Fasteners acquisition. Continued momentum in Engineered Fastening and Hydraulic Tools more than offset the expected decline in oil and gas. We were very pleased with Engineered Fastening, which overcame anticipated weakness in systems sales to record 3% organic growth. In this vein, we continued to achieve significant penetration gains in automotive fasteners, which were up more than 600 basis points versus industry light vehicle production. Diluted adjusted EPS for the quarter was $2.57 as price, lower expenses and volume leverage more than offset the dilutive earnings impact of commodity inflation and currency. It is a noteworthy performance considering that we leaned into $70 million of headwinds, including $20 million of additional FX, which materialized as several emerging market currencies substantially weakened during the last 8 weeks of the quarter. In addition, we completed $200 million in share repurchases in April and will continue to be open to more of the same if the market continues to discount our ability to look to deliver our commitments and the growing array of powerful growth catalysts, which today are as substantial as anytime during the almost two decades that I have served as an executive of this company. These catalysts include Craftsman, FLEXVOLT, revenue synergies from the Newell Tools acquisition, emerging markets and e-commerce in general as well as our inorganic growth pipeline. Craftsman is one compelling organic growth initiative originally expected to be to reach $1 billion in sales in year 10. We are now confident that this timeframe will be shorter and while the ultimate size is indeterminable at this time, the potential for this program to exceed $1 billion is very real given the retail placements we have achieved, which include a major home center, one of the world\u2019s largest e-commerce players a major U.S. co-op in several other important channels. Our DEWALT FLEXVOLT tool assortment and battery system installed base continues to expand with innovation reaching into higher power categories, where cordless power tools have never previously existed. Additionally, the FLEXVOLT battery pack is synergistic with our 20-volt system enhancing its growth and is thus a positive force for the broader DEWALT family of products. As for Newell Tools, the integration of Irwin and Lenox is nearly complete and we are now turning our attention to revenue synergies, which over a multiyear period we expect to represent $100 million to $150 million organic growth as we broadened the distribution of these products around the world. In the emerging markets, we continue to deliver double-digit growth and share gain we are leveraging our unique to the industry business model, the strength of our brands and our complete market basket, including Stanley branded mid-price point corded and cordless power tools as well as hand tool products and we are having great success growing it 2x to 3x market growth rates. Across both the emerging markets and developed markets, e-commerce continues to remain a key commercial driver, which this year represents a $1 billion high growth business for us, a channel in which we are the industry leader in both the U.S. and across the globe, an excellent source of high double-digit growth. And lastly, our M&A pipeline has never been stronger and include several strategically and financially attractive growth opportunities under review. These days, some of our most challenging short-term capital allocation decisions, involve trade-offs between pursuing specific M&A opportunities or alternatively repurchasing more of our own equity. And as we always do, we will strike a good balance between the two and stay true to our long-term capital allocation framework that is to first fund all appropriate organic growth activities and then allocate excess capital 50% to M&A and the other 50% to returning capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. With regard to the former, you will note that earlier this week, we announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.66 per share, which represents the 51st consecutive year of annual dividend increases, an incredible record. So that\u2019s it, a powerful growth story with more catalysts to come, which we will usher along in the back half and into 2019 and beyond as we navigate our way through these transitory 2018 headwinds. And now I will turn it over to Don Allan who will walk you through the segment highlights, the overall financial results and 2018 guidance. Don? Don Allan : Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results in the second quarter. Tools & Storage delivered 11% revenue growth, with an impressive 10% organic growth and 1 point of currency. And as Jim highlighted earlier, the initial effects of our price increases contributed 1 point of organic growth. The operating margin rate was 16.2% versus 17.6% in the second quarter of 2017 as benefits of volume leverage pricing, productivity and cost control were more than offset by commodity inflation and currency. The vast majority of the $50 million of commodity inflation and $20 million of currency that the company experienced in the second quarter was absorbed by the Tools & Storage business. The strong organic growth and related share gains were experienced across each Tools & Storage region and SBU. On a geographic basis, North America was up 10% organically with growth across all channels. The U.S. retail channel has generated low double-digit growth, U.S. commercial markets posted high single-digit growth and our industrial and auto repair markets generated mid single-digit growth. Additionally, Canada contributed exceptional organic growth of 13%. North America\u2019s growth continued to be fueled by new product innovations, the initial Craftsman rollout supporting the Father\u2019s Day promotion at Lowe\u2019s and Ace, a recovery in the outdoor products segment, and of course, our pricing efforts in response to commodity inflation and currency. This growth was achieved while maintaining normal inventory levels within our major customers in North America, the U.S. tool market continues to be supportive providing a sound backdrop for organic growth initiatives that Jim just mentioned. Europe delivered another solid performance with 5% organic growth. All 10 markets grew organically, with above average contributions from Central Europe, the UK, Greece, France and Iberia. The team continues to deliver market share gains as they leverage our portfolio brands, deliver new product innovations and expand retail relationships to produce the strong organic growth. Finally, emerging markets continued their trend of outstanding organic growth, up 17% with all regions contributing. Diligent pricing actions to offset currency headwinds which weekly arose in Q2 as well as a continued focus on e-commerce and the ongoing MPP launch continued to support growth in this part of Tools & Storage. Geographically, Latin America was headlined by double-digit growth in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. Our change to a direct selling model within Turkey and Russia continued to fuel exceptional growth for those countries. And in addition, India, Korea and Japan also posted notable double-digit growth. Both Tools & Storage SBUs showed 10% growth in the quarter. The Power Tools & Equipment Group was led by Professional Power Tools, which was up low double-digits. The consumer power tool group rebounded nicely from the first quarter impacts of the outdoor and Craftsman transition posting mid single-digit growth. Power Tools & Equipment benefited from new product introductions, leveraging our core innovation efforts, continued expansion of the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system and of course, sharp commercial execution. FLEXVOLT continues to be a differentiated growth driver for Tools & Storage. Shipments were on plan and we again saw double-digit organic growth within the North America retail channel and Europe. The 10% organic growth within hand tools, accessories and storage was due to new product introductions, strong performances within the construction and industrial-focused product lines and the contribution from Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies. Hand Tools and Storage business delivered an outstanding 11% organic growth, while accessories, was up 6%, another solid performance from this team. So in summary a great quarter for the Tools & Storage organization, where they delivered organic growth in nearly every market, initiated price increases to counter the impacts from commodity inflation currency and tariffs, all while keeping the acquisition integration and execution of the strong portfolio of growth catalysts on track. Now that is agility. Turning to Industrial, this segment delivered flat organic growth, albeit better than internal expectations. Similar to the theme from Tools and Storage, operating margin rate declined year-over-year to 16.8% as productivity and cost control were more than offset by commodity inflation, growth investments and the modestly dilutive impact from the acquisition of Nelson Fasteners. Engineered Fastening posted total growth of 20%, with the acquisition of Nelson Fasteners. Organic growth was 3% during the quarter as strong automotive and industrial fastener growth more than offset the expected declines in automotive systems due to lower model rollover activity from our customers. This team has successfully leveraged their base business model to deliver technology, engineering and productivity solutions to increase fastener sales 800 basis points over light vehicle production across the first half of 2018 after growing over 500 basis points over light vehicle production in the second half of 2017. Specifically, we have developed a host of joining and fastening solutions that are positioned for the key trends within the automotive space, namely electrification and light-weighting. Additionally, the team has focused on the high growth local and regional Asian OEMs that are now demanding the higher technology and quality solutions we provide, another great example of commercial excellence at Stanley, Black & Decker. And then finally, the early days of the Nelson integration remain on track to plan and the business is demonstrating pro forma organic growth with strength in the shipbuilding and construction verticals, all-in-all a very solid quarter for Engineered Fastenings. The infrastructure business has posted organic decline of 10% for the quarter. Hydraulic Tools grew organically for the seventh consecutive quarter posting mid single-digit growth as they continue to see the benefits from successful commercial launches. Meanwhile, oil and gas posted a high-teen organic decline in the quarter as expected given the lower pipeline project activity versus the prior year. And then finally, the Security segment demonstrated total growth of 6%, which included the benefits of small bolt-on acquisitions, currency and price partially offset by a 1.5% volume decline in the second quarter. North America growth was down 2% organically as higher automatic door and healthcare volumes were more than offset by lower volume in commercial electronic security, which did have a difficult comparable due to the large installation project activity that occurred in the second quarter of 2017. Europe organic growth was flat as strength in the Nordics was offset by anticipated ongoing weakness in France. In terms of profitability, the segment operating margin was 10%. The rate was down 100 basis points versus the prior year as it was impacted by targeted investments to support the ongoing transformation of the business partially offset by continued cost containment. The security team remains focused on the business transformation, which is targeting three key areas within commercial electronic security : one, applying digital technologies to improve the effectiveness of our service and monitoring organization, while significantly lowering the cost to serve; two, delivering simpler and more flexible solutions for our small to medium-sized customers; and three, leveraging business analytics to provide key business insights to our large national account customers. These initiatives, along with focus on commercial and operational excellence, will position the business for sustained revenue growth and margin expansion over the next 2 years. Now, let\u2019s take a quick look at the quarter\u2019s free cash flow performance on the next page. I would like to highlight that the 2017 cash flow amounts presented reflect the results as previously reported and exclude the impacts of the new accounting standards adopted in January of this year. These accounting standards change the classification of an AR sales program that has since been terminated and has no impact in 2018. We believe that presenting the cash flow results in this manner for 2017 provides a more meaningful view of the company\u2019s historical operating cash flow performance. So, to the actual results for cash flow. For the second quarter, free cash flow was $86 million, which provides our year-to-date performance, but brings our year-to-date performance to a use of cash of $369 million. The quarterly and year-to-date declines versus the prior year are predominantly explained by carrying higher amounts of working capital to support the outsized level of organic growth and upcoming Tools & Storage product launches as well as higher tax payments related to the newly enacted U.S. total charge. From a working capital term perspective, we delivered 6.6 turns in the second quarter, which is a decrease of 0.7 turns versus the prior year. This decline is primarily due to requirements needed to support growth and new product launches, including the pending Craftsman rollout. We are confident that we will deliver strong cash flow generation in the second half of the year given our core SFS processes and principles combined with reducing working capital levels in line with normal seasonal activity. In addition, we will continue to maintain adequate amount of working capital to support our new increased growth expectations. Therefore, we are reiterating our commitment to deliver our free cash flow conversion rate of approximately 100% supported by this expected strong second half cash generation. I would now like to take a minute to provide an update on the external headwinds we are facing this year. And just as importantly, the recovery actions we are executing. We continue to see elevated commodity prices and as a result now expect inflation headwinds to approximate $205 million in 2018, with about $100 million already realized year-to-date. This is up $25 million from our previous expectation of $180 million. Steel, batteries and base metals remain the most significant commodities generating this headwind. Additionally during the last 8 weeks of the quarter, we saw significant currency impacts emerge as the U.S. dollar strengthened. At this time, we estimate this headwind to approximate $80 million in 2018, the pressures being driven primarily by the currencies of Argentina, Brazil, Turkey and Russia. In response, we already implemented an initial set of price increases in June, with an additional set of actions planned for the third quarter. Now, shipping to tariffs, we currently estimate the impact of tariffs to be a 2018 headwind of approximately $35 million. This reflects the impact of Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as the initial $34 billion of Section 301 tariffs on componentry and some finished goods. We have initiated price increases for these implemented tariffs and look to further mitigate the remaining impact via the exclusion, the formal exclusion process, where applicable. In response to these $320 million of total external pressures on this page, we have taken a series of recovery actions. First, we have implemented or are in the process of implementing price increases that should yield $190 million during 2018. This is an increase of $70 million from the $120 million in actions discussed in April. Approximately $40 million of that change is related to foreign currency in emerging markets with the $30 million balance in response to higher commodity inflation and implemented tariffs. We expect the remaining price increases to be implemented during the August-September time period. In addition, $36 million in other cost and productivity actions will be executed to help these external pressures to help offset these external pressures. These represent discretionary cost reductions pacing of some investments that have longer term paybacks and incremental productivity opportunities. These are not investments that will jeopardize key programs that support organic growth in the short to medium-term. Now, turning to the right side of the chart to address the additional $200 billion in tariffs under Section 301 that were announced on July 10, we have not included the impact of these tariffs in our guidance due to the uncertainty around implementation timing and the product categories that will ultimately be included. Prior to mitigating actions, we estimate the annual impact to be approximately $70 million to $80 million. Therefore, if you assume and it is an assumption at September 1 implementation, the 2018 impact could be approximately $25 million. However, we believe this is the potential headwind that we can manage within our current guidance through additional price actions as well as our remaining contingency. These tariffs are focused primarily on finished goods such as vacuums and tools and power tool accessories. If these are implemented, we will look to initiate price actions on affected categories to protect our profitability. Now that these tariffs are beginning to hit finished products, it\u2019s important to note that approximately 50% of our North American tools revenue is supported by our North American manufacturing facilities. This undoubtedly puts us in a favorable position versus competition to navigate these tariffs and may create opportunities for increased demand at our local facilities. So, a lot of moving pieces, but we are acting with agility to implement price and cost actions to offset these transitory headwinds and once they have abate we will have the business positioned for a favorable setup. Moving to our 2018 guidance, we are reiterating our 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $8.30 to $8.50, up approximately 13% versus the prior year at the midpoint. On a GAAP basis, we now expect earnings per share range of $7 to $7.20 inclusive of M&A and other charges. This is a reduction of $0.40 versus our prior outlook. The change in the GAAP guidance is related to the recently announced CPA settlement. Now diving into a little more detail in our 2018 adjusted EPS outlook. You can see on the left hand side of the chart, we expect the previously mentioned benefits from incremental price, cost and productivity actions to generate approximately $0.48 of EPS accretion versus our April guidance assumption. We have also increased our organic volume growth expectations by 1 point contributing an additional $0.12 of EPS accretion. Including the benefits from price, we now expect organic growth to approximate 7% for the company. Finally in April, we also executed a share repurchase of $200 million contributing approximately $0.10 of EPS accretion. This cumulative $0.70 of EPS accretion will be offset in its entirety by higher expectations for commodity inflation, tariffs and currency I just discussed. A few brief model-related planning items. We are revising our average shares outstanding to approximately $153 million, which reflects the April purchase. Second item, we expect lower other net expenses due to the favorable to 2Q resolution of a prior claim. However, this will be offset by increased interest expense expectations reflective of higher interest rates and debt levels due to working capital needs. Third item, we continue to anticipate approximately $50 million of core restructuring charges in 2018. However, the second half charges will be weighted more to the third quarter. Finally, we expect third quarter EPS to approximate 24% of the full year 2018 guide as our third quarter will see the largest impact from commodity inflation and currency, while price increases continue to be implemented throughout the quarter. And finally, turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page, organic growth within Tools & Storage is now expected to be high single-digits in 2018 reflective of strong volume trends in our incremental pricing actions. We believe that market conditions remain supportive and provide a favorable backdrop for our pipeline of organic growth catalysts. This team is focused on key initiatives, FLEXVOLT, Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies, e-commerce, emerging markets and the continued rollout of the Craftsman brand. We are now expecting the segment margin performance to be slightly down year-over-year given the elevated currency and commodity headwinds. In the Industrial segment, we now expect relatively flat performance year-over-year in organic growth versus our prior expectation of low single-digit decline. With the business performing above expectations in the first half of the year, the automotive and industrial fastener growth as well as Hydraulic Tools volume should offset the market-related pressures from automotive systems and lower levels of project activity within oil and gas. We continue to expect our segment margins within industrial to be down year-over-year primarily due to the Nelson Fastener acquisition, but also slightly due to the incremental pressure from inflation and tariffs in these businesses. Nelson currently carried below segment average margins, but with cost synergies, we will get these margins up to the line average in a relatively short timeframe. Finally, in the Security segment, we now expect the organic growth to be relatively flat year-over-year, implying low single-digit organic growth in the second half of the year. We are also revising our margin outlook to down year-over-year as we continue to focus on the business transformation I previously discussed. So in summary, we believe we are taking the appropriate actions to position the company to deliver a robust 7% organic growth, with 13% adjusted EPS expansion. This is overcoming approximately $320 million in commodity inflation, tariffs and currency pressure. In addition, we remain focused on free cash flow generation, price realization, productivity and cost management, acquisition integrations and the rollout of the Craftsman brand. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jeff to say a few words about the Tools performance. Jeff? Jeff Ansell : Thank you, Don. That was a comprehensive overview for the quarter, but I just want to highlight a few key points. First, we continue to generate share gains around the world as evidenced by the strong double-digit growth in North America and emerging markets as well as mid single-digit growth in Europe. As you look across the strategic business units, or SBUs, both delivered 10% organic growth. As expected, our outdoor business recovered on a year-to-date basis in Q2 from the decline in Q1 due to weather. Overall, underlying demand looks to remain strong for the remainder of 2018. Next, Craftsman remains on track delivering about 1 point of growth in the quarter and the initial indications on sell-through are positive. Notably, we are converting new users to the Craftsman brand, which is a share gain opportunity for our retail partners in us. The end-user feedback has been positive with top quartile product rating reviews. We remain on track to execute the initial wave of product and store conversion in the second half of this year. Consistent with our prior communications, Lowe\u2019s and Ace will begin to transition to the new Craftsman offerings across the back half of 2018 with completion in 2019. Lowe\u2019s and Ace expect to have promotional product in all stores by the end of the year. We also expect to begin to provide the Craftsman metal storage to Amazon in Q4, with broader rollout to continue in 2019. Other acquisitions remain positive as well. The integrations remain on track and growth of Irwin, Lenox and Waterloo demonstrated high single-digit organic growth in the quarter. Finally, we are encouraged by positive price in the second quarter and are confident that we will achieve the price realization actions that Don outlined earlier. Now, I will turn it back to Jim to wrap up today\u2019s presentation. Jim Loree : Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Another great quarter for you and your team at Tools and for the total company. In summary, second quarter revenue growth was 11%. All businesses contributed. This was powered by 7% organic growth for the overall company 10% as I mentioned earlier in Tools & Storage. We successfully offset approximately $70 million of headwinds tied to the inflation currency. Importantly, a factor in this was the initial benefit of our pricing actions in the quarter. We delivered 1 point of organic growth from price in the quarter and continue to display the agility necessary to deal with the adversity from some of these external factors. We are confident that we will continue to be successful in the second half. Therefore, we are reiterating adjusted EPS guidance of $8.30 to $8.50, representing a 13% year-over-year increase at midpoint. Capital allocation remains a priority. And as I said, we are evaluating near-term actions to create shareholder value, including both acquisition opportunities and the potential for additional share repurchases. And as we look to close out a successful 2018, we are focused on day-to-day execution and operational excellence. This includes generating above market organic growth leveraging our momentum, driving operating leverage, delivering price productivity and cost actions and successfully integrating our recent acquisition, so lots going on to drive a great year. All of this will also result in strong free cash flow generation at near 100% of net income. And I am confident that we will bring the same level of passion, intensity and agility that we demonstrated in the first half to successfully deliver the second half thus producing another great year for Stanley, Black & Decker. In fact, we are already on it. Dennis, we are now ready for Q&A? Dennis Lange : Great. Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Winoker with UBS. You may begin. Steve Winoker : Thanks. Good morning guys and great to see the volume and pricing traction. And I just want to stick on that, the detail is very helpful on Slide 8. In that though, when you talk about expecting to mitigate the potential additional $25 million if that comes to path, how long you think you can really get the price or how much price you really build in, in that short timeframe given how long it takes as you have taught us all in terms of the lag time for pricing to materialize and how does this relate to the contingency that you guys have talked about also in prior months? I assume that\u2019s all gone at this point. But maybe just give us some color on that. Don Allan : I will take that. Yes, so the latest proposed wave of tariffs as I mentioned in my presentation, if, now still a big if, if it was implemented on September 1, the impact would be $25 million to us in 2018. We believe that within a reasonable timeframe given what we have done with other tariffs and the pricing actions associated with that, that we will be able to offset maybe a third to a half of that with price increases in the year if that occurs on September 1. And then the remaining component of that we would utilize what we have is a contingency to cover the gap between the difference, but you are correct, our contingency within our current guidance is relatively small right now and so we don\u2019t have a lot of ability to maneuver beyond these types of things, but we still have some contingency left. It\u2019s just not as significant, than it was 3 months ago given all the other actions in headwinds that we have seen over the coming 90 days or the last 90 days. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. You may begin. Richard Kwas : Hi, good morning everyone. Jim Loree : Hi, Rich. Richard Kwas : How are you doing? On 301, just as we think about it given your manufacturing capabilities, you talked about price in using that, but it also seems like you have some optionality around taking advantage of your manufacturing base here in North America versus the competition. So, how would you think about toggling price and then potential opportunity for share gains? Jeff Ansell : So, I will take the question. This is Jeff. The make where you sell initiative that Jim has talked about for several years now at this point has certainly provided us an opportunity. So we will take price to offset both commodity inflation and tariffs, all the things that Don has already outlined, but beyond that, we clearly are in the best position from a made in North America perspective around tariffs to execute two things. One, the great volume increases that we have just outlined for the quarter. That was our domestic manufacturing footprint allowed us to keep up pace with that tremendous growth. It also provides us opportunities for the future in terms of products, but not impacted by tariffs while competitive products are. So we feel like we are probably in the best position in the space to deal with the future given these things. Jim Loree : And the other point I would like to make, it\u2019s Jim, is that we don\u2019t know what the lifespan of these tariffs is going to be a couple of months, couple of years forever, who knows. So, supply chain maneuverability is there, but we also have to be cognizant that anytime you move supply chain around significantly there is cost associated with it and there is also risk associated with it. So in the near-term, there won\u2019t be a lot of supply chain maneuvering, it will be mostly price and then we will see as time goes on if there are structural changes to the supply chain that we would like to make, because if it appears that some of these tariffs are going to be longer term in nature. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. You may begin. Rob Wertheimer : Hi, good morning everyone. Jim Loree : Hey, Rob. Rob Wertheimer : So, you have quantified I think pretty rigorously all the tariff impact, so that\u2019s extremely helpful. One quick question, are there any other offsets that are possible, so Jim mentioned, you have take care of a consideration on changing sourcing, but Chinese currency weakening any categorization or exemptions or whatever, I am just trying to figure out how much of potential offsets you have included in the numbers that you have provided on the actual cost could be, what can come back that\u2019s not in there? Jim Loree : Yes. I would say, right now, the vast majority of the assets are price increases being passed on to our customers. As Jim said, we will continue to evaluate other alternatives as time goes on here, but we really don\u2019t know the length of these tariffs and if they preview them to be longer term, then as we get into next year, we will start to evaluate other options, but our focus right now is really transferring the stock\u2019s increase on to the customers and the end users, because we have seen a very direct cost increase and it\u2019s something that we believe that\u2019s the more appropriate response in the short and medium-term. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone and congrats on the quarter. I also wanted to just circle back to price cost, obviously one of the key investor themes so far year-to-date. And what strikes me, I think a lot of people from the slides and again going back to Slide #8, which is very, very helpful? So thanks for that. You see the acceleration in price recovery now expected this year whereas previous couple of calls, you are at a $50 million to $60 million gap, if you just look at commodity inflation versus price. And now you have narrowed that gap pretty significantly as you talk to accelerating some price actions. So just trying to get a better sense of which regions those might be and I think you have talked about at points, emerging markets having some better ability to exact price. If it\u2019s possible to kind of roughly break down that $190 million and also what you have achieved a year-to-date? Jim Loree : Okay, it\u2019s Jim. We are not going to necessarily breakdown the entire 190, but I can tell you of the, first of all, currency is probably the most volatile of all the different headwinds that we have this year and currency when it hits in the emerging markets, it\u2019s almost instantaneous our ability to respond, because the markets are conditioned and our organization is conditioned and we have excellent tracking of the FX impact on various countries and so on. So, we have institutionalized a kind of price increase, price management function within the emerging markets and our systems enable us and the market enables us to react almost on a dime. So, that\u2019s the first thing. The second thing is with respect to cost inflation when the cost inflation first started hitting, it was a gradual kind of increase over several months at the back \u2013 starting with the back half of last year and it was very difficult to have customer discussions until it became large enough so that we could have those customer discussions when it was large enough to do that, we did it and once we did it, there was a lag in implementation that naturally occurs when you have the discussions and then the discussions turn into agreements and then the agreements turn into implementations and that\u2019s particularly true with the larger customers, especially in North America, but also in Europe. So, that\u2019s inflation. Tariffs are relatively straightforward, because they are very easy to calculate. You know what, the percentages, you know what the impact is, they affect the entire industry and there is \u2013 it\u2019s highly unlikely that anyone competitor is going to say a 20% increase or 10% increase in the cost of their products is going to eat that. And so it becomes a fairly kind of logical action for both the suppliers and the customers to implement and that\u2019s until the timing is much shorter in that regard and also in some cases, the tariffs overlap \u2013 or tariffs that were already implemented and price increases have been instituted and in some cases we are able to go back and just incorporate the new tariffs into the previously implemented price increases. So, for all those reasons, there is no straightforward answer to your question, there is a lot of complexity to it, but we have a fantastic ability to have a control of it and handle on it and be able to predict it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Jason Makishi : Hi, guys. This is actually Jason on for Julian. Maybe more for Jeff, so the scope of the Tools & Storage volume improvement was that sort of the cadence of that more weighted towards the back end of the quarter? And I guess in terms of the volume surprise, where did the greatest amount of strength relative to your expectations come in and if there was scope for further improvement geographically or by product, where would that be? Jeff Ansell : Well, if you look at the growth profile for the quarter, I guess the word I would use would be pervasive. So, if you look at the results that were shared earlier, the double-digit growth across North America, single-digit growth across Europe, double-digit growth across the emerging markets and double-digit growth across both strategic business units, I would just say there is not a really easy way to explain, but just pervasive would be the point. So, that explains 8 points of the growth. We did get a benefit of 1 point from Craftsman, we got a benefit of 1 point from the outdoor recovery, but just fantastic growth pervasively around the world is probably the best explanation I can give you and we are very, very pleased with it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open. Tim Wojs : Hey, everybody. Good morning. Nice job managing through all this. Jim Loree : Thanks, Tim. Tim Wojs : I had just more of a strategic question. So there is a larger lawn and garden OEM that sounds like they are exiting a portion of their business over the next couple of years. And so my question is, is there opportunity for you to get bigger in lawn and garden from a manufacturing perspective? And how critical is having that manufacturing for Craftsman reaching that kind of line average margin by 2021? Jim Loree : Very good question. And the answer is lawn and garden is strategic to us post the acquisition of the Craftsman brand. We are exploring opportunities to form partnerships and/or acquiring some assets within that space that would have manufacturing and we have been working on that for a while. And I would expect sometime in the foreseeable future some sort of an announcement coming from us that will leverage our Craftsman brand and presence in the marketplace in lawn and garden, but in a way that will not subject us to the types of volatility that you saw with that one announcement or also in a way that will not subject us to severe operating margin dilution that sometimes occurs in that particular industry, especially from the standpoint of first half versus second half. So, we are actually all over this. We have studied it very thoroughly. We have had numerous conversations with participants in the industry and stay tuned, it won\u2019t be long, I think before you see something that will make a lot of sense for Stanley Black & Decker. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman Associates. Your line is open. Justin Speer : Good morning, guys. Jim Loree : Good morning. Justin Speer : Recognizing, I know you are not going to guide to 2019, but to me the market is pricing in a structural issue with regards to the margin and return profile is associated with some of these tariffs and currency moves \u2013 auditing moves. I wanted to get your sense for the levers that you had to pull to offset the carryover of the current FX and prospective tariffs and commodities that are rolling through as you look to next year just walking through. And as you think about it, I mean, as it graduates to next year, I think there is some concerns that you won\u2019t be able to do that and I guess I\u2019d like to get your perspective on that both from a pricing and internal levers to pull standpoint. Jim Loree : It\u2019s Jim. I will tackle this as an ex-CFO. Don Allan : We are in trouble. Jim Loree : The one thing people don\u2019t really necessarily appreciate \u2013 and I think you obviously do based on the question is that when we go after offsetting these types of things whether it\u2019s inflation, currency, tariffs, whatever it might be \u2013 yes, we are going to recover a certain percentage of the headwind in totality over time and the remainder \u2013 so let\u2019s say that percentage on the average be 70% or 80%. The remaining 20% to 30% is more than offset by the productivity that we generate on a day-to-day basis continuously in our supply chain and our plant system. So we look at these things from a timing perspective, yes, they cause some AJA in the near-term, because we have to respond to the headwind when it arrives and it takes a little time obviously as witnessed this quarter with some operating margin dilution offset by volume gains, but as we flip into the successive year, 2019, by definition, there is going to be some price carryover that is not impacted by new headwinds, if all else equal. So, if there are no new headwinds, then we will have price carryover that will be positive and in the case of 2019, the initial look is meaningfully positive. And so we will see what happens with inflation, with FX and currency as we go forward, but all else equal if we had no more headwinds, there would be a meaningful number of positive accretion to margin that would ultimately end up in margins catching up to where they were before and maybe up a little bit beyond that. And then the story for 2019 for Stanley, Black & Decker is going to be what I talked a lot about earlier, which is the growth catalysts are going to really hit their stride in 2019. We have been growing incredibly well here in this company over the past few years and these catalysts are as strong as I mentioned earlier as I have seen in my entire career here, spanning two decades and we are setup for growth in 2019 that will I think be pretty significant. So, that\u2019s kind of the story with us. There is an arbitrage. It\u2019s affected by timing in the early stages of the headwinds. It\u2019s negative in the late stages when they anniversary. It goes positive to catch up and then beyond that maybe some additional accretion based on productivity and mix management and so forth. And then, you have got the growth for next year. Don Allan : And as I will just add on to that, as the current CFO, I will add on and validate what Jim said. It\u2019s completely accurate obviously, but I think also when you look at history, you go back in time and you look at how we have responded to commodity inflation, currency, and you look at it over a 2-year window. In year one, we tend to recover depending on the timing of when these things happen, but in normal course, we tend to recover close to two-thirds of the headwind in year one. But when you look at it over a 2-year period of time, our history has been that we recover somewhere between 75% and 85% of the total headwinds through price actions and then the difference is covered through the things that Jim was mentioning around productivity. So, our history would demonstrate that for next year we would have a positive impact from the net of all these different things that Jim was describing. So I think that\u2019s an important factor that you have to keep in mind that this is not something unusual, this is something that we can point to three or four different occasions over the last 20 years where this has occurred. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Wood with Nomura. Your line is open. Michael Wood : Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask you about the seasonality of earnings. It looks like to hit the fourth quarter implied guidance range, your Tools segment incremental margins \u2013 look like they would have to get back to or better than what you typically see in the mid 20% range. So, I just wanted to see \u2013 is that the correct way to think about Tools segment incremental margins as we go into the fourth quarter and just what does that imply with where you are in price/cost at that point in time in the segment? Thank you. Jeff Ansell : Yes. I think the way to think about it is you have to recognize that the commodity inflation started in 2017, so we had a fair amount of commodity inflation in the fourth quarter of \u201817. And in the fourth quarter this year, we will see the biggest impact from pricing actions will be in the fourth quarter when you look at the full year. So that pricing impact continues to grow from the second quarter to the third quarter to the fourth quarter. And actually at this point, the pricing impact reverses the headwinds in the fourth quarter and will be a slight positive and so that will be the first quarter we will experience that here in 2018. And so that\u2019s certainly going to help margins combining with the fact that you have a comp where you are dealing with margins that were suppressed in the fourth quarter of 2017, because that was really the beginning of the commodity inflation wave. I think that\u2019s the best way to think about it why the profitability will be higher in Tools in the fourth quarter versus what we have experienced in the first three quarters of this year as well as why it will be higher versus prior year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Ken Zener : Gentlemen, good morning. Jim Loree : Good morning, Ken. Ken Zener : Jeff, could you comment on North America Pro Power Tools, the gains were so strong. It seems as though much more of the gains were happening on the pro side versus the DIY side. So Hitachi in the private equity company, Makita, Bosch, are the share gains really coming from like-for-like product or how should we think about your extending your product reach? So, it\u2019s obviously flexible. You are able to dislocate Bosch\u2019s high end table saw for example. That\u2019s kind of a new reach for you. How much of it share gains in the like-for-like categories as opposed to your vitality rate and all this innovation, I am just trying to see how dynamic that pro side is? Thank you very much. Jeff Ansell : Sure. But I would say the vitality rate and the share gains are kind of one and the same. So, we are experiencing share gains highly connected to the fact that we have really strong new product vitality. So if you look at the professional power tool business in North America, which is what you asked about, we were up in every portion of that business from a corded perspective, from a low voltage perspective to a high-voltage FlexVolt perspective. And so it\u2019s a number of things, right. So, it\u2019s the fact that we have the largest cordless system that brings the user into it. It\u2019s also our made in USA strategy where we are the only manufacturer of professional power tools in America. So if you add those things together, it\u2019s driven by vitality, but there is no doubt that there is share gain and that the share gain likely impacts all the companies you just described in your question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open. David MacGregor : Yes, congratulations on the progress in a pretty tough environment. You guys have a lot on your plate. So I am surprised. Jim Loree : Thank you. David MacGregor : I guess just a question for Jeff I guess when we are obviously saw in power tools, there have been some talk about the second quarter planned channel inventory reductions around the Craftsman rollout. And I was just wondering if you could comment on how that unfolded. Was it aligned with plan? And we expect some of that will trigger into \u2013 trip into the third quarter, what are the expectations for that as well? Jeff Ansell : Really, the short answer is I think we commented more extensively in the first quarter as those inventory levels came down for the rollout from retail perspective for the Craftsman rollout. Everything throughout the second quarter remained on track, almost exactly as we had projected, where the inventory levels kind of solidified their position, new Craftsman rolled in, POS was very positive. So, all those things were in balance and so we anticipate that to continue on for the remainder of the year kind of as we described last earnings call, but we are very pleased with the ramp and the rollout. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Megan McGrath with MKM Partners. Your line is open. Megan McGrath : Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up a little bit on your commentary around cash flow and marry it with your comments that you really don\u2019t know how long these tariffs are going to last. So, how do you think about that in terms of potential M&A? Does it make you more likely to do a domestic acquisition? Are you hesitating at all on acquisitions outside? Are valuations changing at all, maybe talk us through that a little bit. Jim Loree : Sure. The acquisition pipeline is strong. And in several cases, there are deals that are right smack in our heartland and would strengthen some of our key franchises immensely and at the same time, we sit here today, we look at the stock price where it is and we say wow, we do tend to allocate half of our capital over a long-term basis to returning to the shareholders and we just raised the dividend, but that only accounts for something like 30% of the typical excess capital. And so there is always some room for share repurchases in that equation. And we look at our balance sheet right now, which is pretty strong and we say we have the opportunity to allocate capital at this point and so what do we do with it? And we look at these acquisitions, they come and they go over time. And as I said, the pipeline is strong and so it\u2019s very difficult \u2013 it\u2019s a challenging trade-off to make right now when we can buy our own stock and feel really great about it, because you can tell by the dialogue here that we are confident in our operations and our strategy and so forth in 2018 and 2019. So the way we are thinking about it right now is if the stock kind of gets some traction and starts going in the right direction again, we have the opportunity to dive into some really interesting M&A opportunities consistent with our 22/22 vision. And if we continue to languish in terms of our TSR performance, then I think stock buyback comes up front and center and we will just see what happens. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is from Mike Shlisky with Seaport Global. Your line is open. Mike Shlisky : Good morning, guys. Jim Loree : Good morning. Mike Shlisky : So I wanted to ask quickly about Nelson Fasteners, can you guys give us sort of an update there on the timing? Do you think you will get the margins in line with the broader industrial segment by the end of this year and then next year will kind of be more of what to expect on a kind of full year basis from that one or is that more of a 2020 timeframe where you will get the margins in line for a full calendar year there? Don Allan : Yes, good question. So, we are really pleased with the initial stages of the integration with Nelson Fasteners. It\u2019s gone very well over the last 90 days or so and we would expect with the cost synergies and other activities and then eventually a little bit of revenue synergies playing out that by the end of next year, we will be approaching line average at that stage. And so by 2020 that full year \u2013 we will be right in line with the average for the segment. So, I think that\u2019s the right way to think about it. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Shannon thanks. We would like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and thank you for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thanks for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Dennis Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's third quarter 2018 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, Executive Vice President and President of Global Tools & Storage. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 11 :30 AM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim, Don and Jeff will review our third quarter 2018 results and other various matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risks and uncertainty. It's, therefore, possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and our most recent 1934 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As you saw in our release, we delivered a strong third quarter in the face of some very difficult external headwinds. The company posted above-market organic revenue growth and 6% EPS expansion, overcoming approximately $135 million of currency commodity and tariff-related pressures. Revenues were $3.5 billion, up 4%, with organic growth of 4% and acquisitions adding 2 points of growth, which was offset by a 2-point currency headwind. Tools & Storage was the vanguard, pressing ahead with all major geographies and business units, contributing to a robust 6% organic growth. Tools leveraged our strong portfolio of organic catalysts to deliver this above-market growth. Price added 1 point to the growth and realization expanded 50 basis points sequentially, reflecting benefit from our third quarter list price increases, and Don Allan will provide some more color on this in his remarks. Industrial delivered 10% total growth with the Nelson Fastener acquisition contributing 11 points, partially offset by 1 point of unfavorable currency. Organic growth was flat as solid performances within Engineered Fastening and hydraulics were offset by expected declines in Oil & Gas. Engineered Fastening delivered strong fastener penetration within automotive and industrial, which more than offset the expected volume declines in Engineered Fastening's automotive systems. It is important to note that that systems volume is highly correlated to new car platforms and 2018, as expected, has been unusually light for these platforms. With that being said, our win rate on new vehicle production lines is very high, so this weakness will take care of itself in 2019 and beyond. Security delivered total growth of 1% as bolt-on acquisitions and price offset currency and modest volume declines. The Security team is fully engaged now in executing its transformational plan, and we are encouraged by the clarity of the vision and the sense of urgency. We believe we are making sustainable changes that will position this business for consistent revenue growth and margin expansion. EPS for the quarter was $2.08, up 6% as price, cost control and volume leverage offset the significant impact from commodity inflation, currency and tariffs. Consistent with our long-term capital allocation strategy, we completed a $300 million share repurchase during the quarter and announced the IES attachments and MTD Products transactions. This reflects our balanced approach to capital deployment by executing strategic M&A opportunities, adding growth catalysts to the portfolio, while concurrently repurchasing shares. And as we look ahead to 2019, our view now contemplates a significant carryover impact from these external headwinds, including commodity inflation, currency and tariffs, as well as a somewhat slower U.S. residential housing and automotive markets related to continued upward pressure on U.S. short-term interest rates. And as such, we will be executing a cost reduction program to deliver approximately $250 million of pre-tax savings in 2019. Our seasoned, capable management team will continue to address these external issues with price recovery actions and adjustments to our supply chain. In addition, we believe these additional cost measures are required to preserve our ability to deliver respectable earnings growth and cash flow next year. Our company has been on and continues to enjoy an excellent growth trajectory, and we will not allow these external impacts to erode the financial benefits from these catalysts, nor cast a cloud over this outstanding growth story. And while the short-term external environment has become more difficult, our long-term strategy and approach to capital allocation remains intact. We are well positioned with multiple company-specific growth drivers, which will buffer the revenue impact from slower end markets and provide for relative outperformance. Craftsman is compelling growth program that has begun its rollout at Lowe's. The exciting news today is that we now expect to achieve our $1 billion Craftsman growth target by 2021, six years ahead of our prior expectations. That means this $1 billion target within four years is about 60% sooner than the 10 years originally anticipated. In another piece of great news today, we announced an exclusive partnership for the STANLEY and the STANLEY FATMAX brands jointly with The Home Depot. This important win represents an exciting growth opportunity that will begin next year. These announcements underscore the very healthy commercial relationships that we share with both of our tremendous U.S. home center partners as well as all of our retail partners around the globe. They also highlight the inherent strategic advantages associated with our powerful brand portfolio. More on that when Jeff speaks in a few minutes. Across both emerging markets and developed markets, e-commerce remains a key commercial driver, which this year represents a $1 billion high-growth business for us, up from almost nothing in 2010. We are the global industry leader in this channel, which is an excellent source of high-double digit growth and will continue for years to come. In the emerging markets, we continue to enjoy double-digit growth and share gain. We are leveraging the strength of our brands, business model and coordinated product offerings across the developing markets, including STANLEY-branded mid-price point corded and cordless power tools, as well as hand tool products. We continue to enjoy success, growing at two times to three times market growth rates. And as for the Newell Tools acquisition, we expect to deliver $100 million to $150 million of organic growth from revenue synergies as we broaden the distribution of these products around the world. Our innovation machine continues to be alive and well. We are seeing continued revenue benefits from FLEXVOLT, and expect to generate growth from other new innovations as our past investments are bearing fruit. Finally, we expect to generate inorganic growth from the IES transaction in 2019, and we are excited about the future benefits from our transaction with MTD, which gives us an option to buy the remaining 80% of the greater than $2 billion lawn and garden company in 2021 and beyond. These catalysts will continue to support share gain in the markets we serve as we continue to work to generate new catalysts, leveraging the SFS 2.0 operating system and through a future capital deployment. So, in summary, there's a lot to be excited about with this powerful growth story, even as we make some very prudent supply chain and cost structure adjustments to ensure the benefit of all this revenue growth makes its way into operating margin and EPS. And now, I will turn it over to Don Allan, who will walk you through more detail on segment performance, overall financial results, and 2018 guidance. Don? Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the third quarter. Tools & Storage delivered 3% revenue growth, with a strong 6% organic growth, which was offset by 3 points of currency. Organic growth comprised a volume of slightly less than 5 points, while price was just above 1 point. More specifically, price realization actions taken in response to external headwinds contributed 1.3 points of organic growth, expanding 50 basis points from the second quarter. We continue to execute and realize our list price actions in accordance with our prior expectations, and we expect that this list price contribution will grow again in the fourth quarter. We should keep in mind that overall pricing impact is not a science and it requires judgment as the team balances many factors such as buying behavior, mix of products, when and where the purchase occurs, or if it is purchased on promotion. Our Tools & Storage business continues to operate with a dual objective to deliver above-market share volume growth and strive to project our margin rate. If you look at the margin rate results for Tools & Storage in the third quarter, the net effect of this was slightly better than expectation, showing the team is managing this dynamic very effectively. With that said, the operating margin rate for Tools & Storage was 16.6% versus 17.3% in the third quarter 2017 as benefits of volume leverage, pricing, and cost control were more than offset by the impacts from these headwinds we've described of currency, commodity inflation and tariffs. The strong organic growth and related share gains are experienced across each Tools & Storage region and SBU. On a geographic basis, North America was up 6% organically with growth across all channels. U.S. retail generated mid-single-digit growth, U.S. commercial markets posted high-single-digit growth, and our industrial and automotive repair markets generated mid-single-digit growth. North America's growth continued to be fueled by new product innovations including FLEXVOLT, the Craftsman brand rollout, and price realizations. We did see some higher-than-expected negative volume impacts from our Craftsman brand transition specifically related to our legacy brands. This being said, Craftsman was still a major growth driver for the quarter and net of this transition impact, and will continue to deliver growth for the foreseeable future. Europe delivered 3% organic growth in the quarter. Eight of the 10 markets grew organically with above-average contributions from France, Central Europe, Greece and Iberia. In the UK, we did experience some market pressure, which we believe is related to Brexit uncertainty and negative volume impacts related to targeted customer transitions within the UK. This contributed approximately 3 points of pressure versus our expectation for this region. Overall, the team continues to deliver new product innovations and expand retail relationships to produce above-market organic growth. Finally, emerging markets continued their trend of outstanding organic growth up 10%, with all regions contributing. Diligent pricing actions topped with increased currency headwinds, and continued focus on e-commerce and the ongoing MPP launch continued to support this growth. Geographically, Latin America was very strong headlined by mid-teen organic growth within Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico, leading with high-single-digit or double-digit-organic performance. With regard to other emerging markets outside of Latin America, we posted double-digit growth in Russia, Korea, Taiwan and India. Now, let's turn to the performance of Tools & Storage SBUs, starting with Power Tools & Equipment, which delivered 8% organic growth. Power Tools & Equipment benefited from new product introductions, and FLEXVOLT delivered robust growth once again and is now tracking at mid-teens growth year-to-date. FLEXVOLT growth continues to be led by increased penetration of the system and the new product launches within that category. Hand Tools, Accessories & Storage delivered 4% organic growth as new product introductions, solid performances within the construction- and industrial-focused product lines, as well as the contribution from Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies. So, in summary, a strong quarter for the Tools & Storage organization with growth in every region as the team executes on the exciting portfolio of growth initiatives that Jim covered earlier. Margins remained solid and 16.6% as the team pursued growth, cost control, and price increases to recover the headwinds from currency, cost inflation and tariffs. While the external environment remains volatile, this team continues to act with agility and is focused on positioning the business for further growth. Now, turning to Industrial, this segment delivered 10% total revenue growth with the Nelson Fastener acquisition and contributing 11 points, offset by 1 point of currency. Organic growth was flat, but in line with expectations. Operating margin rate declined year-over-year to 16.8% as productivity gains and cost control were more than offset by commodity inflation and the modestly diluted impact from the acquisition of Nelson Fasteners. Within Industrial, Engineered Fastening posted total growth of 15%, with the acquisition of Nelson Fasteners leading the way. Organic growth was 1% during the quarter as strong industrial and automotive fasteners growth more than offset the expected declines in automotive systems due to lower model rollover activity from our customers. The Nelson integration remains on track to plan, and the business is demonstrating pro forma organic growth supported by new applications in aerospace, defense and infrastructure. All in all, a solid quarter for Engineered Fastening. The Infrastructure business has posted an organic decline of 6% for the quarter. Hydraulic tools posted low-single-digit growth as it continued to see the benefits from successful commercial actions. Meanwhile Oil & Gas posted high-single-digit organic decline in the quarter, as expected, given the lower pipeline project activity versus the prior year. Then finally, the Security segment demonstrated total growth of 1%, with flat organic growth in the third quarter. North America growth was down 1% organically as higher automatic door volumes were more than offset by lower volume in commercial electronic security. Europe organic growth was flat as strength in the Nordics was offset by weakness in France and in the UK. In terms of profitability, the segment operating margin rate expanded to 11.1%, improving 110 basis points sequentially, but down 20 basis points year-over-year. The Security team is working diligently to optimize our cost to serve, while positioning the business to provide new and differentiated offerings to our large key account customers and our small- to medium-sized accounts. We expect as these initiatives gain further traction as we head into 2019, it will set up the business for more consistent organic revenue growth with meaningful margin expansion. It was promising this quarter to see the business stabilize operating margin dollars versus the prior year and improve the rates sequentially. I would now like to take a few minutes to provide an update on the potential impact of the Sears bankruptcy filing that occurred on Monday, October 15, as we've heard several questions from many of you. In terms of commercial exposure, we sell approximately $50 million annually to Sears Holdings, so a small exposure for the company. As it relates to the Craftsman brand transaction, our future payment obligations associated with the purchase of the Craftsman brand remain unchanged. One, we will make a onetime payment of $250 million in March of 2020. Two, beginning also in March of 2020, we will begin making quarterly royalty payments for all-new Stanley Black & Decker-generated Craftsman sales. Number three, the royalty-free license agreement that is currently in place allows Sears to develop and sell the Craftsman brand within Sears Holding stores. And then, four, as we've said in the past, we will honor valid warranty claims for Craftsman products as it is an important aspect of the brand and the right thing to do. On items one through three, these arrangements which currently remain in place and they are legally binding. Should Sears enter liquidation legal proceedings, the obligations under items one and two will remain. For items three and four, there would be a net onetime non-cash gain recognized within our results when this occurs. In other words, the deferred revenue liability recorded for the royalty-free license would be reversed into the P&L, and that would be partially offset by an increase to our warranty reserve due to higher historical exposure we would now have. As you look ahead, the most important aspect of all this is we believe the potential impacts from a smaller Sears clearly would be a positive for our ongoing Craftsman launch. Now, let's turn to the right side of the chart because I'd like to comment briefly on tariffs. Now that List 3 of section 301 tariffs is in effect at a 10% rate currently and will increase to a 25% rate in January of 2019, the annual impact of Lists 1 through 3 would be approximately $250 million, which is a $200 million increase versus 2018. Items carrying a tariff at this point represent approximately two-thirds of our imports from China. About 90% of this impact is composed of finished goods. Some key categories including mechanics tools, power tool accessories, vacuums and some hand tools. We expect to continue to get pricing associated with tariffs, and our price increases for List 3 will be implemented in January of 2019. Should a List 4 be put into effect covering all remaining imported products from China and, again, assuming a 25% tariff, this would represent another $125 million to $150 million of additional annualized risk before mitigation. It is important to note that if this situation occurs, we believe we are favorably positioned versus competition as approximately 50% of our North American sales are supported by tools production from North American facilities. From a tariff mitigation standpoint, we are acting first with price increases as well as using the exclusion process when available. We have had success already in mitigating some of this impact through leveraging our supply chain and receiving exemptions from the U.S. government. We now have become more aggressive in planning and executing supply chain moves to mitigate tariff impacts. We have been preparing this plan since the tariff discussion hit the radar earlier this year. We continue to evaluate the capital requirements and the respective returns on these investments. This dynamic environment creates the need for agility, and also is an opportunity to more aggressively localize production and expand on our make where we sell strategy. We will begin aggressively accelerating this strategy as we move into 2019. Now, turning to an update on our 2018 guidance. We are revising our 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $8.10 up to $8.20 from the previous range of $8.30 to $8.50. This revised EPS midpoint represents an increase of approximately 9% versus prior year, while overcoming $370 million in external headwinds versus the prior year. On a GAAP basis, we now expect an earnings per share range of $5.90 to $6.00 from the previous range of $7 to $7.20. The largest factor impacting the change in GAAP guidance is the restructuring charges associated with the cost reduction program discussed by Jim earlier. We are being proactive and focused on counteracting these external headwinds for 2019. Therefore, we are taking action to adjust our cost base and implementing a cost reduction program to deliver $250 million in annual cost savings in 2019. The pre-tax restructuring charge is expected to be approximately $125 million and is anticipated to be booked in the fourth quarter of 2018. Now, diving into a little more detail on our 2018 adjusted EPS outlook. You can see on the left-hand side of the chart, we expect higher input costs associated with tariffs, currency and commodities, as well as slightly lower expected organic growth, which will decrease earnings per share by $0.25 and $0.15, respectively. Partially offsetting these headwinds, we expect benefits from an anticipated lower tax rate and other below-the-line items to generate approximately $0.15 of EPS accretion. Now, turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page. Organic growth expectation within Tools & Storage remains at high-single digits in 2018. The team is focused on key initiatives, including the rollout of the Craftsman brand, FLEXVOLT, Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies, e-commerce and emerging markets, and is delivering strong growth in 2018 as a result. We expect the segment margin performance to be down year-over-year given primarily due to the elevated currency, commodity and tariff headwinds, which were partially offset by list price increases and cost containment actions. As it relates to Industrial and Security, there's no change from our 2018 guidance view we provided in July. Next, I would like to provide an update on our free cash flow performance and outlook. For the third quarter, free cash flow was $82 million, which brings our year-to-date performance to a use of cash of $287 million. The quarterly and year-to-date declines versus the prior year are explained by higher M&A-related restructuring and other payments, as well as higher working capital pressure from our ongoing Craftsman launch. We are confident that we will deliver strong cash flow generation in the fourth quarter given our core SFS processes and principles, combined with reducing working capital levels in line with normal seasonal activity. We are, however, revising our outlook to deliver a free cash flow conversion rate of approximately 90%. This recognizes our expectation to carry higher inventory due to continued growth in the business and the ongoing Craftsman rollout. Also, we expect higher M&A-related payments this year versus previous expectation in January. The last comment I have related to this page is as it relates to our view for 2019. This view now contemplates a significant carryover impact from external headwinds such as commodity inflation, currency and tariffs, as well as a potentially slower U.S. residential housing and automotive market related to the continued upward pressure on U.S. short-term interest rates. As we've said, we are being proactive and focused on counteracting these external headwinds for 2019, which, at this stage, will be similar in size to the $370 million headwind we are experiencing in 2018. Therefore, we are taking action to adjust our cost base and implementing a cost reduction program to deliver $250 million in annual cost savings in 2019. This cost reduction program, along with our continued focus on price realization, is expected to exceed these external headwinds so we can deliver a meaningful net positive heading into next year. Therefore, we believe with the 2019 environment, which has a reasonable level of market growth, our earnings will grow high-single digits versus 2018. So, in summary, we believe we are taking the appropriate actions to position the company to deliver a solid 6% organic growth with 9% adjusted EPS expansion, again overcoming approximately $370 million in commodity inflation, tariffs and currency pressures. This performance is quite impressive given the magnitude of these headwinds. The organization remains focused on free cash flow generation, price realization, productivity and cost management, as well as acquisition integrations and the rollout of the Craftsman brand. We are focused on executing on our proactive cost reduction response, which will ensure the business is well positioned to deliver sustained above-market organic growth with earnings expansion in 2019. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jeff to say a few words about Craftsman and our exciting new commercial agreement with The Home Depot. Jeffery D. Ansell - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Thank you, Don. I'd like to make a few key points related to the Craftsman rollout, and as Jim referenced earlier, announce a new partnership for our STANLEY and STANLEY FATMAX brands. We continue to generate share gains around the world as evidenced by high-single digit organic growth demonstrated year-to-date, with growth in every strategic business unit and every geography. This is being delivered as we execute the biggest and most exciting Craftsman product launch in modern history. Craftsman achieved strong growth in the quarter following the successful launch of 1,200 new products, including many that are manufactured in the United States with global materials for the first time in decades. As planned, Lowe's and Ace have begun rolling out new Craftsman offerings, which will continue in Q4 through completion in 2019. Amazon has built strong customer excitement for the launch of our metal storage range in Q4, with a broader rollout to continue throughout 2019. Initial feedback from the Craftsman rollout shows that we are converting new users to the Craftsman brand, which is a share gain opportunity for both our retail partners and us. The end user feedback has been exceptionally positive with top-quartile product review ratings. The end user and customer enthusiasm, coupled with the recent Sears bankruptcy announcement, gives us confidence that we can deliver $1 billion in Craftsman growth by 2021, as Jim said, six full years ahead of schedule. I'd shift now to an exciting update on our partnership with The Home Depot. Today, we've announced that The Home Depot will be the exclusive home improvement retailer for the STANLEY Hand Tools & Storage product portfolio, both in-store and online beginning in 2019. Also included in this exclusive offering is the STANLEY FATMAX product line, the world's leading tape measure brand known for innovation and durability. This agreement represents one of the largest exclusivity partnerships in the tools and storage industry, enhancing our robust offering at The Home Depot with existing exclusives in DEWALT FLEXVOLT cordless tools and DEWALT hand tools. We're excited to expand our partnership and provide both pro and DIY consumers with unparalleled access to the STANLEY and STANLEY FATMAX portfolios. This agreement is an example of our business' commitment to commercial excellence, a representation of the vision we have for our portfolio of iconic brands across the retail landscape. Our strategic brand partnerships with industry-leading retailers are designed to best serve our customers and end users in the U.S. and across the globe. Now, I turn it back to Jim to wrap today's presentation. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Jeff, thanks for sharing those exciting developments regarding our partners and the Craftsman STANLEY and STANLEY FATMAX brands. It's encouraging to see how we are building upon our strong customer partnerships and realizing new opportunities for growth. It's also rewarding to be able to officially update our projection for Craftsman to deliver $1 billion of growth by 2021. So moving to the third quarter, to summarize, we delivered a solid performance of 4% organic growth and 6% EPS expansion, overcoming $135 million in currency, commodity and tariff headwinds. Our teams remain focused on price execution and cost control in response to the external pressures which have now grown to $370 million for 2018 as Don mentioned. And despite these headwinds, we are expected to deliver strong financial performance with 6% organic growth and 9% EPS expansion for the full year 2018. This is a testament to the speed and agility of our team and the strength of our SFS 2.0 operating system that we are in this position today. And as you heard earlier, we are building into our planning, a continuation of this dynamic and volatile macroenvironment, and announced a cost reduction program targeted to deliver $250 million in annual savings for 2019. This will prepare the business for respectable earnings growth and cash flow next year in spite of the carryover headwinds. And as we look to close out 2018, we are focused on execution and operational excellence. This includes generating revenue growth with operating leverage, delivering on pricing, productivity, and cost actions, and successfully integrating our recent acquisitions while generating strong free cash flow. I'm confident that we will be successful in navigating these near-term headwinds and remain optimistic about the outlook for our company-specific growth initiatives, which will buffer the revenue impact from slower end markets and provide for earnings growth and relative outperformance. And just to reiterate, these catalysts include the accelerating Craftsman rollout, a new exclusive STANLEY, STANLEY FATMAX partnership at Home Depot, our growing e-commerce share gains around the globe, a robust emerging market growth program, growing revenue synergies from the Lenox/Irwin acquisition, continued revenue benefits from FlexVolt, and new innovations, and the recently announced IES transaction, quite a robust list. We also remain focused on our long-term strategy and our 2022 vision. When we announced 22/22, the base year was 2016 and we were $11 billion in revenue. We will be $14 billion this year, and we now have reasonable visibility to $22 billion by 2022 based on our growth pipeline and the transactions already announced, plus another $1 billion to $2 billion in acquired revenue in the 2020 to 2022 timeframe. That is very exciting and encouraging in the face of all these near-term challenges. Dennis, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis Lange - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Hey, Jeff. Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : I apologize. It might be a little bit of a multi-part question. But I just wanted to confirm what the headwind is for 2019. And it does sound like the restructuring action is just meant to counter the tariff-related headwinds, and therefore, you're relying on price and other methods to cover the balance. And I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit just on the restructuring. We view you as a very lean, well run, tightly managed company. $250 million is a big number. Maybe you could give us a little bit of color where that comes from, how you get it? Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Sure. I'll start with the first part of your question. So, yes, for 2019, we believe the headwinds of the three categories will be very similar to the 2018 level of $370 million at this stage. So about $200 million of that is related to tariffs, and then the remainder is split between commodity inflation and currency. So you can look at that and say $370 million. We're taking price actions on virtually all of those particular items. We've either done that this year or we will do it early next year related to List 3. In addition to that, we're also doing $250 million of cost takeout actions to be responsive to potentially more headwinds, potentially slower markets, and potentially managing our price dynamics, as we put all this price into the market next year to ensure we can have earnings growth next year. So we're trying to have different levers that we can pull associated with these headwinds, which allows us to grow our earnings, as I said, high single-digits for next year versus 2018. On the cost reduction side, I mean, we will go through a process that we've done many times before as a company. We haven't done one of these in a while. However, the discipline in structure on the process is very much focused on, what are the types of costs that we can take out that would not impact growth initiatives within the short-term and the midterm? How do we ensure that we don't slow momentum in some of these great growth catalysts that both Jeff and Jim talked about this morning? And so it will be very much targeted to activities that are removed from the customer in that regard, removed from the innovation categories, et cetera, that really do impact growth in the timeframe of the next one to three years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Hi Julian. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, just wondered if you could give a bit more color on the top line performance within U.S. Tools & Storage. Your U.S. retail sales slowed quite a lot in Q3. And that was before, I guess, for the price increases that will come. So maybe talk a little bit about the cadence of the Tools & Storage business demand in the U.S. And, also, what type of price increases you think you can get in the future without driving volume demand disruption as the demand seems to be softening kind of even before another round of price increases? Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yeah, so we \u2013 in the U.S. market in particular, we, as I mentioned in my comments, the transition of Craftsman as far as getting Craftsman into the stores, in Lowe's stores, is going very, very well. But as we look at the legacy brands that are being transitioned out, that impact has been a little bit more negative than we originally forecasted. So, therefore, that was one of the larger pressure points that we saw within the U.S. market. Our price expectation was a little bit higher than what actually occurred as well within the U.S. market. And so that was probably the second category. But the first one was probably the larger impact that really drove that. We will continue to put price into the market related to the tariffs that are coming in January for List 3. And we will also continue to monitor the elasticity of how the volume responds to those price increases. And we will manage through that in a way that is balanced along the lines that I touched on earlier where we have a dual objective. When we have market growth, we want to make sure that we outpace market growth at some level. So we're gaining share along the way through our innovation and our commercial excellence. At the same time, we want to manage our margin rate. So you have to have that balanced approach between the two. And so we'll be watching the price reaction in a very focused level. We'll continue to monitor that, and therefore, we'll have to make adjustments along the way to ensure that we achieve that dual objective which is another reason why we're taking costs out of the system, because as we manage that dynamic, it allows us to have another level to ensure that we can grow our earnings? James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: I also want to say \u2013 this is Jim. I also want to say that the U.S. consumer is alive and well, so this is not a doom and gloom story. This is \u2013 the wage rates are up and people are spending. Consumer confidence is off the charts, new records. So I think the \u2013 retail sales may have slowed slightly, but it's not like, all of a sudden, we have a vacuum in the demand. That could come. To your point, the elasticity of demand, all these price increases that companies are taking with respect to these tariffs, elasticity of demand surely will create some lower level of demand at some point in the future. But I want to make it very clear that it's not a doom and gloom story right now. And we don't expect it to be in the fourth quarter because the bulk of the tariff increases really don't hit until January 1st. Jeffery D. Ansell - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: One point to add on to that, to what Jim and Don said, Julian, was that through the course of 2018, we have high confidence. We'll grow in the high single-digit range which will be 2X the market even as we launch 1,200 new Craftsman products, bringing down other brands to move them across the retail segment. So a lot of moving pieces, but we are very confident our growth will outpace the market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Just a couple for me. Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Hi, Rich, good morning. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : How are you doing? So, on $1 billion dollars, first of all, is that net of cannibalization. It sounds like there was some cannibalization here in Q4 or Q3 I should say, and so what would be that near-term in terms of the impact, how we should be thinking about that, and just clarity on that $1 billion. And then secondly, what is the price assumption now for the year for 2018? It was $190 million. I just wanted to get an update there. Thank you. Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yeah, so the $1 billion clearly includes some cannibalization. However, if you think about what Jeff and Jim talked about related to Home Depot, we would like to think that as we rolled that out in Home Depot for STANLEY and STANLEY FATMAX that we can have a mitigating effect on some of the cannibalization that we're experiencing this year and into part of next year or a large portion of next year. So, if you look out over the four-year time horizon that the $1 billion dollars will evolve, our hope is, is that the cannibalization component of that is not very significant. But we'll see how that plays out over time, but we'll continue to see some cannibalization impact as we exit this year and we go into next year. But we do believe the cannibalization impact will be a little less in the fourth quarter and begin to mitigate itself a little bit more throughout 2019. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: That's also going to be affected by the Sears financial situation. So that business has to go somewhere. And we only had a very small amount of business with Sears. I think it was running around $50 million annually. So we feel like that is a very, very positive development from a revenue point of view for us. Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: As far as price this year to your second question, it will be lower than the previous communicated $190 million, probably by about $30 million to $40 million. That's kind of a rough magnitude of where it will be. A large chunk of that happened in Q3, and a little bit more will happen in Q4? James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: We will also say that the peak of the cannibalization really occurred in Q3. I mean, that's when we started most of this process. So the cannibalization rate will be less in Q4 and it will dissipate as we roll through 2019. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with UBS. Your line is open. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : I also have a multi-part question here. So the first one is, that $125 million expense is what I see for the $250 million of savings, is that correct or what else have you got going in there to get to $250 million? And then secondly, I just want to come back to this pricing point that was just raised. A little more feeling for why you were $30 million to $40 million short, how that affects your timing and thinking of what will be really much more concern than I've got around 2019 versus 2018 as opposed to sort of the rest of this year. And I know you mentioned the demand part, but that \u2013 a bit better sense for how you were kind of digging in and really getting a higher comfort level that you can hold it given maybe your prior experiences with soft demand? James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: So part, the one answer is yes. $125 million and $250 million are \u2013 that's all of it. The second thing is, it's early days. And for anyone to speculate that they understand what the elasticity of demand is for all these SKUs in a timeframe when there is really no precedent for these types of price increases in the United States. On the other hand, we have a fair amount of experience in the emerging markets with pretty dramatic price increases. When the currencies weaken, we frequently find ourselves raising prices to offset those currency impacts, and you see continued solid growth in all those markets. We have double-digit growth in the emerging markets. Sometimes you end up with a shift from a volume-driven organic growth to more price-driven organic growth. But in the end, you get the organic growth and you protect the margins. And that's kind of our approach. So we can't tell you how much price we're going to get next year right now. One of the reasons we did, I think Don mentioned this, one of the reasons we did the cost reduction is because we want to have those levers. We want to be able to have the flexibility to manage our price volume and still drive earnings growth and that will give us the opportunity to do that in 2019. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning, guys. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Josh. Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning. Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just wanted to dig in a little bit more on this STANLEY and FATMAX exclusivity announcement. You mentioned some disruption in the channel, call it cannibalization around some product line transitions. Could we see something similar with this as those brands get consolidated into Home Depot? And could you maybe size what that looks like? I think we can all kind of look at what Craftsman has been historically in the market through Sears, but I think this is another middle price point brand that seems like kind of a fair exchange offering for other channels. What's the size of that in the market today that will now be housed a little bit more exclusively inside Home Depot? Unknown Speaker : Well, I'll give as much clarity as I can. But obviously this doesn't happen until 2019, so to speculate at all, that would be impossible. But to answer the question kind of thoroughly would be, the acquisition of the Craftsman brand we felt like gave us a great opportunity to convert share that had eluded us and every other tool company for generations. And I think that has proven to be very accurate, which is why we've now increased our number to $1 billion by year four rather than year ten. Concurrent with that, what we hope to do, but hadn't committed to till now I guess, is that with that, the advent of the Craftsman brand in our portfolio, it allowed us and will allow us to unlock other marquee brands in our stable of world-class brands to go exploit opportunities for share gain to customers that don't support Craftsman. So now you have a growth vehicle for Craftsman-based customers to go after share of Craftsman that has existed in Sears for many, many years, and opportunities to use the other brands to go after share within those locations against competition. And the combination of those two things is giving us an opportunity to do that domestically, and then use brands like Irwin/Lenox, et cetera, to do the same thing globally. So it's an outstanding opportunity. I guess, to comment back on the question about The Home Depot, I would say this, we've experienced accelerated growth on the Power Tools side with DEWALT corded products, DEWALT power tool accessories, DEWALT cordless, DEWALT outdoor and DEWALT FlexVolt. This advent of STANLEY and STANLEY FATMAX gives us the opportunity to replicate that type of incremental growth for us and for them, and on the Hand Tools & Storage side of the business. And it obviously represents share gain for them and for us or we wouldn't have taken the time to announce it today. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Hey, Mike. Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : First question, I just wanted to circle back and just try and \u2013 and I apologize if you kind of hit on elements of this in previous questions. But just trying to think about 2019 and the puts and takes there, and if I'm missing anything or there are areas to elaborate on, appreciate it. So you have, on the one hand, the $370 million additional headwind from the three buckets of commodity, currency and tariff. On the flip side, you're looking at the $250 million of cost savings. And I was just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about the other positive drivers across volume growth, or sales growth, pricing and productivity. Because certainly, within this year, you're lowering the growth by 1%, and maybe that's a little bit due to more cannibalization. But I would suspect, particularly on the growth side, that you're still looking at some type of mid-single digit rate. And I was just curious if you could kind of help us frame thoughts around benefits from pricing as well as productivity? Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Well, let me just clarify one thing. We're not providing guidance for 2019, but we are providing some insight and direction as to what we see based on the actions that we're taking, as well as the headwinds that we have. So we wanted people to understand that we believe we have a way to grow our earnings in a meaningful way in 2019. We have headwinds to deal with, as we've talked about of $370 million. We will have price actions and carryover related to that. We'll have new price actions that we will put into the market, related to List 3 in January. Obviously, those will have a mitigating effect to those headwinds of some magnitude. We do expect to have some organic growth obviously in 2019 as well, and our objective is always to be within our 4% to 6% range. And we'll see, as we get closer to January, whether that's still our view. But at this point, there's nothing that says we should change that at this stage. The biggest wild card would be the impact of price and how we have to manage that along the lines that Jim was just describing, which leads us to why we're taking these cost actions, so we have levers to counter the potential impacts of price into the market. And therefore, we can ensure that we get to the end result of having meaningful earnings growth year-over-year. That's really about all we can say at this stage for 2019. And we'll provide more color as we get closer or get to January. But at this stage, that's how we feel, and we feel like we're positioning ourselves and setting ourselves up, so we can create that outcome for 2019. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: And the one thing I would mention as well, is that sometimes overlooked, as people do their analysis and they try to walk from one year to another, but sometimes overlooked is the variable cost productivity that we generate every year. And that will be in the neighborhood of 3% to 4% most years, and we see no reason why it shouldn't be in 2019. That would be additive productivity to the $250 million of cost savings. And so we have $9 billion of variable cost to work with for that 3% to 4%. And if you're trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together and the different scenarios that could occur, you make sure that you think through that as well. . Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning, guys. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Hey, Nigel. Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Hey, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : There aren't too many companies talking about 2019, so really appreciate some of the moving pieces for next year. It's very helpful, so thanks for that. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yep. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : I wanted to go back to Craftsman. So that's obviously a big influence for next year. And I'm curious if you just make \u2013 bring us back to where your capacity is right now, where you see that moving in 2019, and if Sears does go into Chapter 7 liquidation, what can you do to accelerate that production ramp? Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Very good question. We've worked really hard since March of 2017 to bring this 1,200 SKU product portfolio to life. And I'm very pleased at the initial rollout in the first 90 days of the rollout. Shipments are up. POS is up, representing share gain for us and our partners. But the other key component is our service levels on that product right now, almost 100%. And so we've capacitized ourselves. Before we would commit to $1 billion by 2021, we built capacity plans to support it. So we feel very good about our capability of supplying that accelerated demand through our existing 50, 60 manufacturing plant structure. Again, we make almost 90% of what we sell, so we have great control over those things, and we feel very confident we can support the accelerated demand created by Craftsman in whatever form it might be. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open. Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys, good morning. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning. Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I guess just \u2013 sorry to go back to price again, but I guess, in your conversations with the home centers just on tariffs, are they kind of thinking of tariffs as kind of normal inflation where you need to kind of show them the inflation and then you kind of get prices to lag? Or I mean, since these tariffs are kind of clearly out there, are you able to maybe line up price increases more in line with those tariff increases? Just trying to get a little bit more color on just the confidence on pricing in Q1 and then how that might impact the cadence of price costs in the first half of next year?. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yeah, I don't think anybody except the home centers can get in the minds of the home centers. But I will say that the home centers appear, and frankly, all the customers appear to be in a position where they understand that their supply base cannot absorb onetime increases in the cost of this magnitude, 25%. And they understand that. They understand that they're not going to do it. And so in the end, this is all going to go to the consumer whether it's Tools or whether it's consumer products or whatever in other companies, other industries. And that I think is the way this is all going to play out and is playing out. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dennis McGill with Zelman. Your line is open. Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC : Hi, good morning and thank you. Maybe another one for Jeff on the home centers. I guess for the HD exclusive, can you maybe just talk about what brought about that opportunity to have the exclusive conversation? And then when you look at the brands or the products that fall underneath, what will be exclusive, can you size the relative footprint today at Home Depot versus Lowe's? Jeffery D. Ansell - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: I could do the first part of the question. I don't think I can provide the information on the second part of the question just is \u2013 it's confidential information. But I would say this that when we begin to build the architecture around the acquisition of Craftsman, Irwin and Lenox as well, we looked at all those brands and where they participated. And we were proactive in trying to manage the cannibalization that would occur across those brands if you allowed them all to reside in the same place. And we're proactive in going across our retail landscape with partners to use those brands to accelerate growth and share gain in various places. You've seen like four or five really good examples of that to this point with Craftsman and now STANLEY, STANLEY FATMAX. We also love all of our customers. So we wanted to have an opportunity to grow with each and every one of them. Growth at one at the expense of the other is a short-term solution and not ultimately very successful. So this took a lot of additional work. But it has taken us \u2013 it will take us to a place where share gain in the future is incremental to any share gain in the past. So we feel really good about that. In terms of the size, probably the only thing I can say is that we have been on accelerated growth trajectory with the Home Depot over the last decade across our portfolio. This will allow us to do in Hand Tools & Storage what has been really clearly done across Power Tools and Power Tool Accessories. So it will give us a complete growth platform with a really important customer . Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And I do appreciate all the color you've given us today. Maybe just a little bit more insight on the restructuring plan, obviously, the payback at 2X looks pretty good. So maybe can you give us a little bit more color around like the cadence of the benefits coming through for next year? And then also, if we do get level 4 tariffs, like is there \u2013 how would you go about tackling the potential impact from level 4? Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: So, yeah, I'll give you a little bit of color. As far as the restructuring, as we said in our press release, we will complete the vast majority of the actions associated with it by the end of 2018. So, therefore, we would expect a pretty even cadence across the four quarters of 2019. And so I think you can pretty much move that across the quarter. The bulk of the charge, obviously, will take place in the fourth quarter of 2018. The second question was around what? What was it on? Unknown Speaker : The List 4 tariffs. Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: List 4 tariffs. So List 4 tariffs, we'll take the approach that I described when I went through that on the slide. That the first step of actions will be price increases in the marketplace. The second step will be looking at, is there an exclusion process that we can go through with the U.S. government because there is some disadvantage that we have in the marketplace as a result of the tariff. And then the third will be looking at what we can do to our supply chain to change aspects of the supply chain as to where things are manufactured, whether it's bringing things to the U.S., to the \u2013 along our strategy of make where we sell, or is it moving into another country because it makes more sense to do that, both from a market perspective and a financial perspective. So those will be like the three levels of steps that we would go through. Very similar to what we're going through with List 3, and what we've gone through with the previous two Lists related to the tariffs. James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Not all tariffs are horrible at this point. The tariff impact to some categories, like boxes, metal boxes, they have actually been positive for us. But wave 4 would also accelerate our advantage based on our domestic manufacturing footprint. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open. Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC : Hi, good morning. I wanted to talk about just... Unknown Speaker : Good morning. Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC : Thank you. Operationally, on Craftsman, as Sears goes through its process, do you need to spend more in advertising, et cetera, promotions to sort of pull those revenues to you? Make sure they don't get lost in transition. And is there any risk from whatever actions they make take in 4Q to load and do massive sales or whatever to push stuff through their channel? James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Well, you never know how they're going to behave when they're under protection. But I will say that it's been a fantastic execution. And it's been a real partnership with our retail partner, Lowe's. The sales and marketing resources that they have brought to bear to make this program successful, in conjunction with the sales and marketing resources that we've invested, is like nothing that has ever been done in our industry. So I think the answer to your question is that we've done everything that we need to do to pull those sales from Sears into Stanley Black & Decker and Lowe's. And maybe some will drift out into some of our other retail partners, but we've got that well covered too as we talked about. So we're very pleased and very optimistic with the situation, about the situation. Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: And we feel very well prepared for this. We've been preparing for this. All we didn't know was the date of when it would happen. So Jim referenced the connection between us and Lowe's going forward, and it is exemplary and it is out in front. We're likewise aligned in the hardware channel with Ace, we're likewise aligned with Amazon in the e-commerce space. So we are prepared in whatever fashion that Craftsman customer wants to find the product to make sure that we are front and center and ready to convert. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have further questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thanks for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Conference Call. On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, Executive Vice President and President of Global Tools & Storage. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will be available beginning at 11 a.m. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim, Don and Jeff will review our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller, and as we normally do, we'll be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and our most recent '34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree. James Loree : Okay. Thanks, Dennis, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As you saw in today's release, we delivered a respectable fourth quarter, continuing our trajectory of above-market organic growth and delivering strong EPS growth and solid free cash flow dollars and conversion. As many of you know, in 2018, we faced an unusual and sudden onslaught of large and volatile external headwinds, most of which developed during the course of the year, specifically pressure from input cost inflation, FX and tariffs had, by fourth quarter, grown from our initial January guidance of $150 million pretax to $370 million, which at the EPS level, would have been about 25% dilutive to prior year EPS had we not managed to offset all but $50 million of that with additional price/cost management and other actions. The fact that we ended up delivering 9% adjusted EPS growth in 2018 on 8% revenue growth, which included 5% organic, is quite remarkable. It speaks volumes as to how agile experience - agile our experienced management team deals with short-term adversity and operating environment challenges while continuing to pursue above-market growth and moving the company forward strategically. More on that in a few minutes, but first, a few words about the fourth quarter. Revenues were up 5% to $3.6 billion with organic growth of 6%. Tools & Storage delivered 7% organic with strength in all major geographies and business units. The Tools growth was driven by the continued rollout of the Craftsman brand, price realization and leveraging our portfolio of growth catalysts. Industrial delivered 14% total revenue growth inclusive of the Nelson Fastener acquisition, and organic was up 4% for Industrial. The Oil & Gas business exceeded our plan this quarter and delivered a robust 27% organic growth derived from increased pipeline project activity in North America. Our total company adjusted operating margin rate was 13.3% as volume leverage, price and cost actions were more than offset by the impact of currency, commodity, inflation and tariffs. Security was a bright spot this quarter, delivering both operating margin dollar and rate improvement versus a year ago. The Security team is energized and focused, and we are looking forward to realizing a significant and growing benefit from that business' transformation as 2019 unfolds. EPS for the quarter was $2.11, in line with expectations. And now I'll turn to full year highlights. Full year revenues were $14.0 billion, up 8%, including 5% organic growth and 3 points from acquisitions. Excluding charges, diluted EPS for the year was $8.15, a 9% increase versus 2017, and our operating margin rate remained solid at 13.6% despite absorbing the $370 million of headwinds previously mentioned. Turning to capital allocation. We continued our balanced approach once again in 2018. During the year, we repurchased $500 million of our shares and increased the dividend once again, the 51st consecutive year of increases. From an M&A point of view, we closed on Nelson Fasteners, which further diversifies the Engineered Fastening business into industrial markets. We also announced the IES Attachments acquisition and our entry into large outdoor power equipment with MTD as our equity partner. We're excited to see these opportunities progress and fuel future growth in the coming years. In summary, 2018 was a successful year, one in which we cut through challenges to deliver solid results. This performance is attributable to the agility, passion and dedication of our workforce, and I want to take this opportunity to thank every employee for their commitment and their resolve because it is our people to whom we attribute this great culture and the passion to perform well in any environment. They live our purpose every day with incredible energy and commitment. As we enter 2019, the external challenges don't magically disappear. However, we are well-prepared and positioned to tackle them. In addition, there are signs that the global economic growth is slowing and that the U.S. economy may soon be coming to the end of one of the most enduring recoveries in U.S. history. We are leaning into these challenges and will leverage our SFS 2.0 operating system while deploying an impressive array of growth and margin improvement initiatives to once again be successful in 2019. The investments we've made to support organic growth and our recent acquisitions have created the strongest pipeline of revenue-generating catalysts we've ever had during my almost 20 years as a C-level Executive in this company. These opportunities will provide a foundation for continued share gain and can act as a buffer to the revenue impact that could result from potentially slower markets. We will see benefits in 2019 from the rollout of the Craftsman brand, the largest product program in our history, as well as the repositioning of the Stanley and the Stanley FatMax brands in the North American home center channel. With these programs, we are unlocking new opportunities for share gain by aligning our brands across core user groups within the Tradesman and Professional segments while leveraging our brands fully with our retail partners. The response we have seen from our customers and end users with the Craftsman rollout encourages us regarding the potential for 2019 and beyond. Our core and breakthrough innovation initiatives are stronger than ever, and our innovation focus permeates the entire company. We expect to see future revenue benefits not only from FLEXVOLT, which is a well-traveled story, but also from new innovations coming to market in Tools, Fastening and other Industrial businesses as well as Security. In terms of the Lenox/Irwin acquisitions, we're attacking the revenue synergy opportunities which will represent $100 million to $150 million of organic growth over a multiyear period as we broaden the distribution of these products around the world. In the emerging markets, we continue to deliver outsized growth and share gain, and we are leveraging our unique business model, the strength of our brands, including Stanley-branded midpoint - mid-price-point corded and cordless power tools as well as hand tool products. And we're having immense success growing at 2 to 3x the market rate. And across both developed and emerging markets, e-commerce remains a key revenue growth driver for us. This year, it represents a $1 billion high-growth business, a channel in which we are the industry leader across the globe by a wide margin. And turning to our recent acquisitions, in addition to the organic growth opportunities I mentioned with Craftsman and Lenox/Irwin, we expect to generate inorganic growth from the IES acquisition in 2019, for which we are awaiting government approvals. Additionally, as I said earlier, our MTD partnership is just getting started, and we are excited about the future benefits from this relationship. As part of the deal, we have secured an option to purchase the remaining 80% in 2021 and beyond for an amount which should approximate 7 to 8x EBITDA. This provides clear visibility to almost $3 billion of instant growth in the early 2020s at what will truly be a great acquisition price based on the joint value-creation efforts underway between the companies. So with all these incredibly robust growth catalysts, we are in an excellent position for a successful march to $22 billion of revenue by 2022. In fact, we are so well positioned that we are now shifting our near-term emphasis from identifying and acquiring new growth catalysts to : First, continuing to execute the ones that we already have; and then second, focusing on margin rate accretion. For starters, we will leverage our $250 million cost-reduction program, which is substantially complete, as well as pricing and productivity benefits in 2019. Beyond that, we are now in the process of developing and executing an array of margin expansion initiatives, many of which are aided by applying modern technology such as elements of Industry 4.0 and advanced analytics. More to come at our investor meeting in May, but rest assured, this will be a powerful and substantial initiative that will generate future margin accretion and buffer our earnings and cash flow from the vagaries of economic cycles and the external operating environment. In addition, we have redirected our capital allocation in the short term to a deleveraging posture, keeping the balance sheet in a prudent place as is appropriate for this stage of the cycle. This will give us maximum flexibility in the future for opportunistic repurchases and for acquisitions as our long-term capital allocation strategy of 50% back to the shareholders and 50% reinvested in growth remains intact. So in summary, there's a lot to be excited about with this powerful growth story. And now adding the additional focus on margin expansion will ensure that the benefit of all this revenue growth makes its way into even higher growth rates for operating margin and EPS. And now I'll turn it over to Don Allan, who'll walk you through more detail in the segment performance, overall financial results and 2019 guidance. Don? Donald Allan : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the fourth quarter. Tools & Storage delivered 4% total revenue growth, with 7% organic growth and a 3-point headwind from currency. Organic growth included 5 points of volume and 2 points from price. We continue to see sequential improvement in our price realization, which represented a full quarter benefit from the price actions we executed during the third quarter. The operating margin rate for the segment was 15.4%, down from the prior year as benefits of volume leverage, pricing and cost control were more than offset by the impacts of currency, commodity inflation and tariffs. The impact of these headwinds amounted to $135 million for Stanley Black & Decker. Approximately 90% of this figure impacted Tools & Storage in the fourth quarter. The strong organic growth and related share gains were experienced across each Tools & Storage region and SBU. First, on a geographic basis, North America was up 10% organically with strong performances across all channels. U.S. retail and U.S. commercial markets both posted low double-digit growth, and our industrial and auto repair markets generated mid-single-digit growth. North America's growth continued to be fueled by new product innovations, including FLEXVOLT, the Craftsman brand rollout and price realization. The Craftsman rollout is continuing to be well-received by end-users and our customers. For the year, it drove close to 2 points of revenue for Tools & Storage, net cannibalization. We are excited and encouraged by the success we are seeing as we continue the rollout in 2019. More on that from Jeff a little bit later. Europe delivered 4% organic growth in the quarter. 9 out of 10 markets grew organically, an impressive performance as we did see some weaker market conditions in Europe. The team once again leveraged our strong portfolio of brands and expanded our retail relationships to produce above-market organic growth. Finally, emerging markets delivered 3% organic growth. Diligent price actions to offset currency headwinds, Lenox/Irwin revenue synergies as well as a continued focus on e-commerce and the ongoing MPP launch continued to support growth in this part of the Tools & Storage business. These actions were partially offset by severe market contractions that we saw in Argentina and Turkey. These two markets reduced growth by approximately 360 basis points, and that is not unexpected, given the recent foreign exchange volatility we've seen in those two countries. However, Latin America continued to be strong with double-digit growth. Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Chile and Mexico had high single-digit or double-digit organic performances. Additionally, in Russia, India, Korea and Taiwan, they all posted high single or double-digit organic growth as well. Now taking a look at the Tools & Storage SBUs. All lines showed high single-digit growth in the quarter. Power Tools & Equipment delivered 7% organic growth and benefited from new product introductions and strong commercial execution. FLEXVOLT delivered a robust mid-teen growth for the year while delivering improved profitability, which is now in line with the overall segment average. Hand Tools, Accessories & Storage delivered 8% organic growth as new product introductions, the continued Craftsman rollout and then solid performances within the construction and industrial-focused product lines, and of course, the contribution from Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies, all these items contributing to their growth. In summary, an excellent quarter and a very successful year for the Tools & Storage organization with growth in every region. Operating margin for the quarter was strong at 15.4% as the benefits from volume leverage, pricing and cost control were more than offset by what we saw around the headwinds in currency, commodity and tariffs. This team continues to be resilient and is acting with agility to return this business back to margin expansion in 2019. Turning to Industrial. This segment delivered 14% total revenue growth, which included 12 points of growth from the Nelson Fastener acquisition and a negative 2 points from currency. Organic growth was 4%, and operating margin rate declined year-over-year to 13.2% as productivity gains and cost control were more than offset by commodity inflation, the dilutive impact from the acquisition of Nelson Fasteners and then an unfavorable revenue mix within the fourth quarter. Engineered Fastening posted total growth of 14%, which included the contribution from Nelson Fasteners. Organic growth for Engineered Fastening was 1% due to higher system shipments and fastener penetration gains in the automotive business, which were partially offset by a decline in global light vehicle production. The latest global light vehicle production for full year 2018 shows a modest retraction versus the prior year. As demonstrated this year, our Fastener business can still grow in this environment as we increase the fastener content within our customers. For the year, our auto fastener growth was 6%, over 600 basis points ahead of global production. The Infrastructure businesses delivered robust growth, up 18% organically. This was primarily due to stronger North American Oil & Gas pipeline projects, which contributed an impressive 27% organic growth in the quarter. We also had modest growth within our Hydraulic Tool business. Finally, the Security segment declined 1% with bolt-on acquisitions contributing 3 points of growth, which was offset by an organic decline of 2% and unfavorable currency of 2%. North America declined 2% organically as higher volumes in automatic doors and health care were more than offset by lower installation revenues in commercial electronic security. Europe was down 2% organically as growth in Sweden was offset by weakness in the U.K. and France. In terms of profitability, the segment operating margin expanded to 12%, improving 100 basis points versus the prior year. The Security team continues to make progress on the transformation plan, namely, optimizing our cost to serve while positioning the business to provide new and differentiated offerings to our large key account customers and to our small- to medium-sized accounts. This quarter and the second half demonstrated an important first step toward stabilizing the margin performance of this business by delivering operating margin dollars and rate improvement versus 2017. We expect these transformation initiatives to gain further traction in 2019 as we continue to position the business for meaningful margin dollar and rate expansion and more consistent organic revenue growth. In summary, it was another promising quarter for Security, with the team delivering year-over-year margin expansion for the first time since late 2016. Let's take a look at our free cash flow performance on the next page. I would like to highlight that we are presenting the 2017 cash flow amounts as previously reported and exclude the impacts of the new accounting standards that were adopted in January of 2018. We believe that presenting the cash flow results in this manner provides a more meaningful comparison of the company's operating cash flow performance. Similar to past years, we were able to drive significant working capital improvements during the quarter. Our full year free cash flow performance was solid as we generated $769 million in 2018. Cash from operations declined $158 million versus 2017, which was driven by higher tax payments due to the addition of the toll charge that was included within U.S. tax reform, and we also had higher M&A-related payments. We saw our capital expenditures increase by $49 million in 2018 as we made investments to expand our manufacturing and distribution capacity, made technology investments to support functional transformation and Industry 4.0 and invested to support our acquisition integrations. This performance resulted in free cash flow as a percentage of net income of approximately 119%. Excluding the noncash net charges associated with U.S. tax reform, free cash flow conversion was approximately 90%, in line with expected - expectations communicated in our October earnings call. From a working capital turn perspective, we delivered 8.8 turns in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 0.3 turns versus the prior year. This decline is primarily due to carrying higher levels of inventory to support the Craftsman rollout and, to a lesser extent, the dilutive impact from the acquisition of Nelson. Working capital management remains a key pillar of the SFS 2.0 operating system. We continue to drive working capital improvements across the company, with heavy focus on improving the performance of our recent acquisitions and eventually moderating the inventory levels from our tools, brands, transitions that are happening right now when we feel that's appropriate. We are confident in our ability to bring our working capital turns back above 10 in the coming years. Now let's move deeper into our 2019 guidance. We are targeting approximately 4% organic growth in 2019 with an adjusted earnings per share range of $8.45 to $8.65, up approximately 5% versus prior year at the midpoint. The free cash flow conversion will be approximately 85% to 90%. The free cash flow conversion is slightly below our historical performance and long-term targets due primarily to two factors : One, we are expecting that much of the cash payments associated with our Q4 2018 cost-reduction program will occur in 2019; the second factor is the ongoing cash payment associated with the total charge that we'll see for the next seven years. Over the long term, we are still confident that a conversion rate of approximately 100% is still achievable as we use our Core SFS principles to drive working capital out of the system. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share to range from $7.45 to $7.65, which is inclusive of various onetime charges related to M&A as well as some onetime cost related to our margin enhancement initiative that Jim just discussed, also including the ongoing Security transformation. Turning to the drivers of core EPS growth. You can see on the left-hand side of the chart we expect the benefits from organic volume to generate $0.30 to $0.40 of EPS accretion. The cost-reduction program we executed at the end of 2018 is expected to deliver $1.05 of EPS, which is a net of a modest set of investments to support value-driving activities such as Industry 4.0, advanced analytics and our Security transformation. These items will be partially offset by $0.90 to $1 of incremental tariff, commodity inflation and currency headwinds, net of both carryover price benefits and new pricing actions implemented earlier this year in response to tariffs. We expect a tax rate of approximately 17.5%, which represents a $0.15 EPS headwind year-over-year. And then lastly, the benefits from the MTD partnership and the lower share count, partially offset by higher interest expense, should deliver a positive $0.10 in EPS. I would highlight that we have included Section 301 List 3 at a 10% assumption for the full year. If this does increase to 25%, it could represent a gross headwind of approximately $100 million before pricing and other mitigation efforts. As you read in the release and heard from Jim, we are preparing to take additional cost and margin-driving activities to insulate ourselves from this and other risks. Also, as you know, we always build a level of contingency to ensure that we can deliver our guidance and absorb a certain level of unknown market or external headwinds, and we will continue to do that in 2019. I would now like to review one other miscellaneous guidance matter. We expect the first quarter earnings to be approximately 13% of the full year performance. This is about 400 basis points lower than last year. The primary factor driving this lower percentage of full year delivery is that we continue to expect elevated levels of external headwinds, particularly in Tools, which from a profile perspective, are more heavily weighted towards the front half of the year. This will cause the first quarter to show operating margin rate and dollar retraction as we have a headwind of approximately $125 million to $135 million, net of pricing benefits, which is nearly 3/4 of the expected $170 million full year net headwind. Now turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page. Organic growth within Tools & Storage is expected to be at mid-single digits in 2019. There are multiple catalysts supporting growth, including: Core innovation; continued benefits from FLEXVOLT; the Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies; emerging market opportunities; and the continued brand transitions with Craftsman, Stanley and Stanley FatMax. Margin rates are expected to be positive year-over-year. We are expecting the external environment to continue to be challenging in 2019, presenting another year of large external headwinds, as I just mentioned. However, we will continue to leverage multiple margin levers, including price realization, cost actions, margin-enhancing initiatives and volume to offset these headwinds and position the business for a return to margin expansion in 2019, with stronger performance expected for the second half. In the Industrial segment, we expect a relatively flat organic performance, reflecting softening conditions within the automotive end market. We're expecting Engineered Fastening to be relatively flat organically with continued growth within automotive fasteners. Our systems outlook reflects a softer year as we have been seeing a more constrained CapEx spending environment with our auto customers. In Oil & Gas, we are planning for low- to mid-single-digit growth, driven by stronger North American pipeline project activity. And then Hydraulic Tools growth will be relatively flat due to slower market conditions in that space. We expect operating margins to be flat year-over-year with productivity and cost actions offset by commodity inflation and tariffs in our Industrial segment. Finally, in the Security segment, we're expecting the organic growth to be up low single digits in 2019 as the team continues to execute its transformation strategy. This should translate into improved operating margins year-over-year as we continue to stabilize margins and deliver on our initiatives to lower our cost to serve. So in summary, 4% organic growth, 4% to 6% adjusted EPS expansion despite a 2-point tax headwind, a solid result and a balanced view that acknowledges the current market condition and today's view of the external headwinds, which are front-half loaded. We believe we are taking the appropriate actions to position the company for success in 2019 despite a very dynamic operating environment. We remain focused on our organic growth catalysts, margin expansion initiatives, strong free cash flow generation and successful acquisition integrations. With that, I will like to turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Ansell : Thank you, Don. I would like to provide a few more points on the Tools & Storage performance for the year, including updates on our strategic brand partnerships for Craftsman and Stanley. We closed 2018 with high single-digit organic growth enabled by record-setting new product launches, best-in-class commercial partnerships and integration excellence. As evidence, Irwin, Lenox and Waterloo have delivered double-digit organic growth since becoming part of Stanley Black & Decker. Adding to the strong acquisitive performance is Craftsman, which is exceeding both our and our customers' expectations. We're on track to $1 billion in revenue growth by 2021, 7 years ahead of schedule. This progress is being driven by strong user acceptance. As such, we have achieved a 4.6-star rating across well over 1,000 products and outstanding in-store execution by both Lowes and Ace. We also announced last quarter that the Home Depot will now be the exclusive home improvement retailer for Stanley and Stanley FatMax Hand Tools & Storage product portfolios, both in-store and online, beginning this year. The product will begin to ship in the front half of 2019. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim to wrap up today's presentation. James Loree : Thank you, Jeff. In summary, 2018 was a year of solid performance despite the volatile external environment. As we said, we delivered 8% total revenue growth, including 5% organic; net OM rate remained robust at 13.6%; and adjusted EPS grew by 9%. Our teams acted with speed and agility while facing into and overcoming an unprecedented impact from currency, commodity and tariff headwinds. And while these headwinds will gradually abate as 2019 unfolds, they will be with us for a while, and the economic growth backdrop also looks to be slowing as well. So with that as context, we are pleased that our 2019 outlook calls for 4% organic growth with a 4% to 6% EPS expansion, and we feel good about that. We remain focused on delivering above-market organic growth with operating leverage, reenergizing our focus on margin expansion, continuing to successfully execute our recent acquisitions and generating strong free cash flow. And as always, our seasoned leadership team will act with agility and leverage SFS 2.0 and all available avenues to maximize our value creation for shareholders. In other news today, we are announcing that Stanley Black & Decker was named to the Carbon Disclosure A List for both climate change and water. This great recognition is an honor, and it underscores our commitment to continue to conduct ourselves in a socially responsible manner. I would like to thank my senior management team and all of our Stanley Black & Decker associates around the world as well as all our stakeholders, including the investment community, for your support. We are looking forward to another successful year in 2019 and continuing our pursuit of strong financial performance, pervasive innovation and social responsibility. Thank you. And with that, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis? Dennis Lange : Great. Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Richard Kwas : Jim, Don. First, on Jim, so focus on deleveraging here, kind of base level for capital deployment, doesn't seem like this is going to be a year of meaningful M&A. What would you characterize, given where we are in the cycle, of the puts and takes, consideration, in terms of additional M&A? And then, Don, real quick on the free cash flow conversion and the over - underlying conservatism in the guidance. If you could make some comments on conservatism. And then second, on FCF, is there any working capital headwind with regard to the transition of the Stanley brand to Home Depot? James Loree : Okay. It's Jim, I'll start. At this point in the cycle, our plan is to kind of go in strong, stay strong and emerge stronger. And that's exactly what we did in '08, '09. If you recall, those that followed us for a long time. When we went into this, the cycle, we actually had our balance sheet in great shape and we continued to maintain as much operating margin and cash flows we could squeeze out of the company even though the revenues were down a little bit. And in '09, at the tail end of all that chaos, we actually negotiated the Black & Decker transaction and transformed the company subsequently. Now I'm not suggesting that we have any plans to do that, such a transaction, again. But what I will say is that it's really amazing when you come out of the end of the cycle and look at all the opportunities that are out there, large and small, that derived from others who had not maintained themselves in the same manner during that downward part of the cycle. So with that, debt-to-EBITDA right now is about 2.6x, and we are deleveraging this year. We may do 1 or 2 very small emerging market transactions, but that would be about it. And I'd say by the end of '19, we're going to be in really great shape from a balance sheet perspective. We are already, but even better shape, and then we'll see where we go from there. Donald Allan : So to your second question, Rich, on free cash flow conversion for 2019 guidance. I mentioned the two items that are resulting us being in 85% to 90%, with one being the total charge and then the other being M&A or restructuring-related payments associated with the fourth quarter charge that we took of about $100 million. So most of that cash outflow will happen in 2019. On the working capital front, we don't actually see a dramatic improvement in working capital turns in 2019 because we do have to continue to work through these brand transitions that we've discussed throughout the last year related to Craftsman, but now also related to what's happening with Stanley and Stanley FatMax in the Home Depot. And we have to make sure that we have the right level of inventory to meet the needs of our customers. And we're not going to get overly aggressive in our supply chain until we work through those transitions. So we're not counting on a dramatic improvement in working capital turns in 2019. But as I mentioned, once we work through that, we can regulate and moderate to the levels that are more historical for us and begin to work our way back to 10 turns over the next few years. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Timothy Wojs : I have a quick two-parter. I guess, first, could you just talk about within the Tools growth guidance, what is embedded in there in terms of accretion from Craftsman and the Stanley Hand Tool changes? And then secondly, I was just - the cadence of Q1 margins being lower, is the implication that Tools' margins be positive through the remainder of 2019? Just want to clarify that. Donald Allan : Yes. So if you think about Tools & Storage organic growth, we said mid-single digits. So you interpret what that, but it can range anywhere from 4% to 6%. So it's probably leaning towards, closer to the high end of that range. Within there, we see Craftsman performance net of cannibalization. So when we talk Craftsman net of cannibalization, we're including the impacts of what's happening with Stanley and Stanley FatMax and Porter Cable coming out of Lowe's. We believe that impacts probably 2 to 3 points in 2019. And so that kind of gives you a gauge of where we think it is. So it's relatively close to what we experienced in 2018, maybe a little bit better. The second question was related to - what was the second question, Dennis? Dennis Lange : First quarter margins. Donald Allan : First quarter margins. So yes, what it does imply, as we look at the second, third and fourth quarter, we would expect to start to see, in the Tools business, margin rate and dollar expansion year-over-year. So the first - as I mentioned, a significant amount of that net headwind of $170 million, $125 million to $135 million is happening in the first quarter. So that's a dramatic impact to the first quarter, which makes sense, given the timing of the headwinds last year. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Jim, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on what the kind of other margin enhancement actions you are taking. I assume those are above and beyond the Q4 restructuring. And then also, just maybe as a follow-on to that last question. It would seem you would still expect actual adjusted EPS to probably be down on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter. Is that correct? James Loree : You take the second part. Donald Allan : Okay, yes. Yes it's not true, Jeff. We actually expect adjusted EPS to grow because we do have a low tax rate again in the second quarter, and we had one last year, so that's - it's a bit of a headwind, but it's not a significant headwind. And we do expect OM dollars to grow year-over-year. James Loree : Okay. And on the margin enhancements, I'll give you a little appetizer. I think the main course, we'll serve up at the Analyst Meeting. But essentially, we've - as soon as we completed the work in the fourth quarter on the cost takeout, the near-term cost takeout, we said to ourselves, \"Our margins are under attack from these headwinds. We need to get back what we've lost already, so that $250 million will help. But what if we get more of the same? What if we, the down - what if we go into a downturn in back half of '19 or in '20?\" And so we said, \"We really need to basically create some protection for, call them black swans or economic cyclical aspects.\" And also, our objective here is to grow our operating margins by 50 basis points a year. Obviously, that didn't happen in 2018, and we're committed to do that. So we need a way to get there. And we thought about this, and we said, \"22/22, we're two years in. We've done enough deals now, and they're - every one of them is a deal that we'd do over again if we could. We love these deals. We've done enough so that we can actually see our way pretty much to 22/22 from a revenue point of view. Now let's figure out how we can make sure that we get the margin to go with it to create operating leverage so that we really get that double benefit of lots of revenue growth and margin expansion at the same time.\" And so we've been working a lot on different elements of digital technology and how that can be used to create value in our company, both from a value proposition point of view, in our products, in our business models, but also in our functional processes and so on. And it really occurred to us that if we could accelerate many of these things that we're working on and put some serious, accelerated focus on them, that - we started adding up the benefits from these various initiatives, like Industry 4.0, advanced analytics, Procurement 2.0 and indirect cost management, the technologies that exist today, to use analytics to really do those in a - manage those various topics in a much more efficient manner is really compelling. And so we've been experimenting with some of that, and we feel confident now that we have something that can generate hundreds of millions of dollars of benefit over a 2 to 3 year period. And we'll figure out what the exact amount is, and we'll share that with you in May. But it's a very large number and it's a very focused initiative. We're going to run it like an acquisition integration, with governance. And like I said earlier, we're going to focus on executing the growth initiatives that we already have and we're going to focus on margin expansion. And I think the combination of those two things is going to be incredibly powerful. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just a quick update on what the sort of delta is in your earnings guidance versus previously the commentary around high single-digit growth. Is it simply about a point or so less volume growth assumption? Or has anything changed in terms of your confidence around pricing initiatives, particularly in Tools? Donald Allan : Yes, I would say that there's certainly a point difference in growth, as you mentioned, versus just looking at the markets as they play out in the fourth quarter, and the view of U.S. housing and the automotive space for production just feels like there's still growth there, but it's slowing. So that's certainly one factor. We do have a little bit bigger tax headwind as well because we did come in lower for 2018. So that's a little bit of a headwind in addition. And then the third thing is we need to continue to monitor the impact of all the price in the markets. And like we said in October, we're putting a fair amount of price actions into the market. We're going to manage this both looking at what's the right thing to do for price and what's the right action to ensure we have the right level of volume. And we're going to manage those in concert with each other to achieve the right outcomes. So as we continue to do that, there will be a little bit of pressure probably in the margin rate versus previous expectations, and we saw that play out in the fourth quarter. But those are really the three main factors. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Michael Rehaut : Just a little bit more detail, if possible, around some of the moving pieces of '19 guidance. And obviously, appreciate all the help so far. First, on the margin - I'm sorry, quarterly cadence, with the biggest hit of the commodity inflation being in the first quarter, are we to understand that the reason you have the confidence that you'll switch to operating margin positive in the remaining quarters is because of the cost actions that have already been put in place? Or is there some amount of price realization as well that you're still expecting? And secondly, also on the deleveraging, how are we to think of share buyback for '19 when you talk about the benefit that you expect from lower shares? Is that just the flow-through from what you've done in '18? Or is there anything incremental in '19? Donald Allan : Yes. So the cadence of the quarter is - clearly, the biggest impact in the second quarter is going to be the headwinds going down dramatically year-over-year as we begin to annualize those headwinds in the second quarter. If you remember, in 2018, we certainly vividly remember the timing of all this. But as we went into March and April, we began to see commodity prices increase. We got into May and we saw FX shift dramatically. And in then June, we saw tariffs come onto the scene. So in the second quarter, we saw significant ramp-up of the headwinds, and that continued into the third quarter. So as we get to the end of the second quarter and into July, we will have comped a lot of those headwinds. And so you look at that aspect and then you look at the impact of the cost reductions, which the impact is relatively even across the four quarters, and so it's about $60 million per year - per quarter, I'm sorry. And therefore, you got that impact, combined with a lower level of headwinds year-over-year because of that comp issue is really why we believe we can grow our operating margin in the second quarter. James Loree : And also the fact that the pricing actions are kind of accumulating over time and getting bigger every quarter sequentially. And so that has a benefit, too, especially as we get into second quarter of 2019. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Just want to just unpackage your outlook for 4% to 6%, so let's call it 5% Tools & Storage growth in '19. Roughly, how does that shake out between North America, Europe, rest of the world? And what would your estimate be for market growth in North America in '19? Jeffery Ansell : I think the actual range Don provided was probably 4% to 6%, said it was probably going to be a little bit on the - more towards the high side of that. So I think that's what we're looking at for the - over the course of '19. And I think you'll see that we're absolutely committed to growth in all markets. So you look at growth, we'll have growth in North America, we'll have growth in Europe, we'll have growth in the global emerging markets consistent with what we had this year. Of those 3, probably, the leading growth contender will be North America as it was in '18. But we're getting growth in both of those other places as well. And we think with that estimate, we'll grow above the market, therefore, representing market share gain again in 2019, consistent with what we had in '18. James Loree : Yes. And I think we all know that the European economy had slowed quite a bit. Germany went negative, the U.K. is in chaos and confusion with Brexit, Italy is a disaster. And despite all that, our European outlook for Tools is going to decent, it'll be probably 2% to 4% kind of growth. So it's still continuing to forge ahead in Europe. And then emerging markets, we have some specific markets that are challenged right now, as almost - as we almost always do. I think in this case, Turkey is tough, Argentina is really difficult. And we had major currency devaluations in those markets, but also just the economies themselves are really difficult. So we might see a little bit slower growth in emerging markets this year than we did last year. But still, we're going to be significantly positive, and we'll be running at least 3x higher than the overall market growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Susan Maklari with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Susan Maklari : I just wanted to get a little bit more color on what you're thinking in terms of some of the commodity inputs. We've seen some of those pull back in the later parts of 2018. What's embedded in the forecast from that perspective for 2019? Donald Allan : Yes. So I talked about net headwinds of $170 million. If you break that down a little bit, the gross headwind is about $320 million and you have an offsetting price impact of $150 million. Of that $320 million, approximately 1/2 of that is commodity inflation, so it's a significant number. We have seen positive trends around certain commodities, for sure. But we do have to remember that a lot of the commodities that we get are really engineering-grade commodities, and we haven't seen as much of a movement in those commodities versus some other more straightforward commodities, in steel in particular. So we've seen a little bit of benefit since December. And as we continue to look at this, it may continue to trend in the right direction, and it could result in an opportunity for us as the year goes on. But at this stage, we actually have not seen a dramatic movement in the commodities that we buy because we tend to buy at the higher end of the grades. And as a result, that hasn't moved as much as some of the other commodities. But the trends are positive, which we feel good about right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Just a question on the bridge. I know that there's kind of a lot of moving parts here, and maybe with the outstanding numbers from 3Q, could use a little bit of an update. I guess the real delta here would seem that a normal organic growth, if the right number is kind of a 20% incremental margin, you guys seem to be closer to 10%. And there looks like there's been, at least on the surface, some slippage in that $250 million of cost reduction, and a lot of that soaks up the relief that you've gotten on tariffs or baking in List 3 at 10%. Is that kind of the rough math of it? Because, I guess, both of those numbers, both the headwind and the tailwind, seemed a little bit lower than what I would have thought on the surface just to start out. Donald Allan : Yes, I think on the leverage front, you probably have to really look at it on a volume basis versus total organic. So if you look at volume, you can use an assumption like 20%, 25%. That kind of gets you to the numbers that we're talking about. And then there's a separate price benefit that's netted in the headwinds that we've laid out for guidance and for actual results. Because we really dissected that because pricing can kind of mute the leverage numbers or change the leverage numbers quite a bit. And as a result, you're better off looking at them in those separate categories. Operator : Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : So I guess just a couple. One is kind of a box-ticking item. On the margin enhancement initiatives, could that possibly give upside to second half with respect to payback? Or is that more of a 2020 payback? And then if you could just talk about the impact of what's going on at Sears on your Craftsman rollout expectations. James Loree : Okay. Well, it's Jim. I'll have Jeff handle the second question. And on the margin enhancement initiative, the benefit that we're going to see from that is going to be recognized over a 2 to 3 year period. We're going to do everything we can. We're going to work really hard to try to bring some benefit into 2019 as an insurance policy. And it's not clear that it's going to be a huge number. But I think it's - there's probably something there, and we'll go after it. Jeffery Ansell : Regarding the question relative to Sears. I think it's really, based on everything that has just occurred in the last two weeks, you'd say it's very much business as usual. If you look at the trend over the last, at least 36 months, that company would typically announce a closure plan following holiday sales, and that would be updated over the course of the year to include more and more stores. This year, it's not much different. So the fact that those stores will remain in operation at a lower count than the prior year, et cetera, is very consistent with what's happened in the prior years. So we expect that our Craftsman rollout will continue to take share as that presence atrophies in the marketplace. So not that different than any other prior year. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet. Michael Wood : If we take into account Craftsman accretion to growth and what - where we think you're running at for price, it seems like there's not much organic growth outside of Craftsman in Tools & Storage volumes. You seem to be tracking well above that currently, so I'm curious what is explaining the deceleration in that lack - in the business ex Craftsman. And does that concern you? James Loree : Well, I think that we try to make it very clear that the economic backdrop is one of slowing growth, it's nothing to do with our market share. Our market share continues to outperform the market. And I think the reality is setting in, hopefully not just us, but most industrial companies are facing slower economic growth in the United States, in China, in pretty much most parts of Europe and the emerging markets. I mean, essentially the whole world except for a few bright spots like India, for example. But the reality is that economic growth that we see for 2019, and - is pretty - is probably a good point lower than it has been in the recent couple of years. And then on top of that, it's no secret that the construction markets in the United States have slowed as well. So baked into our guidance is a reality check on the slowing markets. It's not catastrophic. It's nothing that we can't handle. But our long-term growth objectives are 4% to 6%. We're putting 4% out there at a time when economic growth is slowing. Makes perfect sense to me. Donald Allan : Yes. And at the end of the day, we think that's the right thing to do for all the reasons that Jim articulated. But any chance we're wrong, the markets are a little better, then we'll all be happy. But this is the right approach, given the signals that we've seen in housing, the signals that we've seen in the automotive production space. They're all showing growth for the most part except for auto production. Looks like it's going to be down next year. But they're slowing, and we have to be realistic about what the trends are right now. Jeffery Ansell : Maybe one last addition would be if you look at 2018, our growth was 6% to 7% in Tools in a market that grew slower than that. That market, we think, is going to be compressed by about a point this coming year, and our growth looks pretty similar to that, 5% to 6%. So our growth rates will still be accretive to market growth although the market's growing just a little bit slower. That's kind of it. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Just maybe following up on that a little bit, Jim, and the slowing that you saw - that you're expecting to see in the U.S. I mean, Tools & Storage still put up 10% organic in North America. And so can you talk about whether you started to see slowing in 4Q as the quarter progressed? And then I guess my second question for Don, in talking through that $250 million cost benefit number, did you recognize any of that in 2018? And what's the cadence of that number as we progress through 2019? James Loree : Okay. I'll take the first part. The slowing in the tools market, I think, started in the third quarter, concurrent with the interest rates increases that were being implemented by the Fed. And we saw the same thing in automotive as well, the interest rate sensitive type markets, housing, automotive, impacted by rising interest rates. And it continued in the fourth quarter. We were thinking, well, maybe it's an anomaly in the third quarter. Sometimes, you get those for a couple of months or a couple - yes, a couple of months. And it really did continue into the fourth quarter, pretty steady in the sense that it didn't get worse, it's just kind of felt a little bit more anemic in the third quarter and fourth quarter than it did in the beginning - of the first half of the year. Donald Allan : And on the cost takeout side, we did get a modest benefit in the fourth quarter just because some of them were implemented through the November time frame, but it wasn't significant. And the cadence is really, as I mentioned earlier, pretty equal across the year. So it's roughly $60 million to $65 million per quarter. Jeffery Ansell : Maybe one other addition to what Jim just highlighted is that we said for '18, that North America outpaced Europe and global emerging markets. That is also true for '19. And in that, retail - North American retail and North American commercial, therefore, will be accretive to the overall rates we just described. So it's very consistent with 2018. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Justin Speer : I had a couple of questions, first being on channel inventories across your core end markets and your customers. Was there any pull-ahead risk, particularly in slowing traffic and some of these customers that we're seeing? Any potential pull-forward risk into the quarter from tariff-related price increases in your core Tools businesses? Donald Allan : Yes. I wouldn't say - we don't really know if anybody pulled anything ahead for tariff reasons. So our customers don't necessarily tell us that they're doing those types of things. I would say that the inventory levels did modestly increase as we exited the year versus the previous year end, but frankly, they're not significant. It's not something that we view as a major concern as we go into the first quarter and the year. Jeffery Ansell : Maybe additionally, the POS, as we exited the holiday season continued to be quite strong. So what Don described was we did have a little bit of inventory build in the course of the quarter. Most of that was gone by the end of the year, very, very consistent with where we wanted to be at the end of the year and where we ended last year. Secondly, in terms of pull-forwards, the retailers and so forth have gotten so sophisticated, system-driven, that there's very little pull-ahead these days when you announce pricing. So that was not a big impact to the quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Barry with the Buckingham. Robert Barry : Just a couple of things. One is a follow-up on an earlier question on commodity. Did that headwind actually go up versus that 3Q? Because I thought it was $100 million. Now you said - I think you said 50% of $320 million. And then on the tariffs. Is that now, in the walk, $100 million headwind? I'm just curious to the extent to which the change in the value of the renminbi might actually be able to help you offset that. Donald Allan : Yes, the commodity number has gone up primarily because of just some accounting dynamics on how certain things get accounted for. There's a number that's kind of hung up in inventory as we go into this year that will impact the numbers. So it's up by $40 million to $50 million versus maybe what we were thinking in the middle of last year primarily because of that dynamic. And the other thing is on the tariff side, yes, that number is correct, incremental $100 million year-over-year. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me for any further questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's first quarter 2019 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, Executive Vice President and President of Global Tools & Storage. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim, Don and Jeff will review our first quarter 2019 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we'll be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and our most recent '34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree. James Loree : Okay. Thank you, Dennis. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As you saw on our press release, we delivered a strong start to 2019. The company posted solid quarterly revenue growth and overcame the carryover impact of commodity currency and tariff related headwinds to deliver modest earnings expansion. First quarter revenues were $3.3 billion, up 4% versus prior year. This included a robust 5% organic growth and 3% from acquisitions, which were partially offset by a 4-point currency headwind. Price continues to materialize with 2 points of growth attributable to price in the quarter. And Tools & Storage continued its impressive performance, delivering 7% organic growth with all regions and business units contributing. The tools team is leveraging a powerful set of catalysts complemented by an intense focus on commercial execution to consistently deliver above-market growth. And once again, Craftsman, e-commerce, new product innovation, and Irwin/Lenox helped propel the Tools & Storage performance. You'll hear more from Jeff Ansell on this during his remarks. Industrial, total revenues grew 10% as the Nelson and IES Attachments acquisitions were partially offset by automotive market pressure and currency. And Security demonstrated forward progress delivering both operating margin dollar and rate improvement versus 1Q 2018. And a year into our two-year strategic review process, the security team has a strategy along with a detailed plan and is in full execution mode on the business transformation. Don Allan will provide some more color during his remarks and we will cover in depth at our May 16 Investor Day. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.42, up 2%. With a sharp focus on cost control, our business teams delivered a strong operational performance and overcame approximately $160 million of 2018 carryover headwinds in the first quarter. Our outperformance was very encouraging as we contemplate prospects for the remainder of the year. Coupled with strong organic growth, we expect modest margin rate accretion for the total year with a return to near 15% levels in the back half, assuming a stable input cost and tariff environment. This is a simple function of price cost timing as the year unfolds. Moving to M&A, we also closed two strategic transactions in the quarter, completing our acquisition of the Pengo and Paladin businesses from IES, as well as our 20% equity investment in MTD, a large supplier of Craftsman outdoor power equipment, as well as owner of the Cub Cadet and Troy-Bilt brands. With IES Attachments, in combination with our hydraulic tools business, we now have a large portfolio of high-quality, performance-driven attachment solutions that creates a well-defined path for continued profitable growth. We expect IES to contribute approximately $300 million in revenue and be accretive to earnings in 2019. This asset has strong brands, deep customer relationships, and its independent dealer network has approximately 60% of its revenue related to aftermarket applications. Our focus is now on integration and achieving the cost and revenue synergies from the deal. Our minority investment in MTD represents a strategic bet on long-term growth in the $20 billion lawn and garden market, structured in a financially prudent manner. The transaction includes an option for us to purchase the remaining 80% in 2021 and beyond, and we're excited to partner with MTD, a leading outdoor gas-powered equipment manufacturer with a great history and a great team. And finally, based on our strong first quarter performance, we are raising our 2019 full-year adjusted EPS guidance by a nickel to a range of $8.50 to $8.70. So, in summary, 2019 is off to a good start. And our first quarter results provide us with good momentum and additional flexibility to execute and deliver the year. Leveraging our growth catalysts and SFS 2.0 operating system, we are continuing to lean into the external environment as the headwinds begin to dissipate. We remain focused on strong free cash flow generation and a return to operating margin expansion through productivity, cost control, and pricing. And, additionally, we are undertaking an extensive array of exciting new margin-focused initiatives to ensure rate expansion in 2019 and beyond. More to come on these initiatives at our Investor Day in a few weeks. And with that, I'll hand it over to Don Allan for a more detailed discussion on first quarter results and 2019 guidance. Don? Donald Allan, Jr.: Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the first quarter. Tools & Storage revenue increased 3% as 7% organic growth was offset by 4 points of currency pressure. Organic growth included 5 points of volume and 2 points of price. We continue to see the benefits from the price actions we executed in the back half of 2018, as well as the additional price increases implemented this year in response to the List 3 tariffs. The operating margin rate for the segment was 12.1%, down from the prior year as the benefits of volume leverage, pricing and cost control were more than offset by the 2018 carryover impacts of currency, commodity inflation, and tariffs. These carryover headwinds amounted to $160 million for Stanley Black & Decker in the first quarter, with much of this impacting the Tools & Storage segment. The strong organic growth and related share gains were experienced across each region and SBU. So, looking at the results on a geographic basis, North America once again led the way, up 11% driven by the US retail channel, which posted high-teens growth. North America's growth continued to be fueled by the Craftsman brand rollout, new product innovations, and price realization. We continue to see great momentum with the Craftsman rollout at our major retail partners and have seen a strong end user reception as the product has hit the shelves. We couldn't be more pleased with the progress so far. More color to come on that, as well as our STANLEY and STANLEY FATMAX rollouts from Jeff later. Europe delivered 3% organic growth in the quarter despite a continuation of slower market conditions across several countries within the region. The team continued to leverage our strong portfolio of brands, new product innovation and commercial actions to produce above-market growth. And then, finally, emerging markets delivered low single-digit growth, driven by price, new products and e-commerce expansion. These actions were largely offset by continued market contractions in Argentina and Turkey, which presented an organic growth headwind of 3 points within the quarter. We continue to see broad-based share gains across the region. Brazil, Ecuador and Mexico posted high-single to low double-digit growth, while Russia, Korea, Taiwan and India all posted strong double-digit performances. Now, let's take a look at the Tools & Storage SBUs. Both had solid contributions to the overall performance. Power tools and equipment delivered 6% organic growth, which benefited from strong commercial execution and new product introductions. In particular, we had a solid contribution from new products launched under the Craftsman, DeWalt and FlexVolt brands. Hand tools, accessories and storage delivered 9% organic growth as new product introductions, the Craftsman rollout and, of course, contributions from the Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies all contributed to this growth.  So, in summary, an outstanding quarter and a strong start to the year for the Tools & Storage organization as they continue to demonstrate above-market organic growth, tight cost control and strong price actions to overcome significant external headwinds related to commodities, currency and tariffs. Let's turn to Industrial. This segment delivered 10% revenue growth, which included 16 points from the Nelson Fastener and IES Attachments acquisitions, a 3% organic decline and a negative 3 points from currency offset this significant growth from these acquisitions. Operating margin rate was down year-over-year to 13.9%, as productivity gains and cost control actions were more than offset by the impact from lower engineered fastening automotive volume, commodity inflation and the modestly-dilutive impact from these acquisitions. Engineered fastening organic revenues were down 4% due to declines in automotive light vehicle production and lower system shipments, which were partially offset by continued fastener penetration gains. We continue to see declines in underlying global automotive production, which impacts fastener volumes. However, it is also impacting the scope of automotive system projects that our customers are executing. The infrastructure businesses delivered 5% organic growth, primarily driven by stronger North American onshore pipeline project activity in oil and gas. This was partially offset by lower hydraulic demolition tool volumes, whose underlying market has been modestly impacted by the recent retraction in scrap steel pricing. And, finally, let's turn to Security. The Security segment revenue declined 1% with bolt-on acquisitions contributing 2 points and price delivering 1%, which was more than offset by unfavorable currency of 4 points. North America organic growth was up 2% as higher volumes in automatic doors and healthcare were partially offset by lower installation revenues in commercial electronic security. Europe was down 1% organically. France was a bright spot for the quarter as the team was able to leverage new commercial actions in the small to medium enterprise market, which is associated with our transformation plan that Jim mentioned. However, this was more than offset by unfavorable market conditions in Sweden and the UK, two larger markets for our security European team. In terms of profitability, the segment operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 10.3%. The security team continues to demonstrate progress with its business transformation plan. They successfully executed on their first quarter objectives, delivering margin rate and dollar expansion through cost control, and they are focused on minimizing recurring revenue attrition. So, we achieved modest organic growth. Additionally, the team continues to make investments in hiring and onboarding new commercial and field technician resources. We believe these actions, coupled with the new technology forward customer solutions we have developed and are developing, will begin to translate into consistent growth as we move forward in the year. This is the third quarter in a row, our security team has achieved their financial expectations. Nice progress so far. So, now, let's briefly look at the quarter's free cash flow performance on the next page. We were down approximately $65 million year-over-year, mainly attributed to increased working capital. Tools & Storage continues to carry high levels of inventory to support the ongoing Craftsman rollout and other brand transitions that we are currently executing across the channels. As mentioned at January's earnings call, we believe the working capital levels will moderate throughout the year, and we will achieve working capital turns relatively flat to the prior year by the end of 2019. This will position us well for driving significant working capital improvement in 2020, so we can achieve approximately 100% free cash flow conversion in 2020. So, turning back to 2019, please keep in mind that a free cash outflow in the first quarter is in line with normal seasonality. We remain confident that we will deliver strong cash flow generation for the year, given our core SFS processes and principles, combined with reducing working capital levels, in line with normal seasonal activity as I just discussed.  Therefore, we are reiterating our commitment to deliver a free cash flow conversion rate of approximately 85% to 90% in 2019. So, now, let's turn to 2019 earnings guidance. As Jim mentioned earlier, we are raising our adjusted EPS outlook for 2019 to a range of $8.50 to $8.70, which is a $0.05 increase versus our prior guidance. On a GAAP basis, this results in a range of $7.50 to $7.70 per share.  Diving into a little more detail on our 2019 adjusted EPS, you can see on the left hand side of the chart, the increase is supported by the strong organic growth and cost control, which drove approximately $0.15 of operational outperformance in the first quarter. This is partially offset by an incremental $20 million of currency headwinds, which primarily consists of adverse movements in the Brazilian real, Argentinean peso and Chinese RMB. As it relates to recent acquisitions and divestiture activity, the impact from the acquisition of the Paladin and Pengo businesses from IES and the divestiture of Sargent and Greenleaf led to a relatively neutral impact to our full-year 2019 EPS outlook. These IES assets will create solid EPS accretion in the later years through cost and revenue synergies. One other item of note I would like to highlight is that we expect second quarter earnings per share to approximate 29.5% of the full-year performance. This is generally consistent with prior-year performance. Turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page, organic growth within Tools & Storage is still expected to be mid-single digits in 2019. We continue to execute on multiple catalysts, including the continued brand transitions with Craftsman, STANLEY and STANLEY FATMAX, new product innovation, including FlexVolt, Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies, e-commerce and other emerging market opportunities. The margin rates are expected to be positive year-over-year. The team will continue to leverage price, cost actions, margin initiatives and volume to offset the carryover headwinds we previously mentioned. We believe the business is well positioned for return to margin expansion in 2019 and anticipate a meaningful expansion in the second half. In the Industrial segment, we expect organic revenue to be down modestly with total revenue growth positive from the contributions of our recent acquisitions. In infrastructure, we expect oil and gas to be positive organically and hydraulic tools to be relatively flat on an organic basis. Engineered fastening organic revenue is expected to be down modestly with growth in automotive and industrial fasteners being offset by a decline in the systems side of the business. We do believe the pressure we experienced in the automotive systems during Q1 will begin to subside in the later stages of 2019. We expect operating margins to be down year-over-year driven by the modestly dilutive impact from acquisitions and the impacts of negative product mix, specifically, lower automotive system sales in engineered fastening. And then, finally, in our Security segment, we're expecting organic growth of low-single digits and growth in operating margin dollars and rate year-over-year as the team continues to execute on its transformation strategy. So, in summary, the company's organic revenue will grow approximately 4% and we expect 4% to 7% adjusted EPS expansion, which is overcoming approximately $340 million of commodity, currency and tariff headwinds, which is primarily related to the carryover from 2018. We are encouraged by the collective performances across the portfolio in the first quarter, which gives us confidence to increase our 2019 EPS guidance range. We remain focused on leveraging the positive impacts from our continued strong organic growth, the previously executed pricing actions, and the recently completed $250 million cost reduction program to ensure we achieve our 2019 guidance. These factors, along with the beginning impacts of certain margin enhancement initiatives, will result in operating margin and rate expansion in 2019, and we expect meaningful expansion in the second half of the year. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff to provide a few comments on the progress with the ongoing Craftsman, STANLEY and STANLEY FATMAX brand transitions as well as some of the new innovations we are currently launching within the Tools business. Jeff? Jeffery Ansell : Thank you, Don. I'd like to share a few updates on our latest innovations and brand initiatives, including our recent launch of a new DeWalt 20 volt compact series called Atomic, as well as the incredible progress of Craftsman. Our global Tools & Storage business had strong first quarter performance, with high single-digit organic growth led by North America. A key component of this success was our continued focus on innovation-led growth. For example, our DeWalt FlexVolt platform was up double-digits in the quarter as we continued to grow, in the system, our core products as well as expanding into the outdoor category with FlexVolt. We're also pleased to announce the global launch of the 20-volt Atomic series, a range of tools that combines performance and durability in a compact format. The Atomic series augments our existing DeWalt 20 volt line, which is now the largest professional cordless system in the world, with well over 200 products. With this global program just beginning to ship, we expect to see incremental growth in the pro power tool space within the year. During our May Investor Day, we will detail this and other breakthrough innovations.  Regarding Craftsman, the momentum and success from 2018 carried into 2019, with growth across all categories in Craftsman. Our Craftsman expansion plan remains on track and we are well on our way to delivering our $1 billion target by 2021. Now, I'll turn it back over to Jim to wrap today's presentation. James Loree : Thanks, Jeff. And as you heard, it was a solid start to the year as we delivered above-market organic growth, leveraging that array of growth catalysts. I'm proud of the team's efforts and execution, which have positioned us to achieve decent LTM financial results, amidst a host of macro challenges. As these challenges anniversary, we're looking forward to a resumption of margin accretion in combination with our excellent growth. And lastly, I want to remind everyone that we will be hosting an Investor Day on the morning of May 16th in New York City. This will be a great opportunity for us to communicate our strategic and financial objectives, and discuss how we are pursuing growth, margin expansion and transformation at Stanley Black & Decker. As you can tell, we are passionate about delivering growth with margin expansion and this will be prominently featured. We will also showcase members of our business unit and other key functional management teams. So, please reach out to Dennis if you're interested in attending, and we look forward to seeing you there. And we're now ready for Q&A. Dennis? Dennis Lange : Great. Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. James Loree : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Jim, I was wondering if you could address a little bit more \u2013 as you said in your opening monologue that the headwinds are dissipating. And I think we all kind of understand the comp issue and how it was front-loaded here in Q1. But can you provide a little bit more color on how you see that playing out in the back half? And, I guess, part and parcel to my question is, it does look like we might be getting close to trade tariff resolution. And how do you think about maintaining price if we do get tariff relief? Thank you. James Loree : Sure. Well, first of all, the massive hit that we took in the first quarter from the carryover headwinds goes down sequentially in the second quarter, but it's still over $100 million \u2013 sorry, just below $100 million. Right around $85 million. And then, in the back half of the year, the price actually more or less offsets the remaining headwinds, the remaining carryover and whatever modest headwinds that we have this year. So, in general, that's just how the math works. And so, as I said, assume a stable cost and tariff environment. If the tariffs go away, that's a pretty significant reduction in headwinds. I think the total amount of tariffs for the year is just under $100 million or thereabouts. So, most of the tariff impact is List three3. And from what we hear, the way the trade negotiations are going, that would be the most likely tariffs to be removed, List 3. And keeping in mind, to the last part of your question, a lot of the pricing activity was not tariff related, but also inflation related. And so, I think that when you finally add it all up, the price recovery against the tariffs only amounted to between 40% and 50%. And so, there was a big chunk of inflation-related cost that was not covered by the price as well as some of the tariffs. So, I think that \u2013 we'll see how that all plays out, but I think there's sufficient inflation and headwinds to justify a fairly stable price environment going forward. Donald Allan, Jr.: Let me just clarify that the number that Jim gave on 2Q was net of price. I just want to make sure people understand that's not gross headwinds. And the other thing to keep in mind is if all the tariffs went away \u2013 we've communicated this previously \u2013 the impact net of price on an annualized basis would probably be somewhere around $40 million to $50 million. But that's all tariff. And if List 3 happens, it's probably a third to 50% of that number. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning, guys. James Loree : Good morning. Donald Allan, Jr.: Good morning. Josh Pokrzywinski : Yeah. I guess, just to follow-up on Jeff's question there with the margin expansion that you guys talked about in Tools. I think, Don, you mentioned a few times, strong margin expansion in the second half. Should we still expect to see something in 2Q and how has that changed, just given maybe some of the timing of headwinds or price increases or the competitive dynamic out there with respect to price? Donald Allan, Jr.: Yeah. As we were saying over the last couple of months, we were anticipating a kind of modest improvement in margin rate in the second quarter. And we still believe that will be the case. And as we get into the third and the fourth quarter, both Jim and I indicated, we expect the incremental accretion rate for Tools to become quite meaningful, and that's still the expectation at this stage. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. James Loree : Good morning, Mike. Michael Rehaut : Congrats on the quarter. Question I have relates to the Tools & Storage performance. Obviously, you continued great execution on the top line. Given some of the new initiatives that you launched, or Jeff referred to, I was hoping to get a sense of what you think about the mid-single digit growth for the segment for 2019. If you can kind of break that down by looking at also the \u2013 break it down by some of the growth initiatives [indiscernible] such as Craftsman, such as FlexVolt as opposed to the core market growth and if that's changed at all, particularly given the first quarter performance? James Loree : Yeah. As we've indicated previously, we think Craftsman is about 3 points of growth for the full year. The first quarter was fairly representative of that. And we don't see any different view at this stage. We've indicated mid-single-digits. We've also said that that probably means we're \u2013 our view is we are floating around 6% and possibly 7%, and we still feel like that's the right estimate at this stage. What we don't know is just how impactful Craftsman is going to be. It's been very positive. And if those trends continue, those numbers can be a little bit better as the year goes on. But I look at the core underlying markets, they're performing well. We had some weak markets in Europe, as we talked about, where we don't have a lot of market growth right now in many of the countries, but we are demonstrating growth as we had 3% organic growth in the first quarter. So, we're outpacing there. And that really has more to do with just strong commercial activities, product innovation, et cetera, like the European team has done for several years now. In North America, you saw the magnitude of the growth of double-digits and the impact of Craftsman being in there. But even if you exclude that impact, it's still pretty significant performance, which would include things like FlexVolt and other matters as well. So, we still feel like that's a reasonable estimate at this stage. We all have to keep in mind that it is the first quarter. And as we get to the second quarter and we complete the rollout of Craftsman and Lowe's through all the different stores. We'll have a good sense of where we are and a read in the back half of the year and what that means. But I think, at this stage, we feel good about an organic growth number about 6% to 7% for Tools. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open. Tim Wojs : Hey, guys. Good morning. Good start to the year. James Loree : Good morning. Thank you. Tim Wojs : I guess just maybe on \u2013 back on Tools and growth in the quarter, relative to your expectations a couple of months ago, where do you think you saw the outperformance internally? Was it better sell-through at retail? Was it the types of products that consumers are buying? Just a little bit more color on maybe what was better relative to your expectations in the quarter. James Loree : I guess, kind of all of the above. The sell-through has been fantastic and the product introductions have been really well received. And so, it's a combination of all those factors. And I think also, the market is more stable than, I think, we were thinking a quarter ago, although there is some choppiness in housing and so on. I think, in general, it's more stable than we would have expected at this point in time. And the interest rate reductions have helped a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. Good morning. You've given some very good color on your updated sort of macro thoughts around North America demand. I just wondered if you could give us an update around expectations for organic growth firm-wide in Europe and the emerging markets. Those were sort of flattish both in Q1. Just wondered how you think the rest of the year will play out for Europe and EM. Donald Allan, Jr.: Yeah. I think what we experienced in Q1 is not going to be dramatically different other than, I would say, probably emerging markets might start to demonstrate more growth as we get to the back half. They clearly are dealing with some difficult circumstances in two countries that I mentioned, of Turkey and Argentina. But we do start to kind of lap that in the middle of the year, and so the comp gets a little easier from that perspective to demonstrate organic growth. So, I think we'll see a little bit of an improvement in the organic growth profile in the back half for emerging markets. But I think Europe will continue to be kind of a low-single digit growth performance for a good part of the year and North America will continue to be strong. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, guys. James Loree : Hi, Nigel. Nigel Coe : I'm sure you're glad to get 1Q behind you. So, it's, obviously, great news on SG&A. Big reduction there. And I'm assuming that's where the bulk of the cost action is coming through in that line. I know you're going to address this more on the upcoming May conference, but maybe you could talk about the margin transformation initiatives underway, and is that more of a capacity and gross margin initiative? And how does that differ from some of the regular way restructuring you're currently doing? Thanks. James Loree : Sure. So, the margin resiliency initiative, we like to call it, gets us back to kind of our historical margin accretion of about 50 basis points a year after we get back to our prior levels, which we will accomplish pretty much this year, start to have margin accretion again. And so, really, the intent of this is \u2013 it may have a modest 2019 impact, but the real impact will be 2021 and we'll be driving that 50 basis point and possibly even more margin accretion going forward. And we'll get into a fair amount of detail about this in \u2013 on May 16th. But the general thrust is utilizing technology and technological advancements to enhance value-creation initiatives that already exist. So, it could be as it relates to price, it could be as it relates to procurement and so on. So, there's different categories or buckets, if you will, where we're taking technology and utilizing kind of leading-edge practices to data analytics, artificial intelligence, cobotics, those types of things to actually enhance our margins and create value. That's the basic idea. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nicole DeBlase : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. James Loree : Good morning. Donald Allan, Jr.: Good morning. Nicole DeBlase : So, I just wanted to dig into 2Q a little bit. It seems like that's the thing that the investors are asking about most or grappling with since \u2013 it seems like it's not a whole lot different than normal seasonality for me, but, essentially, consensus is doubling versus 1Q excluding the tax benefit. So, if you guys could kind of talk through the big puts and takes. I know we talked about the $85 million net headwind. What's the gross headwind expected? If you could talk through organic growth since I think the comp gets a bit tougher year-on-year, tax rate, and anything else that we need to consider when we're thinking about bridging from 1Q to 2Q? Donald Allan, Jr.: Clearly, the volume overall is the biggest driver where the volume of the whole company will probably be up $400 million to $450 million sequentially from Q1 to Q2. So, that's clearly a big driver. You also have \u2013 the gross headwinds go down on an absolute basis by about $30 million to $35 million from Q1 to Q2, while the price benefit stays relatively consistent. So, you get a benefit there as well. And then, some of our cost actions were not completed until Q1. So, you get a full quarter benefit of that in Q2. Those are really the three main drivers that are driving that. There is a little bit of a modest impact from a lower tax rate in Q2 versus Q1, as well as many of the tax benefits we're expecting in the first half versus the back half of the year. Those are the four main drivers that would get you to that number. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. James Loree : Good morning. Donald Allan, Jr.: Good morning. Joe Ritchie : Maybe just touching on the focus of the Analyst Day. I know we're going to talk a lot about the margin expansion. But maybe just a broader question around, like, is this a pivot? You guys have been focused very much so on the growth initiatives historically the 22/22. And now, it seems like this Analyst Day is going to be a little bit more focused on the margin expansion opportunities. And so, maybe discuss a little bit just kind of the shift in philosophy there. James Loree : It's not really a huge shift in philosophy. It's really kind of back to the future. We've always in the last, I'd say, five to seven years we have always been focused on growth and margin expansion. And if you go back and look at the years preceding last year, there is a pretty strong track record of strong organic growth, acquisitive growth, plus margin expansion. And that formula has been very lucrative for shareholders and we intend to get back to that. So, the reason we, obviously, got off that track through one year has everything to do with the headwinds that we've talked about ad nauseam. So, this is something that we are fixated on doing in this company is doing both. And I know a lot of companies that see it as either/or. But we don't think of it that way. And we have the capability and the track record to expand margins while growing, and we intend to get back to that beginning in 2019, but really in earnest in 2020 and 2021. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Deepa Raghavan : Good morning. Good quarter there, Jim and Don. James Loree : Thank you. Donald Allan, Jr.: Thank you. Deepa Raghavan : Your outlooks for Q2, just a little bit touching on that given that it's an outdoors season, heavy season, outlooks looks like it's 250-ish at midpoint. Can you talk about momentum into Q2 including possibly any point of sales [indiscernible] North America and what are some of the upside and downside case in Q2? We know it's an outdoor season. It's meaningful to Craftsman/MTD just the weather in there. But on a year-on-year basis, is there anything else that other than what you've addressed earlier? That would be helpful. Thank you. Donald Allan, Jr.: Yeah. So, I'll pass it over to Jeff in a minute to maybe give us some commentary on the outdoor season view for us. But as I mentioned and Jim mentioned, the POS was strong in the first quarter. We do think that trend will continue into the second quarter and likely for the remainder of the year. The other drivers are the reason for why we think the business will continue to improve around margin rate in the second quarter, so we can achieve what I described. But let me give Jeff a chance to give a little bit more color on our view of the outdoor season. Jeffery Ansell : So, to reiterate what Don just said, POS was robust as were the organic growth numbers in North America in Q1. There is not a great deal of outdoor activity in that quarter. It more starts in the second quarter, runs through the third. But what we did see was a slow start to the outdoor season, as much of the US market was underwater, if you remember, early days of the spring. That changed quite significantly in the last four weeks. So, a season that started out negative has turned positive at this point, certainly, for us. And we're comping relatively sluggish outdoor numbers from last year. If you remember, last year's outdoor season wasn't a really robust one. So, it's been really positive for the last four weeks and we have every reason to believe it will continue to be positive through the second quarter, one, given the kind of sluggish comps from last year, but also the new product development that we put into the market this year in the DeWalt brand as well as the Black & Decker brand and, most recently, the Craftsman brand. So quite positive. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open. Rob Wertheimer : Hi, good morning. I just wonder if you could give any kind of an update on Craftsman production, US production, just progress. And then, any thoughts on evolutions at MTD and if you're able to achieve better results through rating [ph] them? Thanks. Donald Allan, Jr.: I'll start with the first part of the question, then turn it over to Jim for the second part. Craftsman domestic manufacturing is in a really good place. We essentially began the process with almost no domestic manufacturing for Craftsman and what we procured. To this point, over the course of about 12 months, we've gone from what was almost 0% to about a third of the product line manufactured domestically today on our plan to double that going forward, which we'll give you more detail around that at the May Investor Day. But the inertia created by Craftsman, and then combining that with domestic manufacturing, the combination of those two things has led us to growth in every category that is Craftsman today. So, we're quite pleased with where we are. But I would say. we have yet a lot to do. Jeffery Ansell : Great. So, on MTD, really excited about the transaction, including the option. But as excited about the people that we get to work with because, frankly, the transaction has got this \u2013 got us all set up with a confluence of interests in the sense that any EBITDA growth that occurs will kind of share the benefits post-closing of the 20%, will share the benefits 50/50 in terms of the ultimate determination of the option price. And that structure has put us in a position where we are working together in earnest on value creation opportunities for MTD that include everything from growth to cost reduction, to margin expansion and so on. And it's going to be a multi-year program. And as we're running it like an acquisition integration, while subscribing to all the principles of antitrust that we have to subscribe to, and we're very confident that we will get MTD's profitability up to a point where it will be able to slot it into our portfolio in 2021 or 2022 in a way that is really accretive for us and is a great deal for the folks at MTD. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open. Justin Speer : Hey, guys. Thank you very much. I just wanted to further unpack the Tools & Storage growth and what you're looking for underlying market growth for this business and how that kind of sequences as the year progresses? And then, dovetailing that question with, is the reality that if we do get trade resolution, do you think you'll be able to hold on to most of that price? Do you think you'll be able to hold on to the potential savings from tariffs going away? James Loree : Yeah. As I mentioned on growth earlier for Tools & Storage, we have a view of 6% to 7% for the full year. We expect Craftsman to be about 3 points of that, which would demonstrate some modest growth over GDP, if you look at it globally, not assume being a point or point and a half. So, that's pretty significant in some camps around the world. But that's our view and we think that will continue to be the case. And we're very hopeful that Craftsman outperforms expectations, and maybe some other product innovations and other growth catalysts do as well. And we'll see as the year progresses. We talked about how we have a lot of work to do on Craftsman to complete the rollout in the second quarter. And then, we have to focus on the rollout of other brands and some of our other customers. So, we have a lot of work to do over the year to make this happen. But we're positive at this stage and we'll continue to provide updates along the way, in particular in July and October. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Buckingham Research. Your line is open. Robert Barry : Hey, guys. Good morning. James Loree : Good morning. Donald Allan, Jr.: Good morning. Robert Barry : Congrats on the solid start. James Loree : Thanks. Robert Barry : I just wanted to actually clarify a couple of things. One is, just why the Industrial outlook is weaker and how much of that weakness happened in 1Q? And then, just on a couple P&L items, that price and commodities are still kind of plus 150, minus 150 and if there is any kind of potential upside or downside to those values just based on what we're seeing with commodities? Donald Allan, Jr.: Yeah. I think for Industrial, our view is a little bit worse than it was in January as we saw the automotive light vehicle production was down almost 5% in the first quarter, which was worse than projections. It's supposed to be down a little bit, smaller number in the second quarter, and then begin to moderate in the back half of the year. We do think systems will start to return in the back half of the year. That's the feedback we're getting from a lot of our key customers.  And so, that's clearly a pressure point, although it's a modest pressure point versus expectations. I think we were thinking relatively flat back in January. Now, we're just down modestly as a result of that. I think the engineered fastening team is doing a great job managing through this cycle with the auto industry and looking for opportunities in some of the \u2013 and the Nelson acquisition that they've done as well as the other aspects of the Industrial fastener business within their world. So, they continue to be focused on that. The headwinds, as we mentioned, have gone up a little bit overall, $20 million due to FX. And at this stage, commodities are not changing dramatically. Although, we think as we go through the year that could be an opportunity that we see emerge as the year goes on. But. right now, it's not flowing through as an opportunity for us to capture in our P&L at this stage. And then, tariffs are bit of an open wild card at this stage as to what happens. Do we have a deal with China in the future? And if we do, do all the tariffs go away? Or as Jim said, do they partially go away? It is a factor that we see. But we feel good about where we're positioned as a company to deal with these headwinds, even though we saw modest increase in them. It feels like, as we go throughout the year, the ones in commodities and tariff feel like there is a possibility for an opportunity [indiscernible] to get smaller. However, we could potentially see a little bit more pressure in currency as we go throughout the year. We certainly saw the volatility of that last year, but I think that \u2013currency tends to be something that's easier for us to manage if that's the only major headwind we are dealing with. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open. Michael Wood : Hi. Good morning. I was hoping you could provide some color in terms of the \u2013 you gave a very explicit 1Q guidance, which you beat operationally, you said, by about $0.25 \u2013 sorry, $0.15 or so excluding the timing of the tax. Curious if there was some other pull forward in 1Q that didn't allow you to flow that $0.15 beat into your 2019 guidance? Donald Allan, Jr.: As I mentioned in my commentary, is that we actually did have an operational outperformance of $0.15 in the first quarter, but we did see a $20 million increase in currency or $0.10 of an impact related to that. So, the net benefit is about $0.05. And we felt, at this stage, the prudent thing to do, to let that flow through. Let's see if we get resolution on China trade. Let's see if some of the trends that I had mentioned emerge in the volume of Tools, as well as the headwinds associated with commodity and tariffs. And so, it's a prudent first step and we'll see how things progress in the next quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open. David MacGregor : Yes. Good morning. James Loree : Good morning. David MacGregor : Congratulations on a good quarter. James Loree : Thanks. David MacGregor : Just on Craftsman, thinking about second quarter and the dynamics around the Craftsman brand, can you update us on the timing of the load-in? I think you mentioned earlier that, Lowe's, you expected that to be complete in the second quarter. But have you started the Amazon load-in yet? And if so, how far into that process are you? And finally, can you update us on the timing of the load-in Home Depot on the STANLEY and FATMAX and how long that will take to complete? Thanks. Jeffery Ansell : Yeah. This is Jeff. I'll take the question. I'll give you the status first of STANLEY, STANLEY FATMAX and then we'll migrate to Craftsman. We've just begun the process of rolling out the STANLEY and STANLEY FATMAX products that we highlighted last earnings call. So, they are just flowing through the supply chain, into stores. You will see those product set \u2013 the first phase of that set this coming month. So, in the month of May, you'll see those things set at store level. So, no underlying POS or any of that at this point, but the rollout is going quite well. And so, we're very positive on that. Regarding Craftsman, probably similarly, we've had greater demand for the product than we anticipated. And as such, we've expanded our view of the size of Craftsman and the timing of Craftsman previously. In order to make certain that we can accommodate that increased demand via supply, we have elected to move the rollout of new customers on Craftsman to the early parts of the second half of this year. So, in an attempt to make sure, we can satisfy the customers that we do have today and the demand that the end user has created, we pushed those back just a bit, but they will begin very early second half, and we'll roll those things out in the cadence we described, but starting at that point and time. So, all positive underlying reasons to do those things. And again, we're quite positive with both the rollout of STANLEY, STANLEY FATMAX and Craftsman across all categories. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Ken Zener : Good morning, everybody. James Loree : Hey, Ken. Donald Allan, Jr.: Good morning. Ken Zener : Jeff, can you talk to the outdoor category given MTD and Craftsman? Specifically kind of a bigger picture, but what constraints the expansion of cordless applications into gas? Is it your guys' internal R&D? Is it just the market price? Or you don't want to be the bleeding edge? Thank you very much. Jeffery Ansell : Well, it has advanced quite significantly in the last, you'd say, two years, right? So, there have been cordless \u2013 non-gas cordless outdoor products from us for almost three decades. But the cost curve has enabled us to beat us and others to get electric products competitively priced with petrol really for the first time in the last 12 months. And at that point, then the consumer has the decision to make. They would either choose petrol, which they are accustomed to today, or migrate to electric. And that's a process that's beginning as we speak. So, I'd say the technology enables that today. So, you see this in categories like string trimmers, hedge trimmers, blowers, chainsaws, things that historically have been gas driven. And that migration has happened relatively rapidly and you'll see \u2013 if you survey retail today, you'll see examples under the Craftsman brand where we have NCAP's registration that says, you choose your power source. So, it will be gas product or the electric equivalent at the same price, allowing the user to make the decision, which has been the first time in history we've ever been able to make that claim or do that. And it's going really well. So, I don't think there's any technological hurdles with it, in that sense. As you get into higher and higher output products, walk behinds, ride-on mowers, there is still a gap between the value proposition of petrol or gas and electric. And we and others are working to close that gap, but there's probably a little more work to be done there. But the early read is very positive and the electrification of outdoor products being led really by us across brands like Black & Decker, DeWalt and Craftsman. So... Donald Allan, Jr.: One of the things that we're doing to take advantage of this period where we own 20% of MTD and have not yet exercised the option is to collaborate on R&D because it's an application challenge. It's not just a battery challenge. It's a system challenge. So, their expertise in the actual units of outdoor power equipment as we go up the power curve and our expertise in battery technology and application to lower power output type products, it's a great combination \u2013 best combination in the industry to tackle this and we're going to be out in front on that one. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Susan Maklari : Good morning. James Loree : Good morning. Donald Allan, Jr.: Good morning. Susan Maklari : I wanted to focus a little bit on the cash flows and the balance sheet. On the last call, you talked to taking a defensive approach to cash flows this year with a focus on deleveraging. And with the operating environment coming in a bit more stable relative to your initial expectations, are there any changes to your capital allocation plans for this year? Donald Allan, Jr.: There really isn't any significant changes to our capital allocation strategy. As we thought about January, we are preparing the company for a slow growth environment. And we were concerned about housing, in particular, what was happening as interest rates had been rising in the previous year and there was talk about continued increases in that area and what that could mean for housing. As Jim mentioned, that's changed a lot in the last three months where now the Fed has a different kind of position on interest rates and, actually, we've seen a little bit of a reversal in that trend, and that's had a bit of a positive impact on housing. But we're still dealing with a relatively \u2013 a little bit of a slow growth environment in certain pockets. We have a slow automotive industry. Housing is doing okay, but it's not robust at this stage. And so, we're not overly concerned about the economy at this view. We feel good about how we've set up the company and to be prepared for, as we mentioned, various different environments, and this was one of them. And the importance of our capital allocation is, we have to keep in mind that, in the previous couple of years, we've done some significant capital allocation transactions, including buying back stock, acquisitions of IES, MTD, Nelson Fasteners and then, before that, we had Craftsman and we had the Newell Tools acquisition. So, we've allocated a fair amount of capital to these different areas. So, a couple of things are happening this year. One, we want to get our debt to EBITDA ratio down closer to two times and we will achieve that with the current cash flow view and projection of the business. And that will really position us to be able to look at other allocation strategies in the M&A world as we go into 2020. And, frankly, we need to absorb a lot of those transactions that we've completed in that timeframe as well. James Loree : There is a massive amount of execution going on as you can glean from the conversations that we've had in the last hour, and it's all going really well. But as Don said, we kind of want to get our debt-to-EBITDA down to right around 2 and digest some of these things and exploit some of the growth opportunities that we have. And then, we'll look in, as we go into 2020 and beyond, does more repurchase make sense or do we have some acquisition opportunities that might be very attractive to help us continue to drive growth? Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Justin Bergner with G Research. Your line is open. Justin Bergner : Good morning. And thank you for taking my question. James Loree : Good morning. Donald Allan, Jr.: Good morning. Justin Bergner : You made a comment earlier in the call that you're hoping to reach 100% or close to a 100% free cash flow conversion in 2020. I'm not sure, but it seems like that's a pull forward of your earlier comment that that was more of a mid-term goal. Could you clarify that's the case and sort of maybe indicate what drivers will allow you to get that free cash flow conversion up to 100% 2020? Donald Allan, Jr.: Yeah. I think one of the things that we've talked about in the last year or so is that we've had to really take some pressure on in our working capital as we dealt with these brand transitions which are fantastic opportunities for us to develop organic growth, and you've seen that track record in the Tools & Storage business. And, therefore, we haven't seen significant progress in working capital turns in the last \u2013 previous year as well as this year, we'll probably be relatively flat year-over-year.  So, as we go into 2020, we see opportunity once those transitions has kind of gotten to a more stable state on a go-forward basis, and they're really embedded in our existing business. And then, we're dealing more with just new product introductions and new innovations, et cetera. That gives us an opportunity for us to make some significant improvement in working capital turns where we'll end this year probably somewhere between 8.5 and 8.8 for working capital turns as a company. And, therefore, we've been over 10. And so, there's no reason why we can't see that opportunity going into 2020 and 2021, which means that significant benefit will flow through free cash flow, which will allow our conversion to get back up to 100%. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker\u2019s second quarter 2019 conference call. On the call in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, Executive Vice President and President of Global Tools and Storage. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning\u2019s call will also be available beginning at 11 :00 a.m. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim Don and Jeff will review our second quarter 2019 results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with other calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It\u2019s therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. It\u2019s my understanding that the webcast may have some issues with the advancing of slides and so as such we will be identifying which slide that we are speaking to as we move through the presentation today. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree. Jim Loree : Thanks, Dennis and good morning to our guests. Thank you for joining us. Stanley Black & Decker delivered a strong outperformance in the second quarter to close out the first half of 2019 in a solid position. We continued to generate above market organic growth, achieved operating margin rate expansion and delivered adjusted EPS growth overcoming a $110 million of pre-tax currency commodity and tariff headwinds. This 2Q outperformance is a testament to the agility and determination of our 61,000 employees around the globe. Their continued efforts to drive growth, realized price and control cost enabled us to successfully overcome the external forces that have pressured our margins in recent quarters. With their help, the company produced its first quarter of operating margin rate accretion since the fourth quarter 2017, a critical milestone. On that positive note, second quarter revenues were $3.8 billion, up 3% versus prior year. This included 3% organic growth and 3% from acquisitions which was partially offset by a 3 point currency headwind. Price materialized as expected contributing 2 points of revenue growth in the quarter. The growth was achieved despite some challenges in specific markets this quarter, such as continued declines in global automotive light vehicle production and a deceleration in other industrial focused end markets. Emerging market conditions were also generally weaker than normal in several markets around the world. Tools & Storage achieved a strong 5% organic growth rate with most regions and business units contributing. The tools business continues to benefit from a powerful set of catalysts, including the ongoing Craftsman rollout. We also benefited from continued focus on product innovation and commercial execution. And as a result, the team continued to build on its record of consistently delivering market share gains. Industrial, total revenues grew 13%, enabled by the IES Attachments acquisition. In its first full quarter of results, the business is demonstrating pro forma organic growth with solid operating margins and the financial performance remains on track. Assimilation of employees, suppliers and customers is well underway and going smoothly and all-in-all, we are pleased with how the integration is progressing. Security continues to demonstrate progress on its value creation plan with improvements in both operating margin dollar and rate versus prior year. The margin improvements delivered to-date are encouraging and we believe there is more to come. We are now seeking to leverage our talent investments in our commercial initiatives to generate organic growth. The recent infusion of over 1,000 digitally proficient associates has upgraded the security talent base and enabled the rapid commercialization of technology centered customer solutions. We expect to see continued progress on all fronts in the coming quarters for security and as you can appreciate, there is significant value creation potential associated with a successful transformation. Moving to the overall company, I am pleased with our strong operational performance, which was punctuated by 60 basis points of operating margin rate expansion and 4% adjusted EPS growth versus prior year. This was achieved with a laser focus on cost control and price execution with our business teams overcoming in the quarter, approximately $110 million of mostly 2018 carryover headwinds. With a solid first half behind us we are reiterating our full year adjusted EPS range of $8.50 to $8.70. This includes a 4% organic growth, margin rate expansion and 4% to 7% adjusted EPS growth versus prior year while absorbing an estimated $390 million in combined tariff currency cost inflation, OM pressures, again mostly from 2018 carryover. The power of our growth catalyst is clear. We continue to deliver above market organic growth even as some markets around the world have slowed. These share gains have resulted from execution of our SFS 2.0 operating system and include an array of programs, including the Craftsman brand rollout, breakthrough innovations such as DEWALT FLEXVOLT, Atomic and Xtreme as well as from acquisition revenue synergies, emerging markets and e-commerce. To ensure that we create an even more resilient, adaptable and agile organization, we recently launched a major companywide program that we call margin resiliency. As mentioned in our May Investor Day, this program will deliver $300 million to $500 million of annualized operating margin benefit over a multiyear period. The effort is centered around creating benefits across our entire value chain by applying the latest digital technologies and techniques such as artificial intelligence, advanced analytics and others to optimize performance and create incremental margin. Specific areas of benefit include supply chain automation and optimization including Industry 4.0, price realization, indirect cost reduction and organizational efficiency. Our ability to execute a program of this nature as forward facing and impactful as it is was made possible by our aggressive investments in recent years in digital transformation. Our purposeful commitment to high performance, innovation and social responsibility has enabled us to attract and inspire the talent capable of doing this. Margin resiliency will have impact as early as the second half of 2019 and the momentum will build in 2020 and beyond. And finally, as a separate but also positive note, I would like to highlight that last week we increased our dividend for the 52nd consecutive year. The quarterly payout now stands at $0.69 per share, which represents a 5% increase. This is a reflection of our confidence in our cash generation capability and our capital allocation strategy of returning approximately 50% of our excess capital to shareholders through dividends and repurchases and 50% towards M&A over the long-term. And with that, I will now hand it over to Don Allan for a more detailed discussion on second quarter results and 2019 guidance. Don? Don Allan : Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the second quarter. For those following on, I am on Slide 5 within the presentation. Tools & Storage revenue was up 2% as 5% organic growth was offset by 3 points of currency pressure. Volume growth contributed 3 points while price was aligned with our expectations and added another 2 points of growth. The tools team continues to do an excellent job balancing price realization and margin recovery with above-market organic growth and share gains. The operating margin rate for the segment was 17%, expanding 80 basis points from the prior year as the benefits of volume leverage, pricing, and cost control more than offset the impacts of currency, commodity inflation and tariffs. Returning to margin expansion was an important milestone within tools and it was realized in the second quarter while offsetting significant external headwinds. As Jim mentioned, the company had $110 million of tariff, commodity and currency headwinds to more than offset in the quarter. The Tools & Storage business was impacted by greater than 90% of these headwinds. The strong organic growth and related share gains were experienced across most Tools & Storage regions and SBUs. Looking at it on a geographic basis, North America led the way and was up 7% organically. This performance was driven by share gains in our U.S. retail and commercial channels, up high-single digits and mid single-digits respectively. This was partially offset by a modest decline in the industrial focused businesses. The overall North American results were robust considering that we saw some of our construction and industrial focused customers modestly bearing inventory during the quarter. North America\u2019s growth was fueled by the Craftsman brand rollout, price realization and new product innovations. Clearly, these growth catalysts are resonating with the end user and delivering share gains as evidenced by double-digit POS experienced in the second quarter. Moving on to Europe, Europe delivered 5% organic growth. 8 out of 10 markets grew organically with double-digit performances in Central Europe and Iberia and solid mid single-digit performances in Germany, the UK and the Nordics. The team continues to gain share leveraging our strong portfolio of brands, new product innovation and commercial actions to produce above market growth. And then finally in emerging markets, emerging markets declined 2%. The ongoing benefits from price, new products and e-commerce expansion were more than offset by a 3 point impact from market contraction in Argentina, Mexico and Turkey. Despite the pressures from these three markets, we continue to see broad-based share gains across the region. Brazil, Colombia and Taiwan posted mid to high single-digit growth, while Russia, Korea and India all posted robust double-digit performances. The emerging markets team is focused on delivering pricing benefits to recover currency headwinds and leveraging our growth catalyst to deliver share gains in what we expect to be a continued slower growth market environment in the back half of the year. Now, looking at the Tools & Storage SBUs, both lines had a solid contribution to the overall performance. Power tools and equipment delivered 6% organic growth benefiting from strong commercial execution and new product introductions. In particular, the outdoor segment posted high-teens growth driven by new products and expanded merchandising launched under Craftsman, DEWALT and DEWALT FLEXVOLT brands. Jeff will provide more detail about this later in the call. Additionally, we will begin shipping our newest \u2013 we began shipping our newest breakthrough innovations, Atomic and Xtreme which have a superior power to weight ratio compared to other products currently on the market. Hand Tools, Accessories & Storage delivered 4% organic growth as new product introductions and the ongoing Craftsman rollout continued to contribute to growth. So in summary another excellent quarter for the tools and storage organization as they continue to leverage our growth catalyst to deliver above market organic growth and share gain. Equally as important they returned to margin expansion, overcoming significant external headwinds through growth, cost control and disciplined price execution. Now turning to industrial, this segment delivered 13% revenue growth, which included 18 points from the IES Attachments acquisition, which was partially offset by a 3% organic decline and a negative 2 points from currency. Operating margin rate was down modestly year-over-year to 16.4% as productivity gains and cost control were more than offset by the impact from lower Engineered Fastening volume and commodity inflation. Engineered Fastening organic revenues were down 4% due to declines in automotive light vehicle production, lower system shipments and softer general industrial end-markets, which were partially offset by fastener penetration gains. We continue to see declines in underlying global automotive production for the fourth consecutive quarter, which has been down approximately 5% during the first half of 2019. The infrastructure businesses delivered 2% organic growth, primarily driven by stronger onshore pipeline project and inspection activity in oil and gas. The growth was partially offset by lower hydraulic demolition tool volumes whose underlying market is negatively impacted once scrap steel pricing declines. And then finally the Security segment declined 3% with bolt-on acquisitions contributing a positive 2 points and price delivering a positive 1 point. This was more than offset by volume being down 2%, unfavorable currency of 3 points, and then a negative 1 point impact from the Sargent & Greenleaf divestiture. North America security was flat as higher volumes within healthcare were offset by lower automatic door installations. The strong order and backlog trends in this region continue to demonstrate growth is around the corner. Europe was down 2% organically. France was again a bright spot for the region as the team leverages commercial actions in the small to medium enterprise market that is associated with our overall transformation plan. This growth however was more than offset by adverse market conditions in Sweden and the UK. In terms of profitability, the segment operating margin expanded a significant 120 basis points in the quarter to 11.2%. Once again, the security team demonstrated progress with its business transformation. For the third consecutive quarter, they successfully delivered margin rate and dollar expansion through controlling costs and delivering operational efficiencies in our service and monitoring organizations. To take the next step, security needs to demonstrate consistent organic growth in the back half of 2019. We are encouraged by the value creation potential from our commercial investments. Year-to-date, we have filled over 100 new sales positions and added over 40 technicians in the United States and Europe. We are bringing in digitally enabled skill sets to develop new solutions that utilize the information flowing through our analytics platform to deliver insights to help our customers improve their operational efficiency. We have also begun commercializing new app based solutions for our small to medium-sized customers. While this is not yet manifested itself into significant organic growth, we have seen strong order patterns and backlog improvements, which make us optimistic that growth is on the horizon. Now, let\u2019s move to Slide 6 and briefly look at the quarter\u2019s free cash flow performance on the next page. For the second quarter, free cash flow was $404 million, which brings our year-to-date performance to a use of cash of $117 million. The quarterly and year-to-date improvements versus the prior year are predominantly explained by higher net income, lower CapEx and a significant improvement in working capital. We remain confident that we will deliver strong cash flow generation for the year utilizing our core SFS processes and principles, combined with reducing working capital levels in line with normal seasonality activity. Therefore, we are reiterating our commitment to deliver a free cash flow conversion rate of approximately 85% to 90%. Now, let\u2019s turn to earnings guidance on the next page, Slide 7. We are reiterating our 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance, which calls for approximately 4% organic growth and an adjusted earnings per share range of $8.50, up to $8.70, up approximately 6% at the midpoint. On a GAAP basis, the EPS range remains unchanged at $7.50 to $7.70 per share. Now, diving into a little more detail on our 2019 adjusted EPS outlook, you can see on the left hand side of the chart, we estimate an incremental $50 million in external headwinds primarily related to List 3 China tariffs, which is in essence increasing from 10% to 25%. This increase will be partially offset by slightly lower second half expectations, related to commodity inflation. Additionally, we are modestly adjusting our full year expectations around organic volume growth, which reflects a slower market outlook for general industrial and emerging markets and incorporates the deceleration we saw during the second quarter. Our plan still calls for solid 4% organic growth as we execute our robust pipeline of growth catalysts, which will deliver above market share gains. Offsetting these headwinds are incremental pricing actions, the initial benefits from margin resiliency and the operational outperformance achieved during the second quarter. Finally, we expect third quarter earnings per share to approximate 23% of the full year performance, while the fourth quarter earnings per share will approximate 29% of the full year earnings. These quarters are slightly different than historical trends due to the timing of various brand transitions on revenue, impact to pricing in response to tariffs and the margin resiliency benefits. In addition, we will have some variation in the effective tax rate for each quarter. Now, turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page, Tools & Storage assumption still calls for mid single-digit organic growth and margin rate expansion year-over-year. As demonstrated with the second quarter performance, the team will continue to leverage price cost actions, the margin resiliency initiatives and volume to offset the external headwinds and deliver operating profit growth. The second half of the year should see a continuation of margin expansion, as we anniversary the carryover headwinds from 2018 and take actions to neutralize the incremental List 3 tariffs. Moving to the Industrial segment, we are now expecting low single digit organic decline reflecting the slower market outlook across our general industrial and automotive end markets. Total growth is expected to be positive, including the contributions from our acquisitions. Engineered Fastening organic growth is expected to decline low single digits, but the second half performance should see a slight improvement sequentially versus the first half, as the year-over-year comparables will begin to ease. Operating margins are expected to be down year-over-year, driven by lower volume and the impact from the external headwinds. The Industrial teams are focused on controlling costs and capitalizing on share gain opportunities that often present themselves during a difficult market backdrop. We fully expect the business to emerge in a stronger position, when the automotive market once again turned positive. Finally in the Security segment, we are expecting positive organic growth in operating margin dollar and rate expansion year-over-year, as the team continues to execute on its transformation strategy. So in summary, for the whole company, we expect 4% organic growth for the full year, 4% to 7% adjusted EPS expansion, which is overcoming close to $400 million of commodity, currency and tariff headwinds. We continue to be encouraged by the collective efforts across the organization through the first half of the year. This strong operational performance puts us in a position to deliver our 2019 EPS guidance, while incorporating incremental tariff headwinds and navigating dynamic end markets. We are very pleased to achieve operating margin rate expansion in the second quarter and believe this will continue for the remainder of 2019. We remain focused on leveraging our continued above market organic growth, pricing and cost actions. Additionally, we will begin to see the savings associated with the margin resiliency program in the second half. These factors combined will result in operating margin growth and rate expansion for the full year of 2019. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jeff to provide some additional color on the Tools & Storage business. Jeff? Jeff Ansell : Thank you, Don. In Tools & Storage, we maintained our Q1 momentum led by another strong performance in North America and Europe. Our continued focus on innovation-led growth and the ongoing execution of brand initiatives were key drivers to this success and share gain. Notably, our innovations in cordless and corded outdoor products across DEWALT, Craftsman and Black & Decker have enabled a fantastic outdoor season, where we are up mid-teens organically year-to-date. In Craftsman Outdoor, we launched a broad range of cordless products for the season with a 60 volt system catering to outdoor enthusiasts and 20 volt range designed for residential use. In DEWALT, we also launched new 60 volt outdoor products, which are part of our flexible battery platform. They are delivering growth in addition to our 20 volt outdoor line. We are seeing strong POS across the portfolio, as DEWALT outdoor continues to gain traction in the market. More broadly, our DEWALT 20 volt line is the largest professional cordless system in history, with over 250 products augmented by the recent launch of DEWALT Atomic series, which is the best-in-class power to weight ratio product. We are also pleased with the launch of our 12-volt DEWALT Xtreme series, a range of performance packed, offering power tool and organic solutions for variety of applications. With this program just beginning to ship, we expect to see incremental growth in the pro-power tool space in the back half of the year. Our DEWALT cordless battery platform continues to expand on serving a broad spectrum of end users from heavy-duty applications with large power requirements via FlexVolt to compact applications in the mechanical, electrical and plumbing and pro-user segments via our DEWALT Xtreme and Atomic range. This broad category innovation has been accelerated by tremendous brand execution across DEWALT Stanley, Stanley FatMax, Irwin and Craftsman, all of which are positive year-to-date. Lastly, a word on Craftsman, overall performance and customer rollouts remain on track and we continue to be well on our way to delivering three points of incremental growth in 2019 and our $1 billion target by 2021. The most satisfying part of the Craftsman re-launch has been our redesigned products are winning with the end user in delivering growth and share gain for us and our customers. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Jim to wrap today\u2019s presentation. Jim Loree : Thanks, Jeff. Great quarter. So to recap, we had strong operational performance in the second quarter, serving us well in this dynamic external operating environment. Partially due to the outperformance based on margin rate accretion, we\u2019re able to reaffirm our full year guidance today, despite somewhat slower end markets especially in industrial automotive. And as we look to close out a successful 2019, we are focused on day-to-day execution and operational excellence in accordance with our SFS 2.0 operating system. This includes continuing to leverage our organic growth catalysts, building momentum and realizing early benefits from the margin resiliency program, successfully integrating our recent acquisitions and generating strong free cash flow. I\u2019m confident that our seasoned management team will bring the same level of passion, intensity and agility that we demonstrated in the first half to successfully deliver the second half of 2019, well at the same time, preparing for a strong 2020 and beyond. Dennis, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis Lange : Great. Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Jim Loree : Hi Julian. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Maybe just my question would be around the phasing of the gross external headwinds and what that means for operating margins in the second half. So I think your guidance implies about $120 million of gross external headwinds left for the second half, maybe help us understand how much of that falls in the third quarter. And just following up on the commentary on margin expansion for the rest of the year, that I think you\u2019d said, are you saying the Q3 margins will be up year-on-year as well or it was just a general, second half comment? Jim Loree : Okay. So you\u2019re correct with the $120 million in the back half of the headwinds. That\u2019s an accurate calculation. And then, the third quarter \u2013 the split would be roughly $75 million to $80 million in the third quarter and the remainder in the fourth quarter. So a bigger amount hitting in the third quarter as things like commodity continue to tail-off, etc, and then we obviously have new headwinds in both quarters from tariffs. So that would be the split that we\u2019re seeing. And we do expect margin expansion both in the third and the fourth quarter. However, the third quarter will be probably a modest expansion in the 20 bps to 40 bps range, and then we\u2019ll see a larger expansion in the fourth quarter as a lot of the actions that we\u2019re taking in response to the new tariffs, such as pricing will get a full effect in the fourth quarter and then some of the margin resiliency things we\u2019ve been working on, that will \u2013 that will grow across the back half of the year and we\u2019ll see a larger impact in the fourth quarter, hence why we see bigger expansion in the fourth quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Jim Loree : Good morning. Nigel Coe : Hey. Maybe just \u2013 Jim, you talked about deceleration through the quarter. Maybe just talk about how June trended you guys. You didn\u2019t mentioned weather, so congrats on that, but I\u2019m sure weather was a factor. And maybe just touch on the inventory headwinds that you saw at the big box channels. And I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks guys. Jim Loree : Yes. We don\u2019t want to get too much into the month by month data, but suffice it to say that we didn\u2019t really see a significant slowing in the construction DIY-type markets. The slowing was predominantly in the industrial, general industrial and specifically automotive sectors of our business. So our DIY construction and those types of tools held up very well. I mean, we\u2019ve got POS as strong as I\u2019ve ever seen in 20 years. So if the market is slowing, it\u2019s not slowing for us not in that \u2013 in that part of the business. And a lot of the inventory corrections we saw were in the industrial channel, and we saw other corrections that were modest in different parts of the Company, that\u2019s just normal course activity though. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Jim Loree : Mike, good morning. Michael Rehaut : First question I had was on the \u2013 the core organic growth, you know, the tools business continues to perform very well, just wanted to understand, given some of the comments around industrial which might not as much impact the Tools segment more perhaps the other segments, but your comments around some slowing of end markets, emerging markets, etcetera. How do you expect the back half to play out on an organic growth standpoint, 3Q versus 4Q? And then just lastly if I could sneak a clarifying question as well. Don, you mentioned the tax rate impacting 3Q, 4Q results. A little more detail there, if possible? Thanks. Don Allan : Sure. So, the organic tools and storage performance as we mentioned in Q2 was 5% organic growth, and we had a little bit of negative decline in some of the industrial channels that we serve for industrial tools, about 2% of a decline in those particular businesses. So, nothing significant. We do believe as we look at the back half of the year for Tools that we\u2019re we think the organic growth is somewhere between 5% and 6% for the back half, with the quarters being pretty much in that range for both quarters. So, the trend that we saw in the second quarter feels like the right trend as we go into the back half of the year. And so, we\u2019ve shown a little bit of moderation in the Industrial section of the tools business. On the tax rate, the third quarter tax rate is kind of 25%, 26% and the fourth quarter will be around 15% to 16%. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, thanks. Good morning guys. Jim Loree : Good morning. Don Allan : Hi, Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : Hey, there. So just one quick one on the 3Q versus 4Q ramp, I didn\u2019t hear you guys talk about organic growth for the two quarters. I know the comps are a little bit easier in the third quarter, a little harder in the fourth. So just how to think about the 4% for the rest of the year? And then, on just on Tools & Storage, did you guys see the 3-percentage point benefit from Crafts in this quarter, implying that just the underlying market was kind of flattish? Jim Loree : So, on the third and fourth quarter organic growth, 4% for the year. When you look at the third and fourth quarter split, the third quarter is a little bit below the 4%, fourth quarter is a bit above the 4%. We have to remember in the fourth quarter there is a lot of activities that will be happening around the brand transition in particular. So, we\u2019ll see a positive impact from that. We\u2019ll see some of it in the third quarter as well. But we\u2019ll see a bigger ramp, most likely in the early part of the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s just something to consider as you think about the performance. On the Craftsman side, yeah, we saw a significant impact of about 3 points related to the Craftsman rollout. And so, as you saw from the performance, in North America we had a very strong high-single digit retail performance across many of our key customers and not just related to Craftsman, certainly Craftsman was a significant part of that, but then we saw some negative performances in emerging markets. I mentioned the three countries that were contracting and we saw some positive performances in the European market. So, you know, overall, it\u2019s kind of kind of netted to a relatively small number, but we had some significant pockets of growth as you look at them. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open. Tim Wojs : Hey everybody. Good morning. Jim Loree : Good morning. Tim Wojs : Maybe just touching on Europe a little bit. You know, I think accelerating organic growth in that region is pretty impressive. So, I\u2019m just thinking you know, as you look over the next 12 months, just the sustainability of a mid single-digit type organic growth number in Europe and the programs that may be supporting that as some color. And then what do you think Europe on an underlying basis in Tool this is actually growing, thanks, the market? Jeff Ansell : So, I\u2019ll take that. And this is Jeff. We\u2019re quite optimistic for the remainder of the year in Europe. So, if you remember, we had a little more than 2% growth, organic growth in Europe in the first quarter, 5% here in the second, and we feel comfortable with that same type of growth rate in the back half, really driven by share gain. If you look at the results we\u2019re posting, where we\u2019ve been up somewhere between eight of ten and ten of ten in total markets for the last several years and that trend continues. So, the expansion and growth of DEWALT Stanley, brands like FACOM, etcetera in Europe have been extraordinarily positive. So, we feel very good about it and I think our intelligence would tell us that the European tool business has grown well less than half of that is what we think, probably less than 2% and we\u2019re probably going to end the year closer to five. So, we feel good about it. But again, it\u2019s probably more share gain than it is robust end market. Operator : And our next question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open. Justin Speer : Good morning, guys. Thank you. Jim Loree : Hey, Justin. Good morning. Justin Speer : Just the SG&A, I know you have the cost reduction program rolling through that $60 million I think per quarter on the $250 million program announced last year. That seems to be phasing well. But as you think about this program and some other programs that you may be unfurling for the balance of the year, SG&A and thinking about in the next year, is this permanent or should we think about some of these costs coming back next year if growth is better next year? Jim Loree : Yes. I would say that the vast majority of this is permanent change. You know, like any time you do a cost reduction program, you make decisions maybe to freeze merits and some other things that are definitely temporary, but those are modest, when you look at the total impact of $250 million. And so, as we think about margin resiliency initiatives going forward, those will be permitted, kind of process sustainable structural changes in how we do business to make us more efficient and effective in meeting the needs of our customers, and as we work with our vendors and other partners across the business. So, the margin resiliency initiative is really about sustainable permanent change. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning guys. Jim Loree : Hey, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just want to follow-up, Don, on your point on the 3Q versus 4Q phasing and you mentioned that price was part of it. And I know that there is probably a lot of little things that add up to that third quarter versus fourth quarter EPS growth rate, but if I remember last year, you know, the expectation for price in fourth quarter was pretty high, and then ultimately with promo activity and I think seasonally, just having a harder time getting price in the fourth quarter given the holiday, that ends up being kind of a long pie. Is there something different about how you\u2019re expecting to go through that process this year or something that you think has changed in the market from a pricing perspective? Don Allan : Yes. I would say, a part of what\u2019s happening in the fourth quarter is price, because we get a full quarter impact versus the third quarter, getting a partial impact. But the bigger impact of why our earnings are up or will be up in the fourth quarter is that the dollar volume for revenue is expected to be significantly higher than the third quarter, given that we have various brand transitions that we\u2019ll be executing on. We expect the industrial segment to perform at a higher level, given we had a very difficult fourth quarter last year and as they\u2019re anniversarying some of those headwinds. And then obviously we expect security to demonstrate some growth as well. So, it\u2019s all those different factors. But if you look at a 4.5% roughly organic growth performance in the fourth quarter, you\u2019re going to get to a sequential growth number in revenue that\u2019s close to $250 million to $270 million. And as that flows through to operating margin and eventually earnings, that\u2019s going to be a significant reason for the higher level of performance, combined with all the other little things that you mentioned, like price, margin resiliency, etcetera. The tailing off of commodity inflation that\u2019s going to happen more in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, it\u2019s all those different factors that are going to drive that. I think one of the things that I didn\u2019t mention, but I will mention now is that when you look at the operating margin dollars as a percentage of the full year, the percentage in the third quarter isn\u2019t dramatically different than the percentage in the third quarter of last year. And so, when you look at the OM dollar percentage to the full year by quarter, you look the first quarter was lower by about 2 points to 3 points, versus last year. The fourth quarter is going to be higher by 2 points or 3 points for the reasons I mentioned. But the two quarters in between are pretty much in line with last year\u2019s performance. When you look at that level, you can do the same thing at pre-tax, it\u2019s relatively the same thing. It\u2019s really when you get down EPS that you see a bigger deviation because of the tax rate. Operator : Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Deepa Raghavan : Good morning, all. Jim Loree : Good morning. Deepa Raghavan : Great quarter. Obviously, a lot of moving pieces within your guidance, can you talk through some of the items that positively surprised you in the quarter? It could be with your pricing initiatives, the cost actions, whether it was in markets or regions that surprised you favorably, or what also was unfavorable versus your prior thoughts? Relatively, are you seeing any incremental push-backs or demand impacts from this continued price increases that you are living in the market? Thank you. Don Allan : Okay. So I\u2019ll take the first part and then maybe I\u2019ll pass the second question over to Jeff around pricing, but the \u2013 as far as the quarter what things we saw that were a little bit different than expectation, emerging markets clearly was lower to some extent. We expected some slowness, especially in Argentina and Turkey, but Mexico was a bit of a surprise given the events that happened in the middle of the quarter around the threats of potential tariffs that seemed to slow the markets a little bit in the back half of the quarter. So that was certainly a little bit different than expectation. When I look at kind of the retail tools performance, I think we\u2019d say, it pretty much was in line with expectation. No real, unusual surprises there, either positive or negative in that regard. Jim Loree : Although I think the POS was a positive surprise. Jeff Ansell : Yes, the low down was kind of as expected. Don Allan : The low-double digit POS is always a positive, probably above expectations. So that\u2019s a fair point, Jim. But as far as our kind of revenue performance, there really wasn\u2019t anything that really stood out as unusual, but that\u2019s a great positive trend, as we think about execution in the back half of the year, especially the third quarter. And then industrial, slowing down a little bit, as we mentioned in the industrial tool business, was a little bit of difference versus expectations. However, we expected a lot of that slowness in our Industrial segment. Jeff, you want to take the price question? Jeff Ansell : Yes, maybe two things to add. When we talk about industrial within tools, the industrial construction part of our business which is the hardcore construction part of the business continue to perform really well. POS was great. Growth was great. When you get into heavy duty manufacturing industrial like the industrial storage business and some of those things, they were pressured. So we continue to win in every part of construction. It was more of the industrial manufacturing part that was pressured a bit in the quarter. In regards to price in POS, you know, we\u2019ve done everything we can to deal with the effects of price inside of our business, and then that has required us to pass on price to our customers as well because we \u2013 there is no way we could contain it all. But even as we\u2019ve done that in the last \u2013 in the year to date basis, we\u2019re up double-digit POS on a year-to-date basis, and that\u2019s from everything from outdoor, through cordless power tools, brands everything. So we feel like we\u2019ve done a really good job of managing price and volume to this point. The future, we will continue to stay really close to it, but we feel like we\u2019ve done a pretty good job with our customers of managing the volume price equation. And as a result, robust POS is driving growth for us and our customers. Don Allan : Yes. I think the other positive, even though it\u2019s not a huge positive versus our expectations, but the \u2013 you know, the fact that Europe has been able to continue to be very strong, even in the face of tremendous uncertainty over there. Everything every \u2013 almost every country, you look at, you see political, geopolitical turmoil and economic stress and just limited growth. And so, I think the kind of mid single-digit growth performance in Europe continue to sustain that and I think that bodes well as well as Jeff said for the second half in Europe. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Buckingham Research. Your line is open. Robert Barry : Hey guys, good morning. Jim Loree : Good morning. Robert Barry : Just a couple of quick follow-ups. I think you are expecting Tool\u2019s margins to be only very modestly up in 2Q and then much more meaningful in the back half, and it looks like 2Q ended up being more meaningful and now 3Q is going to be only pretty modest. So just curious what kind of drove the outperformance in 2Q or why that kind of shift is happening? And then just a quick follow-up on the Craftsman channel loading. When does that peak that contribution to growth? Thanks. Don Allan : Okay. I\u2019ll start with the margin question and pass the Craftsman question over to Jeff. Yes, we expected modest rate accretion in the second quarter for Tools & Storage. We ended up getting close to 80 bps of accretion in the second quarter. We still expect good accretion in the third quarter, not quite as much as 80 bps, but still a very healthy performance and then it gets even stronger in the fourth quarter. The second quarter really is just a factor of us being very focused on how we manage, as I mentioned in my comments, and we mentioned a fair several times over last year, really that balance between volume growth, pricing and making sure that we are focused both on organic growth and margin rate accretion performance. And I think the tools team did a great job managing that dynamic in the second quarter to get this type of performance. So a little bit of timing related to tariffs, where some of the tariffs shifted into the third quarter related to the new List 3 one going from 10% to 25%, that was a little bit of a positive that didn\u2019t impact us in Q2. Just given the timing of it, but beyond that, it was really just strong execution by the tools team. Jeff, do you want to take the Craftsman question? Jeff Ansell : Sure, Don. In regards to the question on Craftsman loading, I would say probably the loading itself anniversaries to a large degree in the fourth quarter. So if you look at the rollouts, we\u2019ve been rolling out Craftsman for \u2013 on an increasing basis over six quarters. So it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s the fourth quarter where it starts to anniversary most of the largest loads. At the same time, we stay really close to that POS and I think we\u2019ve said before and I\u2019ll say it again, the POS in Craftsman tend to be almost twice what it replaced in the categories that we\u2019ve added it. So even though we\u2019re anniversarying the loading, we still feel really good about the 3 points of incremental growth in our path to a $1 billion by 2021. So both of those things are \u2013 they\u2019re positive at this point. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Ken Zener : Good morning, gentlemen. Jim Loree : Good morning, Kenny. Ken Zener : Jeff, I wonder if you could comment, in the old days of Black & Decker, the outdoor power tool group had an effect on 2Q, obviously with your growing investment and insight into the outdoor power tool and given the very wet second quarter. Could you comment on any perhaps drag you saw there, but also \u2013 for whoever, how that might affect the execution of when you get a more, it\u2019s a great business, but it becomes more seasonal, how that kind of affects perhaps operations or how you\u2019d approach a very wet winter and how we should think about that going forward? Jeff Ansell : Well, our result in outdoor has been really good. So we\u2019re up mid single digits by 15% on a year-to-date basis. Some weeks 19%, and the best intelligence we have says the outdoor space would be up about a third of that. So that clearly represents share gain across Black & Decker, Craftsman and DEWALT. And I think the thing that\u2019s changed over the last 25 years, I\u2019ve been in the outdoor business is, we\u2019ve become a much more prevalent player for a longer part of the season. So while we historically participated in the spring part of the other season, we\u2019ve gotten far, far better at other categories where now that\u2019s elongated well into the fall and early winter, blowers and some of those things that we historically hadn\u2019t done. So the \u2013 if you think about it that way, we shipped those products in Q1, they sell in Q2, blowers and so forth happened in Q3, so outdoor has become \u2013 it\u2019s a seasonal business, but it\u2019s is now three quarters of our year versus what used to be one quarter of our year. And so all in all, I don\u2019t think the season hasn\u2019t impacted us. And I think the season in total was up a bit for \u2013 in the market, but ours was probably three times the market growth. But we feel good about that same prospect for the fall as well. We have really good promos and listings and so forth. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open. Michael Wood : Hi, good morning. Jim Loree : Good morning. Michael Wood : Can you give us any initial quantification of the 2020 carryover external headwinds from tariffs, FX commodities and potential offsets with the carryover from your cost actions. And you also called out less commodity inflation, just curious if you could pinpoint where you\u2019re seeing that and does that become a year-over-year tailwind by year-end? Jim Loree : Yes. So obviously, we will have a carry-over impact from the List 3 tariffs going from 10% to 25%. So we only have about a half-year impact of that this year. That\u2019s roughly $70 million of an impact in 2019. So you can expect that to be roughly the same in 2020. The commodity impact or deflation impact or lower inflation is probably $15 million to $20 million this year, most of that hitting the fourth quarter. So we would expect a little bit of a carryover impact from that. It\u2019s coming from things, certain steels and resins primarily that\u2019s driving it. But we\u2019re also seeing it in a couple of other categories. It\u2019s kind of spread across various different categories. No one big one driving all of it. So, if things stay where they are, we would expect a carry-over impact. It may be as reasonably close to the tariff impact at this stage. So hopefully they neutralize themselves at this as we look at it right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. Your line is open. Josh Wilson : Good morning. This is Josh filling in for Sam. Thanks for taking my question. Jim Loree : Good morning. Josh Wilson : I want to dig in to the incremental pricing. You maintained your organic growth guidance for the year, but it was lower volume expectations offset by some incremental pricing. Could you give us some more color on which segments and which geographies that incremental pricing is coming in and what gives you confidence that those markets will support those increases? Thank you. Don Allan : Well, I mean, we\u2019ve been as you know, we\u2019ve been getting price in the market for over a year now related to all these different headwinds and so some of these are going to start to anniversary themselves in the back half of the year. So, you\u2019ll have a full year impact. We will have new pricing actions related to the List 3 going excuse me, going from 10% to 25% in the back half of this year. We\u2019ve been running at about a two-point price impact. I would expect that probably would be somewhere between one point\u2019s, to two points in the back half of the year, given that we\u2019re starting to anniversary some of these things as likely being maybe closer to one versus two. So, the impact of price in our organic growth will be a little bit smaller than what we\u2019ve experienced in the first half of the year and then obviously the offsetting impact to get to 4% organic growth will be volume, which means it will be a little bit bigger versus what you just mentioned. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is open. Ross Gilardi : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Jim Loree : Good morning. Ross Gilardi : I was just wondering if I could throw in a question on the Security business. I was interested in your comments on improving trends in what parts of the business are you seeing strength. And then just more broadly and while you\u2019re clearly making a margin progress, you\u2019re still a long way from the mid-teens operating margin objective that you want for the business. How would you look at it next year, if you\u2019re still making positive progress, but you\u2019re still well short of your margin targets with respect to retaining or divesting the business? Don Allan : Well, the retaining or divesting of the business question is a question that we promised to answer a year, two years from a year ago in May. And right now, we\u2019re not speculating on all these different aspects of and scenarios what-ifs, and so on. What we\u2019re focused on is margin improvement and organic growth and transformation of the business model to make it a more relevant business model and a more defensible business model for the 2020s. And regardless of whether we elect to keep it or divest it, either way, the value that we\u2019re creating by focusing on this is substantial and that\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about it right now. We don\u2019t want to distract ourselves with having to evaluate what\u2019s the right time to divest should we divest or what\u2019s the right divestiture approach if we choose to do that. I mean there\u2019s a lot of complexities associated with those questions which we\u2019ll answer at the appropriate time. But for now, we\u2019re focused on margin improvement, which we\u2019ve accomplished at the beginnings of now and we\u2019re and it\u2019s mostly in the electronic business. I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s across the board in the electronic business where we\u2019re focused on margin improvement and now we\u2019re moving now that we have that going, we\u2019re moving to an extreme focus on driving the value proposition and the go-to-market feet on the street, selling the applications that we\u2019ve developed. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Shannon thanks. We\u2019d like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have further questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for joining. Have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, later we will conduct the question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon and good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's third Quarter 2019 Conference Call. On the call, in addition to myself is Jim Loree President and CEO, Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO, and Jeff Ansell Executive Vice President and President of Global Tools & Storage. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 11 :00 AM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim. Don and Jeff will review our third quarter 2019 results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking to just one question per caller and as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call, such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree. Jim Loree : Okay. Thanks, Dennis, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. As you saw from this morning's release, we delivered a strong third quarter successfully overcoming $90 million of currency and tariff related pressures as well as weak end markets conditions in some industrial and emerging markets. Fortunately, the US construction in DIY markets continue to be supportive. With the help of our growth catalyst we once again achieved above market organic revenue growth and at the same time protected our earnings base. Revenues were $3.6 billion, up 4% with organic growth of 4% and acquisitions, adding three points. That solid organic and inorganic growth was partially offset by a 2% decline from currency and a point from divestitures. Tools and storage achieved strong 5% organic growth with craftsman, new product introductions and e-commerce contributing. North American retail POS continued at strong double-digit levels with the second week of October, marking the 22nd consecutive week in double-digit territory. Industrial total revenues grew 13% with a 16.0 contribution from the IES attachments acquisition. The IES integration and targeted cost synergies remain on track, segment organic volume was down modestly 2% as global light vehicle production continues to be in deep contraction and general industrial markets are on a slowing trend across the globe. Currency also shaved a point off the Industrial revenue line. Security made progress on its value creation plan reaching an important milestone in 3Q with the generation of positive organic growth. Our investment in digital talent, the rapid commercialization of new technology-based solutions and our activities in the small and medium business segment are starting to gain momentum. Electronic security achieved mid-teens order rates during the quarter and is now working to convert a strong backlog into future revenue. We are confident that there is a significant value creation opportunity on the horizon as we execute this transformation. In this regard, we reiterate our commitment to update investors on our security portfolio review, no later than the first half of 2020. For the overall company, we delivered 2%, adjusted EPS expansion and a consistent operating margin rate versus prior year. 2% EPS expansion are seemingly modest accomplishment but impressive when taken in the context of $90 million of external headwinds. It was our pricing, cost control and margin resiliency actions that enabled us to overcome an escalating tariff regime, persistent dollar strength and the unfavorable impact of which grew by $15 million as the quarter proceeded. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter and the year 2020, our view now assumes a continuation of the current demand environment across our markets, as well as some carryover tariff and currency related headwinds into 2020. We continue to swiftly respond to the volatile external environment with price recovery, supply chain adjustments and acceleration of our margin resiliency initiative. It's a testament to the strength of our team in our enterprise that we have produced above market organic growth and a 9% CAGAR, EPS expansion over the past three years, while simultaneously absorbing $900 million and commodity tariff and currency related cost inflation. To preserve our ability to deliver continued earnings and cash flow growth in 2020 and beyond, we are taking new cost reduction measures that will result in approximately $200 million of annualized savings. This is in addition to the previously announced margin resiliency actions which will also contribute materially to 2020. When taken in combination with our robust growth pipeline, these cost/margin actions position us for a solid 2020 setup for EPS and cash flow. So with that and with our balance sheet in great shape after deleveraging this year, we are ready to tackle whatever market conditions come our way in 2020 and beyond. Here are some specifics, which will continue to drive growth as we look ahead. The craftsman brand roll out continues to be a fantastic story by the end of the year, we will have grown craftsman into a $600 million business, net of cannibalization just three years following the acquisition that is $500 million of pure organic growth. The craftsman program includes several top tier retail partners and by year-end 2020 we will have over 10,000 retail outlets with $1 billion of revenue by 2021, six years ahead of our original plans. It's also clear that our innovation machine is stronger than ever. FlexVolt is now nearing $400 million in annual revenue and continues its double-digit growth trajectory. Our latest breakthrough innovations DEWALT Atomic and Xtreme power tools offer the highest power to weight ratio is available in the market, this time in the compact and subcompact segments. These two product lines are quickly adding hundreds of millions of dollars of growth and the positive end user reception demonstrates that these products are going to be winners in the marketplace. E-commerce is also a powerful growth driver in our emerging markets and developed markets. We are the industry leader by a wide margin with $1 billion in global revenue growing consistently at double-digit levels and then there are the revenue synergies from our recent acquisitions. We're well on our way to broaden our distribution of the Irwin and Lenox brands around the world and by next year we expect to generate a cumulative $100 to $150 million in revenue synergies. Additionally, we are exploiting the revenue potential from the IES attachments and Nelson Fastener's acquisitions. And then finally with our MTD partnership, our teams are now working together on multiple opportunities to generate operational efficiency and revenue growth. With this relationship we've gain entry into the $20 billion lawn and garden market in a financially prudent way and beginning in July 2021 we have the option to purchase the remaining 80% of the business with the potential to add approximately $3 billion of revenue at an all-in EBITDA multiple in the range of 7 to 8 times. These programs position us for a strong multi-year revenue growth and share gain outlook. However, we are not singularly focused on growth. To support margin expansion and create a buffer for future external volatility, we're making progress with our margin resiliency program. This is a major transformational initiative, which will provide $300 million to $500 million of cumulative operating margin benefit by 2022. Most of the benefit derives from systematically applying digital technologies such as AI, machine learning, advanced analytics, robotics, and connected factors among others to create value across our entire enterprise. So as you can see, there is a lot to be excited about as we look ahead, as we make cost structure adjustments in the near term, we continue to feed the commercial and innovation machine that has created this powerful growth story. So, thank you and now, I'll turn it over to Don Allan who will walk you through more detail on segment performance, overall financial results and guidance. Don? Don Allan : Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the third quarter. Tools & Storage delivered 4% revenue growth with a strong 5% organic growth, offset by one point currency. Volume growth contributed four points and price delivered one point of growth. The operating margin rate was 16.6% flat versus the third quarter of 2018 as benefits of volume leverage, pricing and cost control for offset by the impacts from currency and tariffs, which totaled approximately $90 million of the entire company. However, 95% of that impact was in Tools & Storage. Share gains were experienced across each Tools & Storage region and SBU . Looking at the geographies, North America was up 7% organically. US retail has strong momentum and delivered low double-digit growth in the quarter. The US commercial channels posted low single-digit growth while the industrial tools & Storage business was down mid-single digits due to the ongoing customer inventory corrections we've been experiencing . And then the automotive repair channel had growth of low single digits. The strong quarter in North America was fueled by our growth catalyst, namely the craftsman brand roll out and an ongoing stream of Nucor and breakthrough innovations such as DeWalt, FlexVolt, Atomic and Xtreme. The shipments were supported by continued strong sell-through, as evidenced by the double-digit POS growth in North American retail. The growth catalysts have been a steady source of outperformance, which has helped us to navigate slower growth and in the industrial and emerging markets. Now moving on to Europe. Europe delivered 4% organic growth in the quarter. This was led by the UK, the Nordics, Central Europe, Greece and Iberia more than offsetting some softer markets including Germany and France. Overall, the team continues to gain share leveraging new product innovations and commercial actions to produce above market organic growth. This will be the sixth year in a row that our European team has demonstrated mid-single or high-digit organic growth. A truly outstanding performance by that team. Finally, emerging markets declined 1%, the ongoing benefits from price, new product launches and e-commerce expansion were more than offset by market contractions in Mexico, Turkey and China. We continue to see share gains across the region with Brazil, Chile, India, Taiwan and Korea posting mid to high single-digit growth. And then Russia, delivering double-digit growth in the quarter. The emerging markets team continues to contend with currency volatility and is delivering pricing actions to protect our margins and leveraging our growth catalyst to deliver share gains. Now looking at the tools and storage SBUs, power tools and equipment delivered 6% organic growth benefiting from commercial execution and new product introductions. We are benefiting from the strong craftsman performance as well as expanding our leading DEWALT power tool system with new innovations. Our trio breakthrough innovations FlexVolt, Atomic and Xtreme deliver on key user needs for more power with smaller formats. They clearly are generating share gains for us and our customers. Moving to a hand tools, accessories and storage, we delivered 5% organic growth driven by new product introductions and the ongoing craftsman rollout. Our national big box partner is now fully set across all locations with the successful launch of 1200 new craftsman products. The broader rollout for our e-commerce, and other retail partners is well underway. Sell through remains strong and we continue to convert new users, which will represent significant share gain opportunities as we head into 2020. So in summary, another excellent quarter for Tools & Storage, this team continues to act with agility to react to the changes in the external environment while positioning the business for future growth and margin expansion. Looking at the Industrial segment, the segment delivered 30% total revenue growth with the IES attachments acquisition contributing 16 points, partially offset by a volume decline of 2% and a 1.0 headwind from currency. Operating margin rate declined year-over-year to 15% as productivity gains and cost control were more than offset by the impact from lower engineered fastening volume and the externally driven cost inflation we experienced. Engineered fastening organic revenues were down 4% as fastener share gains were offset by inventory reductions and lower production levels within the automotive and industrial customers. The market environment for this business remains challenged with underlying automotive production declining for the fifth consecutive quarter and our industrial markets are showing signs of inventory reductions and slowing trends. Despite this though our auto fastener business showed positive organic growth in the quarter demonstrating 300 basis points of content penetration gains relative to the underlying market. The systems business within automotive which is capex driven as we know showed low double-digit decline and despite gaining share the industrial fasteners business was down in the mid-single digits. The infrastructure business delivered 4% organic growth due to stronger onshore pipeline project and inspection activity in oil and gas. This is partially offset by lower hydraulic tools volumes, which was impacted by a difficult scrap steel market. And then finally, as Jim mentioned the IES business and the related integration continues to hit all key expectations. So as we turn to Security this segment delivered organic growth of 1% in the third quarter. North America was up 3% organically driven by higher volumes within healthcare, automatic doors and electronic security. Europe was down 1% organically, a strong growth in France was offset by continued adverse market conditions in the Nordics and the UK. In terms of profitability, the segment operating margin rate was 10.9%, down 20 basis points versus the prior year as organic growth and cost containment were offset by a 50 basis point impact from the Sargent & Greenleaf divestiture as well as investments to support the business transformation and commercial electronic security . The modest growth achieved in the quarter was another encouraging step as a security team begins delivering on the targeted investments we've made in digital, commercial talent and field technicians. These talent investments support the commercialization of new technology enabled solutions focused on delivering customer insights through data analytics and in app-based solution for our small to medium enterprise customers. The forward-looking indicators remain positive as we continue to see mid-teens year-over-year improvements in orders and backlog. We are optimistic the team can continue to build upon their early wins to deliver consistent organic growth going forward. So now let's turn to guidance, looking at page 7, we are revising our 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance to 835 up to 845 from our previous range of 850 to 870. This new EPS guidance represents an increase of approximately 3% versus prior year at the midpoint while overcoming close to $450 million in external headwinds from commodity inflation, currency and tariffs. On a GAAP basis, we expect an earnings per share range of 650 to 660 compared to our prior range of 750 to 770. In addition to the items impacting Core guidance the changes primarily attributed to an additional 150 million of restructuring charges associated with the cost reduction program announced today. Now let's dive into a little more detail in our 2019 adjusted EPS outlook. You can see on the left hand side of the chart. We estimate an incremental 55 million in external headwinds related to tariffs and foreign exchange since providing guidance in late July. This additional impact is evenly split between currency and tariffs. The tariff related headwind now includes the estimated impacts from list for China tariffs at 15%. Additionally, we are modestly reducing our expectation for organic growth, which reflects a slower growth environment, we have been experiences when in our industrial channels and emerging markets. Our plan now calls for an above market 3.5% to 4% organic growth as we continue to leverage our strong pipeline of organic growth catalysts and a choppy market growth environment. Partially offsetting these headwinds are incremental benefits from the margin resiliency initiatives, incremental cost actions and a lower tax rate, which is now expected to approximate 16.5%. Moving to free cash flow guidance as we look at the third quarter, free cash flow was $96 million which brings our year-to-date performance to a use of cash of $21 million which is 266 million better than the prior year. The year-to-date improvement versus 2018 is primarily related to higher net income, lower capex and reduced levels of working capital. We remain confident that we will deliver strong cash flow generation for the year, utilizing our core SFS processes and principles combined with reducing working capital levels in line with normal seasonal activity. Therefore, we are reiterating our commitment to deliver a free cash flow conversion rate of approximately 85% to 90%. So if we turn to the segment outlook on the right side of the page, we'll start with tools and storage with assumptions call for mid-single digit organic growth and a relatively flat to positive margin rate year-over-year. The team will continue to leverage price cost actions margin resiliency and of course volume to offset the external headwinds and deliver operating profit growth. We expect the fourth quarter to demonstrate margin rate expansion as we continue to take additional actions to offset the incremental impacts from currencies and tariffs. In the Industrial segment, we continue to expect a low single digit organic decline reflecting the slower market growth, we've been experiencing across our general industrial and automotive end markets. Total growth is expected to be positive, including the contributions from our acquisitions. Operating margins are expected to be down year-over-year driven by lower volume and their share of the impact from these external headwinds. And then finally in our Security segment, we expect positive organic growth and operating margin rate and dollar expansion year-over-year as the team remains focused on realizing the benefits from our transformation strategy. So as you start to think about the set up for 2020, I would like to provide you some insights. As Jim indicated earlier, we are taking cost actions to help counteract the carryover effect of currency and likely tariff headwinds, as well as softness in the industrial and emerging markets. The actions to adjust our cost base have commenced. And we are implementing a cost reduction program expected to deliver $200 million in annual cost savings. The cost savings will come from head count actions across the company as well as executing some footprint rationalization opportunities. As we approach this cost reduction we were focused on ensuring our commercial and innovation organizations have ample resources to continue growing above market and look toward areas where we can rationalize leadership structures or organizations to serve the businesses more efficiently. In some cases this accelerating existing organizational efficiency and plant footprint rationalization plans capture within the margin resiliency program. However, even with these cost actions announced today, we firmly believe we can achieve additional margin resiliency benefits in 2020 to ensure we are prepared for any potential new headwinds. This $200 million cost reduction program is a proactive response, which will allow our businesses to demonstrate a solid level of margin growth in 2020. So we don't want the likely carryover headwinds presumed previously mentioned an expected higher tax rate next year of approximately three points, we feel we have positioned the company for continued adjusted EPS and free cash flow growth next year. So in summary, for the whole company we expect 3.5% to 4% organic growth for 2019, low single-digit EPS expansion which is overcoming $445 million of commodity, currency and tariff related headwinds. These headwinds equates almost $2.50 of earnings per share. The organization remains focused on executing our playbook to generate above market growth, optimize our global supply chain, adjust our cost structure through the actions announced today and generate significant value with our margin resiliency program, which will ensure the business remains well positioned to deliver sustained above market organic growth and earnings expansion in 2020 and beyond. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jeff to provide some additional color on tools & Storage, Jeff? Jeff Ansell : Well, thank you, Don. Our Global Tools & Storage delivered strong performance in Q3 led by strength across North American retail in Europe, we've just completed the rollout of our impressive craftsman range across hardware, wholesale, home center and e-commerce channels. The tremendous growth and share gain we are experiencing with craftsman is accretive to our growth, which is accretive to the market. The end-user reviewed an endorsement of our more than 2,500 craftsman products is unprecedented. We have extraordinarily high confidence in our ability to deliver 1 billion by 2021. We also see the opportunity to expand across industrial and automotive channels into the future. Our DEWALT business continues to be robust, delivering double-digit growth led by strength across our flexible franchise as we continue to advance across commercial applications as well as outdoor solutions. New product launches across DEWALT, Atomic and Extreme ranges in 20 volt and 12 volt applications respectively offer the user best in world power to weight performance and has been immediately endorsed by users across the globe. Finally, our expansion of Stanley and Stanley FatMax will exceed 100 products this year and continues to serve as a share gain enabler consistent with our ambitious expectations. In summary, tremendous new product development across craftsman, DEWALT and Stanley has enabled growth and share gain throughout 2019 along with momentum carrying into 2020. Now I will turn it back to Jim to wrap today's presentation. Jim Loree : Thanks, Jeff and great product story. In summary for the company, we delivered a solid 3Q with 4% organic growth, $2.13 earnings per share overcoming $90 million in currency and tariff headwinds. This continues to require execution of price optimization, cost control and margin resiliency in response to the external cost pressures, which for 2019 are now $125 million higher than our January guidance. Nonetheless, we will deliver in 2019 a respectable financial performance with 3.5% to 4% organic growth and year-over-year EPS expansion. As we close out the year we remain focused on day-to-day execution and operational excellence. This includes continuing to leverage our organic growth catalysts realizing the initial benefits from our margin resiliency program successfully integrating our recent acquisitions and generating strong free cash flow, our proactive $200 million cost reduction program announced today will supplement these activities, providing us with the capability to perform and whatever environment we encounter in 2020. Dennis , we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis Lange : Great. Thanks, Jim. Shannon we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks, good morning. As always, I just wanted to kind of dig into the $20 million cost reduction program, a bit deeper than we maybe expected and I know you've been so dancing around this your preserving growth investments and making sure you don't harm growth potential, but equally wanted to reduce cost as well. I'm just wondering what this tells us about how you view the world in 2020, how you preserving the growth investments and maybe addressing the any overlap between the margin resiliency program and what you're forecasting for 2020? Jim Loree : Okay. It's Jim. I'll tackle this one Nigel. I have done comment on the overlap, as it relates to the numbers. First of all, the size of the program is a compromise between what the art of the possible and how much growth we want, or how much cost, we wanted to take out like any cost reduction program and we were fortunate for a couple of reasons. Number one, we've had a few structural ideas percolating for a while here that have enabled us to combine a few organizations and drive more enterprise efficiencies. So in areas, for instance like emerging markets and the Global Tools & Storage business [indiscernible] we segregated them about six years ago in order for us to focus more on the emerging markets provide more focused effort on the emerging markets, especially in the growth area. Now a couple of things have happened. First of all, the emerging markets have become more volatile and there's less growth in the near term there and so we have also established an infrastructure in the emerging markets, which is really solid now and the focus has produced that and so now we can combine that with the other assets of the Global Tools & Storage business leveraging those assets across the entire globe. So I think that's a, that's a big one. The other one is in the industrial segment we ran those three different enterprises separately and now we're going to run them on a combined basis. So those two structural changes have created a pretty significant opportunity for cost reduction. And then there's just several functions that we are taking a more enterprise approach too, so for instance, just pick one communications and also marketing. Those two are now being done on a much more of an enterprise basis and that has resulted in pretty significant cost reduction. So those are a couple of the elements. Another one is that for a long time we haven't really looked at spans and layers across the organization and we had been doing that in connection with the margin resiliency initiative and as it turned out, there were a couple of pockets in the organization where we had grown more layers and the spans were lower than optimal. And so we've been able to take action in those areas and I think that's a very positive change because it creates agility, even more agility for the organization. So. with that, I'll turn it over to Don to talk about how much of the margin resiliency is overlap and how much of the 300 to 500 is consumed by the 200. Don Allan : Yes. So we expected that many of you folks would have this question. And when you think about some of the things that Jim was describing, several of them are actually new concepts that we had within the organizational efficiency pillar of margin resiliency. So if you think about the $200 million, I think probably the simplest way to think about it, it is probably about a third of $60 million to $70 million is really things that we pulled forward that we were contemplating as part of margin resiliency. And then the remainder of it is really just looking across the entire enterprise and for areas of efficiency, plant rationalization decisions, etcetera. So the way I step back from it and look at this is the $300 million to $500 million as Jim reviewed earlier in the presentation as we think about that going forward into 2020 and beyond. I still feel very confident that we can achieve the $300 million to $500 million above and beyond what we're talking about even with maybe 60 million to 70 million of that being consumed because I just think the opportunity is very significant and we've dedicated a full-time team of people we're putting one of our senior leaders in charge of it, full-time, starting at the beginning of January. Steve Roderick who presented at the Investor Day on the topic. And so we are dedicating resources in the sense of people, resources in the sense of technology investments, and then we also brought in certain consulting resources on a minimal basis as well to ensure that we hit this objective over the next three to four years . But my confidence level actually goes up as each month goes by, given the amount of effort and focus we have on in the opportunity that we see. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open. Tim Wojs : I guess maybe just thinking about Craftsman $600 million kind of ending the year and the target for $1 billion in 2021, I guess, how should we think about the phasing of that incremental $400 million over the next couple of years and then you know what's the opportunity if the crossing is beyond the $1 billion as you look out even further beyond '21? Don Allan : Yes, I will take the question. It's planned at this point. So as Jim indicated, we've added $500 million of organic growth since acquiring the craftsman brands putting us at about $600 million this year, we have high level of confidence that we can grow that to about $800 million by the close of next year to a $1 billion to close the following year to put us very much on track to the billion dollars objective we set. And we still have opportunity beyond that, from new product development and category expansion within the existing base, but then also as I intimated earlier, opportunities for that craftsman brand in the industrial and automotive space, which is placed that it had a kind of builders reputation over the last 90 years. So we have very high confidence on that attainment plan of $200 million of over a year for the next two years to reach $1 billion and growth beyond that clearly so, high level of confidence and endorsement of the craftsman growth plan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Deepa Raghavan : Good morning, Jim And Don. I have a margin question, I apologize it has a couple of parts to it, but I guess I could use some clarity. First, how the 2/3 of the $200 million in new cost action different from the margin resiliency measures, i.e. do those do those costs come back once the environment improves, that's one part of it. The second part is, can you talk about your updated thoughts on that $300 million to $500 million in cost actions, is that range so sufficient given weakening backdrop or a kind of majority of those cost actions that are saved be pulled forward well before 2022 if macros weaken further here or should we think about that, as you know, there is a gestation period or staggering period to these cost actions and they just cannot be pulled forward before 2022? Thanks. Jim Loree : Yes, I will. As I mentioned, in response to Nigel's question, of the $200 million. Yes, about a third of it, we basically what we've done is we've, we've accelerated some margin resiliency initiatives and Jim gave some good examples of what those were when he responded to a portion of that question, such as emerging markets and core tools coming back together, combining our three industrial businesses and running them as one platform, et cetera. So those were pulled forward as an acceleration. But what I also said was that I felt confident even with that pull forward that we still can achieve $300 million to $500 million of margin resiliency starting next year and beyond in addition to that and so we don't feel like we've done anything here that significantly changes our view on that $300 million to $500 million and that will commence in a significant way starting next year, as a way for us to build contingency against new potential headwinds. And I've said publicly before that we think that's about $100 million , $150 million per year, starting next year and then we'll have a subsequent a few years after that to achieve the number that I just or the range that I've just described. I think that's the best way to think about it. We have not done anything to minimize the potential impact of that $300 million to $500 million, which means if you add those two things together, we think the opportunity is a little bit bigger now.' Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just a clarification around if we think about the overall external headwinds into next year. Was that the 150 million or is that at the slightly different numbers you see it today versus the full five this year and when we're thinking about the total scale of the cost reduction plans, the stuff in May and what you've announced today are those scaled with a view to still being able to hit maybe the low end of the medium-term EPS growth guidance that had laid out back in May, or is that very much still a question and we'll revisit when you guide formally for next year? Jeff Ansell : Yes. So as it relates to the headwinds as we go into next year, if you just look at what the headwinds that are in place today, which would be list one through three and then list four A, the carryover effect of that is about $100 million and then if the second list for it happens in December, which is list four B, which would be the remainder of items that come from China, they have not, do not have a tariff on it today that would be another $25 million of carryover impact, so the total of those two would $125 million assuming that second list four happens. FX carryover right now looks to be about $30 million to $40 million of an impact next year so in total, we're somewhere in the 155 to 165 carryover impact of all those items. It does not, that does not encompass if there is an increase to any of the tariffs going like there was things being discussed of going from 25% to 30%, if that occurred on list one through three that would be another $55 million so you're getting to a number of around 210 to 215 roughly at that point in time. And so we think we've taken enough actions at this stage related to the $200 million to offset what is known but we've also put a little bit of cushioning there for the likely or possible increase in some of these tariffs as we think about that going into 2020. On the second part of the question , I think at this stage, we feel like we position ourselves to grow our EPS and as we close out in the fourth quarter and we give guidance in January, we'll give more specifics and details but with these headwinds I just described and a tax headwind year-over-year as I mentioned in the presentation, we still see a path to demonstrate as Jim said solid EPS growth. Jim Loree : I would also note that this is a little bit different than in the past, because in the past we've historically, last couple of years anyway we've averaged about 40% price recovery on these tariffs. What we've done here is we've covered the entirety of the tariffs with cost actions and the question would be, what's the market outlook next year, is it going to trend negatively or is it not. So what we're really trying to do with margin resiliency plus also covering 100% of the of the tariff exposure with cost actions is to make sure that we have a very significant cushion in the event that the economy takes a turn for the worse, we're not predicting that, we don't see it. We see it in industrial and we see it in some of the emerging markets and so on, but we don't see it in the core of our business, which is the North American retail and with Europe, we see a little slower, but still not terribly negative on the construction in DIY side. So I think it's a very prudent way to go into the year. I think we're set up really nicely and we'll see where we go from here Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Michael Rehaut : Thanks, good morning everyone. First question I just wanted to get appreciate all the detail. And I guess just a couple of the remaining pieces of the puzzle, at least, people are trying to do some of the math around 2020, you hit on the carryover from tariffs, the difference there as in FX. I was just curious, at this point in time, if you had a sense about raw materials and we've had other companies starting to talk about it being a slight tailwind next year, how 2019 is shaping up from a raw material standpoint and if we just froze today in time how that might flow into 2020 and also on the margin, I'm sorry, on the cost-cutting initiatives the cost reduction initiatives into the $200 million, should we be expecting that to fully be realized in 2020 or maybe even partially be realized in the fourth quarter and the bulk remaining in 2020 just a sense of timing on that ? Don Allan : Yes, sure. So as it relates to commodity inflation as we sent back in the July earnings call, we expected a little bit of moderation of that in the fourth quarter of this year, we're still expecting that is still baked into our guidance assumption as it was in July, not a significant number, but we are seeing a little bit of positive trend there. We're still trying to finalize expectations for next year related to commodity inflation, but at this stage trends are good in certain areas, other areas are not as positive. But overall, we think we still would see some level of deflation probably modest deflation at this stage, but we still have a lot of work to do over the next two to three months, to really nail that down, because we also do see it as an opportunity as we go into 2020 to see if we can achieve some deflation in that particular area, which is just another area that allows us to build contingency, as we think about some of the any new headwinds or as Jim mentioned, the more difficult to market that might evolve. At the end, the second part of the question, which was related to what Dennis, what was the second part -- much cost savings have been in the next, low cost savings. Yes, the vast majority of the $200 million is next year. It's a very small impact here in the fourth quarter. And so I would factor in the $200 million hitting in 2020. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks, good morning guys. Can I just get a, just a clarification on the tariff so the impact to this year it doesn't seem like it's really changed much from what you guys said intra-quarter, but then if I look at the List 1 to 3 tariff that were supposed to increase on October 15 that seemed to have gotten delayed and so is that, is the increase embedded in your 4Q guide or is the delay embedded in your 4Q guides, just some clarification around that would be helpful? Dennis Lange : Well, the increase that happened in the third quarter is embedded in our guide related to List 4A, the change from not going to 30%, which was kind of the relief that was given a few weeks ago where List 1 through 3 was going to go from 25% to 30% that is not factored into our guidance. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley, your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning guys. Just on the cost saving side. Don. Is there anything else besides the initiatives you guys have announced today that blends into next year. Obviously there's a lot going on in 2019 that you've been working on all year but any carryover from that? Don Allan : From the cost actions, specifically I guess you're referring to other cost actions we've done Josh is probably [indiscernible]. So I assume that's where you're talking about other cost actions that we've taken throughout the year. Yes, there's a little bit of carryover effect related to some of the margin resiliency initiatives we've done, but I wouldn't say that's anything significant. It's probably in the $10 to $15 million range. It's not something very significant. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, thanks, good morning guys. So I guess maybe just one clarification on restructurings, of the 200 million savings. Just thinking about how the cadence spreads over 2020 since some of this is like plant rationalization, which to me seems to take a little bit longer than the more basic headcount reduction stuff and then one question that isn't around tariffs so restructuring you guys still have conviction in Tools & Storage margins returning to positive territory in 4Q. If you could talk about like the drivers of that conviction since we just haven't seen that play out. So far year-to-date.? Don Allan : Yes. So and if you start with your first question, I would say that the cadence by quarter next year, but it's $200 million benefits will be pretty even. About $50 million per quarter because of the vast majority, a large part of that will be completed by the end of we're going into the beginning of the first quarter. There will be some planned things that are a little bit delayed, but frankly, the magnitude of that is not going to change that cadence dramatically. As far as the Tools margin rates. I mean actually we had a great second quarter where our margin rate was up 80 basis points versus the prior year, the third quarter was flat versus the prior year and now we expect the fourth quarter to be up, as I mentioned and so, actually we did turn the corner on that in the second quarter, the first quarter was down significantly, because that was really the biggest quarter of headwinds, just looking at an individual quarter for this year but that trend has changed in the second quarter in a big way. We saw some new headwinds emerge in the third quarter that didn't allow us to grow the rate, but it was flat year-over-year and then the fourth quarter we will able to grow as because now we're able to take some, some more actions in response to the new headwinds that allow us to do that and then you combine it with the fact that the rate was pretty low last year given the 4th quarter would was say with some pretty significant headwinds as they started in the third, fourth quarter of last year as they went into the first quarter. Jeff Ansell : Yes, my remarks, I mentioned that from our January guidance through presence. We've had $125 million of evolving growing headwinds during the year. I think for us to drive that margin story and most of those were in Tools. So for us to be able to perform at that margin rates that we have under the circumstances I think there has been a fairly impressive story in the face of pretty significant adversity. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open. Justin Speer : Thank you, guys, I appreciate your time. Just a couple of questions rolled up and one is just where in the P&L will these initiatives, the $200 million initiative show both on the consolidated basis, but also the segment basis. And you had I think a $250 million of cost cuts last year, another $200 million that rolled into this year and another $200 million next year and then you also talk about the $300 million to $500 million, I'd like to kind of maybe parse out where that falls, where you think that's going to shine in the margin structure. And then lastly if tariffs are removed, how do you think your margins respond in that scenario and a good case scenario that we find resolution? Thank you. Don Allan : Yes, I would say that the cost actions are across the entire company every business has participated the corporate functions that participated. So the impact of them will be spread across all those different categories based on the magnitude of spend, so you can probably easily do the math, given the level of SG&A that we have in each business and at corporate and just kind of apply that percentage against the total SG&A for the company and that's pretty much what it's going to do for next year, as we think about the $300 million to $500 million going forward that again will benefit every business, I mean I think the magnitude from a dollar perspective will be larger in Tools & Storage just because it's a much bigger business and the opportunities around NextGen procurement industry and those types of things will definitely hit that business in a bigger way. And so at the end of the day, there could be a little bit more heavy weighting to Tools given that some of those things are really more specific to our Tools business in the manufacturing footprint that they have or the procurement processes and organization they have, but now I don't think it's a dramatic shift. I think you can look at that and probably recognize that every piece of the company is going to feel the benefits of that over the next three to four years, and I want to answer the best part of your question which is, what if they go away. While the reality is we don't expect them to go away and -- that's you love to talk about . I don't often get is an opportunity to discuss so really enjoy it, but the total tariff impact I think built in at this point is $425 million annualized and as I mentioned earlier, we've been recovering there's through price about 40% of historically anyway of the tariff impact. So I think the really good news is, if the tariffs are removed, yes, the customers are going to want some money back and we probably want to give it back at least some of it, because the price elasticity of the end products and end markets but in reality there's a pretty significant chunk of tariff impact headwind that would not be given back or at least we have the flexibility to do what we want with it, and frankly, it would be nice to see that drop through to the margin line. So, yes, thank you for the questions. In the fourth just to clarify, the 425 would assume all of this four happens and List 1 to 3 gets another 5% on it, so that we're going to be that the scenario that I laid out, were all these things went in a negative way it would be 425 on an annualized basis; based on what we know today, the number would be 345. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Ken Zener : Good morning, everybody. I understand your actions are attempting to address all of the inflation through your own actions not through the market pricing. I'm wondering could you, obviously it's a more conservative approach, but what does it, tell us perhaps about consumer elasticity or the retailers' willingness so far to accept more price increases and/or how your competitors are getting impacted as these tariffs impact product that's fully assembled. Thank you. Don Allan : Yes, I mean obviously we can't get into a detailed discussion of competitive dynamics we have our General Counsel is sitting at the end of the table here looking at us, but we would never do that; however, I will say that that 40% that we've recovered, we were unfairly, in my opinion, hit with tariffs on componentry for products that we made in the United States, which is pretty significant for us relative to competition and up until List 4 our competitors were not feeling that same impact. So we were in a position for a while until List 4 came about, that we were competitively disadvantaged now with List 4, it changes the playing field and at least levels that you could even argue, it's somewhat in our favor now, so I think what happened over time was that the competitors did some pricing actions, probably not to the extent that we did. And so it's interesting when you look at the volume performance of Stanley Black & Decker vis-a-vis the competitors were doing pretty well. So I haven't studied economics since college but I would say that we have, I think through our value propositions in some of the products that Jeff Ansell talked about whether it's Craftsman, whether it's Xtreme, FlexVolt, Atomic or Stanley FatMax. I mean, I think all of these product actions in addition to a lot of our commercial excellence activities and our scale and our global reach, et cetera, have enabled us to gain share and to avoid the elasticity trap of some of the, what we otherwise would have experience. So it's a real testament to the strength of our value proposition and our commercial execution that we've been able to put numbers on the board in organic growth at the level we have been. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from [indiscernible]. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning and thank you. It's -- just on the faster side, obviously the entire industrial economy has a little bit of excess inventory probably trade war-related. Is that sort of excess inventory correction done in next year, you get a chance to ride up and down with the markets or is there a little bit more and then relatedly I don't suppose there is excess inventory in the big box channel but just a sort of checking on that question if that's any kind of a risk? Thanks. Don Allan : Let me take the industrial piece now then will hand over to Jeff on the big box side. So on the industrial side. I wouldn't call it excess inventory. I would call it a combination of the manufacturing markets are slowing. And so, you're seeing a little bit of an impact of that and then you're just seeing what I would call more normal inventory corrections that occur at this stage of a slowdown and so we've seen a slowdown start in the second quarter and continue to the third quarter, likely will continue for at least a portion of the fourth quarter. And so what we're just seeing is our customers really just focused on tightening their inventory levels, but I wouldn't have described it as excess inventory before. Jeff? Jeff Ansell : Regarding the second part of the question, the POS that Jim and Don had referenced, it has been incredibly positive all year and accelerated over the last 22 weeks, but it's the, the double digit POS that we have achieved year-to-date and continues as we speak, has been in balance with inventory, so we don't see any excess inventory and aggregate across the home center channel and POS continues to be a really robust story for us across all the brands we've referenced. So all in all things are already getting really well and share gain continues to be in our favor. Operator : Thank you, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2019 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker\u2019s fourth quarter and full-year 2019 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, Executive Vice President and President of Global Tools & Storage. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning\u2019s call will also be available beginning at 11 :00 AM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim, Don and Jeff will review our fourth quarter and full-year 2019 results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we\u2019re going to be sticking with one question per caller and as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may or may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It\u2019s therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree. Jim Loree : Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in this morning\u2019s press release, we successfully closed out the year with an in line 4Q performance. Quarterly revenue was up 2% to $3.7 billion, with organic growth of 2% amidst a mixed global macro. Our total company adjusted operating margin rate was 13.6%, up 30 basis points year-over-year, and adjusted EPS for the quarter was $2.18, up 3%. Full-year revenues were $14.4 billion, up 3%, with a solid 3% organic growth performance. Our operating margin rate was quite resilient at 13.5%, just 10 basis points under last year, despite absorbing $445 million of external pre-tax headwinds from tariffs, FX and the like, a significant portion of which were not and could not have been anticipated at the beginning of the year. Adjusted EPS for the year was $8.40, a 3% increase versus 2018, a notable accomplishment under the circumstances. And finally, we were thrilled to deliver $1.1 billion of free cash flow for a conversion rate of 113% and a CFROI of 14%. Working Capital turns improved to 9.8 turns, up a whole turn versus prior year. And this strong cash performance helped us support our growing dividend and enabled us to finish up the year with the balance sheet and great shape with a debt-to-EBITDA of approximately 2.0 times, while absorbing $900 million of capital allocation to M&A in 2019. And in this regard, we closed on two previously announced transactions. And during 2019, first, our 20% minority partnership with MTD provides a path to enter the $20 billion-plus outdoor power equipment market with an industry leader in a financially prudent way. Beginning in July 2021, we have an option to purchase the remaining 80% of MTD, with the potential to add approximately $3 billion of revenue at an all-in EBITDA multiple in the range of seven to eight times. This option remains in place for 10 years, giving us maximum flexibility to enter the market in an appropriate time of our choice. We also closed on the acquisition of IES Attachments, a leading provider of off-highway specialized attachments for prime moving equipment, doing business under the Paladin and Pengo brand names. This transaction almost triples the size of our infrastructure business unit, while further diversifying our presence in the industrial markets. The business features high profitability, good growth, and it\u2019s heavily weighted to the aftermarket, which represents approximately 60% of revenues. In addition, today, we announced that we have reached an agreement to acquire Consolidated Aerospace Manufacturing, or CAM, which gives us an exciting platform for growth in the aerospace components and fasteners market. And I\u2019ll provide a bit more color on that in just a moment. Another highlight from 2019 was the progress made by our Security business. 4Q was a significant step forward in the turnaround as we generated our best security organic growth and recollection at 4%. With all major regions and businesses contributing, North America electronic security was up 10%, a very encouraging indication of the power of our new business model. Security also demonstrated its ability to accrete its operating margin rate, which was up 20 basis points for the year. And so we appear to be at an inflection point, with increasing positive momentum in organic growth and a stable operating margin rate poised for accretion in 2020. And as for the future of Security in our portfolio, we look forward to providing you with a midyear update, as promised. However, we are confident in the value we are creating through this transformation, regardless of whether we choose to retain or to monetize the assets at some point. So looking back at 2019, a lot of progress was made against a volatile uncertain backdrop of tariffs and other external headwinds. Despite the $445 million of pressures, we more than help serve with our financial performance. We continue to execute on our growth catalysts, including Flexvolt, Craftsman, e-commerce, DEWALT, Atomic and Xtreme and acquisitions. We continue to enthusiastically embrace the growing importance of ESG and multiple stakeholder capitalism, recognizing the power of purpose-driven performance and the importance of diversity and inclusion to the success of the corporation. Our 60,000 employees, our Board members and the many business partners in our ecosystem gave it their all and we emerged well-positioned to tackle the challenges and opportunities of the 2020s. And I want to personally thank each and every one of them for their contributions. Our performance this year was no small accomplishment and I\u2019m very appreciative. And with that said, I want to move to another developments that we announced today. As indicated in our release, today, we\u2019re sharing plans for a leadership succession in our Tools & Storage business. And after 20 years with the company, Jeff Ansell has made a personal decision to step back from his responsibilities as President of Tools & Storage and take a less intensive role in our organization. And we\u2019re pleased that we are able to share a seamless transition plan today, with Jaime Ramirez as currently Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Tools & Storage, assuming leadership responsibility for the entire unit over the course of the first-half of 2020. Jeff has been an incredible colleague, teammate and leader of Tools & Storage for 15 years now. In fact, over the last two decades, few have contributed more to the growth and success of this company than Jeff. He was integral to the historic Stanley and Black & Decker integration that created enormous growth for the company. And during his tenure, leading tools, that unit grew from a $600 million revenue hand tool business to a $10.1 billion industry leader. His passion for customers, brands, products and innovation is truly remarkable. And even with that track record and all those accomplishments, we were supportive when Jeff approached us about his interest in making this change. We are grateful for as many years of dedication and high-performance, but also completely respect his desire to spend more time on personal and family endeavors. Further, we appreciate his willingness to remain a major contributor to the company\u2019s success in the coming years. So effective July 1, he will transition his current operating responsibilities to Jaime and will assume the leadership of a major and exciting organic growth program, involving the revitalization of the Black & Decker brand. He will continue in this role through the end of 2021, and at that point, will stay on as a strategic advisor to the company through the end of 2023. And as I mentioned, Jaime will assume full leadership of the business by midyear. He\u2019s a 27-year veteran of Stanley Black & Decker, cutting his teeth in the emerging markets, the agility, adaptability and drive to win necessary to succeed in those high-growth volatile markets will serve him well. And in addition to his strong and proven execution skills, Jaime is a champion of innovation, technology and digital transformation with a socially responsible approach. We are confident that he is the right leader to take Tools & Storage into the future and he will bring that transformative focus, along with his passion for the business to the role. And many of you have met Jaime before, and we look forward to you spending more time with him in the months ahead and the years to come. And so on behalf of the Board and our entire management team, I want to extend our heartfelt appreciation to Jeff for all his contributions and the impact in leading our Tools business to become the largest, most innovative and most trusted tools franchise in the world. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff to make a few remarks. Jeffery Ansell : Jim, thank you for the kind words. It is a tremendous pride that after more than a quarter of a century in this company and a decade and a half leading the Tools business, I share with you my decision to transition my responsibilities. 15 years ago, I set out to establish our Tool business as the biggest and best in the world. That mission has more than been accomplished. At this point, I want to share more time with my wife and children, as they so willingly shared me all these years. This transition allows me to do just that and at the same time, remain professionally connected to the company that I love through 2023. A great deal has been accomplished in the past 15 years by the Tools & Storage team in Maine. And while I\u2019m in transition, the team that remains has delivered incredible results, including increasing the size and profitability of the Tools business by more than 17 times, making us the world\u2019s largest Tool company, developing over 10,000 new products and growing our flagship brand to their largest sizes in history, including Stanley Black & Decker, Irwin, Lenox, Craftsman and DEWALT. I lead the Tools business in excellent care. The management team is the absolute best in our industry and have known and worked alongside Jaime Ramirez for more than a decade. His long tenure and successful track record in this wonderful company have prepared him well for this role. Our strength in every major geography in the world and our unparalleled stable of brands, combined with our robust pipeline of innovation, as well as pervasive faith in Jim, Don and our entire management team, instill tremendous confidence in me that this organization\u2019s best days are ahead. I will always be indebted to our customers and employees for making all this possible. And with this, I turn the call back to Jim. Jim Loree : Thank you, Jeff. It\u2019s been a great journey and not over yet. And before I turn it over to Don Allan, I just wanted to cover a little more detail on CAM. Growing and diversifying our industrial business through M&A is a priority for the company and a key element of our strategic capital deployment. Our vision presented at our 2019 Investor Day is to create a $3 billion to $4 billion global industrial platform that is made of highly engineered application-based solutions. We are looking for businesses that have the attributes you see on the left side of this slide, strong engineering capabilities with technology that has industry-leading, customer recognized and trusted brands, and a recurring revenue component or heavily weighted aftermarket element. Additionally, we want businesses that are global and scale, can differentiate through innovation and operate in strong end markets and have the potential for robust growth over the long-term. Consistent with this strategy, we are very excited about today\u2019s announcement of the CAM acquisition. CAM is a leading manufacturer of specialty fasteners & components for the aerospace & defense end market. This acquisition is an ideal bolt-on to our existing Engineered Fastening business and further adds to our industrial portfolio in a new high-growth, high-margin market. The transaction is valued at up to $1.5 billion, with $200 million held back and contingent upon the 737 MAX receiving timely FAA authorization to return to service and Boeing achieving certain production levels. When adjusted for approximately $185 million net present value of expected cash tax benefits, the net transaction value is approximately $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. CAM has LTM revenues of approximately $375 million and attractive profitability characteristics. This business has strong brands, a proven business model, deep customer relationships and an experienced management team, which will create a pathway for profitable growth and value creation. Given the favorable characteristics of the asset, the five \u2013 year five cash flow returns are within our 12% to 15% target, and is expected to add $0.30 to $0.40 of EPS accretion by year three. This acquisition of CAM also gives us a platform asset in aerospace to add on future bolt-on acquisitions. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and we\u2019re excited to welcome CAM and its 1,600 employees to the Stanley Black & Decker family as soon as possible and are ready to get work \u2013 to get to work on the integration and synergy plan once closed. And as you take a step back to look at what we\u2019ve accomplished in industrial over the past three years, it is notable that the acquisitions of Nelson, IES Attachments and CAM, aligned closely with our strategy and have increased our exposure to new end markets, while diversifying our industrial portfolio beyond automotive OEM. These three high-quality assets in the aggregate represent approximately $1 billion in revenue and $2.6 billion in strategic capital allocation. Each carry strong prospects for revenue and profit growth, as well as compelling cash flow returns and EPS accretion. And now I will turn it over to Don Allan to cover the fourth quarter and our 2020 guidance. Donald Allan : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I would also like to express my gratitude to Jeff Ansell and let him know how much I enjoyed working with you for over 20 years. We work together to drive our company forward operationally. I will miss having you in those moments going forward, but I\u2019m so excited for you and the next stage of your SPD journey. Thank you, Jeff, for being an amazing leader through this wonderful transformation of Tools & Storage. Now I\u2019ll take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the fourth quarter. Tools & Storage delivered 1% total revenue growth, with 2% organic growth and a 1 point headwind from currency. Price was modestly positive in the quarter, but slightly below our expectation. As we saw, our promotional mix increase in North America, which partially offset the continued pricing benefits we are receiving across the global business. The operating margin rate for the segment was 16.5%, up 110 basis points versus prior year. The benefits of significant margin resiliency actions taken, volume and price were partially offset by tariff and currency headwinds, as well as unfavorable product mix and plant under absorption related to significant inventory reductions. Total tariff and currency headwinds amounted to approximately $85 million for the entire company, with 95% impacting Tools & Storage. The unfavorable product mix was caused by reduced levels of hand tools, accessories and storage revenue versus the prior year, which of course has higher levels of profitability, combined with the increased promotional activities in the power tools SBU. We took the opportunity within the quarter to begin to normalize our inventory levels following the completion of the Craftsman roll out and other various brand transitions we have been executing across the marketplace. This effort resulted in a very strong cash flow performance, but the lower production volumes created a non-recurring P&L headwind that we were able to overcome. These last two areas of operational pressures, combined with lower-than-expected volumes, emerged during the quarter and drove a negative impact on our segment operating margin. However, we were mostly able to offset that with significant margin resiliency action. On a geographic basis, North America was up 3% organically. U.S. retail continue to see strong momentum with mid single-digit growth in the quarter. The U.S. commercial channel posted low single-digit growth, while the industrial focused product lines and automotive repair channel were both down high single digits. We believe there was some ongoing customer inventory corrections that occurred during the quarter, which constricted our shipment growth in this particular area. This is the second consecutive full quarter we have experienced this negative impact in the channel. North America\u2019s growth continue to be fueled by our brand roll outs, including Craftsman and new product innovations, such as the DEWALT Flexvolt, Atomic and Xtreme. The sell-through continued to be robust across North American retail, with the fourth quarter once again delivering double-digit POS, resulting in a double-digit performance for the full-year as well. It is rewarding to see these growth catalyst generating such a positive response from our end users and delivering such a strong performance once again. Europe delivered 3% organic growth in the quarter, with seven out of the 10 markets growing organically. This performance was led by the UK, France, Central Europe, Greece and Iberia, which more than offset weaker markets in Italy and the Nordics. The team once again leveraged our strong portfolio of new products and commercial actions to produce above market organic growth. Finally, emerging markets declined 3% organically. Weaker market conditions within Latin America more than offset the benefits from price, new product launches, and e-commerce expansion. The Latin American market pressure was most acute in Chile, Mexico and Central America, which in some cases, you are seeing the political environment or social disruption, beginning to impact the business confidence and the underlying GDP. We saw strong performances in Brazil, India and China, which posted mid single-digit growth, while Russia, Turkey and Korea, all posted strong double-digit growth. Now let\u2019s take a look at the Tools & Storage SBUs. Our tools and equipment delivered 6% organic growth, benefiting from strong commercial execution and new product introductions. User response to our new innovations within Flexvolt, Atomic and Xtreme has been very positive and continues to translate into share gains for us and our customers. Hand Tools, Accessories & Storage declined 3%, as new product introductions are more than offset by the aforementioned customer inventory corrections and the shift to more promotional items such as power tools. In addition, the Craftsman comps are getting more difficult, and this will cause a temporary pressure to organic growth for a few quarters. In summary, a strong quarter and incredibly successful year for Tools & Storage, generating mid single-digit organic growth and an OM rate expansion, despite taking out most of the $445 million of externally-driven cost headwinds that came our way in 2019. An incredibly impressive performance by the team, which continues to be resilient and act with agility to position the business for future growth and margin expansion in 2020 and beyond. Turning to Industrial. This segment delivered 9% total revenue growth, which included 13 points of growth from the IES acquisition, partially offset by a 4 point decline in volume. Operating margin rate increased 40 basis points year-over-year to 13.6%, as productivity gains and cost control more than offset the impact from lower volume and externally-driven cost inflation. Our Engineered Fastening revenues were flat organically, as higher system shipments and faster penetration gains were offset by inventory reductions and lower production levels within industrial and automotive customers. Our industrial end markets remain challenge due to ongoing inventory reductions and slowing trends across these particular areas. However, despite underlying automotive production declining for a sixth consecutive quarter, our auto fastener business continue to benefit from penetration gains, outgrowing global production by 410 basis points. The infrastructure business has declined 17% organically, as volumes were impacted by challenging oil and gas pipeline and scrap steel markets. Now let\u2019s turn to Security. I\u2019m pleased to report we delivered 4% organic growth, marking the second consecutive quarter of positive organic growth. North America was up 7% organically, driven by increased installations within commercial electronic security and higher volumes in healthcare and automatic doors, a very impressive performance in North America. Europe hosted 1% organic growth, led by France and Sweden, which were partially offset by continued market weakness in the UK. In terms of profitability, the segment operating margin rate was 11.2%, down 80 basis points versus the prior year, as organic growth and cost containment were more than offset by the impact from the Sargent & Greenleaf divestiture and investments to support organic growth. The investments are significant and we\u2019ll begin to pay dividends in 2020, as the 2019 revenue impact was modest, but building momentum. Without the impact of these two items, Security would have experienced significant margin rate expansion. It was encouraging to see security organic growth accelerate in the fourth quarter and we expect the top line momentum to continue into 2020. The business will look to balance organic growth and OM rate expansion on a consistent basis, as we leverage our targeted investments in commercial electronic security. We feel the business is well-positioned for success, which is low single-digit organic growth with consistent operating margin dollar and rates expansion. Let\u2019s take a look at our free cash flow performance on the next page. As you can see, our free cash flow for the full-year was excellent, as we generated approximately $1.1 billion in 2019, up $312 million year-over-year, and the free cash flow conversion of 113% of our net income. The improvement was due to higher cash from operations, driven by our working capital improvements, as well as modestly lower capital expenditures. As it relates to working capital, we delivered 9.8 working capital turns, up one turn year-over-year. As I mentioned earlier, we made the decision in the fourth quarter to reduce inventory levels within our Tools & Storage business, as the heavy lifting from our brand transitions are complete. As we look ahead, we still see opportunities to improve working capital back about 10 turns in the coming years. We are very pleased with this result. As many of you know, we have been very focused on getting our annual free cash flow back above $1 billion. And now that we\u2019ve completed these significant brand transitions, we were able to complete \u2013 achieve that objective in 2019. So let\u2019s move to the 2020 guidance on Slide 8. We are expecting an adjusted earnings per share range of $8.80 to $9, up approximately 6% versus prior year at the midpoint. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $8.05 to $8.35, inclusive of various one-time charges related to restructuring, M&A costs, as well as the Security business transformation and key margin resiliency initiative. As a reminder, this guidance does not include the impact of the CAM acquisition. In addition, we expect the free cash flow conversion will approximate 90% to 100% in 2020. So let\u2019s turn to some of the drivers of core EPS growth, as you see on the left-hand side of the chart. We expect approximately 3% organic growth, which will generate $0.40 to $0.50 of EPS accretion. The actions associated with our cost reduction program announced in October are broadly complete and expected to deliver approximately $0.95 of EPS. These items will be partially offset by $0.60 to $0.70 of carryover tariff and currency headwinds. Finally, below OM, we expect a net $0.25 EPS headwind year-over-year. This includes a tax rate of approximately 18%, which is up 2 points year-over-year and certain benefits experienced in 2019 will not repeat at the same levels in 2020. Additionally, we are seeing about $0.05 from net headwind, which includes share pressure related to previous financing activities, partially offset by favorable interest expense. Just to clarify our tariff assumption. We are assuming the benefit within our guidance from the recently announced trade deal. So this means, list four A is at 7.5% beginning in the middle of February and list one, two, three remain in place at 25% rate. This result \u2013 resulted in a net benefit of about $0.10 in our guidance, which includes a reduction in our tariff expectation, as well as lower-than-expected pricing benefits. As it relates to pricing, we have benefits built into the plan across all of our businesses. But since the tariff environment has deescalated from \u2013 for the time being, much of the new 2020 pricing, we achieve will be generated by exact executing margin resiliency actions. So let\u2019s turn to margin resiliency. We are now in full execution mode and expect to generate $300 million to $500 million of cumulative benefits from this program over the next three years. As a reminder, the margin resiliency program is generating accelerated productivity by applying technology to our manufacturing and procurement process \u2013 processes, as well as our back office. This was developed as a response to the dynamic nature of the external operating environment, which we now view as our new reality. As such, we are leveraging the program as additional contingency to offset any incremental headwinds or market dislocations that may come away throughout the year. Should the external environment stabilize, or in the event we start to see some tailwinds, we will leverage this program as an opportunity to outperform our guidance or reinvest into our businesses. I would now like to review our expectation for the next quarter. We expect first quarter\u2019s earnings to be approximately 14% of the full-year performance, which is about 300 basis points lower than last year. The first factor driving this lower percentage of full-year delivery is that, we expect a little more than half of the $115 million of full-year external headwinds to impact the first quarter. Next, we\u2019ll anticipate organic growth to be relatively flat in the first quarter. We are planning for the global industrial environment to continue to be choppy, and we are facing more difficult times in Tools due to the Craftsman roll out. While we expect Craftsman to still deliver about 2 points of growth within the Tools & Storage segment in 2020, the first quarter discreetly is one of the toughest comparisons for the load-in, which started to intensify in the first quarter of 2019. These two factors represent approximately two-thirds of the reduced first quarter contribution, resulting in a relatively consistent operating margin rate and dollars versus last year. The remaining one-third of the first quarter difference is related to higher-than-expected tax rate and the impact from consolidating MTD\u2019s full winter season. Now, we\u2019re going to turn to the segment outlook on the right-side of the page. Organic growth for the Tools & Storage is expected to be at mid single digits in 2020. There are multiple catalysts supporting growth, including core innovation, benefits from our breakthroughs, such as Flexvolt, Atomic and Xtreme, e-commerce and the continued contribution from the brand transitions with Craftsman, Stanley and Stanley FatMax. Margin rates are expected to be positive year-over-year, as we realized the benefits from volume, our cost actions and productivity, which will more than offset the carryover impact from the external headwinds. In the Industrial segment, we expect a relatively flat to modestly negative organic performance. This outlook reflects the current slow market conditions within the automotive and industrial end markets, as well as the oil and gas pipeline and attachment tool markets. Our expectation is that the front-half will continue to carry similar market pressures as what we saw in the back-half of 2019. Once we get to the second-half, we do see the opportunity for better performance and potentially modest growth as the comp sees. Operating margins in the segment are expected to be positive year-over-year, as productivity and cost actions are partially offset by modest tariffs and currency headwinds. Finally, in the Security segment, we are expecting organic growth to be up low single digits in 2020. With the investments we have made over the past year, the team has positioned the business for a more consistent top line performance. This is expected to translate into improved operating margins year-over-year, as we leverage volume and deliver on our focused initiatives to lower our costs to serve. One last matter as it relates to guidance. With the recent virus outbreak in China, we are anticipating some questions as it relates to our manufacturing footprint. First, our major facilities and suppliers are not located in the affected area. Our largest tools and engineering fastening facilities are located in the broader Shanghai area. We also have plants that are in mainland China adjacent to Hong Kong and Macau, as well as the plant along the eastern coast. We are staying close to the situation and the team is working through contingencies for manufacturing and for our supply base. With what we know thus far about the one week extended shutdown for Chinese New Year, we feel this is an impact that has contemplated in our guidance. Of course, this is a very dynamic situation and our teams will react and respond as conditions change and we will update you as we know more throughout the quarter. So in summary, for our total company, we expect a 3% organic growth, 5% to 7% adjusted EPS expansion, inclusive of a 2 point tax headwind. A solid result in a balanced view that focuses on delivering margin expansion by realizing the benefits of our cost actions and generating volume leverage to successfully overcome the carryover impact from tariffs and currency. We believe we are taking the appropriate actions to position the company for success in 2020. The organization is focused on leveraging organic growth catalyst, executing margin resiliencing \u2013 resiliency, generating strong free cash flow and successfully integrating the CAM and IES acquisitions. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Jim to close out with a summary of our prepared remarks. Jim Loree : Thanks, Don. One last look at 2019. It was a successful year considering the environment. The performance was possible due to the agility, passion and dedication of our workforce and I thank our people for their commitment. It\u2019s their extraordinary dedication, passion, teamwork and sheer will to win that makes this company so special. Our teams acted with speed and determination, while facing into $445 million currency commodity and tariff headwinds, as well as very dynamic end markets. We delivered 3% total revenue growth, including 3% organic growth, and our OM rate remains strong at 13.5% and adjusted EPS expanded by 3%. In a really positive note, free cash flow was $1.1 billion, with very strong conversion and a CFROI consistent with our long-term financial objectives. And as we turned to 2020, our leadership team will act with agility, leveraging our proven ever-evolving operating system to successfully navigate the underlying external environment. And additionally, we\u2019re continuing to execute on our margin resiliency initiative $300 million to $500 million over several years to get our margins back on an upward trajectory, despite whatever headwinds might appear on the horizon. We\u2019re looking forward to another successful year in 2020, continuing to achieve our vision to deliver strong financial performance, become known as one of the world\u2019s great innovative companies and elevate our commitment to corporate social responsibility. We are ready for the 2020s, and now we are ready for Q&A. Dennis? Dennis Lange : Great. Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Brett Linzey : Hi, good morning. This is Brett Linzey in for Jeff. Hey, just want to come back to the incremental revenue opportunity. I think, you said 2 points contribution from Craftsman. But if we include some of the other key programs, Flexvolt, Atomic, Xtreme with Craftsman, what are you contemplating in the guide in terms of incremental growth from those programs? Thanks. Jim Loree : Yes. I would say that, the 2 points from Craftsman, obviously, I stated in my prepared remarks, we expect mid single-digit performance for the overall business on a global basis. You\u2019ll have \u2013 the other share gains that we will achieve above market GDP, which is probably in the high ones, if you look at our global mix anywhere from 1.8% to 2%. And so, any other share gains that we gain along there will add to that, and then we do have some pressures, as I mentioned, in emerging markets that we expect to continue in the first-half and then some of the industrial tool channels as well. In the first-half, there will be a bit of a drag on that, but those are the main categories. So I would expect share gains, some of those innovations, Craftsman, market growth of close to 2 and then you\u2019re going to have some drag in the areas that I mentioned that kind of gets you to that mid single-digit number. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Jason Makishi : Hi. This is Jason Makishi on for Julian. Just a question around the first quarter guidance, particularly around the margin rate. I think last year, there was about a $40 million to $50 million inventory charge taken as a result of commodity cycles and the Tools business. Is there a reason why despite that, theoretically being a non-repeat in Q1 2020, the operating margin rate is going to stay sort of flat year-on-year? Can we get a little bit more color as to what the offsets are? And then maybe just any guidance around what the total commodity headwinds plus tailwind is for the full-year? Jim Loree : Yes. So the first quarter, I mean, as I mentioned in my comments, we do have an incremental tariff and currency headwind of the annual number is about $115 million, that\u2019s about \u2013 half of that\u2019s going to hit in the first quarter. So that\u2019s clearly of the magnitude of very similar to the number you mentioned related to the item in the first quarter of 2018. So, that\u2019s a significant drag that we\u2019re seeing. So you had a one-time now that last year that goes away, but then you had this particular issue that comes in. The \u2013 if you look at the split for the full-year, I said under $115 million of headwinds, the tariff numbers, $80 million to $90 million, and then the rest is currency. Commodities, at this point, we expect to be neutral. But, of course, that\u2019s an opportunity as we go throughout the year to see if we get a little bit of deflation as the year goes on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open. Tim Wojs : Yes. Hey, guys. Good morning. Jim Loree : Good morning Donald Allan : Good morning. Tim Wojs : I had a two-part question, if I could. So I guess, the first just the guide for Q1 implies acceleration through the year in Tools and some more meaningful margin improvement through the year. So I guess, what\u2019s your line of sight to both of those within the Tools segment? And then the other side of this is just Jim, you talked about Black & Decker revitalization. I was hoping you could give us just a little color on what exactly that means? Jim Loree : Don, you take the first part. Yes. So we really respect and appreciate you so much. We\u2019re actually going to take your two-part question, even though it\u2019s really two questions. Don? Donald Allan : I think it\u2019s very cool how you addressed that, Tim, two-part question, it\u2019s actually one question. Yes, so the cadence for Tools is that, we expect, in the first quarter, kind of relatively flat, maybe down slightly for organic growth, but I feel like it\u2019ll be close to relatively flat. And then as we go throughout the year, there\u2019s this comp issue that we\u2019re dealing within the \u2013 in the first quarter for Craftsman is quite significant. It\u2019s almost 3 points in the quarter. And so when you factor that in and you factor in some of the slower markets, I mentioned in emerging markets and industrial, it\u2019s kind of how you get to that number. That\u2019s going to start to regulate in Q2, and it obviously going to get to the back-half. You don\u2019t have those types of pressures you\u2019re dealing with year-over-year. And we expect nice growth from the program of Craftsman for the full-year, as I mentioned, 2 points. And I will remind everybody, the POS continues to be very strong for Craftsman. And it\u2019s double digits \u2013 that has been double digits throughout 2019, and we expect to continue to be strong as we go through 2020 and the success of this roll out will help us drive that type of performance. And then we expect some of these markets to get a little better in the back-half and that\u2019s probably the right way to think about the cadence. Jim Loree : And on the revitalization of the Black & Decker brand, this is an opportunity that has been in front of us for a long time and it\u2019s taken a lot of thought and preparation and we\u2019ve had so many other priorities in revitalizing brands that it was a little bit lower on the list. But it truly is a remarkable brand, one of the great consumer brands in the world. And it\u2019s an opportunity to unlock some great value from this asset. And Jeff, as you know, is the mastermind behind the Craftsman revitalization and execution of that, and now he tackles this Black & Decker project and he\u2019s actually worked and done a fair amount of work on this already, has a fair amount of definition for what it is. But how much of that he and we want to share right now is not very much, because there\u2019s always the element of confidentiality and to some extent, surprise when it comes to these sort of things. And \u2013 but I will turn it over to Jeff and you can tell him then whatever you\u2019d like to disclose at this point in time with recognizing that, it won\u2019t be too much. Jeffery Ansell : So well, to add on to what Jim said, I guess, the genesis of this was that, Black & Decker in any survey, any study you do is like iconic, remains iconic from an aided and unaided awareness perspective. And we looked at the progress across our tremendous stable of brands these past 10 years, and I\u2019ll give you a rough ranges. But we had growth like 70% in the Stanley brand, 9% and 10% with Lenox and Irwin, since we acquired it, over 250% in DEWALT and 500% in Craftsman. we love those numbers. We\u2019re really excited. It\u2019s fueled that growth. Black & Decker is also at the biggest \u2013 the largest size in history, but it\u2019s only been up about 3% in that timeframe. So we look at it as a really opportunity cost. We could do so much with that brand. We haven\u2019t had the time to do it. I now have the opportunity to do just that, and we\u2019re excited about what can happen in the next few years here. So you can see, we\u2019re not disclosing a whole lot right now other than it\u2019s a big opportunity. But more to come on that, you\u2019ll see it over the coming quarters should have some impact by next year and really material impact beyond that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. Jim Loree : Good morning. Donald Allan : Good morning. Nicole DeBlase : My question is around free cash conversion. If you guys could talk a little bit about the differences between the low and the high-end of the guidance for 2020. And I guess, what\u2019s the scope to get to a 100%-plus conversion sustainably from here? Donald Allan : Sure. Yes, I would say that for 2020, that range of 10% of 90% to 100% is really dependent on probably primarily two factors. One would be working capital. We did end the year at close to 10 turns. And so we will continue to drive improvement in that number. But to get a positive impact in your free cash flow related to working capital, you need at least a half to 0.07 [ph] of a turn improvement for the whole company to make that happen. So we might get close to that, but it might actually be closer to neutral than a positive impact from working. And then CapEx will be something that continues to be between 3% to 3.5% of our revenue. But we also know that it\u2019ll probably at the higher-end of that range in 2020, as we start to work through some of these China supply chain mitigation strategies as we move production to other countries in certain cases, as well as we will be building our Craftsman plant in Fort Worth, Texas as well, and there\u2019ll be a fair amount of costs in 2020 related to that. So those are really the two factors that kind of result in that variation. Our goal is clearly to get to a 100% or more and always is, but we occasionally on an annual basis will manage that to achieve these other strategic objectives. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Jim Loree : Good morning, Mike. Michael Rehaut : First question, I guess first and only question I have is on \u2013 just kind of parsing out the 2020 guidance a little bit more. Specifically, just wanted to revisit the margin resiliency initiatives, you referred to it in the prepared remarks is something that you expect to continue to materialize. And just wanted to get a sense of how you\u2019re thinking about that flowing through and the timing of that benefit flowing through in 2020, if you\u2019re still thinking about the $100 million to $150 million type of benefit for the year and how it would hit the P&L? And then just as a slight clarification, the $200 million cost reduction, I\u2019m coming to that being about $1.05 in EPS benefit, I just didn\u2019t know if my math is off, if there was something different between that and the $0.95? Donald Allan : Yes. The last part of your question is really just kind of timing of that particular \u2013 as we know certain things, certain parts of the world, you can\u2019t do it as quickly as you\u2019d like. So you have a little bit of an impact to that. That\u2019s why it\u2019s about $0.10 different than what you\u2019re calculating for your math. But that obviously will carryover into 2021. Our margin resiliency, I\u2019m glad you asked that question. The \u2013 if you remember from the October earnings call, when we gave you some initial thoughts about 2020, we were really had the objective of trying to position the company with an EPS growth that was reasonable, given the headwinds that we were going to experience or as a carryover into 2020. And I think we\u2019ve done that with the guidance today at 6% midpoint. But we also wanted the margin resiliency to get about $100 million to $150 million of value in 2020, but we wanted that to be more of a contingency. And I mentioned that in my comments earlier, and that\u2019s really the plan. So it\u2019s not baked into our guidance right now. It\u2019s there for, if other headwinds come our way that we have to deal with, like this virus and China as example might be a little bit of a headwind for a period of time. Currency might be a headwind that emerges or it doesn\u2019t emerge, these headwinds don\u2019t happen. And there\u2019s an opportunity for us to outperform, and as I mentioned, reinvest in the business. The cadence by quarter is relatively consistent. It\u2019s not going to be backend loaded in a big way. So, I would expect you can be pretty close to evenly split, maybe 40% in the first-half, 60% in the back-half. Jim Loree : And if I could just add. When we look \u2013 we look at the environment that we\u2019re in over the last three years, the external headwinds have averaged about $300 million a year. And if you look at the five years preceding the 2017 to 2019, which is \u2013 would be the last three years, we look at the previous five years, they averaged $135 million a year. So we had a step function change in headwinds and most of those headwinds at the beginning of the year are a significant proportion of them were \u2013 it was impossible to plan for them. And so I think we\u2019re sitting here at this juncture with the potential that we could have headwinds of hundreds of millions of dollars like we had over the past few years. And obviously, we have some of that in the plan or not, or something less. And so, it\u2019s only prudent to reserve a pretty significant contingency for the potential that we could have really, really significant headwind similar to we\u2019ve had over the last three years. And so that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re thinking about it. And if they don\u2019t come, then we have a fantastic opportunity to outperform our earnings, as well as reinvest in the company \u2013 in the company\u2019s growth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Deepa Raghavan : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jim Loree : Good morning. Donald Allan : Good morning. Deepa Raghavan : Okay. Question is on capital deployment. It\u2019s a good start, especially purchasing some different exposure with CAM. But, Don, what \u2013 how should we think about deployment pace, the pace of deployment going forward, given the $1.5 billion cash deal takes up much of the excess cash availability over the year, even as you\u2019re deleveraging. Any thoughts there? And thank you. Jim Loree : I\u2019m going to tackle that question, because Don has had so many questions about guidance, so I want to give him a break. But also, we both think about capital deployment quite a bit and we happen to agree on our approach. And so, as most of you know, our long-term capital deployment strategy is to allocate 50% of our excess capital to M&A and 50% to giving back to the shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases. And over the last 20 years, you will find \u2013 if you calculate that, you will find that it actually turns out to be 50%, 50-50. And so we\u2019ve been true to that and we will continue to be true to that, because we think that for this company, that is the best value creation strategy for the long-term. And so, we shouldn\u2019t look at these things necessarily in isolation. But from a tactical point of view, we were at 2.0 debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the year. This will take us up to 2.66 for a period of time until we work it down again. So, there won\u2019t be a lot of M&A activity \u2013 of significant M&A activity this year, unless something really significant comes along. And then we we look at what are the options and going forward, we have the Security business, which is a potential asset to monetize, if something really down the fairway came along our way. We also have the MTD option in front of us, but we have 10 years to execute that. So there\u2019s no pressing need to have a \u2013 probably about $2 billion of \u2013 when we finally implement or execute that option, it would be about $2 billion if we did it in the 2021, 2022 timeframe. So I think, we\u2019re in a great position from a tactical point of view, too. We have the opportunity to create excess capital if we see something really great that we want to execute on in terms of M&A. We also have the opportunity to kind of take 2020 as sort of rebuild the balance sheet year back to where we want it to be for the dry powder and we\u2019ll go from there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open. Justin Speer : Thanks, guys. Just wanted to just follow-up on the comments on the promotional cadence and channel inventories, you mentioned them being full for at least a portion of the Tools & Storage business. You mentioned promotions being a little bit more elevated in parts of the Power Tool business. Just wanted to get a sense for what\u2019s going on there? And thinking about the incremental tariffs, incremental pricing if these elements are going to make it really difficult to get incremental pricing to at least partially offset the the carryover tariffs and currency? Donald Allan : Yes. So, I\u2019ll take that. The promotional activity, I would kind of summarize that as it\u2019s an intense holiday season. There were a lot of things going on in the power tool space. And we ran probably higher-level promotions than originally expected as we went into the quarter, which that can happen sometimes in a holiday season, like the fourth quarter, even the second quarter occasionally, as we go into the \u2013 late spring and summer. So I would just say that\u2019s things that happen and nothing really unusual about that. I would also say that, we did have a little bit of a reduction in the inventory and the channels by our customers, and so not a massive reduction in weeks on stock, but there was a little bit of a reduction in some of our major customers, which is good, because that\u2019s just them managing their inventories appropriately. And as you know, in the case of one of our customers, in particular, they build a higher level of inventory due to those significant launch of Craftsman and that\u2019s going to have to continue to be something we monitor. But we\u2019re going to manage that throughout the year as we go through 2020 and still achieve 2 points of growth, as I mentioned, for Craftsman as we manage that dynamic. And if the POS continues to be strong, the way it has been in double digits, that the amount that we have to manage in inventory will become smaller and smaller. As far as tariffs go, the $85 million carry over, a lot of that is tariffs that were put in place in the back-half with some pricing put in place in that period as well. So there\u2019s a little bit of carryover price, but we\u2019re going to manage price more through the margin resiliency initiative versus specific pricing actions for tariffs, so there\u2019ll be a little bit of that associated with $A, but that\u2019s not a large number. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is open. Ross Gilardi : Hey, good morning. Jim Loree : Hey, good morning. Donald Allan : Good morning. Ross Gilardi : I was just wondering, can you give a little more details on CAM, like how profitable is the business? When did the transaction actually closed and sort of why is the equation so far out? I realize these are series of same questions, but a number of questions, but just really some more color on CAM aftermarket versus OE and Boeing exposure and whatnot? Jim Loree : Sure. I mean, we\u2019re not disclosing the actual profitability level at the request of the CAM folks. However, suffice it to say that, it\u2019s a high-growth, high-margin business and the \u2013 have substantial EBITDA and EBITDA growth potential ahead of it. The aftermarket is a pretty significant part of the revenue base. It has grown approximately 6% organically over the long-term. So very nice asset, high-growth, high profitability, good aftermarket content, and a lot of engineering content, which in a lot of these components are in critical functions on the airplane. So we\u2019re very happy to have made this acquisition. It\u2019s a strategic platform. There are multiple multitude of bolt-on opportunities, as well as some larger opportunities that may or may not become available over time. So it just gives us a great runway for future growth. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Shannon, thanks. We\u2019d like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is now recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2020 first quarter conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, President and CEO, and Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 11 :00 AM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release.  This morning, Jim and Don will review our 2020 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in our 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree. James Loree : Thanks, Dennis. And good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin with a short passage from our most shareholder letter.  \"The new decade is upon us, and with it comes a host of new challenges with the most significant one of them all being something called VUCA, a term which emanated from a Military College in the US in response to the onset of the post-Cold War era. VUCA stands for volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. And while back in that period, VUCA described the backdrop for the formation of a new world order.\" \"This time, I believe it describes what leaders of all institutions will have to consider as we devise strategies and tactics to thrive in what can now be called the New World Disorder of the 2020s. It's an exciting world full of disruptive risks and opportunities, with the accelerating pace of technological change always pushing the limits of what individuals and institutions can absorb.\" \"In 2019, we put much thought into what it will take to win in this environment and we were perhaps blessed by having to deal with the unusually volatile conditions we faced in 2018 and 2019. For structural reasons, our recent external challenges may have been more pronounced than encountered by most diversified global industrials. Ironically, we feel blessed that we have experienced them and endured through them and have now emerged with a fitness and mindset to take on the challenges of the 2020s.\" I put the finishing touches on that shareholder letter on February 9, several weeks before the devastating impact of COVID-19 began to unfold in real time across the globe. It struck suddenly and jarringly. And while no one could fully understand what to expect next and exactly how it would impact public health policy, consumer behavior, the global economy, our markets, et cetera, our management team truly did have the fitness and mindset to tackle the first great challenge of the 2020s, COVID-19. The VUCA world had arrived earlier and more forcefully than could ever have been imagined.  We acted swiftly and decisively to establish key priorities, including \u2013 one \u2013 ensuring the health and safety of our employees and supply Chain partners; two, maintaining business continuity and financial strength and stability; three, serving our customers who provide essential products and services to the world; and four, doing our part to help mitigate the impact of the virus across the globe.  These priorities create clarity for our people and our stakeholders in a time of crisis. Through that framework, we empowered our leaders to take the necessary actions to protect our people, our company, our customers, and our communities.  First and most important is the health and safety of our employees and our supply chain partners. As a provider of essential products and services to the world, we have been permitted to continuously manufacture products and provide services in most locations around the globe since the inception of the lockdown.  It began in China with our 10 plants there operating continuously after returning from Chinese New Year in early February. We took extreme measures to protect our 8,000 workers there, including temperature screening, mandatory use of masks and other PPE, social distancing, frequent hand sanitizing and automatic quarantining of anyone exposed to international travel or other high risk situations. In addition, all Chinese employees who were able to work virtually were required to do so.  These precautions were so effective that to date we have had only one known instance of an employee in China testing positive for COVID-19. And she has recovered. That early learning in China proved critically useful to managing safety in our global operations as it enabled us to establish a standardized safety protocol based on applying our China practices as the virus worked its way around the world.  Among approximately 25,000 manufacturing and distribution workers globally, we have had fewer than 50 test positive to date. We track each employee case continuously as it develops.  We've had only a few locations out of our 100 plus factories and DCs with any notable spread, although we have had one where nine cases were detected within a 12-day period. We immediately and voluntarily effected a temporary shutdown of that facility for sanitizing and sent the majority of employees home for a mandatory 14-day quarantine.  For the total company, comprising approximately 58,000 associates, we've had less than 100 employees test positive for COVID-19, a testament to our safety culture and the importance we place on protecting our people.  And while we recognize that the situation can change quickly with respect to this virus, our safety measures are largely working. That health and safety commitment and execution has enabled us to maintain a supply chain that has functioned at a high level thus far during the crisis, providing business continuity, with few and only relatively minor supply disruptions.  This is a day-to-day management process. However, we can say, at this point, so far, so good.  And as for the company, we were in a strong financial position coming into the crisis and we remain strong today. Not surprisingly, we are anticipating the COVID-19 driven demand disruptions will negatively impact our full-year revenue outlook and, therefore, overall financial results in 2020. And here's what we've seen relative to demand. Overall demand in January and February was consistent with our now withdrawn guidance that was issued in January into March as the lockdown unfolded in Asia, Europe and then the US.  Sell-in volume fell into deep negative territory at levels in the aggregate even deeper than 2008/2009. The automotive industry in Europe and North America essentially shutdown. Commercial aerospace experienced similar dynamics. General industrial orders dried up as plants not providing essential products and services were closed around the globe, and major European countries such as Italy, France and Spain, as well as many in emerging markets basically shut down their discretionary and non-essential economies.  Most states in the US followed suit after California's March 19 stay-at-home order. And North American retail was a bright spot as homebound DIYers flocked to home centers and e-commerce to stock up on tools and other projects supplies, driving positive POS.  Retailers generally took that opportunity to trim inventories, however, creating a large gap between sell-out and sell-in, which has continued into April.  As a result, we recently withdrew our previously announced guidance for the year. And today, we'll be detailing a comprehensive cost reduction and efficiency program that will deliver $500 million of savings in 2020, above and beyond variable cost reductions, and $1 billion over the next 12 months.  The primary focus is to, one, adjust our supply chain and manufacturing labor base to match the current demand environment; secondly, substantially reduce indirect spending; third, reduce staffing in a manner that ensures we're prepared for a demand recovery at the appropriate time; and fourth, capture the significant raw material deflation opportunity that has emerged as the economy has weakened.  I recognize that this is a difficult time to make reduced work decisions that impact employees, but these actions are necessary given the decline in demand we are seeing. And with that said, we are being thoughtful and executing these actions with compassion, as well as consideration to position the company to capitalize on a recovery as the crisis subsides, and subside it will.  We are already seeing greenshoots, suggesting that economies and industries around the world are either rebooting or preparing to reboot in the coming weeks. Home center POS in North America is remarkably positive, as we speak. e-commerce volumes are up in double-digits. European and US auto is preparing to resume production. Governments are beginning to permit non-essential manufacturing to resume, et cetera. All of this suggests that, as we see it today, second quarter will likely be the trough in 2020, albeit a deep one at that. We believe we have sufficient flexibility to navigate through this volatile period and emerge even stronger on the other side. We have stress-test our business for a wide variety of demand scenarios, and have initiated the necessary actions and contingency plans to maintain a solid financial and operational foundation during this unpredictable period. Don will provide more color and detail on these in a few minutes.  Also important in this crisis is our mission to assist our governments and communities in mitigating the spread and impact of the virus around the globe. In the face of today's challenges, we are seeing the best of humankind \u2013 people, businesses, governments, NGOs are coming together. And as an organization, we are taking steps around the globe to do our part.  Now is the time for corporations like ours to demonstrate how we can align our resources to help deliver the innovative solutions and positive societal impact the world needs right now.  We are participating in a number of ways, using our expertise and innovation and our financial and operational resources to be a force for good and make a difference in our communities.  To start, we are contributing to COVID-19 relief funds in the US and globally in support of those who have been catastrophically impacted by the virus. As part of this program, we are matching all employee donations globally two-for-one to help our colleagues make an impact in their local communities. In addition, we are setting up a relief fund for our own employees and their families to help those who have been severely impacted by the virus and are in need of temporary financial assistance.  We are looking at ways to use our supply chain scale to help acquire critical PPE and other medical equipment that is needed. For instance, we purchased 3 million face masks for philanthropic distribution to vulnerable adult living facility, frontline workers and residents who desperately need protection.  And we have created a COVID-19 response task force comprised of cross-functional leaders throughout our organization that are focused on leveraging their expertise to develop solutions to help combat the virus.  Our teams are working on 3D printing face shields for healthcare workers and have partnered with other companies to develop emergency hand sanitizer supplies, as well as a DEWALT-powered portable battery respirator. Our teams are supporting those who make the world, especially the frontline caregivers and first responders, the workers in our customers' factories, construction workers and many others. They are each giving it their all to help keep us safe, healthy and functioning well.  Their work contributes to society in so many ways, and our products and services are helping them to do their jobs every day, the people that make the world. Now, I'll turn briefly to first quarter results. Revenues were $3.1 billion, down 6% versus prior year and driven by a 7% organic decline, primarily related to the impacts we experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.20, which was better than otherwise could be expected considering the demand headwinds that emerged in March.  And our business teams are focused on cost control and supply/demand balancing and are realizing the benefits we anticipated with the margin resiliency program.  The strong execution, however, was not enough to overcome the impact from the coronavirus-related volume declines and approximately $60 million of carryover headwinds related to tariffs and currency.  Now, I'll now turn it over to Don Allan to provide the business details for 1Q and a deeper dive into our scenario planning, cost response, capital allocation posture and liquidity picture.  Don? Donald Allan : Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. I hope you are all staying safe and healthy.  Before I take a deeper dive into Q1 results, I just want to share my deep appreciation for all our Stanley Black & Decker employees around the globe, who have been working night and day to keep one another safe, operate our business in this challenging environment and still give back to our communities. Thank you very much.  So, let's move on to Q1. Tools & Storage revenue declined 10%, with volume down 9% and currency contributing an additional 2 points of pressure. Price was a positive 1 point, driven by the benefits from our actions in response to continued tariff and currency headwinds.  The challenging revenue environment as a result of the COVID crisis emerging in Q1 has impacted all Tools & Storage regions and SBUs.  The operating margin rate for this segment was 11.5%, down from the prior year as the benefits from cost control, margin resiliency and price were more than offset by lower volumes due to the virus, tariffs and unfavorable currency.  As the quarter unfolded, we saw the humanitarian crisis from COVID-19 evolve quickly into an economic crisis and started to experience demand impacts in virtually all global markets we serve \u2013 first in Asia, then in Europe and finally in North America and the emerging markets. Our planned organic growth for the quarter was relatively flat to a slight decline.  As we detailed in January, we anticipated a difficult comp due to the significant load in of Craftsman in early 2019, as well as softer industrial channels and emerging markets in our guidance at the time. The entirety of the miss versus our plan can be attributed to the impact from the virus. However, our proactive cost control and margin resiliency initiatives were able to significantly mitigate the net operating margin impact from lower volumes.  On a geographic basis, Europe was down 7% as France and Southern Europe led the decline, while the North fared somewhat better, with low-single digit declines as the lockdowns started later. Growth in the European region in the month of February and first two weeks of March was positive, illustrating how quickly trends change during the second half of March.  Emerging markets declined 13%. Asia was hardest hit, down 25%, with Latin America down 12%. All countries in these geographies were down for the quarter except for Russia, Turkey, Colombia and Chile, which are all up low-double digits.  North America was down 8%, with all channels experiencing declines. However, Canada was relatively flat for the quarter.  Similar to the overall segment, we expected North America to be relatively flat due to the Craftsman load-in dynamic. So, the declines for the quarter was largely driven by the virus impact.  From an underlying demand standpoint, retail POS extended the strong double-digit trends from 2019 through much of the quarter. We started to see demand deviations versus our plan around the second week of March as more broad-based shelter-in-place orders went into effect and the month of March POS was relatively flat by the end of the month. Now, looking at the SBUs. Power tools and equipment declined 3% as early momentum behind commercial execution and new product introductions were more than offset by the later-in-quarter impact from the pandemic.  Contrary to what you would think, the less cyclical hand tools, accessories and storage SBU declined 14%, more extreme because this SBU had a larger benefit in 2019 from the Craftsman rollout.  As we watched the trends in the quarter, e-commerce globally and DIY in many developed markets showed signs of acceleration. As you can imagine, with more people spending extended times in their homes, maintenance and repair work that may have been put off for some time has taken a new priority in the lives of our end users. Our global position in e-commerce and the reestablishment of Craftsman in the marketplace have benefited us in this particular environment.  Turning to Industrial. The segment delivered 6% revenue growth, which included 15 points from IES Attachments and CAM. Both of those acquisitions. Additionally, we had an 8% organic decline and a negative 1 point from currency. Operating margin rate was down year-over-year to 13.2% as margin resiliency and cost controls were more than offset by the impact from lower volume and currency.  Engineered fastening organic revenues were down 9%. As you would expect, Asia led the declines with auto being more impacted than general industrial customers. We have seen this dynamic emerge in other geographies we compete in as well.  The automotive manufacturers were forced to make tough decisions to close their plants and began shutting them down in Q1 as humanitarian and economic crisis moved across the globe, leading to North American shutdowns late in March. On a positive front, many of the Chinese auto plants have reopened, albeit at significantly lower volumes, and most of the other auto manufacturers are planning to reopen North American and European plants within the next several weeks.  The commercial model in engineered fastening is sound and we continue to partner with our customers on new content, which we believe will provide a pathway for share gains as production levels improve. We are prepared to ramp up once our automotive customers solidify their new production dates across Europe and North America.  The infrastructure businesses declined 6% as low single-digit growth in oil and gas was more than offset by lower attachment tools volume. Oil and gas benefited from continued growth and inspections, while attachment tools declined in the mid-teens, a relatively similar performance to what we experienced in the fourth quarter. Through mid-March, Security's organic growth was close to 3% quarter-to-date. By quarter-end, however, the Security segment has declined 4% as organic growth shifted to a negative 2% for the full quarter, a 5 point swing in two weeks as the world shut down and customers were cautious in allowing technicians onsite as they postponed projects. Embedded in that organic growth performance was a 2 point negative impact from divestitures. Security additionally experienced a 2% decline in revenue from currency.  North American Security organic growth was up 2% as higher volumes in automatic doors and healthcare were partially offset by lower installation and service revenue in the commercial electronic security business. Obviously, we are seeing customer accessibility limitations impacting our ability to complete installation orders in this environment.  Europe was down 1% organically due to customer restrictions in France and UK, which more than offset solid growth in Sweden.  The commercial momentum continued with strong order intake and a backlog that is up 20% versus last year. As the restrictions lift in North America and Europe, we are in a good position to continue the organic growth momentum in Security. In terms of profitability, the segment operating margin was down 290 basis points to 7.4% as price and cost control were more than offset by lower volume in electronic security, investments to support growth and the impact from the Sargent & Greenleaf divestiture. The volume loss in late March for customer installations was significantly above line average profitability.  So, that is the view of Q1. But now I would like to share our view on the near-term prospects for our businesses. So, as we move to slide 9, today's environment is changing on a daily basis and we are doing everything we can to keep our employees safe and healthy and serve our customers, while we continue to evaluate and prepare for a wide variety of demand scenarios that could occur in 2020 and beyond.  I will start with the left side of the page, which depicts how we expect COVID to initially impact demand. The chart is arranged from the most impacted businesses at the top to what we believe to be the least impacted businesses as we move down to the bottom of the table on this page.  We are seeing that the hardest hit businesses will be automotive and aerospace. Both have seen OEM shut down production. In the case of auto, these end markets were seeing negative trends for much of 2018 and 2019, so this environment has deepened this decline globally. Our customers are at varied stages of restarting in Europe and the United States. As a reminder, our auto fastening business is 25% CapEx driven, with the remainder based on production. As it relates to our aerospace exposure, it is close to 90% commercial, with the vast majority of that tied to new builds. Finally, we expect general industrial portion of fasteners to be somewhat less impacted as the customer base is diverse and we serve some essential industries that have remained operational during this time.  Turning to Tools & Storage. Market demand is most closely correlated with global GDP and consumer confidence in the served geography. Approximately 85% of our tools are construction oriented, with the remaining 15% serving industrial customers and automotive aftermarket.  As broad-based global shelter-in-place orders were issued, the impact to North American independent construction channels and industrial customers, as well as geographies outside of North America has been very significant.  On the contrary, our major North American retail customers were qualified as essential, which enabled us to continue to serve demand and we are seeing demand acceleration in DIY in the region and e-commerce globally, supporting these trends in North America retail POS for the first four weeks of the fiscal month of April, which was up low-double digits.  However, since about 70% of our products serve the professional, declines in construction and repair activity levels and industrial production are expected to impact demand, while shutdowns remain in place.  Additionally, we are experiencing some inventory corrections in our North American retail partners, as they utilize this crisis to reset store inventory levels by the end of Q2. Our infrastructure businesses have been less impacted today by shutdowns as large construction projects have been able to safely continue. Attachment tools are seeing an impact as OEMs adjust production and customers focus on only the most critical inventory.  Less impacted today is oil and gas as they complete their planned backlog of projects. However, we are expecting a longer-term impact to this business related to the price of oil that would be negative.  Lastly, Security. Generally, this business is rather resilient during recessions because of the significant amount of recurring revenue, and in downturns, we typically see an increase in the demand for security.  The current crisis, however, is challenging this segment in new and different ways. Regional shutdowns are limiting our ability to enter our customers' facilities and complete installation and maintenance orders.  As I referenced earlier, though, the team has seen strong motor trends, which gives us confidence that this business will have significant backlog to convert when the environment improves.  Additionally, we believe new market needs in factories, offices, retail and consumer as well as the healthcare environment should create new revenue opportunities for this business to capitalize upon as we emerge from the crisis. So, accounting for all these factors, our plans assume a 35% to 45% decline in organic revenue for the second quarter.  As an added disclosure, to provide some more transparency, an indication of our April month-to-date revenue trend in each of our businesses is denoted by the colored balls on the left side of the slide. You can see the actual data is very much in line with how I described the businesses earlier. Aggregate shipments for the company are tracking in line with the midpoint of our planning assumption or about a 40% decline.  One could have the view that the demand impact will be the deepest in the month of April, as the government restrictions are currently very broad and restrictive. If this turns out to be an accurate view, then we would appear to be at or slightly below the 35% end of our range for Q2. However, we think it's too soon to draw definitive conclusions until we better understand the length of the shutdowns and what demand looks like once restrictions ease.  As we look ahead for the full year, we have modeled scenarios that result in a 15% to 30% organic decline in revenue. The key variables driving the range is the depth and the duration of the revenue decline, as well as the timing and the magnitude of the bounce back in 2020.  The high end of the decline would look more like an L-shaped recovery and the shallow end would be representative of a V. Our base case plans for a U-shaped recovery with a few bumps likely along the way, which currently expects 2Q to carry the deepest decline, with the revenue contraction moderating across both Q3 and Q4. We have sized and structured our cost program to address this scenario, and it is relatively similar to the midpoint of these revenue ranges.  However, we've structured our cost program to provide us flexibility depending on the shape of the recovery. Should we see a quicker V-shaped recovery, we can reverse some of these decisions as necessary to support the demand environment as it returns.  However, should we see further deterioration or a more elongated L-shaped recovery, we can choose to make some of the temporary actions permanent, resizing our cost base to reflect the new environment. Now, turning to more detail on our cost response. As Jim mentioned in his opening comments, we are targeting four areas of opportunity within our cost program. Indirect spend, compensation and headcount, benefits modification and raw material deflation.  This new program expands and incorporates $100 million to $150 million 2020 margin resiliency opportunity I discussed on the January earnings call. However, these reductions are incremental to the headcount reduction program that we implemented in Q4 2019 and included in our guidance in January. We see this as a $1 billion savings opportunity over the next 12 months, with approximately $500 million benefiting this year.  Now, I will dive deeper into each one of these opportunities. First, we are targeting to significantly reduce our $1.7 billion in indirect spend, as we focus on professional services, MRO, T&E, marketing, et cetera.  We're taking a clean-sheet, bottoms-up approach to assessing these spend categories and establish indirect spend control towers, with cost category owners who will be focused on reviewing all proposed spend. The mindset in this environment is to only approve expenditures that are essential to running our business. Next, based on where commodity prices are in today's environment, combined with the initiatives we are executing within margin resiliency, we believe there's a significant opportunity to capture incremental raw material deflation across our roughly $6 billion of annual spend in finished goods, components, commodities and transportation. This can help offset some of the remaining tariff and currency pressure that we will face in 2020.  Together, these two categories represent about 60% of the $1 billion savings target, which means about 40% is compensation and benefits. Our approach in this area is to ensure that we are preserving our ability to reduce labor costs in a manner that allows us to treat our employees with compassion in these incredibly difficult times, and to prepare us for demand recovery at the appropriate time by making these actions as temporary as possible.  The savings include salary reductions for senior leaders, temporary benefit reductions, such as suspending 401(k) matching in the United States, a voluntary retirement program, furloughs, modified workweeks, and finally, some reductions in force. Today, about 70% of the actions are temporary, specifically the furloughs, pauses in benefits, salary reductions and the like.  As you think about modeling this $1 billion plan, we should start to see some benefit in Q2 related to these actions and approximately $375 million of the $500 million will benefit the second half. One other assumption related to this, we believe approximately 60% of the $1 billion in cost savings is classified as SG&A, with the remainder in cost of sales.  So, that is our plan to address the semi fixed cost base in this environment.  We also have addressed variable spending by adjusting our manufacturing and supply chain to align with the current demand environment. We are taking a similar cost reduction approach in this area, ensuring that we treat our employees with compassion and partnering with our suppliers to provide the right flexibility.  We also are protecting inventory of our highest volume SKUs until we get a sense of the demand progression across the coming months and quarters. We will be leveraging the operations excellence principles in the SPD operating model to ensure we remain agile and efficient, carrying only the levels of working capital required.  As we think about scenario planning and various models, as a reminder, we historically have seen decremental margins around 40% prior to any cost-cutting actions across our businesses. This is a good starting assumption as you plan various demand scenarios. As I said earlier, we are planning for a U-shaped recovery, with a few bumps likely. And with our cost actions, we believe we can limit the decremental margins to low to mid 20s this year, and better than that across the 12-month period. We currently believe Q2 will likely be the deepest decremental margin as we face deep revenue declines and the cost cutting actions will not see a full quarter impact. So, I've given you quite a bit of detail on how we are tackling the next 12 months. Beyond that timeframe, by design, there will be a snapback in some of these costs if we are in a better demand environment. In fact, if we find out that we are in a V-shaped recovery in the coming quarters, we may choose to put some of this spending back in place. However, if we find ourselves in an L-shaped recovery where volume stays depressed for a longer period of time, we will make these actions permanent.  We believe we are taking the appropriate actions given the current environment and trying to prepare ourselves for a range of outcomes that gives us the right level of flexibility to react to the recovery in whichever manner it comes.  So, now we'll move to slide 11 and talk about our past performance in previous recessions. In an effort to provide some additional context to our scenario planning, we want to share some information about how we performed in past recessions. I say we as Jim, myself and many members of the management team were a part of the senior leadership of the company during those time periods.  Since we had a major acquisition coming out of the 2008/2009 recession, we have included both SWK and BDK in these metrics. I will focus my comments primarily on 2008 and 2009.  So, from a top line perspective, peak to trough pro forma organic sales declined 23% throughout. The duration of the recessionary period, the average quarterly organic sales decline was 13%, with the deepest quarterly decline being 24%. To get a sense of how the business rebounded coming out of the housing-led recession, we looked at organic growth two quarters after the end of the recession, which returned with 12% growth.  Turning to profit, in both recessions presented on this page, entering the down cycle, decremental margins approximated 40% before cost cutting, which is consistent with what I laid out earlier.  However, we did our best to proactively cut costs during both periods and limited peak to trough decrementals below double digits at SWK in 2001 and to the high teens for the combined company in 2008 and 2009.  At this point, we have limited visibility to the potential length and the depth of the current environment. However, we are approaching this situation drawing on the experience from the past and trying to replicate the track record of performance during downturns. We feel our approach has served us well to make sure we do what we can to remain agile and resilient as we manage the uncertainty and come out of this crisis stronger, prepared to find more organic and inorganic growth opportunities.  Let's now move to slide 12 and give an update on liquidity. So, a quick update on our liquidity and balance sheet. At the end of Q1, we had approximately $1.7 billion of outstanding commercial paper. This is aligned with normal seasonality we typically see this time of year. We don't have any long-term maturities coming due until December of 2021, which is $400 million. The next maturity is $754 million in 2022, with the remainder of our long-term maturities in 2026 and beyond. Available liquidity starts with approximately $1 billion of cash on hand as of quarter-end. Leveraging our strong investment grade credit rating, we have had and continue to have uninterrupted access to the commercial paper market since the crisis began. We have about $1.3 billion of available capacity on our $3 billion CP program. Finally, with the successful remarketing of the 2017 preferred equity units in May, we have the opportunity for an additional $750 million of liquidity.  As you can see, we have significant flexibility from a liquidity standpoint, with the total potential of $3.1 billion all in as of the end of the quarter.  Backing up our robust commercial paper program is $3 billion of revolving credit facilities, which are backed by a well-capitalized diversified banking group.  You may have seen in our 8-K that we issued last night announcing that we have modified the covenant on these facilities to now carry an EBITDA to interest ratio of greater than 2.5 times, with certain one-time expenses excluded from the ratio through 2021. This proactive and prudent action preserves access to liquidity and gives us the flexibility in a period that will carry higher charges related to our cost program. From a capital deployment perspective, the priority is debt repayment and, in turn, achieving our leverage targets. To ensure we maintain our strong liquidity position and deliver on our capital allocation priorities, we've initiated additional capital conservation actions which included significant reductions in 2020 capital expenditures and a temporary suspension of M&A and share repurchase activity. So, as we move to slide 13 to summarize all this information \u2013 we just covered a lot of ground here, so I'll spend a moment to summarize a few key points for 2020. We are continuing to suspend our guidance for now and are experiencing substantial revenue declines early in the second quarter, as I mentioned, which we currently expect will represent the trough quarter for the year.  From a revenue perspective, our planning models assume the potential for a 35% to 45% second quarter revenue decline, with the month-to-date April results tracking in that neighborhood. The future is dependent on countries getting control of the health crisis as all of us now. We have modeled multiple scenarios and currently assumes sequential improvement as we move through the year, with a full-year range of 15% to 30% revenue decline, depending on the shape and the timing of the recovery, as I discussed. Decremental margins pre-cost cutting should be 40% and our cost reductions will attempt to minimize that impact down to the low to mid-20s.  From a cost structure perspective, we had $180 million of savings included in our Q4 2019 cost reduction and are adding an additional $500 million to that in 2020. Tariffs and FX are currently expected to be $150 million headwind, with $60 million of that behind us in the first quarter. From a cash perspective, our focus is capital conservation and deleveraging, as I mentioned. With that comes capital expenditure reductions and temporary suspension of M&A and share repurchase activity. Finally, expect us to target expanding working capital turns versus the prior year. The demand environment will dictate if we see a cash flow positive from working capital liquidation, but as of now we want to preserve sufficient working capital levels to capitalize on a recovery when it presents itself.  As you can see, it's a complex situation. We've never seen this type of humanitarian crisis in our lifetime. But we can draw on our vast experiences where we have successfully navigated this company through 177 years of ups and downs. Our team is actively engaged in managing everything within our control, while also contributing where we can to helping mitigate the spread of this terrible pandemic.  Thank you. And I will now turn it back to Jim. James Loree : Thanks, Don. It would be easy to lose sight of the opportunities that arise during moments like this, given all the detail and difficult actions that we're taking and we'll continue to take, but I also want to emphasize that we continue to execute on a number of outstanding growth catalysts that we believe will position us to perform in this difficult market environment and beyond. The iconic Craftsman brand rollout continues to have a strong customer response, excellent growth and we remain well on our path towards the $1 billion marker. This brand is well-positioned to capture the DIY and value-oriented professional, a growing market in North America.  Our innovation machine is a strategic differentiator and enables us to generate share gain, with a steady stream of innovation that we bring to the marketplace across our businesses. More specifically, our recent series of DEWALT product breakthroughs, including FlexVolt, Atomic and Xtreme have been well received by end users and now account for more than $0.5 billion of revenue, with a healthy growth rate, at least pre-COVID-19. And then, lastly, we are the tools industry leader in e-commerce with 2019 online revenues of $1.3 billion. And this global opportunity has outstanding potential for rapid growth in today's environment and in the years to come. And during the last couple of years, we've very methodically expanded this program from a North America focused e-commerce platform to a globally-focused platform with strengths in many, many of markets around the world. It's going to be a huge advantage for us going forward. Of course, during 2019, we closed on that 20% stake in MTD, a leading outdoor power equipment manufacturer based in Ohio. This is an exciting opportunity for us to increase our presence in both the gas and electric outdoor power equipment market.  So, there's a lot to be excited about and our growth teams are not sitting still. We know that when this crisis \u2013 this crisis has a potential to create sweeping changes in consumer behavior and user needs and business model requirements. Multiple new growth opportunities will arise from this and we are prioritizing resources to ensure that we're in a position to capitalize on them. So, in closing, COVID-19 has presented us with the first great challenge of the 2020s. And within this uncertain environment, we've aligned our organization around key priorities \u2013 health and safety of our employees and supply chain partners being number one, business continuity and financial strength, serving our customers and doing our part to help mitigate the impact of the virus.  We were in a strong position going into the crisis and are taking the necessary actions to stay strong during the crisis and to emerge from it even stronger. Our commitment to safety is rock solid. Our businesses have operated continuously since the inception of the crisis. Our financial strength and liquidity is in great shape and our billion dollar cost reduction and efficiency program has been carefully designed to support financial stability and performance in whatever demand scenario emerges. The vast majority of our customers are either open for business or planning to reopen in the coming weeks. Our growth catalysts are alive and well and we are doing what we can to support our people and our communities around the globe.  So, it is with both realism about the present and cautious optimism about the future that we have the resources, the experience, the strength and the mindset to take on the first great challenge of the 2020s and we're now ready for Q&A. Dennis? Dennis Lange : Great. Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Good morning, Jim. James Loree : Good morning. Nigel Coe : Yeah. Thanks for all the details. It's really helpful. And the context around what you expect for 2Q and the full year is very helpful. Not all companies are doing that. So, much appreciated.  We'll take a lot of the details offline with Dennis, but in terms of the cost savings, can you just confirm \u2013 I think the answer is yes, but this is additive to the costs savings in train right now. So, this is $500 million plus $200 million. So, it's more like $700 million of cost reduction this year? And then, the second part of the question is, given it's a billion dollars to analyze savings, $500 million for the full year, really, this is second half and not much of this falls into 2Q. Thank you very much. Donald Allan : Yeah, I'll provide a little clarity on that. So, the $500 million in 2020 related to the billion dollar program is in addition to the actions that we took in Q4 of 2019. So, that's correct. As it relates to the timing, what I said in my very long script was that $500 million for the year, we think $375 million of that will be in the back half. And so, that obviously gets you about $125 million in the second quarter. And so, that's kind of how it lays out. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. You may begin. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning. I guess a multipart one from me also. Can you provide a little color on how the manufacturing footprint realignment plays into this, specifically thinking the shift out of China and into the US? And  if I could squeeze a second part in, with sell-out so strong, how long do you think the home center is going to actually draw down inventory before they actually have to kind of hit the reset button to start ordering on the other side? Thank you. James Loree : Okay. I'll take the second part your question first. Because I think a lot depends on the POS. We're seeing some eye-popping numbers on a weekly basis in a couple of the places. And if that continues, there will be some replenishment that would be advisable, no later than the third month of this quarter, June. So, it's really their decision. They make those decisions in how they want to play their inventory.  I can completely understand the challenge they have, trying to balance the opportunity that might be out there, but they don't know for sure versus the risk of getting stuck with a significant inventory problem if all of a sudden those trends change. So, it's just a balancing act and it's a tight wired one at that.  As far as the manufacturing footprint, it's an interesting question because with virtually 98% of our salaried population stuck in their homes working virtually, it's hard to really execute on these types of projects, in addition to the fact that they can't travel. So, there's a travel ban in place. Like most companies, we have a complete ban on travel. It has very few, if any, exceptions. So, there will be some delays in the footprint program until we're able to travel and that sort of thing. But I think we're talking probably months in terms of delays, but there will also be an acceleration because the importance of making of footprint happen even faster is amplified by the nature of the crisis. So, you end up with a lot of planning going on right now virtually. And then, when we get into the execution, we're going to try to accelerate. Long story short, I think we're going to be looking at roughly the same kind of two to three-year time frame for the moves to be complete. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open. Timothy Wojs : Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning. James Loree : Good morning. Tim Wojs : Appreciate all the details that you've provided. I also have kind of a two-part question. I guess, first, how are you balancing just R&D and innovation and growth investments? So, just specifically, is that something that's been preserved and protected as you've kind of make these cost reductions? And then, second, how should we think about balancing just both production and working capital? I guess, at this point, would you expect working capital to be more released than you thought prior to this or would you expect it to carry that working capital just given the uncertainty around retail stocking levels? James Loree : I'll take the first part of your question. I'll give Don the second, even though I know the answer to it. Donald Allan : I know the answer to the first too. James Loree : Fair enough, Don. We have largely protected any applied innovation. So, there may be some theoretical innovation that we cut back a little bit on, but not much. Some of the programs that are still looking at 5 years out, 6 years, 7, 8, 9, 10 years out in terms of how some of these look like, the construction industry will change and what the impact on our tool business would be and how we're going to manage through all that. That program, for example, is alive and well. And so, when you think about the nature of the comp and ben reduction, so many of them in this are temporary \u2013 70% are temporary. So, instead of maybe working five days on a project, we're working four, and for a period of time. I think that's the way to think about it. Donald Allan : Yeah. On the operation side, we gave a lot of thought to how we ramp down the labor force in manufacturing and distribution, and in particular in tools. In engineered fastening, it was fairly straightforward because you had OEMs shutting down and we basically would shut our plant down in a similar correlation and then we'll ramp up a little bit in advance of them ramping up. So, it's fairly straightforward from that perspective. But on the tools side, it's a little bit more complex, especially in North America, in that we have several major customers in retail that are continuing to perform. As we talked about earlier, the POS is very strong through the first four weeks of April.  So, we did a planning assumption around our second quarter revenue decline, but we didn't reduce production to that level. We actually reduced production to a more modified view of that. So, if you look at the \u2013 maybe tools being down somewhere 35% to 45% in Q2 like the company, we're probably somewhere between 0% and 35% to 40% is where we cut that production. And so, we recognize the importance of continuing to serve those customers, but also making sure we're prepared as things start to accelerate maybe in June or in the third quarter, whatever the timing is, we're prepared for that.  And given our supply chain, with some of the lead times we have, we have to make sure that we strike that right balance, which we will carry a little higher level of inventory probably through Q2 and Q3 and maybe longer, but I think we're striking the right balance to ensure that we meet our customers' needs now and going forward, but also ensure that we get the right dollar value out of working capital performance in 2020. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And congrats on all your efforts so far managing the challenging backdrop. First question, or I guess my only question, but I do have a clarification question as well if I could, but the core question is just also around some granularity on the cost reduction program. Just trying to understand it relative to the prior margin resiliency efforts. You had noted that it is inclusive of the $100 million to $150 million that you're expecting to realize this year. I was curious if the next two years, that would overall encompass the total number of $300 million to $500 million. If that remaining portions are also included in this $1 billion program or if that's still kind of years out. And then, in terms of the clarification, there are a few different numbers in terms of the sell-in and the sell-out on North American retail. I was hoping if you could just kind of review for March and April so far what you've seen. It is roughly what you had in terms of sell-in and sell-out. Donald Allan : So, for the sell-in and sell-out, so for March, the POS, as I mentioned in my script, was flat \u2013 relatively flat. The POS in April is up low double-digits. So, it's very strong. And the sell-in that we're seeing in the month of April is consistent with what I showed on that chart, which for Tools & Storage is in that ballpark of the 2Q range I mentioned, probably turning towards the lower end of that range. So, that gives you a sense of those aspects.  As far as the cost reduction goes, if we reflect back to the January earnings call, we talked about having $100 million and $150 million of margin resiliency initiatives that weren't in our guidance. They were just there as a contingency, things we were going to execute on as new headwinds came our way. So, clearly, some big headwinds have come our way, much bigger than anyone anticipated, for us and many in the rest of the world.  But when you think about what those opportunities were in margin resiliency, there were things around higher levels of procurement savings due to utilizing technology in certain tools to drive that value.  Using industry for that old technologies around automation and data analytics, artificial intelligence that would drive more value to our manufacturing footprint and eventually into our supply base as well. Those things are not driving a lot of value in the billion dollars. So, those two buckets, in particular, were a large part of our margin resiliency program. There were other aspects around indirect and a few other things, like functional transformation. Functional transformation will continue to move forward and that'll be a value driver for the next two to four years depending on the function. Indirect, yeah, we're probably pushing a lot of that right now in the next 12 months, but what we need margin resiliency for us is to help us sustain that savings going forward because, right now, what we're doing is really brute force.  So, that's a long-winded answer to your question, but I still think there's a very big opportunity for margin resiliency out there when you think about those different categories and then there's a sustaining aspect around indirect that really helps us keep that significant number that we're getting in the billion dollar program in our P&L, so it doesn't pop up in a very large way in the coming years. James Loree : And as you can imagine, we really haven't had the opportunity to get into tremendous amount of detail ourselves as we work through this crisis. On that particular question, really just trying to find every cost savings opportunity we could find and we'll go back and do the detailed analysis over the next couple of weeks. In probably the next earnings call, we'll give you a little more granularity around the answer to that question. But as you can see from what Don said, it's partial basically. Partially included, partially not and more to come later. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. James Loree : Good morning. Julian Mitchell : Hey, morning. My first question just really around the free cash flow. You've spent a lot of time discussing the sales and earnings trends and slide 10 was very helpful in that regard for historical context. Just wondered what the historical context was around the free cash flow in downturns and how you think it might be similar or different in this current downturn.  And then, my clarification would just be around \u2013 you talked about decrementals all-in this time of, I think, low to mid-20s this year. That's a bit heavier than the last two downturns on slide 10. Is that simply because of the tariff and currency costs? Or is it more about just the sort of starting point, i.e. the notion that this downturn could carry on into next year? Thank you. Donald Allan : Yeah, sure. Julian, it's really timing. I know I said a lot of things in my script, but as I went through that low kind of 20s for 2020, what I also said is when we when at the full 12 months going into 2021, we actually think we'll get better than that. So, hopefully, we get very close to that high teens number that we saw in the 2008 and 2009 period. What was the first question he had? Dennis Lange : Free cash flow. Donald Allan : Free cash flow, yeah. So, free cash flow in recession has actually, from a conversion point of view, performed very well. Obviously, gets impacted by the charges that you put through your net income. You tend to get a good working capital benefit in a recessionary period. Now, this might be a little different. We're trying to manage that, as I mentioned, in my presentation with the right balance because we want to ensure we have enough inventory if the recovery is very quick. And we didn't face that type of challenge as we went through the recession because we don't expect quick recoveries. We expected very slow recoveries. This is a different scenario where you could see a V or, in our case, we modeled a U, and there might be a scenario where stronger growth comes later versus in the short term. And so, I think we have to strike that right balance to ensure that we don't go overboard in working capital. But, overall, I would expect conversion to be strong given the historical dynamics we have seen. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning, guys. James Loree : Hey. Good morning. Joshua Pokrzywinski : I'll try to keep it to a mere 17 part question for mine. Just going back, Jim, to the point you made \u2013 or I think it might have been Don \u2013 about not just the sell-in versus sell-out, but more that the pros aren't working right now. What do you think those job site closures are costing you? Because I guess New York City and Northern California I think are opening in real time right now for construction sites. So, maybe some light at the end of the tunnel there if you wouldn't mind sizing that. And that's all I have to say. James Loree : Well, it's interesting to think about it because the pros do a fair amount of shopping at home centers. And so, I think what we're probably seeing is this DIY phenomenon is probably a lot bigger than we suspect because there's a big negative I suspect coming from the pros. They're just not stopping in the contractor's desk as much as they used to right now because the projects aren't active. And so, it's hard to pinpoint exactly what that difference could be because we don't really know how big the DIY impact is. But I think the ballpark, it's probably in the single digits for sure, but probably mid, low single-digits would be my \u2013 negative impact would be my guess, but it's a guess. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Markus Mittermaier with UBS. Your line is open. Markus Mittermaier : Hi. Good morning. Glad you all are well. James Loree : Good morning. Markus Mittermaier : And thanks for all the scenario analysis. Very helpful. One question quickly on your base case. You've talked a lot about decrementals. What I'm wondering is, on the other side, given that you, I think, mentioned in your prepared remarks, indirect cost and deflation is about 60% of the cost-out. How does that compared to the past and what would that mean for incrementals because if 60% of total cost-out, incrementals should be quite interesting. Is that sort of like in a U-shape base case recovery that is outlined? Donald Allan : Yeah. You're right. it, obviously, depends on what type of recovery we see. If we see a very rapid V recovery in the back half of this year, then the incrementals will change because we will be adding that cost. We have 70% of our comp and benefits costs that we've kind of called temporary at this point, which is 40% of our $1 billion. And we probably wouldn't add it all back, but we'll add some of that back because we have modified workweeks and furloughs and things like that that are happening with the salaried part of our company. And so, that would clearly have a governing impact on incrementals as we grow. That being said, there's a lot of things we can do to continue to drive productivity. We touched on margin resiliency earlier in a question we had from Michael. And those are types of initiatives that have been little bit on hold for a period of time, but they are beginning to re-energize themselves going forward to create the value that we think is there. And so, I actually think the incrementals will see a bit of a governing impact in that recovery, but I think it's something we can manage through. So, it's not too significant.  In a longer period of recovery, where it's a U or even an L, we will be working to make that billion dollars as permanent as possible, which means we could take some of the temporary things and make them permanent or we could take alternative actions to replace some of those temporary things over time. Because if we see that type of recovery where we have a bumpy performance from multiple quarters going into next year, then we're going to probably take the approach of how do we really make the vast majority of that permanent, which would not impact incrementals once we got into a growth mode. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nicole DeBlase : Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys. James Loree : Good morning. Nicole DeBlase : So, I just wanted to ask on pricing, how pricing trended through the end of the quarter into April and if you're seeing more promotional activity from peers and whether or not you guys are getting more promotional activity to drive POS in the North America retail channel. James Loree : In this environment, promotional activity does not make a tremendous amount of sense. So, all the price that you're seeing is pretty much coming from programmatic price, largely from the margin resiliency program because we're not in there implementing across-the-board price increases in a deflationary environment. And so, we're also getting some carryover from pricing that we did from the earlier price increases on the tariff and other related inflation. But no new pricing actions other than maybe more surgical ones that are based on analytics and things like that that are being utilized in the margin resiliency program. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joseph Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hope you are well. And echo everybody else's comments. Great detail on the call today. James Loree : Thank you. Joseph Ritchie : Just one question. Just going back to slide 8 and the trend that you're expecting in Q2. So, I think the way to think through this, auto and aero probably already down more than that number for 2Q. And the commentary around Tools & Storage, it is really interesting to hear point of sale is up double digits. If I heard Don's comments correctly, the sell-in already at the 2Q number, with an expectation that it'll remain there unless the point of sale becomes \u2013 stays as strong as it is. Is that the right way to think about it? James Loree : That's pretty much the right way to think about it. Donald Allan : The sell-in is right in that range of Q2 right now for tools North America. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open. Robert Wertheimer : Good morning, everyone. James Loree : Hey, Rob. Robert Wertheimer : If I could just ask a related question to the last one. I know you've given a tremendous amount of detail both on how you're managing and on the short term. There's disruption in supply chains globally. If there is a call for more sell-in into the home centers, is there a chance that that's just disruptive and, therefore, you miss out on some sales or do you feel like you've had a handle on that?  And then, I just don't know \u2013 again, you give more detail than normal, which is very helpful, what's the normal sell-in process? I don't know whether the up doubles and the down is just \u2013 there's some seasonality to this, obviously, or whether, all else equal, you'd be expecting much stronger sell-in towards the end of the quarter? Thanks. James Loree : Yeah. We have a keen appreciation for the opportunity cost of not being prepared for a spike in orders from the home centers, in particular. And I would say supply chain approaches are somewhat different, but the general rhythm would be kind of monthly. We've gone to a weekly rhythm and, in some cases, a daily rhythm, monitoring the ins and the out. And it is a very, very significant opportunity for us. And so, actually, as it turns out, we have \u2013 and Don alluded to this, but we have actually programmed the inventory side \u2013 our inventory builds, if you will, to deal with the possibility that there could be an increase in sell-in in terms of orders later in the quarter. Normally, there is probably substantially more orders in the second month of the quarter for shipping in the third month. However, it remains to be seen if that's going to occur this time around. But I think it's one of these things that we're just managing on a real time basis and we're in contact with the customers and we're monitoring the sell-out and, at some point, those two things have to kind of equal each other. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Kenneth Zener : Good morning, everybody. James Loree : Good morning. Kenneth Zener : The 2Q thoughts \u2013 I'm sure you've been working on the weekends here. I think you laid out 2Q pretty clear. For your base case growth rates for the second half, I'm interested, does the second half base case \u2013 are you implying 4Q is up there? And I ask relative to your comments around the 40% leverage, A. And then B, how that $375 million split? Does the majority of that fall into 3Q? I guess that's what I'm looking at, your base. Is that 4Q sales up? And is that $375 million savings split equally 3Q or 4Q? Thank you. Donald Allan : Yeah. The base case assumes \u2013 I'll start with the costs. Yes, $375 million which would actually be a significant impact to moderating those decrementals of 40%. And that's how we get ourselves to the low 20s, is we see that impacting the back half of the year.  As far as the revenue performance goes, by the time we get to Q4 in our base case, we're kind of anywhere from flat to slightly down, and that's really where we are. And then, you can do the math for what Q3 would be based on that. We're not assuming growth right now in our base case in the fourth quarter because it is a U shape, but we'll see. There's still a lot to occur going forward and we'll have certainly a lot more color as we get to July for our next earnings call where we are. But we kind of planned a scenario that would be difficult, which is why we went after the billion dollars of cost, but we did it in a way that gave us the flexibility that both Jim and I've described over the last hour or so. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open. Justin Speer : Thanks, guys. Good morning. Just a question on raw materials. I think you said $6 billion of materials input, this slide \u2013 roughly 70% of your cost of goods sold are raw materials and inputs. Just trying to understand what percentage decline you're planning in that cost-out this year simply based on the collapse of commodities in your broader plan? And is there anything beyond that deflation that's in that cost savings bucket?  And then, secondly, how should we think about pricing integrity across the business for the year in this type of environment, just looking beyond the near term pricing dynamics? Donald Allan : Yeah. I think on the commodity front, we have a really nice opportunity to pursue as a result of the much lower global demand and the way that prices of commodities have adjusted in the last month or so. And that opportunity is now. We're really trying to make that happen in the next 30 to 60 days with all our respective suppliers in those categories.  When I think about the billion dollar opportunity and 60% of it is a combination of indirect and commodity deflation, probably good way to think about that is, it's going to be anywhere from two-thirds as indirect to maybe 55% indirect and kind of in that range and the difference will be commodity deflation. That kind of sizes it for you for this year. And then, we'll see how we progress throughout the remainder of the year. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. We'd like to thank everyone for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker\u2019s 2020 second quarter conference call. On the call in addition to myself is Jim Loree, President and CEO\u2026 \u2026this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning\u2019s call will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim and Don will review our 2020 second quarter results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller, and as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements on the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It\u2019s therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree. Jim Loree : Okay. Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone. It\u2019s great to be here with you today and now we are about five months in since COVID-19 began to roll across the globe. And while this pandemic has created an incredibly challenging time for all of us, it has also cast a new and very positive light on our portfolio as three powerful trends have emerged, which worked to our significant benefit. First, there\u2019s the sudden acceleration in the shift to e-commerce, and then there is a reconnection with the home and garden and a trend towards nesting and DIY, and thirdly, a newfound societal obsession with health and safety, read security. The combination of these trends has profound and exciting implications for our future growth and strategic positioning, but more on that in just a few moments. In the meantime, we just completed what I would characterize as one of the most storied and most successful quarters we have experienced in my 21 years as a C level executive at this company. It was successful based on the sheer magnitude of the challenges we faced and overcame, and it was also successful in that we have managed to operate effectively and maintain the strength of our enterprise throughout the crisis to-date, while further strengthening the company and positioning it for even better margin performance and growth as we take stock here in the middle innings and we look forward. Let me give you a sense of some of the accomplishments our team has racked up since this crisis began. We were able to operate continuously across the globe with only minor and temporary supply disruptions, while protecting our employees and maintaining the highest health and safety standards. We managed to handle with remarkable efficiency. The most volatile intra-quarter demand swings we have ever experienced, beginning in the first four weeks of April. During which revenues were down approximately 40%, followed by an explosive May and June, which brought our point-of-sale in North American retail to stratospheric levels that we have never seen before. Security revenues also improved dramatically as the quarter progressed. We took swift and decisive cost actions early in the crisis, announcing a $1 billion annual cost reduction initiative in April, of which $175 million was realized in the second quarter. Our margin resiliency initiative now in its second year contributed to this impressive performance. We substantially raised our second quarter revenue planning assumptions twice during the quarter, while maintaining our cost reductions intact. This bodes well for the remainder of the year and we were able to upgrade our internal full year revenue and margin scenario analyses accordingly. Now our current base case for full year 2020 revenue and operating margin exceeds what we thought our best case was for the year back in April. And as a consequence of the better 2Q volume, in conjunction with our cost and margin actions, we delivered $3.1 billion of revenue and $1.60 in EPS. Our operating margin rate came in at 12.8%, just 200 basis points lower than in second quarter 2019. And the Tools & Storage business logged an impressive 17% segment operating margin rate, flat with prior year, which means that that business achieved its previous peak margin performance in what we currently believe will be the trough quarter in the cycle for tools with revenues down 16%. As we enter July, given the uncertain economic outlook ahead, we decided to convert the run rate financial impact of our temporary salaried workforce reductions into permanent savings. We will implement this in early October by eliminating our temporary salaried actions that is furloughs and modified work weeks, returning 9,300 employees to a full work schedule, while transferring the remaining 1,000 or so to permanent reduction status. This action will be a major step in ensuring the sustainability of the bulk of our $1 billion cost reduction actions and we believe it paves the way for us to manage successfully through any reasonable economic scenario, which may unfold in the coming months. In the back half of the quarter, with the supply chain performing and the cost reductions intact, we decided to identify a series of supercharged growth initiatives, which we will pursue in addition to the ones already in place. These initiatives have become even more attractive as a result of trends catalyzed by COVID-19 and are being funded as we speak. We expect these initiatives, which include exercising our option to acquire the remaining 80% of MTD, most likely in early 2022 to contribute $3 billion to $4 billion of incremental annual revenue beginning in 2022. All of that execution occurred, while our salaried workforce was working remotely for the most part. We accomplished so much so fast during this time frame that we gained a new appreciation for the art of the possible when the power of people is combined with the power of today\u2019s collaboration technologies. And finally, I would be remiss, as I think of our second quarter accomplishments if I didn\u2019t reference the incredible resiliency and dedication of our people. It was the extraordinary people in our factories, distribution centers, service centers, call centers, as well as our field techs and the salaried people in their homes that took a leap of faith and trusted that we could operate continuously, safely and successfully during this time, when everyone is dealing with extraordinary personal and other challenges. And it is to them that we owe a debt of gratitude and thanks for a job well done under extremely difficult circumstances. Throughout the crisis, we have remained focused on our key COVID-19 era priorities, which we shared with you earlier this year, first, ensuring the health and safety of our employees and supply chain partners, second, maintaining business continuity and financial strength and stability, third, serving our customers who provide essential products and services, and fourth, doing our part to help mitigate the impact of the virus across the globe. Our number one priority has been and continues to be the health and safety of our people and supply chain partners. We continue to take significant measures to protect our 30,000-plus employees in our plants and distribution centers and other essential facilities. On a tactical level, we established a mandatory mask policy in all locations in April, along with temperature taking and health questionnaires for all people entering facilities. We have continuously enforced social distancing, modifying our facilities and production lines where necessary. We implemented intensive standardization protocols in all of our operations as well and we formed a corporate safety committee of senior execs and specialists to review and monitor compliance with our COVID-19 safety protocols and hired Chief Medical Officer specializing in infectious disease control as part of that committee. We review every suspected case for root cause, trace it to completion where possible and respond with appropriate actions as we continue to learn more about the virus and its transmission characteristics. And as you would expect, with geographic hotspots in California, Texas, the Carolinas, Mexico, Brazil and others, all areas where we have significant operations, we have seen our share of confirmed cases, which as of today, number approximately 300 or about one-half of 1% of our total workforce. Notably, both Europe and Asia have been very quiet and we have had only one confirmed case in China during the entire crisis, remarkable given that we have 10 plants and 8,000 people there. The vast majority of confirmed cases have resulted from contracting the virus, while colleagues were out in their local communities or were visiting with friends and our family or were in a hospital for an unrelated matter. And as a result, we have been conducting a massive educational campaign for our associates through two global safety timeouts and several other approaches. We seek to ensure their effect based understanding of risks and required safety protocols and to reinforce how our employees can stay safe at work and in the community. There\u2019s a lot of information -- misinformation out in the public regarding this virus and the common understanding is necessary to keep people as healthy and safe as possible. And with so many of our associates homebound, our people are operating remotely in new and efficient ways, and we are seeing many unanticipated benefits of this future of work. It has allowed us to virtually flatten the organization, incorporating more diverse perspectives into decision-making, and enabling faster and more efficient collaboration. Going forward, remote and hybrid office remote work will facilitate flexible working arrangements for our salaried people, enabling the reduction of our office real estate footprint, opening up new access to talent across the globe. And as we move forward, we will continue to have offices as activity hubs. However, there will be many associates who will continue to work remotely by choice and only be in the office when necessary or convenient. As mentioned, one of our key COVID-19 era priorities is to focus on doing our part to help our communities and governments mitigate the spread and impact of the virus. Earlier this year, we announced plans to contribute $10-plus million to support pandemic response efforts around the world. In that spirit, we have already deployed millions of dollars to support non-profits that are providing critical services such as hospitals and other healthcare organizations, as well as those focused on basic services such as food banks. We are also donating more than one million masks across North America in support of elder care facilities. Finally, we have initiated a $5 million employee relief fund to help our own associates and their families around the globe who have encountered severe financial hardships in connection with the pandemic. In addition to cash contributions, we have formed a task force that is focused on leveraging our people\u2019s time and talents to create innovative solutions aimed at COVID-19 relief. An example of this is our partnership with Ford and 3M to design and produce lithium-ion powered respirators. And lastly, we are teaming up with private sector organizations such as the U.S. Chamber, the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers, as well as with individual state and local governments in support of their efforts to battle the virus. Our philanthropic work here is never done and we are all in working to do our part in living our purpose. And now I would like to comment on our position regarding racial justice. On June 3rd, in the wake of the brutal slaying of George Floyd, I issued a statement on behalf of the company. I will share some brief excerpts from that statement. Quote, there is no place in society for this type of racism and brutality. We are for those who demand justice, take a stand for equality and commit to inclusivity for all. We have seen anguish and unrest resulting from racism and implicit bias. The deep-rooted history of these truths is real. We stand to do better. We intend to listen, understand and take action for the African-American community within Stanley Black & Decker and at large, end of quote. We are committed to doing a part to level the playing field. Since early June, our senior executives including me, as well as our non-executive Board members have had extensive dialogues with our black associates to build a shared understanding of their experiences with racism and bias to determine concrete actions we can take to address equality, equal opportunity, career advancement, diversity and inclusion as we committed. We have commissioned a task force, which has recently made substantive recommendations, which we will move forward with in the second half and beyond, and many of these actions will have benefits that will spillover to other diverse cohorts as well and we see an opportunity for real positive change going forward. So I hope that summary gives you a window into what we have been doing to effect positive change during the busiest, most productive and most challenging environment we faced during my tenure. We feel really positive about what our team has accomplished and how the company is positioned to deal with, both the opportunities and the challenges ahead. And I will now turn it over to Don Allan to provide the business details for second quarter, as well as a deep dive into our scenario planning for the back half of 2020. Don? Don Allan : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the second quarter. Tools & Storage revenue declined 16% as volume was down 16%, currency contributed an additional one point of pressure, while the impact to price was a positive 1%. The positive impact to price was driven by the benefits from our actions in response to continued tariff and currency headwinds. The operating margin rate for the segment was 17%, flat to the prior year with the benefits from productivity, cost control and price offset the impacts from lower volume, tariffs and currency. The segment delivered decremental margins in the teens, which is an outstanding result and a reflection of a strong operational performance by the Tools & Storage team. They were quick to execute on the cost actions and productivity opportunities, while also demonstrating excellent agility by responding to the higher North American demand levels that emerged in the middle of the quarter. So let\u2019s now take a look at the regions for Tools & Storage and starting with North America, which was down 10%. U.S. retail was flat organically as channel inventory reductions early in the quarter were offset by the strong underlying demand trends that emerged in mid-April. This demand inflection was primarily driven by a DIY phenomena that started shortly after the lockdowns emerged. The end-users refocus on the home has increased activity levels for our categories resulting in historically high POS levels. We experienced multiple weeks that demonstrated POS growth in the 30%s, 40%s or even over 50%. While we do not know the duration of this trend, we can report that the strong POS has continued into the first four weeks of July. More details on these July trends a bit later in my presentation. Additionally, retail customer store inventories are now at historically low levels, and therefore, we are well beyond the Q2 inventory corrections with our North American retail partners and are currently experiencing shipment growth in line with POS demand. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the U.S. commercial and industrial tool channels experienced more significant organic declines, down 44% and 25%, respectively, due to the impacts from shutdowns and reduced construction activity. We saw some positive indications in June, as re-openings occurred and activity resumed within our more pro focused end markets. But we expect a slower recovery in these channels compared to the incredibly strong result in retail. Europe started the quarter very slow as revenues declined by approximately 45% in April, improved during May and by June revenues were flat versus prior year, resulting in a decline of 21% for the full quarter. The U.K., France and Southern Europe led the declines, while the Nordics with limited shutdowns posted high single-digit growth. With all major European markets reopened by June, we saw improved demand, which has continued into July. The emerging markets were down 29% in the quarter, as these regions were significantly impacted by customer closures and government restrictions implemented to control the virus. All regions were -- within emerging markets declined. Asia improved sequentially from the first quarter but was still down 20% organically. There were a few bright spots with South Korea and Vietnam showing double-digit growth. Latin America saw the most meaningful impacts down 38%, driven by significant declines in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. The performance during the quarter was very choppy and the environment remains more challenging than the other regions as the virus impacts are still very prevalent in Latin America. That gives all of you some interesting details on a geographic basis for Tools & Storage. Now let\u2019s take a quick look at the second quarter performance by SBU. Power tools and equipment declined 9% as continued momentum behind commercial execution and new product introductions were more than offset by the volume impacts from the pandemic. Hand tools, accessories and storage declined 23% due to steep declines in our industrial tool channels and international markets, which this SBU has more exposure to. This SBU also dealt with some, obviously, some difficult comp dynamics associated with last year\u2019s fantastic Craftsman rollout. Both of these SBUs benefited from positive global trends in e-commerce and DIY, e-commerce continues to grow rapidly and it represented nearly 15% of the global 2Q Tools & Storage revenue. With our leading global market position in e-commerce and our strong stable brands, we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on these two accelerating trends. As we look ahead, we are making additional targeted investments to further maximize these significant market opportunities as they continue to gain momentum. For example, we see opportunity to expand our e-commerce initiatives into several key geographies where our current presence is limited, and of course, we have the exciting Black & Decker initiative in North America, which we just began about a year ago, which will leverage both the e-commerce and DIY trends. The Tools & Storage team did an amazing job managing the business to an incredibly turbulent period of time and demonstrated great flexibility and agility, a fantastic outcome given the environment they needed to navigate. Let\u2019s shift to the industrial segment. Total growth was negative 20%, which included a 10-point benefit from the CAM acquisition, offset by a 29% volume decline and a negative 1 point from currency. Operating margin rate was down year-over-year to 8.8%, as the impact from volume declines was partially mitigated by cost actions. Engineered Fastening organic revenues were down 35%, driven by lower global light vehicle and general industrial production. The declines were broad based with all regions impacted. As you would expect, automotive fasteners and systems experienced a 43% decline as global light vehicle production was down 47% in the quarter. The general industrial markets remain weak, but the declines in our industrial fastener business were less severe, only down 24%, as it benefited from serving essential industries, as well as the return of manufacturing activity in May and June. Broadly across our regions and end-markets, underlying demand improved each month of the quarter. Therefore, we currently believe 2Q represented the trough for this business and recovery will continue to build momentum, now that global automotive production and general industrial activity have resumed. The infrastructure businesses declined 19% in the second quarter due to lower volume in oil and gas, which was down mid-single digits and a 25% organic decline in attachment tools. While this overall segment was particularly hard hit with factory closures and reduced industrial activity, the teams worked hard to manage cost and limit decremental margins that they prepare to participate in a recovery going forward. I would like to call out the attachment tools business specifically for their agility. Even with the steep market driven declines, which I mentioned 25% down, they were able to maintain a mid-teens operating margin rate for the quarter, well done. Finally, I will review the security segment, which was another positive within the quarter, as they performed better than initial expectations. Revenue declined 11% as volume was down 9%. They also had a 1 point negative impact from divestitures, a 2 point decline from currency and price was a positive 1%. North America organic growth declined 7% and Europe was down 10% as all businesses were impacted by government and customer restrictions, which were more pronounced clearly earlier in the quarter. We saw this dynamic improve in May and June, allowing us to perform more installation and maintenance activity. Backlog remains in a healthy position. It is up 16%, positioning us well for continued improvement in the back half of 2020. In terms of profitability, the segment operating margin was down 160 basis points to 9.6%, as price and cost control were more than offset by lower volume. This is a strong performance for security as they implemented swift cost control actions and were able to pivot to increase demand as things shifted in May and June. We also believe that the security business can now energize its commercial activities around new transformational revenue opportunities related to safety, such as proximity, entry and identity management software solutions. We believe these growth opportunities will help us take the business transformation to the next level in the coming year or two. So in summary, the second quarter was a challenging environment as we navigated the pandemic, but thankfully less extreme than feared. The outperformance to our initial expectations was a result of our team\u2019s resiliency and strong operational execution, enabling us to deliver approximately $175 million in cost actions and productivity opportunities, which helped to minimize our decremental margins to 25%, which were close to 10 points better than initial perspective. Let\u2019s now briefly look at our free cash flow performance and a refresher on liquidity on the next page. On a year-to-date basis, our use of cash is $224 million, which is $107 million behind the prior year. The primary drivers are lower earnings, as well as the working capital decisions that we made to ensure we are prepared for potential second half improvements in demand, primarily related to strong Tools & Storage U.S. retail trends. Lower capital expenditures partially offset these impacts reflecting our focus on capital conservation and maintaining a robust liquidity position as we navigate the current environment. In terms of our liquidity and balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $860 million of cash on hand. Our strong investment-grade credit rating continues to provide us with the uninterrupted access to commercial paper. Following the successful remarketing of our preferred equity units in May, we used the $750 million of proceeds to pay down the short-term debt. We now currently have approximately $2.3 billion of capacity on our $3 billion CP program. As you can see, we have maintained enough flexibility from a liquidity standpoint, with a total potential of $3.2 billion available, as of quarter end. As a reminder, we do not have any long-term debt maturities coming due until the fourth quarter of 2021. Our capital deployment priorities remain focused on debt repayment and achieving our leverage targets. To support these priorities, we have kept in place our planned 2020 capital expenditure reductions and are continuing to suspend M&A and share repurchase activity for the time being. Also, as a reminder, the company withdrew its full year guidance in April, as a result of the uncertain macro environment and we will continue to refrain from providing such guidance at this time. Similar to April, I would now like to provide some insights on our second half scenario planning, as well as recent trends and revenue. While we have a much better appreciation for the depth and duration of the trough across our businesses, the trajectory of the economic recovery remains uncertain. As such, we are preparing for a variety of demand scenarios that may occur and we will remain flexible in our approach. The left-side of this page provides a segment view of our second half organic growth planning assumptions. And our June and July forecasted shipment trends, as well as our color -- as our color on the region or sub business performances relative to the recent trends. We also show some other recent key trends on the right side of the page, which are providing us additional insights into our potential second half revenue performance. For Tools & Storage, our planning assumption for second half organic growth ranges from negative 3% to a positive 4%. A key factor in this range is the sustainability of the very strong growth in U.S. retail demand, that\u2019s largely been driven by the surge in DIY and e-commerce. As mentioned earlier, we have seen record POS and it continues into July. POS was up 33% versus the prior year in the first four weeks of Q3. If these trends continue, you can clearly see a line of sight to positive growth for the segment in the back half. So we are watching the U.S. consumer trends very closely. We are also watching the potential for the extending of the stimulus packages, here in the United States, and finally, looking at the continued return of our pro focused activity, which all of these could help support or sustain these recent trends. The remaining portions of the tool business, such as our U.S. commercial and industrial channels, as well as international operations all carry deeper troughs within Q2. Many are on a recovery trajectory and the slope of that improvement will also influence the high and the low-end of this range. Europe Tools & Storage has seen strong performance over the past eight weeks with organic growth in the high single digits. Asia clearly is further along than Latin America in this recovery. However, Latin America, which now much better than the depth of the downturn, continues to be very slow as far as its improvement trajectory, as the region addresses that spread of the virus and has difficulty in containing it. Our midpoint for the Tools & Storage second half organic growth assumes, one, POS continues to moderate from current levels but still strong for the entire second half of 2020, two, Europe continues to see growth but slightly moderated versus the last eight weeks, and three, U.S. commercial and industrial, as well as emerging markets are slow to recover. The recent revenue performance in the segment revealed a strong organic growth rate globally of 8% for the last eight weeks, which likely supports a view that tools is trending towards the high-end of the planning assumption range. For industrial, our planning assumption is an organic growth range that is down 25% to 15% in the second half of 2020. This business is facing some of the company\u2019s most difficult end markets. The last eight weeks, the shipment trends were down 23% organically. Our midpoint of the above mentioned range would assume continued improvement across Q3 and Q4 from what we believe to be the trough in the second quarter. As you look at the business trend over the last eight weeks, we see that Engineered Fastening is tracking in the low 20s as both auto and industrial focused markets continue to gradually improve. Another trend to look at in assessing our view on the auto portion of Engineered Fastening is that light vehicle production is down approximately 17% for the last eight weeks. The attachment tool trends are negative high-teens, while oil and gas and aerospace fasteners on a pro forma basis are weaker than the planning band of a negative 25% to 50% for the whole segment. Given all these facts in the industrial area, it appears this segment is currently trending to the midpoint of the planning range. For security, we expect this business to be relatively stable and continue its improvement trajectory with a second half range of down 8% to flat. This business is demonstrating a 4% decline in the last eight weeks, so continues to show improving trends. Although, the recovery is mixed by country, backlog remains strong which supports an opportunity for sequential improvement with installation and maintenance activity. Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, new security and safety needs in factories, offices and healthcare environments emerging from the virus should create exciting new revenue opportunities for the business to capitalize upon starting in the back half of the year. As you aggregate these planning range assumptions for the total company, we see three scenarios. First, on the low-end, we see the potential for a 7.5% organic revenue decline in the back half. This would represent a choppy recovery for our end markets. For this to occur, we would have to see significant moderation in POS trends for North American tools and slower recovery trajectories in all the different areas of the company. Our base case, which is the midpoint, is down organically just below 4%. This represents a broad continuation of recovery trends across the businesses and continued strength in Tools North America, particularly in the third quarter. As it relates to the third quarter, this scenario embeds low to mid single-digit growth within Global Tools, sequential improvement versus 2Q within security and industrial growth that declines in the low 20s. Finally, our high scenario or improving case is relatively flat organic revenue performance in the back half of the company. Broadly this would assume slightly more accelerated recovery scenarios within the businesses and North American retail POS trends continuing at very strong levels through the fourth quarter. Our company organic revenue trend in the last eight weeks is modestly positive. So this is one factor that makes us feel that this optimistic scenario is possible, however, not quite probable at this stage. While this is a broad range versus our normal environment for revenue, we feel it\u2019s prudent to prepare for all of these scenarios, both to ensure that we have sized our cost base appropriately for the pessimistic end of the range and to ensure we are prepared in our supply chain if the markets are better. Moving to the cost reduction program slide, first, I want to remind you how we are approaching this initiative. We have targeted four areas of opportunity within our cost reduction program, indirect spend, compensation and headcount, employee benefit modifications, and raw material deflation. We see this as a $1 billion savings opportunity over the next 12 months, with $500 million benefiting this year. Approximately 60% of this is made up of indirect spend and deflation, with the balance consisting of compensation and benefit actions. We got off to a fast start in the program in the second quarter and we are approximately $50 million ahead from an execution perspective. This was the result of a swift implementation across the entire company. At this point, we are maintaining our 2020 estimate of $500 million of savings, which implies that we should realize about $325 million in the second half. As you think about the total program over the next 12 months, we are still on track to deliver $1 billion. The organization has been working diligently on ensuring that these cost actions are highly sustainable heading into 2021. As Jim mentioned in his opening remarks, we are converting a significant portion of the temporary compensation actions, such as furloughs and reduced work weeks to permanent actions. While a very difficult decision, this was needed to prepare the business for what remains an uncertain demand environment and it removes the significant uncertainty for many of our employees who are impacted by these temporary actions, which were approximately 10,000 employees. It will also help ensure our compensation related actions are sustainable and we will have no snap back as we look into 2021. As it relates to indirect spend, the teams currently have about half of the savings identified as sustainable. We are working to push this higher potentially up to 75%. Based on external research for these types of programs, a very good result is 50% sustainability and 70% will be a best-in-class result. So this is a significant amount of forward progress as it relates to the implementation and sustainability of our cost program. At this point, we feel that two-thirds of the $1 billion program can be permanent. This would result in a positive 2021 carryover or tailwind of approximately $150 million. So now let\u2019s address decremental margins for 2020. We are assuming we can limit the decremental margins net of cost cutting to the mid- to high-teens in our base case. Clearly, this is a volume dependent and you can see better decremental margins potentially mid-teens in our improved case. If we experience a choppy recovery, they could potentially be 20% to 21% this year. As a reminder, our decremental margin performance peak to trough during the last two recessions was contained to mid- to high-teens, so these are very relevant compared to our current 2020 view. I would like to wrap-up my comments by summarizing our 2020 planning assumptions on slide 10. From a revenue perspective, we see the potential for a range of down 7.5% to flat for second half organic revenue, which puts the full year decline in a range of 5% to 10%. Our planning assumptions limit decremental margins, net of cost savings to mid- to high-teens for the full year 2020, with a range of outcomes dependent on volumes, as I just mentioned. From a cost structure perspective, we have $180 million of savings included in our estimate or range assumptions our -- from our Q4 2019 cost reduction program and expect an additional $500 million from the cost actions announced last quarter. Tariffs and FX are currently expected to be $180 million headwind, with $115 million of that behind us in the first half. Finally, as you see in the middle of this page, we have disclosed our planning assumptions for the below the line items. So as you work through your models of various business scenarios please utilize this information. From a cash perspective, our focus is capital conservation and deleveraging. We are maintaining our capital expenditure reductions in our temporary suspension of M&A and share repurchase activity. We will keep a sharp focus on working capital management and have aligned our supply chain with the recent trends and will modulate accordingly based on the trajectory of the recovery. We believe we are continuing to take the appropriate actions given the current environment and we are maintaining our approach to planning around a range of outcomes. Should growth or cost savings track ahead, we will remain flexible and reinvest in key areas, which could enhance growth in the short-term and mid-term. We are prepared to react and respond as recovery continues either at a rapid pace, a choppy pace or any scenario in between. Thank you and I will now return it back to Jim. Jim Loree : Thanks, Don. We continue to execute on a number of outstanding growth catalysts, which position us for continued market share gains, as well as buffering the shocks of a volatile global economy, like, we are experiencing in 2020. The Craftsman brand remains a key element of our growth strategy and we continue to see a strong customer response, excellent growth and remain well on our path towards $1 billion. This brand, with its enduring value proposition, is well-positioned to benefit from the positive trends we have seen in North American DIY. We are continuing to invest in our innovation machine, bringing the new core and breakthrough innovations to market, and most recently, our DEWALT product line has had innovations that span the power spectrum. DEWALT, ATOMIC and XTREME provide the highest power to late ratio tools in the market, while FLEXVOLT is reaching up into higher power categories where we continue to introduce new tools that are cordless for the first time. And during 2019, we also closed on a 20% stake in MTD Holdings, a leading outdoor power equipment manufacturer. This is an exciting opportunity to increase our presence in both the gas and electric outdoor power equipment markets, with the first opportunity to purchase the remaining 80% beginning in the middle of 2021. MTD continues to make progress on improving their operating margins and is also benefiting from the focus on the Home & Garden nesting phenomenon that has emerged in recent months. And as I mentioned earlier, downturns are a time of opportunity, as well as a time of disruption. So, for example, we are the tools industry leader in e-commerce with global 2019 online revenues of $1.3 billion. But with a sudden acceleration and a shift to e-commerce, our growth opportunity here has become immense. To put it in perspective, it took a decade for e-commerce to become 10% of our revenue, and almost overnight, it grew to nearly 15% of sales and is increasing quickly, with our market position, brands, digital capabilities and global customer relationships, what a great opportunity to build upon our strengths in this area. With its excellent margins, this is one of the major growth areas that will attract significant new investment from us in the second half and beyond. And in a matter of months, society has discovered a newfound obsession with health and safety. This in turn has thrust our security business with its healthcare, electronic security and automatic doors businesses, smack in the middle of a new growth landscape. For example, we are commercializing new solutions such as automated entrance management with temperature monitoring, contact and proximity tracing, and touchless stores for commercial buildings and manufacturing plants. We are allocating resources to scale these solutions and benefit quickly from these new sources of potential growth. We expect all of these growth catalysts, which include exercising our option to acquire the remaining 80% of MTD, most likely in early 2022 to contribute $3 billion to $4 billion of incremental annual revenue beginning in 2022, a great long-term growth story as we look ahead to the future. So in closing, we are delighted with the second quarter performance under the circumstances. We were able to quickly pivot to serve a rapidly improving demand environment and weathered in good stead what we currently believe to be a trough revenue performance for the year, maintaining an intense focus on cost control and delivering on the improved demand trends within the quarter, we are able to limit the impact to our margin rates and deliver $1.60 of EPS. Unfortunately, we were in a strong position going into the crisis, and with the dedication and commitment of our talented, diverse management team and all of our great people are taking the necessary actions to stay strong during the crisis and to emerge from it even stronger. We are now ready for Q&A Dennis. Thank you. Dennis Lange : Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Good morning, Jim. Good morning, Don. Jim Loree : Hi Nigel. Don Allan : Good morning. Nigel Coe : Hi. So I want to start off with the, first of all, thanks for details, these are fantastic on the second half of the year. On decremental margins, I just want to confirm the FY\u201920, mid- to high-teens commitment, implies second half closer to low- to mid-teens, I think, if we have taken the 24% decremental in the first half of the year, is that correct, number one? And number two, assuming that industrial is going to be a bit fresh in the back half of the year, it seems to imply that tools margins potentially up in the back half of the year. I just want to make sure that we think about this correctly? Thanks. Jim Loree : Yeah. So, on your first question, that\u2019s an accurate kind of view of the decrementals in the back half. Yeah, I think, the margins for industrial will be a very pressured especially in the third quarter, but get better in the fourth quarter, but they still won\u2019t be improving year-over-year, but at this stage, we do think tool margins will be improving in the back half year-over-year. But probably will be more improvement in Q3 than Q4 right now, due to various comp and other matters, but also our insight for Q3 is very clear versus the insight for Q4 is still a little unclear. So that\u2019s probably another factor in that analysis as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open. Tim Wojs : Hey, everybody. Good morning. Nice job on the second quarter. Jim Loree : Hi, Tim. Don Allan : Hi, Tim. Jim Loree : Thanks, Tim. Tim Wojs : Just my question is on inventory really within the tools business. Just wondering if you could provide just color on where you think channel inventory is relative to normal. And as you are talking to your customers, just how long do you think it takes back to get to whatever, I guess, is normal? Just -- it seems like it could be a multi-quarter tailwind if you are only shipping the POS now. So just some color there on what you think inventory levels are relative to normal and how long it could take to get back? Jim Loree : Yeah. I mean, inventory levels are exceedingly low and pretty much as low as I have seen in my time here. And I think the customers would probably prefer to have higher inventories, if they could. But as you pointed out, we are simply keeping up with POS right now. We were fortunate that we built a pretty substantial amount of inventory early in the quarter when we started to see, the POS dramatically outperform the shipments and the customers in the beginning of the quarter were still in the process of an inventory correction themselves and then it took them a while to realize that the POS needed to be replenished like ASAP in the middle of the quarter and the orders started rolling in, probably in the back half of the quarter. But by then, with our supply chain cycle time, we are fortunately producing sufficient inventory to at least keep up with the POS and actually it took us a while to get to the point where we were keeping up with POS. There was substantial inventory drain in the channel throughout the quarter stabilizing pretty much near the end and then has been stable for several weeks now. Don Allan : Yeah. And my comments in the script, and what Jim said, we don\u2019t want to leave the impression that the inventory levels are so low that it\u2019s causing major issues with the end-user. But then when you look at the weeks of stock and you look at the typical range of anywhere from nine weeks to 15 weeks depending on customer, we are definitely at the very low end of that range and so that\u2019s a factor in as we think about going forward. And we are producing enough products in the tool space that if there is a desire of our customers later in the year to restock. We will have the ability to do that, even if the POS continues to run at the levels it\u2019s trending at now. Operator : Our next question comes from Markus Mittermaier with UBS. Your line is open. Markus Mittermaier : Yeah. Hi. Good morning, everyone and thanks for the scenario. Very\u2026 Jim Loree : Good morning. Markus Mittermaier : Hi. Very, very helpful. Can I ask about the positive carryover into 2021 that you mentioned the 150 million? Just confirming that this is pre any of the supply chain changes and potential cost savings that you might have from that by rearranging the China supply into Europe and the U.S.? So that would be incremental on top of that and then like is there any change maybe pulling that plan a bit more forward in time, would be great if you could elaborate on that? Thank you. Don Allan : Yeah. I mean, maybe the best way to answer that question, because it\u2019s a very good question is that, if you think about our margin resiliency program, which Jim commented on related to how it contributed to this year\u2019s cost actions. We still think there\u2019s a great deal of value going forward in that program and we believe this a range of $300 million to $500 million of opportunity that we can capture over the next three years to four years. And part of that will be what you are talking about really shifting the supply chain and the value opportunities that happened there associated with that. There\u2019s also many other things associated with Industry 4.0, advanced analytics, better pricing, analytical and technology tools. I mean, our organizations have really digitized themselves and the supply chain continues to do that to really create more value on a go-forward basis. So one of the really positives that\u2019s coming out of this crisis is that we are not like depleting our margin resiliency value creation. We still see a great deal of value going forward. And at this point, I would just assume it\u2019s probably $100 million to $150 million per year for the next three years, starting next year. We will certainly refine that as we get closer to the end of this year. But -- that is an opportunity that we will continue to pursue, and as you can see, there are a lot of values still associated with it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nicole DeBlase : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Jim Loree : Good morning. Don Allan : Good morning. Nicole DeBlase : So, I am going to ask one really easy question and so I was hoping maybe you could make an exception and answer two for me. First, on just the cost savings the remaining 3, -- what is it $325 million for the rest of this year. How does that split between 3Q and 4Q? And then, I guess, my bigger question is, when we think about the DIY potentially, I guess, as people go back to work. What\u2019s the potential that that could be offset by the pro coming back as that is kind of compensated? Don Allan : Yeah. The first one is it\u2019s a pretty even split between Q3 and Q4 and then I will pass your second question over to Jim. Jim Loree : Yeah. I mean, actually, I think they are both relatively easy questions, because, clearly, the DIY fade is something that makes logical sense. When you take into account the factor, even if there is a stimulus, which I suspect there will be, it will be a lower dollar amount than we have seen thus far, and so, I think, that there probably will be some POS fade. I just -- it\u2019s unsustainable to keep circa 40% POS going for a long, long period of time. So, yeah, I think that\u2019s probably going to happen. But the pro has been pretty much on hold very, very quiet in terms of what we are seeing there, and of course, with the housing market potentially heating up here and if the urbanization and so forth, it\u2019s likely to go on and starting to go on, likely to continue and so forth. I think we are going to see a fair amount of pros coming back into the mix from the sidelines. So I think there is some potential that that could happen. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone and congrats on all the results and the efforts so far. Jim Loree : Thanks, Michael. Thanks. Michael Rehaut : I had a question around the cost savings program. Wasn\u2019t sure, when you talked about still reiterating the $4 billion [ph] of savings -- $1 billion of savings and $500 million in 2020, from what I understand a portion of both of which is the temporary actions that you had said prior to this call is maybe about 30% of the overall total. At the same time, you are talking about welcoming back 9,000 employees, which is wonderful, but it\u2019s -- I understood that part of that was perhaps part of the temporary actions. So just trying to get a sense for and then you talked also about the carryover at $150 million, which is close to that two-thirds of the overall actions being permanent. So just trying to get a sense for the remaining third, how that flows through and maybe the timing of that, if perhaps the solve in kind of talking about working to get those type reactions permanent. But it doesn\u2019t seem like maybe in the next six to 12 months, you will get that $4 billion, if I am understanding that right, but perhaps, you could walk us through that? Don Allan : I think the way to think about it, Michael is that, if we got the $4 billion obviously, we have another $0.5 billion of incremental benefit in 2021. But we do recognize that that\u2019s probably not likely that we are going to get that type of carryover. Because we are going to have some of these temporary things that come back into our systems such as, we have suspended certain employee benefits as an example, that\u2019s going to be something we can tolerate as an organization for one year. But we can\u2019t continue that into next year, so that will be something that comes back into our cost base. We did some of these temporary compensation things that we are reversing for the reasons we articulated, which will create kind of an incremental cost next year year-over-year. But then we are shifting into -- and we have some things in indirect that we did temporarily this year that will increase in our cost base next year. But then what we are doing is we are focusing in other categories where we are taking permanent headcount actions here right now through, as Jim mentioned, into September timeframe. That would kind of help offset a portion of that. And then, we also are trying to sustain some of these indirect savings, so they are permanent. And so ultimately, when you look at the $1 billion that we have gone after, we think we found $650 million of it roughly that is permanent. And when you do all the math of all those pluses and minuses, and Dennis can give you a little more detail off-line, if you would like. You are going to get a situation where you get a value of $500 million this year, it\u2019s incremental over last year and you are getting at a value of $150 million incremental next year over this year and that\u2019s really how it works. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Jim Loree : Good morning. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just a question around the tools margins for the medium-term. So looking at your guidance, it looks like the tools margins are back to that sort of 17% plus level in Q2 and the second half. Historically, that\u2019s where they have kind of peaked out. So I just wondered, as we look ahead, what type of incremental margins should we expect in tools when sales growth resumes. And do you think that in the medium-term an operating margin aspiration of sort of 19%, 20% or so is realistic given the margin resiliency efforts, so pushing through higher than those old peaks? Jim Loree : Yeah. And we are very, very pleased with the tools margins in this quarter, because they are pretty much at what have historically been peak levels at a time when revenue is in what we think is a trough in the cycle. So, yeah, I mean, I think, that\u2019s a very significant probability that they will accrete upwards. There are a lot of positive things that Don has talked about. And I have referred to relative to the impact on margins from the cost reductions, from margin resiliency, et cetera. And so I think it hopefully will foretell a very positive story in the future. And I think equally important is the lack of what we have had over the past few years, which have been really significant headwinds from the dollar -- the strength of the dollar, which is now kind of backed off a bit and hopefully will continue along those lines for a while. And also the tariffs are kind of anniversarying out here as we speak in the next quarter and inflation has turned into some deflation. So there are a lot of powerful things happening in the tools margin story that I think bodes very well for it going forward. There\u2019s always going to be new headwinds over time. So we can\u2019t get crazy about it, but clearly, the momentum is upward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Deepa Raghavan : Hi. Good morning all. Can you talk to\u2026 Jim Loree : Hi. Deepa Raghavan : \u2026what kind of initiatives are being taken other than just expanding -- other than just taking more -- taking the rest of the stake in MTD? If you can just focus on what kind of verticals or end markets, probably, perhaps, is it more DIY focused, maybe COVID-proof products, more eco -- more e-commerce friendly, et cetera? And just a broader question tagging to that is, in the process of managing through COVID, did you discover any new adjacent markets or newer opportunities you can expand into? Thank you. Jim Loree : Yes. That\u2019s great. It\u2019s a great question. And it\u2019s -- I was trying to kind of get at that with -- when I talked about the trends that had occurred with the advent of COVID. The first being the sudden shift into e-commerce and -- in terms of the revenue weighting and the consumer preferences. And then in addition to that, you have this kind of re-imagination and re-acclimation to the home. People spending time at home, doing projects at home and then also out in the garden and landscaping, so a lot of the DIY in that area. I think that\u2019s going to be a relatively, I will call it, a semi-permanent trend, which means, probably, for at least a couple of years, we will see that, and then finally, the obsession with health and safety. So all of those things play to our portfolio with the world\u2019s leading, certainly, world\u2019s leading tool business in a great position in e-commerce and in DIY both in the U.S. and in North America and in Europe. And then the MTD acquisition, which hopefully we will be able to do in early 2022, that\u2019s going really well in terms of the cost takeouts that we had -- are working with MTD on, making sure their margins get up to acceptable levels and also from a revenue point of view, MTD is doing quite well as well with significant growth at this period of time. So that\u2019s going to be a great story and that\u2019s probably going to be about $3 billion when we exercise that option of revenue that we are going to bring on probably at a weighted multiple when you take into account the first 20% and then the second 80% will weighted multiple, probably be in the 7 times to 8 times EBITDA range, which is going to be just fantastic. And then the security business, because of this newfound obsession with health and safety, the security business, which has what is today a relatively small but extremely sophisticated healthcare business that serves acute care facilities and elder living facilities and has very sophisticated technology in terms of IoT in particular in artificial intelligence using that business to help with contact tracing and other relevant healthcare applications and one of them being to the protection of elders in these elder care facilities, which as we all know is one of the great tragic stories of COVID-19. Most stakes are running around 50% plus of their deaths associated with elder care facilities. So we are going to be trying to help out with that as a social kind of project to help deal with safety in elder care facilities. And then the electronic security business, which, for a long time, has been on the bottle, if you will, certainly has now moved into the strike zone in terms of strategic relevance with all of its applications that relate to health, safety and security. So, yes, I think, it\u2019s a really great time for our portfolio based on what we see out there in the world today. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for any closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Shannon, thanks. We would like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thanks.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2020 second quarter conference call. On the call in addition to myself is Jim Loree, President and CEO and Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release which issued earlier this morning and the supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim and Don will review our 2020 third quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller.  And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements on the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and our most recent 34 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree. James Loree : Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone. What an eventful year it has been thus far. Going into 2020, we expected some volatility and uncertainty. However, no one could have anticipated the ups and downs and the twists and turns this year would take, and there's still two months ago.  As you saw from this morning's press release, our team is doing an impressive job managing through the trials and tribulations of this era. And I want to thank every one of our 54,000 plus associates who contributed to those results.  I'm happy to say that we nailed what was perhaps one of the best quarters in our history. Pick your metric \u2013 gross margin, operating margin, free cash flow, the list goes on.  For me, the most gratifying is the operating margin rate of 17.7%. We've proven over the decades since the Black & Decker merger that we can produce organic growth at a reasonably consistent 4% to 6%. However, our goal has always been to marry that up with relatively consistent operating margin rate accretion, with a goal of breaking through that 15% ceiling at some point. That has been elusive until now. In late 2017, we entered what turned out to be a three-year period of significant external headwinds caused by tariffs, cost inflation and FX pressures, all totaling approximately $1 billion of unfavorable margin impact.  With a lot of work and a strong constitution, we were able to offset those headwinds and generate a 6% EPS CAGR during that era. We also bought Irwin, Lenox and Craftsman, among others, and utilized those acquisitions to cement incredibly strong strategic partnerships with our two major home center partners in the US, as well as building a thriving e-commerce business, including a partnership with North America's largest e-commerce player.  And when the pandemic hit by April, we phased into four weeks of revenues down 40% as the world went into lockdown and most retail channel partners dramatically cut their ordering. In response, we beefed up our already strong liquidity position and took out $1 billion of cost, including $0.5 billion of indirect or non-people related costs. We managed to keep our supply chain running with only minor disruption, including operating over 100 plants around the globe, and have done so successfully throughout the pandemic.  Then a strange thing happened in North America. People stuck in their homes, began to do projects, some DIY, some through trades people and contractors, and POS at our retail partners began to skyrocket in May. It has been at unprecedented levels ever since. By May, retailer inventories were plummeting. And recognizing that our supply chain lead times would preclude us from serving the demand if it sustained, we took a decision to invest $600 million in fast moving inventory in advance of orders from retailers beginning in the May timeframe.  That turned out to be an excellent call. In the third quarter, construction and DIY tool revenues in Europe and the emerging markets began to recover, while North American retail stayed strong. This caused positive revisions to our revenue estimates and ultimately drove double-digit growth in tools in the third quarter, even while some of our revenue shifted into October in the final days of September.  So, with that as backdrop, why am I so excited about our record 17.7% operating margin rate? The reason is that we believe we've achieved a new range of profitability to couple with our continued organic growth. Yes, continued organic growth. We believe if 2021 is a reasonably stable economic year that the 40% of our portfolio than in 2020 will be significantly down organically \u2013 that is industrial and the security segments \u2013 as well as industrial tools will bounce back and become a positive. We also believe that tools and outdoor will be very strong in 2021, with channel inventory rebuilds and continued pandemic end demand at least into the first half.  Our e-commerce position, which will approach $2 billion in 2020, should also continue to be a robust growth driver as we capitalize on our strength and make continued investments to make it even stronger.  We also believe that approximately $625 million of our $1 billion cost takeout will stick, resulting in some carryover benefits next year and that the margin resiliency initiative will continue to bear fruit in 2021, yielding $100 million to $150 million of additional margin tailwind. Perhaps most refreshing of all is the absence of sizable new headwinds in the area of FX, inflation and tariffs.  For all those reasons, as we sit here today, amidst all the market uncertainty, we believe the growth and margin story is sustainable in the stop/start kind of pandemic economy that we're in. My comments do not contemplate a severely pressured 2021 global economy and we do not believe that scenario to be the likely case.  Our people have worked tirelessly to produce these results. Our third quarter financial performance reflects the agility, courage and common sense of our leaders and their teams under the circumstances. And we thank them for that.  Now for a few financial highlights. Total company third quarter revenues were $3.9 billion, up 6% versus prior year. This included 4% organic growth and a 2-point contribution from the CAM acquisition. And turning to profitability, we executed to deliver a gross margin rate of 35.9% or 160 basis points above that of prior year. And as mentioned, our operating margin rate was a record 17.7%, up 320 basis points. This achievement was the result of strong cost control, our margin resiliency initiative, volume leverage and price. And leading this performance was Tools & Storage, delivering 11% organic growth and a record 21.5% operating margin rate.  Industrial achieved sequential improvement in both revenue and margins despite a steep year-over-year market-driven organic decline and effective cost management to protect margins helped position the business for outstanding volume leverage during an eventual market recovery.  And lastly, Security delivered stable results even in this climate with just a modest decline in organic growth and relatively flat operating margin. We continue to transform this business and are investing to capture the emerging health and safety opportunity related to the pandemic. We're excited to realize the benefits from this multi-year transformation with a potential for organic growth with margin expansion in 2021 and beyond.  And finally, all of this was punctuated by record adjusted EPS of $2.89, which was up 36% versus last year, as well as $615 million of free cash flow in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to $391 million, up over $400 million year-over-year.  And as we look ahead, our well-established pandemic priorities remain consistent. First, ensuring the health and safety of our employees and our supply chain partners. Second, maintaining business continuity and financial strength and stability. Third, serving our customers as they provide essential products and services to the world. And fourth, doing our part to mitigate the impact of the virus across the globe.  The pandemic is not over yet. We are maintaining our focus and not letting our guard down as we enter the next phase and continue to manage with agility and resiliency. These priorities have helped us keep our employees as safe and secure as possible, operate continuously to serve our customers and to support our communities during this challenging period.  We will continue to exercise discipline on expenses and reap the benefits of the cost savings program put in place earlier this year. We are concurrently making investments in key growth areas associated with reconnecting with home and outdoors, e-commerce and health and safety even as we work to ensure that our operating margins stay in the 15% plus zip code.  In summary, it was a truly notable quarter and there's a lot to be excited about for the future, including MTD, which brings between $2 billion and $3 billion dollars of revenue and becomes executable beginning in July 2021.  Thank you. And I'll now turn it over to Don Allan to provide you more color on the third quarter as well as our scenario planning as we look to the fourth quarter and beyond. Donald Allan, Jr. : Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the third quarter. Tools & Storage delivered excellent revenue growth, volume up 10% and price contributing 1 point. The segment organic growth for the third quarter was impacted by the timing of promotional volume that ended up shipping in October versus our previous expectation of September. This represented approximately $100 million to $125 million for 4 to 5-point impact versus the 3Q revenue planning assumption we communicated in late August.  As many of you know, there is a significant amount of volume that goes into the channel for the fourth quarter holiday promotions during the September through October timeframe. You will see this timing shift included in the Q4 planning assumptions that I will review later. The third quarter operating margin rate was outstanding and clearly a record performance at 21.5% for Tools & Storage, up 490 basis points versus the prior year as volume, productivity, cost control and price delivered the strong margin rate expansion.  As volume growth accelerated, we experienced excellent operating leverage due to the significant adjustments to our cost base over the last six months in response to the pandemic.  Now, let's take a look at some of the geographies within Tools & Storage. North America was up 11% organically. US retail delivered 16% organic growth, driven by strong DIY and improving professional demand, along with continued momentum within the e-commerce platforms. POS remained very robust throughout the quarter as we experienced an average growth in the low 20s percentile over the entire third quarter. The US retail store inventory levels, although up slightly from the beginning of the quarter, remained significantly lower than last year.  The North American commercial and industrial tool channels continued to see a slower path of recovery compared to the strong results in US retail as the commercial channel declined 7% during the quarter. Within this channel, there are a mix of customers that serve both construction and industrial markets. If you look at pure play construction focused customers in this channel, greenshoots emerged and they delivered low single-digit organic growth for the quarter, a positive signal that the pro is returning. Finally, in North America, our industrial and automotive tools business declined 11%, which was a significant improvement from the 2Q decline of 25%.  Moving to Europe, Europe delivered 12% organic growth, benefiting from similar trends as North America, as well as channel inventory recoveries as these markets emerge from the Q2 shutdown. We believe the channel inventory increases represented approximately a third of the growth within this region.  The result was led by construction markets and was experienced across all major geographies, with the UK, Central Europe and Iberia up double digits, and France, Germany, Italy and the Nordics up mid to high single digits.  Organic growth in emerging markets was up 11%, led by pricing, improved demand and an inventory recovery. Latin America led the way and was up 12% in the quarter. The growth was broad based with Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Colombia up double digits, with Mexico and Peru up mid-single digits.  Asia was down low single digits in the quarter, with modest growth in South Korea, India, Japan, Malaysia and Vietnam, which was offset by declines in China and Southeast Asia.  And then finally, Russia and Turkey had very strong growth during Q3, contributing to the recovery for overall emerging markets.  Now, let's shift to the FPUs within Tools & Storage. Power tools and equipment delivered 22% organic growth, benefiting from strong commercial execution and new product introductions.  Despite the difficult comps earlier in the year, Craftsman is benefiting from the strong DIY and e-commerce momentum, resulting in growth significantly ahead of our expectations and starting to approach our annual goal of $1 billion in revenue.  Additionally, DeWalt is capturing the positive trajectory in the pro recovery, as well as new product introductions such as Power Detect and continued expansion of our Flexvolt, Atomic, and Xtreme breakthrough innovations into new product in Tools & Storage, which declined 5% for Q3.  New product introductions and DIY growth were not enough to counter a large exposure to industrial focused customers, which are still declining but sequentially improving as I mentioned previously.  Now, e-commerce continues to see strong momentum and we saw that experience throughout the quarter. Driven by impressive exponential growth across all regions, this channel represented approximately 18% of the global Tools & Storage revenue for the third quarter. As we continue to expand our market leading share position in this strategic channel, we are making targeted investments to bring in world class talent and expand our digital capabilities to maximize this rapidly accelerating opportunity.  So, in summary, despite a very dynamic environment, it was an outstanding quarter for Tools & Storage. The business delivered a record operating margin rate, executing on the cost actions while demonstrating the agility to meet the strengthening demand that emerged throughout the quarter. Great work by our Tools & Storage teams. Turning to the Industrial segment, total growth was negative 7%, which included a 10-point benefit from the CAM acquisition and currency contributed a positive 1%. This was offset by an 18% decline in volume. Despite the significant organic declines, we are cautiously optimistic in the positive sequential improvement in the markets across many [Technical Difficulty] businesses, with automotive showing the largest Q3 sequential improvement.  Operating margin rate was down year-over-year to a respectable 12.3% as the impact from market-driven volume decline was partially offset by swift cost control.  Our cost actions are having a significant impact and contributed to a 350-basis point sequential improvement in the margins. Let's now dive a bit deeper into this segment. Engineered fastening organic revenues were down 14%, driven by lower global light vehicle and industrial production. The declines were experienced across all regions. Although global light vehicle production remained down 5% year-over-year, forecasts continue to improve. As a result, automotive fasteners experienced strong sequential improvement from April, relatively in line with this mid-single digit decline in light vehicle production. However, our auto systems business is still experiencing significant declines in the low 20s as OEMs continue to conserve capital in response to the current market environment. Industrial fasteners declined high teens. And despite more positive indications for global industrial production, recovery in these markets have not bounced back as quickly. Our customer insights indicate that the majority of the manufacturers are balancing the initial surge and pent up demand following the Q2 closures with a slower trajectory towards normalized business activity.  Infrastructure declined 25% due to lower volumes in attachment tools, which was down in the high teens, while oil and gas declined 35% due to a sharp reduction in pipeline project activity. While the outlook for oil and gas remains challenged, we are beginning to see positive signs and improving environment in attachment tools.  And finally, let's turn to Security. Total revenue was relatively flat versus prior year, with volume down 4%, partially offset by benefits from both price and currency. North America declined 3%, primarily due to lower installations in commercial electronic security and health care due to the pandemic.  Europe experienced a modest organic decline as growth within the Nordics and France was offset by lower volume in the UK. However, global backlog remains in a healthy position and is up versus the prior year, while order rates in electronic security have continued to gain strong momentum since Q2.  One item to briefly note before I cover margins related to Security, during Q3, we reached an agreement with Securitas to sell commercial electronic operations in five countries in Europe and emerging markets. These businesses represented approximately $85 million in annual revenue and the divestiture will be modestly accretive to segment margins going forward. This decision represented normal portfolio pruning and will allow our Security team to focus their efforts and resources on our geographies where we have strong market positions.  Now in terms of profitability, the segment operating margin rate was up 10 basis points to 11% as pricing, cost control more than offset the impact from lower volume and growth investments. We delivered this margin expansion and funded growth investments with a 90-basis point expansion in our gross margins, another very positive sign of the business transformation underway.  As the market normalizes and we ramp up the new growth opportunities within health and safety, the security business is well positioned to return to organic growth and consistent margin expansion as we head into 2021.  So, in summary of all our businesses, a very strong quarter as we continue to navigate the uncertainty in the current environment. As I take a step back and reflect, I am so proud of how our team stepped up during the crisis to position the business for success.  Our Industrial business, hit with the steepest market declines, is on track to deliver double-digit margins this year, far improved from the 7% margin prior recession trough the Industrial segment experienced by Black & Decker during 2009. Security has taken swift action to return to margin expansion and is now focused on accelerating its transformation with several exciting growth initiatives.  And of course, what a performance by Tools to reposition its margin potential during this downturn, while simultaneously investing in programs that can keep us on the offensive as it relates to growth and share gain.  Let's now briefly look at how this translated into free cash flow performance on the next stage. On a year-to-date basis, our cash generation is $391 million, which is $412 million ahead of the prior year. The strong performance was driven by approximately $600 million of free cash flow generated in the third quarter. Our cost focus combined with a surging demand in Tools & Storage resulted in strong earnings growth, lower working capital versus the prior year and reduced capital expenditures.  As we look ahead into closing this year, our priority is to ensure we maintain appropriate levels of working capital to support the continued strong growth for Tools & Storage into 2021, as well as market recoveries in our other businesses.  As a result of this key priority, our plan assumes $300 million of incremental working capital in Q4, which will reduce our normal seasonal working capital benefit versus prior years.  Even considering this planning assumption, we expect to generate a significant amount of cash in the fourth quarter and our planning assumption is for $800 million to $900 million of free cash flow for the full year of 2020.  From a capital deployment perspective, while we have removed our explicit pause on M&A and share repurchase, our priority today is deleveraging in line with our strong investment credit ratings. In terms of our liquidity and balance sheet, we ended the quarter with full access to our $3 billion commercial paper facility and approximately $700 million of cash on hand. As a reminder, we do not have any long-term debt maturities until late next year. So, as you can see, we have maintained flexibility from a liquidity standpoint.  I would now like to discuss the third quarter exit trends for demand and how we are planning for the fourth quarter. On slide 8, I will start on the left side of the page and walk through a segment view of our fourth quarter planning assumption range. I will also provide color on the geographic or key business exit trends. In this case, I will use September and October month to date actual shipments as our exit trend, which normalizes for various timing factors.  For Tools & Storage, we are planning for a fourth quarter range of 8% to 10% organic growth. One key assumption in the Tools & Storage range continues to be the sustainability of the strong demand within US retail.  I'm happy to report that POS in North American retail has remained strong. While demand is lower than some of this stratospheric levels we experienced in Q2, the POS growth has remained very strong in the low 20s for the prior four and eight-week period.  POS for the most recent four-week period for brands such as Craftsman and Stanley are delivering similar levels of growth that was demonstrated over the entirety of the third quarter.  POS growth within our more pro focused brands such as DeWalt and Stanley FatMax have accelerated in recent periods, reflecting the positive trajectory of the pro recovery which gained momentum as the third quarter progressed. Our planning range assumes that POS will be maintained in the mid-teens to the low 20s for the entire fourth quarter.  The recoveries in Europe and Latin America accelerated in the third quarter and we continue to see positive momentum. However, we are planning for a moderate deceleration of shipment growth from Q3, factoring in the inventory recovery that occurred for these regions. Finally, the US commercial and industrial channels, along with Asia, should continue to see sequential improvement, but are planned at slower trajectories compared to the other channels or regions within the segment.  The revenue trends in the Tools business for the last eight weeks support our view of continued strong performance as we've experienced growth at 12% in this time horizon. This is slightly above the high end of our planning range for Q4. However, we anticipate the deceleration in the international markets primarily to occur over the remainder of the quarter. For Industrial, our plan assumes for an organic decline of 10% to 15%. Many of the end markets are demonstrating continued recoveries. Exceptions are aerospace and oil and gas which are longer cycle and we are planning for protracted recovery.  On the positive side, we have continued to see improvement in automotive production forecasts, industrial production trends, and order momentum in attachment tools. Our midpoint would assume continued improvement within automotive attachment tools and general industrial end markets versus Q3. The revenue trends for the last eight weeks support continued recovery for this segment, as our shipments were down 11% organically, in line with the more optimistic end of our Q4 planning range.  Another positive signal is that engineered fastening has demonstrated organic growth over the last four weeks. Market momentum and easier comps in this segment are starting to emerge.  Turning to Security, our plan assumes for a range of down low single digits to a high end of being relatively flat organically. Exit trends for this business are tracking relatively in line with this range, which is a good result considering that Security grew 4% organically in Q4 2019. Although the recovery continues to be mixed by country, backlog remains strong and odors have been gaining momentum which supports an opportunity for sequential improvement with installation and maintenance activity.  Additionally, the business is focused on stimulating demand with their existing and new health and safety solutions, which have emerged from the pandemic and will begin to generate revenue prior to the end of the year.  As you aggregate this for the total company, we are planning for a Q4 range of 3% to 5% organic growth. The low end of this range represents a moderation in the strong POS within US retail or a meaningful deceleration in the recovery trajectories in industrial, security or the remaining tool market.  The high end of our range reflects continued positive momentum in the recovery and with North American POS levels continuing to be strong. We currently are not planning for an improvement in store inventory levels within this range for our Tools & Storage major customers.  The company revenue trend is up 7% organically across September and October month to date. Considering we would expect it to be a little stronger initially due to the monthly timing and tools previously mentioned in our revenue range, it is a reasonable expectation at this stage for the fourth quarter.  Now moving to page 9, I would like to provide an update on our cost program. As a quick reminder, we targeted four areas of opportunity \u2013 indirect spend, compensation, benefits and raw material deflation. We are on track to capture the previously outlined $500 million 2020 benefit. During the third quarter, we realized $175 million as a benefit which brings our year-to-date savings to $350 million.  The organization continues to make progress on improving the sustainability of our cost action. As you think about the program heading into 2021, we are still on track to deliver a positive carryover of $125 million, net of cost associated with restoring the temporary cost actions implemented earlier this year.  In addition to this positive carryover, we continue to execute on our margin resiliency initiatives and expect to see an opportunity for $300 million to $500 million over the next three-year period. A reasonable expectation for the 2021 margin resiliency opportunity is a range of $100 million to $150 million.  As a reminder, we view this program as an incremental source of contingency to offset any unforeseen headwinds that may arise throughout the year, support investment into the business or support margin expansion and outperformance.  Now, I'll quickly summarize our 2020 planning assumptions on slide 10. From a revenue perspective, as I mentioned, we see a potential for a range of 3% to 5% organic growth in the fourth quarter. From a cost structure perspective, we had $180 million of 2020 savings from our Q4 2019 cost reduction program and expect an additional $500 million from the cost actions announced earlier this year as I just mentioned. Tariffs and FX are currently expected to be $165 million headwind, with $140 million of that behind us through three quarters.  Considering these factors, we are planning for a full year operating margin dollar growth in the mid-single digits and significant margin rate expansion versus the prior year.  Finally, we have disclosed our assumptions for the below-the-line items as you work to model various business scenarios.  When you evaluate all these financial factors and complete the math, the result will be an EPS range centered around our 2019 EPS result of $8.40 per share, an excellent potential outcome given where the world was six months ago in the depths of the crisis.  From a cash deployment perspective, our near-term focus is deleveraging. We are maintaining our capital expenditure reductions, while continuing to invest in the key areas that drive growth, margin resiliency, or support footprint moves in Tools & Storage.  We will keep a sharp focus on working capital management and have aligned our supply chain to serve the strong revenue growth.  I know many of you are thinking about 2021 at this point. As outlined earlier, we have built approximately $125 million of positive carryover from our cost program and have margin resiliency at our disposal to serve as a contingency.  In addition, as Jim mentioned, we don't see major headwinds or tailwinds from an input cost perspective at this stage. Therefore, this sets up nicely to handle a significant amount of cost headwinds should they emerge or outperform expectations if these headwinds do not emerge.  As it relates to revenue, our visibility has improved, but it's far too early to comment on market demand for 2021. That being said, we don't accept the notion that our setup is a story about insurmountable comps. Consider that, in 2020, approximately 25% of the portfolio is expected to show double-digit market-driven organic retractions mainly concentrated industrial-focused end markets across our segments.  It is reasonable to expect growth from an arguably easy set of comps in this category. 20% of the portfolio is showing modest retractions this year in addition to the 25% I just mentioned. This would include Security and some of our emerging market geographies in Tools. These businesses certainly don't have tough setups as we sit here today and appear poised to be able to demonstrate growth.  The remaining 55% of the company, which includes North American retail and European Tools & Storage, will show growth this year, but the setup for the front half of 2021 is very good as they retracted organically in the comparable period in 2020 due to the shutdown and inventory corrections that we experienced. These markets have continued to stay strong and the refocus on the home trend has emerged and continues. Finally, we have a host of growth catalysts that Jim will outline in a moment. We believe we have the investments and the initiatives in place to drive the next leg of share gain across our businesses.  But considering all these factors, and of course, assuming no adverse changes in market demand due to major economic pullbacks, we do not see any reason at this point as to why we cannot demonstrate organic growth in each of our segments in 2021.  So, hopefully, this helps you see why we are excited with the potential for the company to create significant shareholder value in 2021 and beyond.  Thank you. And I will now turn it back to Jim. James Loree : Okay. Thank you, Don. Like I said before, no one could have anticipated the ups and downs and the twists and turns this year would take and it looks like it's going to be a great outcome.  Look, we've covered a lot of ground already. And so, I'll just take a few more minutes to highlight our growth catalysts. The Craftsman brand rollout remains a key element of our growth strategy and the surge in DIY outdoor and positive trends in e-commerce have further accelerated this opportunity. By the end of the year, we expect to deliver $900 million of cumulative growth from this program since acquisition and about $100 million dollars ahead of our latest plan.  And with more Craftsman growth opportunities on the horizon, we can reiterate our commitment to achieve the $1 billion revenue targets six years earlier than we committed during our initial acquisition announcement. We can now start to evaluate how much further we can go beyond $1 billion over the course of time, especially with the potential addition of outdoor power equipment through MTD. The MTD opportunity gives us an option beginning in the middle of the next year to acquire the remaining 80% of one of the great American outdoor power equipment companies at an all-in multiple that will be in the 7 to 8 times EBITDA range. We continue to be encouraged by their product development pipeline as well as their progress on improving profitability.  That category is experiencing similar benefits from the consumers' reconnection with the home. And we continue to be excited about the runway for growth by leveraging brand, technology and channel synergies. This combination has the potential to generate significant shareholder value by expanding our presence in this $20 billion plus market. And everybody understands how the pandemic has accelerated the consumer shift to e-commerce. In Tools, we are the industry leader in this channel by a factor of approximately 3x and we've been working on it for 10 years, building e-commerce partnerships with major players all around the world.  Over that timeframe, it has evolved from nothing to representing at least 18% of sales, up 5 points this year alone. We're investing in new talent, digital capabilities and our brands, including the revitalization of the Black & Decker brand to capture this compelling opportunity.  And we have the products. Despite all the cost actions, we are continuing to invest in our product innovation machine, bringing new core and breakthrough innovations to the market. In Tools, we continue to strengthen our position as the industry leader in maximizing power output, with innovations like DeWalt Power Detect and FlexVolt Advantage. The extension of our innovative Atomic and Xtreme power tool platforms into new products and categories is providing more solutions for users to expand their toolkits with the highest power to weight ratios available in the market.  And the societal obsession with health and safety that we're all experiencing right now has created new opportunities for Security. Our transformation came at the right time as Security is leveraging capabilities that have been developed during the last two years, such as digitally proficient talent, technology, and partnerships to commercialize new solutions. These are products such as automated entrance management with facility threshold controls, contact and proximity tracing, and touchless doors for commercial establishments that will begin to show revenue in 2021. And taken together, these growth catalysts have the potential to generate over $3 billion to $4 billion of revenue annually over a multi-year period. The shareholder value creation potential is compelling over the medium to long term.  And as for the short term, it was a remarkable quarter and one for the record books. Despite the pandemic, we are running on all cylinders. The fourth quarter looks to be strong, as Don pointed out as well.  I want to thank you all for your interest and support, as well as thank our Stanley Black & Decker leaders and their associates for their commitment and effort as we look ahead to our next chapter, which we expect to be a powerful growth story with significant margin accretion potential.  Dennis, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis Lange : Great. Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : A bunch of questions. I guess I'll trust those behind me will ask the ones I don't. I want to focus in on margins a little bit more, if we could. And just understand if there was anything really unusual in the Tools margin in the quarter. And then just thinking about what you're suggesting for organic growth, it looks like it would put Tools revenues in Q4 similar, maybe up slightly from Q3. So, maybe you could just give us a little additional color on margins specifically in Tools & Storage from Q3 into Q4. Thank you. Donald Allan, Jr.: The third quarter margins, as we mentioned, were really outstanding at 21.5%. And there was nothing unusual in there or one time in nature. It was really a demonstration of the significant amount of costs that we took out very quickly back starting in March and April timeframe of this year. A lot of that was temporary. Then we did a very quick pivot \u2013 do you remember back in June and July? \u2013 to convert a large portion of that to permanent cost actions and make it sustainable going forward because we recognize the volatility of the situation and we're really starting to see the benefit of those cost actions flowing through the margins and maintaining our cost base at this level as we see the strong top line growth and get outstanding operating leverage as a result.  Let me just be clear that, for those of you wondering if we're just cranking up the plants, and that's resulting in some unusual benefits to margins, that's not the case. The way that accounting works, it actually gets hung up on your balance sheet for almost six months and you don't really see that benefit till later on down the road. So, we're not seeing that benefit because I know that's probably a question some of you have. It's really just what I mentioned. It's really focused on the cost actions we took and the benefit of operating leverage associated with that.  On the organic growth part of your question, yeah, I would say we're probably looking at a similar Q4 to what we just experienced in Q3 for Tools, and, frankly, for the company as well, overall. And we'll see how that plays out. We've had a great start to the fourth quarter. We really feel positive about the performance in the month of October. But we also know that, in the fourth quarter, the heavy revenue month, really the biggest one is October and then the beginning of November is pretty strong too. So, it's great to have that start at the beginning of the quarter. Operator : And our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities. Deepa Raghavan : I'll stick with the margin theme here too. Don, you noted Tools & Storage margins have stepped up higher. Can you talk about how much of that structural lift in margin sticks over the medium term? That is, how much higher than the 17% T&S margins we should be expecting on a go-forward basis here?  Also, a quick clarification on 2021 margin resiliency measures of $100 million to $150 million. Will that be pulled only if things deteriorate versus your plan? Or will that be layered in irrespective? Thank you. Donald Allan, Jr.: On your first question, we really are very focused right now on how do we take this step change in margin rates for Tools and do our best to make a large part of it sustainable. And I really think when you see the Q4 result, and actually when you do the math and you start to think through the models, you're going to see that the margin rate in Q4 is going to be \u2013 although not as high as Q3 because we do have a normal tick down due to some holiday mix factors that occur in the fourth quarter, but still will be around 20%. It will be a very strong margin rate for the fourth quarter for Tools & Storage. When I think about going forward into next year, we are now looking at this business as being a very high teens margin business, and we want to be able to maintain that going forward. And so, that's our view at the stage. They will exit the year around 18% for the full year for margins. And we would expect them to continue to be somewhere between 18% and 20% next year, barring any unusual things that \u2013 headwinds or things like that, that we're not expecting at this stage.  As far as margin resiliency, we're going after that number no matter what. So, these are these are things associated with Industry 4.0, commercial pricing excellence, some of the plant moves we're doing around the world to streamline our operations, et cetera, and so we will aggressively go after that $300 million to $500 million over the next three years, the $100 million to $150 million for 2021. And so, it sets up a nice contingency if we need it. And as I said in my script, if we don't need it, they'll help us either make some investments or have an outperformance or a mix of both. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Josh Pokrzywinski : I'll just shift over to growth. And, Don, one comment you made about the lack of contemplated inventory replenishment. I know we're kind of talking about percentages of percentages, given that it's really just a phenomenon that precedent in US retail. But I think some of Jim's earlier comments dating back to other points in the third quarter suggest there's maybe four or five weeks of inventory that could use replenished at some point. My math would say that, on the totality of Tools & Storage, that's still kind of a mid to high-single digit percentage of any given quarters of growth potential. Is that something that we see stretching out here into the first half of 2021? And is that kind of the right order of magnitude to think about what that restock means in terms of segment organic growth? James Loree : It's Jim. I know you directed it towards Don, but I feel lonely because everybody wants to talk about margins, and I'm not an expert \u2013 I know how to make them expand, but I'm not an expert on the details of the margins. So, I'll take that one.  And we've had a lot of customer contact with our partners who have these inventories that are not where they want them to be. And the fill rates are not exactly where they want them to be, although I think we're doing reasonably well in relation to their typical suppliers. So, there is this replenishment of \u2013 and I think you're in the right zone, about four weeks or so of inventory that we would all \u2013 customers and us would all like to replenish. But keeping up with the POS, I feel humbled to say that right now is really a challenge. So, yes, I think you've got it right, in the sense that it's not going to be solved in the fourth quarter and the customers are very, very clear about, it must be solved in the in the first quarter. And we hope to be able to do that and to fulfill their needs. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Apologies, Jim. Maybe one more question on margins. Looking at it \u2013 maybe two parts, I suppose. In 2021, understand that the margin resiliency and the carryover sort of net of temporary actions, but should we expect much in the way of things like outright new selling costs coming back or R&D perhaps stepping up or are those sort of all included when you talk about a reinstatement of actions? And also, beyond 2021, broad thoughts on incremental margins in Tools? What do you think your entitlement is there when you consider competition the channel, but also your margin resiliency efforts? Donald Allan, Jr.: I would say that, you look at the back half of this year for Tools & Storage margins, we're clearly benefiting from some amazing operating leverage that most likely we will not get that magnitude of operating leverage next year because we will do some of the things you mentioned, we will continue to invest in growth, and so we may not have 21.5% or 20% margins like we're going to have in the back half of this year. But we believe we're going to have margins that, as I said, are somewhere between 18% and 20%. So, pretty robust margins as we make some of those investments, which means our operating leverage will still be very, very strong, probably somewhere between 30% and 40%, leaning more towards the 40% next year and pretty robust.  And so, I think we've positioned our cost base, we're positioning our manufacturing footprint as we continue to make changes to that as well as expand some capacity in certain areas around distribution and manufacturing to allow us to make sure that we continue to have that type of leverage as we're able to benefit from this significant growth environment, which has the potential to continue for much longer than the first three to six months of next year. We'll see how that plays out. And whether there's certain factors like US stimulus and other things that continue to drive that type of performance. But there's a lot of activity, as you know, a focus around the home that Jim touched on and e-commerce as well. And so, we're really trying to prepare ourselves for that type of environment that may continue for maybe 12 to 18 months. And as a result, I expect to see very strong margins throughout next year in the range that I mentioned. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Michael Rehaut : I just wanted to get a finer understanding on the promotional sales shift, number one, in Tools & Storage. Looked like it was expecting another 4 to 5 points of growth in the third quarter, but now that shifts into the fourth quarter. However, I'd be surprised if you were to say \u2013 excluding that \u2013 if that normal shift had occurred or the sales were in September, I'd be hard pressed to say you would be looking for a mid-single digit organic growth range. So, just want to try to understand how that kind of works through and also if it has different \u2013 if those sales have different margins being promotional sales.  And lastly, I'd just love to get some additional comments in terms of the growth opportunity you see for the company over the next couple of years in e-commerce? James Loree : I'll take the latter part of your question and Don will take the former part. Donald Allan, Jr.: If we go back to the Tools shift from Q3 to Q4, about 4 to 5 points, as I mentioned and you mentioned as well. So, yeah, when you think about the dynamics of what's happening in the fourth quarter, we're getting a really strong surge here in October of some things that shifted from the month of September to October. And when you look at the performance for the full quarter, it's going to be a similar type result as what we experienced in Q3. So, if that 4 or 5 points that shifted into Q3, we'd be kind of looking at mid to high-single digits performance in Tools & Storage for the full quarter.  But that factors in a lot of different things. You have to recognize that, although POS in North America is strong and we're assuming it's somewhere between mid-teens to low 20 percentile, other things \u2013 the growth is decelerating in certain parts, like the European markets, the emerging markets. We saw some inventory kind of stocking and restocking in those geographies that will not repeat itself here in the fourth quarter. So, although we see growth, it won't be of the same magnitude we saw there.  And then, we still have some portions of the business that are retracting, although retracting at slightly lower percentages than what we saw in Q3. We still have that as a factor as well.  So, when you pull that all together, that's kind of how you get to that net result at the end of the day. Jim? James Loree : On e-commerce, obviously, we're very excited about this topic because when it was not very popular, we were kind of a couple of yards and a cloud of dust, just workman like going after it, building it, zero \u2013 almost zero in 2010. And today, we're knocking on the door of $2 billion in e-commerce and the profitability is good. It's not something that you can worry about negative mix. The profitability is good. The cost to serve is actually reasonable vis-\u00e0-vis other channels and gross margins are excellent.  So, today, we have a vast network of partnerships around the world with major e-commerce players. And we're very pleased with that and proud of that, ranging from Alibaba to Amazon to some of the regional players and so forth. It's all B2B2C as opposed to D2C, which is okay for us. It's worked well.  And, frankly, our competition has more or less shied away, have not really made it a strategic focus in general. So, we sit here today in a very good place with strength. And so, we're not naive to think that the competition is not going to jump in. Of course, they are. But we are going to double down in this area and have already constructed a $75 million worth of investments over the next year or two to strengthen our position in e-commerce. And one of the big initiatives is the Black & Decker brand revitalization. It's probably a little-known fact. But the Black & Decker brand plays extremely well with the younger generations. And of course, younger generations are the core of the e-commerce of growth in the future.  So, with Jeff Ansell running this Black & Decker revitalization initiative in partnership with a major e-commerce player in North America is kind of one of our elements of the strategy. And then, we also have significant investments in the core, so strengthening the core e-commerce that we have as well with additional resources, additional focus on content creation and market development. And also, initiatives, pretty significant initiatives in Germany, China and India, all D2C. So, areas where our share is not where we're under indexed, if you will, from an existing channel perspective. Going D2C in those markets because we have very little to lose, especially in China and India, and really excited about this. I think e-commerce is going to be a major, major growth driver for many years to come. Operator : And our last question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Wanted to maybe stick on growth for my one question. When you guys issued your 8-K intra quarter in 3Q, I think you guys were calling for high teens T&S growth and recognized the promotional activity was 4 to 5 points. And so, I was wondering if you could maybe just elaborate what else changed relative to your expectations earlier in the quarter? And then, specifically, I've heard you call out international decelerating and inventory levels. Just any more color around on around that specifically would be helpful. Thank you. Donald Allan, Jr.: I would say that, when we did the announcement back in late August, we said in Q3, for Tools, we see kind of a high teens performance for organic and we talked about the reasons why it's different. We also communicated that we expected Q4 to have kind of low single-digit growth. So, we're indicating that the back half would probably grow somewhere around 7%, 8%, in that range. We're now looking at a back half that's going to grow around 10%. And potentially a little bit better if some of the trends continue here in Q4 that we saw in October. So, we're seeing a better growth profile for the back half of the year in total versus what we thought about a month and a half ago or so for the Tools & Storage business. And a large part of that is the continued strength of North American retail and what we're seeing there with POS. And although we do have some de-selling in Europe and the growth number will be lower, but still very good versus Q3 because Q3 was pretty robust and kind of mid-teens number for growth, we'll probably see something that's closer to half of that in our European markets. And that factors in some of the inventory stocking that we saw in Q3.  So, the things that have really shifted are that we were able to recognize how much inventory was built in our customers throughout the third quarter. And there was a significant amount in some of the international markets and very little in the North American retail channel. And then, here in the fourth quarter, we see the dynamic of not having \u2013 as I said, we're not really putting any inventory build in the fourth quarter. At the end of the day, could there be a little bit in the North American retail channel when we're done? Maybe, but it's probably going to be pretty modest to the point that Jim made when he answered this question earlier. The bigger part of the adjustment is going to happen in Q1. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2020 fourth quarter and full-year earnings conference call. On the call in addition to myself is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim and Don, will review our 2020 fourth quarter and full-year results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree. Jim Loree : Thanks, Dennis and good morning. Today we issued record fourth quarter results marking an outstanding close to a very dynamic and successful year. As I mentioned in our 2020 shareholder letter, we expected the operating environment of the 2020s to be one of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity or VUCA for short. Lest we had any thought of easing into that construct over time. Like others we were thrust into action as the pandemic roared onto the scene in March and April. And as for many companies, the early days of the pandemic brought into focus the first rung of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. We quickly established pandemic era tactical priorities. First, protect the health and safety of our employees and supply chain partners. Secondly, ensure the continuity of our operations and financial stability. And third, do what we can, or could to mitigate the impact of the virus in our communities. We undertook a myriad of actions consistent with those priorities, including the implementation of intensive companywide safety protocols, including mandatory masks from day one, significant liquidity enhancements, cost reductions, some temporary, some permanent as well as a substantial increase in our philanthropy, both in dollar terms and in-kind. We asked our people to be guided by our purpose. For those who make the world, we emphasized our three simple leadership principles which include creating clarity, inspiring engagement, and growing and delivering. Our people, while dealing with a personal hardships and challenges characteristic of this era, responded beautifully to our lead. Amidst four weeks of collapsing sell-out revenue in April, we were hunkered down, ready to ride out the storm. And then suddenly in the last week of April, and on into the summer months, an abrupt and very positive phenomenon emerged in the tools business. Our end users, many of them homebound, with time on their hands, discovered and/or rediscovered DIY projects, both indoors and outdoors. We enjoyed a surge in North American retail of a magnitude never before experienced. By June, POS was running 30% to 40% greater than the prior-year. E-commerce growth exploded at levels even higher than that. Unfortunately, both we and our channel partners had solid inventory positions at the onset of the demand. By May, we were ramping-up our factories to extraordinary levels. By the third quarter the demand trend had extended to Europe and other markets around the world albeit at somewhat lower levels but still in strong double-digit territory. The second half of 2020 proved to be an all-out test of our supply chain resiliency and ability to serve the growth. Customer inventory levels have been substantially reduced by mid-year and our global factories were running at historic levels just to keep up with the POS demand and they still are. We faced rolling labor shortages, supplier issues and various arbitrary government edicts in jurisdictions all over the globe. However, we were able to prevail and operate continuously with only minor exceptions and along the way, we've moved forward with significant capacity expansion actions for both power and hand tools and we look forward to serving continued growth in the future. 2020 was by far the most difficult backdrop we've ever faced. But we were prepared for volatility and our people rose to meet the challenges. Fortunately, we went into it with strength and have stayed strong for the duration. Back in 2016, we committed to a vision that embodied purpose-driven performance. We built a company that is anchored by our supportive people oriented culture, striving to deliver top quartile shareholder return to become known as one of the world's great innovators, and to elevate an already strong commitment to ESG and corporate social responsibility. We demonstrated in 2020 that when corporations like ours put people first and work to have a positive impact on society at large, the result can be extraordinary resilience, which benefits our shareholders through outstanding growth, cash flow, margin expansion, and ESG. And that is the story of 2020. On the heels of an excellent third quarter, the fourth quarter was the pinnacle of our 2020 performance, and we enter 2021 stronger than ever. Now I'll take a moment and recap the 4Q numbers which demonstrate the power of our momentum as we enter 2021. Revenues were up 19% to $4.4 billion, with organic growth of 16%. This was led once again by Tools & Storage, which had organic revenue up an impressive 25%. Our total company operating margin rate excluding charges was a fourth quarter record at 16.5%, up 290 basis points from prior-year with volume leverage, productivity, cost actions, price and margin resiliency initiatives all contributing. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $3.29, up 51% versus prior-year. And now let's turn to the full-year. Revenues were $14.5 billion up 1% with 10% organic growth in the second half more than offsetting the first half pandemic-related issues. Our full-year operating margin rate expanded 110 basis points to 14.6%, attributable to strong cost control, productivity on margin resiliency initiatives, and price. Adjusted EPS for the year was $9.04 an 8% increase versus 2019 especially remarkable, when considering our original pre-pandemic guidance mid-point last January was $8.90 a share. We converted the strong sales and margin results along with just over a half turn of working capital improvement into record cash flow. Free cash flow was $1.7 billion for the year, $1.7 billion for the year, an all-time record for the company, up 55% versus 2019 with a conversion rate of 136%. And lastly, I'm happy to report that we successfully exceeded all of our five-year medium term environmental health and safety goals established in 2015. We targeted a 20% reduction of our energy consumption, our carbon emissions, our water use and our waste generated in our facilities, and more than attained each one of those goals. In addition, we significantly improved our recycling and use of renewable energy and achieved our safety goals. When I became CEO in 2016, we updated our vision to elevate our commitment to social responsibility. Achievement of these goals is an important milestone in our journey to execute on our 2030 sustainability strategy, more goals and more milestones ahead as we continue on this March. So where do we go from here? In a world of elevated uncertainty, here are a few observations to simplify and clarify our point of view on that for 2021 and 2022. Without question, tools and outdoor demand is on a roll, and we think it will be for some time to come. Benefiting from a series of exogenous factors including first a secular surge in global DIY driven by the consumers rediscovery of Home and Garden. Secondly, a massive acceleration of the global shift to e-commerce within our channels, which plays to our strength as the global tools leader in e-commerce. And third, a cyclical boom in North America Home Improvement driven by increasing new and pre-owned home sales associated largely with household formation and the Urban Exodus. And then there is the need to rebuild channel inventory levels, which we believe are at least four weeks lower than desirable. Our Tools business has never been stronger or better positioned to gain share and we have consistently grown organically and gained share every year since the merger of Stanley and Black & Decker 11 years ago. Our unmatched array of iconic brands, market leading innovation, combined with our scale and organizational agility continues to support that investment thesis. Total company operating margin reached new heights in the second half of 2020, breaking through the 15% threshold at 17.7% and 16.5% in 3Q and 4Q respectively. This is a significant increase of about 300 basis points over prior-year and it is not a coincidence, it derives from an intentional confluence of tight cost management, volume leverage, price mix management, and our margin resiliency initiative. The latter applies cutting edge digital technologies to optimize margin performance across multiple value pools. Skeptics point out that the third quarter benefited from cost reductions, some of which were admittedly temporary in nature. These Skeptics now have to deal with the fourth quarter in which the 16.5% includes the vast majority of temporary costs such as furloughs, four-day workweeks, executive salary reductions, and benefit deferrals back in the run rate. This was accomplished as we began to fund significant new investments and growth initiatives including major thrusts into e-commerce, revitalizing the Black & Decker brand, security, health and safety and outdoor products. And although the second half 2021 Tools growth comp is difficult, we believe it is manageable, and we're predicting full-year total company organic growth of approximately 6% at the mid-point; with a super strong first half and a modest negative in the back half yielding the 6% mid-point, which is the high-end of our long-term growth objective for that measure. Our strong share momentum aided by numerous growth catalysts such as Flexvolt, Craftsman, Atomic, Xtreme, Power Detect and E-commerce should not be underestimated. On top of this, there is an industrial related portion of Tools that is in the midst of a cyclical rebound as we enter 2021, along with about $4 billion of Industrial, which includes engineered fastening automotive, and the Security segment revenue, which was negative in 2020 and all those are expected to be positive in the aggregate in 2021. So for all these reasons, and more as Don will cover in his remarks, our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance is introduced at $9.70 to $10.30 a share. At the mid-point, this is $10, up 11% which is a very good place to start our journey into 2021. And while it is too early, way too early to guess at what market conditions might be in 2022, we stand to benefit from our multi-year relationship with MTD and our optionality to acquire the remaining 80% at a very attractive multiple with a window that begins to open in July of this year which brings me to a brief update on MTD. Our current planning assumption calls for the exercise of our MTD option and the potential addition of up to $3 billion of revenue from the MTD transaction in 2022. And just to clarify, we expect to implement or exercise the option in late 2021 and begin to recognize revenue subsequent to regulatory approvals, and hopefully beginning in 2022. The lawn and garden category is experiencing similar benefits to Tools from the consumers' reconnection with the home and MTD LTM revenues now approximate $2.6 billion with a very strong second half revenue performance in the books comparable to our Tools business. Additionally, MTD continues to make progress on multiple opportunities to generate operational efficiency and margin improvement delivering a 6% operating margin in 2020, with momentum coming into the 2021 season, and plenty of runway ahead for further improvement. The transaction was structured in a financially prudent way whereby we purchased 20% of the company at an 11 times multiple with the option to purchase the remaining 80% anytime during a 10-year window beginning this July. MTD\u2019 incremental EBITDA improvements since our initial purchase is shared 50 :50 and is thus valued at 5.5 times, which provides us the ability to acquire a market leader in outdoor power equipment at an all-in multiple at the time of option execution likely to approximate 7 to 8 times. We're excited by the multiple levers to accelerate growth and margin expansion with this acquisition. In addition to the initial revenue contribution upon consolidation, we see additional organic growth opportunities in the pro-outdoor equipment market as well as to drive electric powered and autonomous mower offerings, while employing our successful commercial model to fully leverage our portfolio of brands and channels. We're also working on a multi-year roadmap to achieve 15% operating margin in the category. Likely some say, however, we believe we're up to the challenge. I remind the naysayers that Black & Decker's operating margin was below 6% in the year before acquisition, and the very same team that addressed that opportunity is still on the field today. We continue to be encouraged by MTD's innovation and product development pipeline as well as their progress on improving profitability and we're excited about this future combination. Even before exercising our option, we're bringing this vision to life in 2021 with SBD and MTD, each independently launching a series of new products under the DeWalt, Craftsman and Black & Decker brands that are hitting the market now across the gas and electric power spectrum. A few notable examples MTD brings world-class innovation in writing and zero turn mowers and through a licensing arrangement will launch a new lineup of DeWalt branded gas powered professional mowers that are now beginning to roll-out at one of our major U.S. retailers. In addition, we have designed, developed and are launching new cordless 20 volt DeWalt walk-behind mowers, also with strong listings that will be made in the USA with global materials in MTDs Tupelo, Mississippi facility. MTD continues to expand its outdoor offering into new categories with Craftsman under license. New to market this year will be an impressive lineup of zero turn gas mowers as well as gas powered solutions in writing and walk-behind mowers. Concurrently, SBD will expand our battery and electric powered offerings and push mowers power washers, and handheld products such as chainsaws, trimmers and blowers. Lastly, as a part of our e-commerce focused brand refresh with Black & Decker -- of Black & Decker, MTD will launch a new lineup of gas handheld products under license and we'll launch new electric offerings including an autonomous robotic mower in Europe. As you can see, we've been busy working our partnership with MTD and there is a lot to be excited about that and for 2021, these opportunities are planned to deliver more than $100 million of organic growth for SBD as well as support additional growth for MTD. With broad coverage across gas powered products for MTD and electric and battery powered categories for SBD, we're just starting to tap into the significant potential ahead of us. And now I'll turn it over to Don Allan to cover the fourth quarter and our 2021 guidance. Don? Don Allan : Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. We're incredibly pleased with our fourth quarter financial performance which closed out an amazing back half to 2020. So now, I'd like to review our business segment results for the fourth quarter. Tools & Storage delivered an exceptional 25% total and organic revenue growth with volume up 23% and price contributing an additional two points. All regions continued to benefit from exceptionally strong revenue trends related to the consumers' reconnection with home and garden. E-commerce continued to be very strong. We had a strong holiday season, and a robust lineup of new products and innovation. The operating margin rate for this segment was another outstanding result at 20.7%, up 420 basis points versus the prior-year as volume, productivity; cost control and price were modestly offset by new growth investments. As the revenue outlook improved during 2020, we released incremental SG&A investments to further the development of our brands via digital marketing, increased distribution capacity, and added commercial resources to support our business model in brick-and-mortar and e-commerce. We believe much of these investments will drive further organic growth in share gains in 2021 and 2022. Now let's look at some of the geographies within Tools & Storage. North America was up a robust 27% organically. Retail continued to see exceptionally strong POS, delivering 36% organic growth through a very strong holiday season along with continued momentum in e-commerce. POS growth for the quarter approximated 30% and retailer inventories ended the year slightly below Q3 levels and well below prior-year, an amazing Q4 performance for the Tools & Storage team. And what's incredibly amazing is we still have a channel refill opportunity of four weeks in front of us that will likely materialize in the front part of 2021. The North American commercial and industrial channels continue to experience positive sequential trends, with both posting low single-digit growth this quarter versus declines in Q3. Pure play construction customers within these channels were up mid-teens in Q4 significantly improved from the low single-digit growth last quarter. This trend is clearly another strong signal that professional demand is back and accelerating.  The Tools & Storage European business also had an outstanding fourth quarter as all regions grew, which resulted in 18% organic growth. This performance was led by the UK, Central Europe, Nordics, Benelux and Iberia all up double-digits with France and Italy up mid-single-digits. The team experienced strong revenue growth in both retail brick-and-mortar and e-commerce. Finally, emerging markets delivered an exceptional quarter of organic growth as well up 22% with all regions posting positive revenue trends. We experienced strong construction demand in these markets, and when combined with positive pricing momentum, it supported this robust performance. Latin America was the strongest performer delivering 36% organic growth with all countries up double-digits, while Russia and Turkey had another very strong quarter, also resulting in double-digit growth in these markets. Finally, Asia delivered low single-digit growth led by South Korea and India each up double-digits, which was partially offset by modest declines in China and Southeast Asia. Now let's pivot and look at the Tools & Storage SPUs. Power Tools delivered 32% organic growth, benefiting from the home and construction trends mentioned previously, as well as strong commercial execution for the holiday season, and new product introductions. We continue to see strong share gains from our new innovations in Flexvolt, Atomic and Xtreme which now represent over $600 million of annual revenue on a combined basis. Now to our product tools business delivered 29% organic growth as these categories continue to benefit from the consumer reconnection with the home as well, as new DeWalt and Craftsman cordless products were launched in 2020. The Hand Tools and accessory and storage business delivered an impressive 15% organic growth this quarter. This was supported by new product launches, the strong performance in emerging markets, and Mac tools combined with the rebound in professional construction demand I just previously mentioned. In summary, an amazing quarter and an incredibly successful year for Tools & Storage. The team remained focused and responded with agility to the pandemic, and quickly pivoted to fulfill the surging demand that emerged in the second half of the year. This effort was remarkable and helped them deliver record levels of growth and margin expansion during one of the most challenging operating environments in our lifetimes. Great job by the entire team, we thank them for their intense and focused efforts. I'm really excited to see the encore performance in 2021. Turning to Industrial, total growth was 10%, which included an 11 point contribution from the CAM acquisition and two points from currency. This was partially offset by a 2% volume driven organic decline and a negative 1% impact from the divestiture of a non-core product line in oil and gas. It was great to see continued improving trend sequentially as the organic decline in Q3 of 18% improved to negative 2% in the fourth quarter, a trend which is positioning the segment for organic growth in 2021. The operating margin rate increased 110 basis points year-over-year to 14.7% as the benefits from productivity and restructuring cost actions more than offset the impact of the lower volume. Diving a bit deeper into this segment, engineered fastening revenues were down 2% organically, as growth in automotive was offset by an improved but still declining general industrial end market. Automotive was up mid-single-digits behind high teens growth in automotive fasteners, which was partially offset by continued declines in systems as most new capital investment decisions related to new car models continue to be on hold. However, Global Light vehicle production continues to improve and we remain well-positioned to outpace the underlying market with content gains in the fastener portion of this business. Industrial fasteners declined high-single-digits in the fourth quarter, the recovery in the Industrial markets continues to progress and we once again saw sequential improvement. Our infrastructure businesses declined 5% organically as positive attachment tools growth was more than offset by reduced pipeline construction in oil and gas. And finally turning to Security. Total revenue was down 3% with a 3% positive impact from currency, while price and acquisitions each contributed 1%. This was offset by a five point decline in volume and a negative 3% due to the divestitures announced last quarter. North America declined 5% as growth in healthcare was offset by lower installations in automatic doors and commercial electronic security. These businesses are serving markets that are still slowly improving from the pandemic impact and it also faced a difficult 7% growth comparable in 2019. European Security organic growth was relatively flat as they experienced solid growth in France from the new growth initiatives which began to take root. This performance was offset by lower volume in the UK related to the various intense lockdowns from the pandemic. Our focus on health and safety initiatives such as touchless doors, contact tracing and healthcare solutions are building momentum and generated about 150 basis points of growth in Q4. With a healthy backlog, a continued recovering market, and the addition of these new solutions, we're optimistic that Security can return to growth in the front half and for the full-year of 2021. In terms of profitability, the segment operating margin rate was 11.2% flat versus the prior-year as price and cost control were offset by the impact from lower volume and growth investments. Now let's take a look at our very strong free cash flow performance on the next page. As you can see, we were able to leverage our strong operational performance in the back half to generate a record full-year free cash flow of approximately $1.7 billion in 2020. This represents an increase of $593 million versus the prior-year and a free cash flow conversion of 136% of net income. This result was driven by the strong growth in Tools & Storage, our companywide cost actions, and lower capital spending delivering significant improvement in cash earnings. Now as it relates to working capital, we delivered 10.4 working capital turns, up 0.6 turns year-over-year reflecting the strong revenue performance and leveraging the SBD operating model to drive working capital efficiency across the company. With the strong cash generation and inclusion of the excess cash on the balance sheet, which amounted to $1.4 billion at year-end, we believe we-re well-positioned from a leverage perspective heading into 2021, a fantastic outcome. Now we'd like to discuss our views on 2021, as improving channel and markets visibility has enabled us to reinstate guidance. Beginning with Slide 10, I'd like to dive deeper into several of our 2021 organic growth assumptions. We're experiencing a fast start to the first quarter as strong market trends in Tools & Storage continue combined with improving Industrial and Security markets. Therefore, we expect organic revenue growth to approximate 21% to 26% for the company in the first quarter of 2021. Tools & Storage is the largest contributor of this strong performance and our plans assume a 1Q organic growth range of 30% to 40%. Underpinning this assumption is the continuation of the strong demand trends, the potential for customer inventories to start to move back to historical levels, and finally, we have an easier comp since Q1 2019 had the beginning -- Q1 2020 had the beginning impacts from the pandemic. Growth continues to be broad-based with all regions contributing to very strong outlook. POS in U.S. retail through the first three weeks of January has remained in a similar band that we experienced during this December and we're assuming this trend will continue through the remainder of the quarter. We're also seeing continued positive momentum in the commercial and industrial channels, Tools & Storage European and emerging markets continue to experience strong momentum as well. And we're currently expecting demand trends in Q1 that are similar to the fourth quarter we just completed. Another way to look at the 30% to 40% Tools & Storage organic growth assumption is that it represents approximately $600 million to $800 million of Q1 organic growth. January, which is historically a very slow month for Tools & Storage, is on track to three or five weeks to deliver $400 million of growth in the month. Additionally, February and March were both negative comps in 2020. Therefore, we believe with a continuation of market demand trends and a modest contribution from safety stock increases across our global customer base, this represents a very strong but reasonably balanced expectation for the first quarter. Turning to Industrial, our first quarter assumes a decline of 5% up to flat organically. To deconstruct this a bit, at the mid-point of this range, we're calling for high single-digit to low double-digit growth in both Attachment Tools, and within automotive engineered fastening, which in total represents a little more than half of this segment. Supporting this Attachment Tools experienced a 50% year-over-year increase in Q4 backlog. In automotive, this assumes a moderation of fastener volume growth to low double-digits, and a less severe decline on easier comps for our systems business. We expect our Industrial fastener business to continuous sequential improvement and be relatively flat. Offsetting these positive factors in Q1, we anticipate steep declines in oil and gas and aerospace. CAM is included in the organic growth calculation partway through the first quarter. As both of these businesses are longer cycle, they held up relatively better when the initial impacts of the pandemic occurred, and therefore will be challenged in the front half of 2021. Turning to Security, our plan assumes for a range of flat to up low single-digits organically in Q1. Exit trends in December for this business were strong, and the backlog ended the year up double-digits, which provides a good setup as we enter Q1, particularly as the easier comps begin in the month of March. Additionally, the business is focused on continuing to stimulate demand with our existing and new health and safety solutions that emerge from the pandemic and started to generate revenue prior to the end of the year. Turning to the right side of this slide, I want to touch on the full-year growth assumptions for all segments and the first and second half planning assumptions for Tools & Storage. As you would expect, we're planning for a very strong first half of the year. We're expecting the strong trends I just talked through for Q1 to moderate in the second quarter but remain quite strong. The continued market recoveries in Security and Industrial, strong demand in Tools and relatively easy year-over-year comps positions the company for an organic growth range of 19% to 24% for the first quarter. For the second half, we have moderated our assumptions to incorporate the difficult comps created by the strong second half 2020 growth in Tools. While we're pushing for more growth and share gains, we felt it was prudent to set expectations for a decline of 3% to 8% organically for the company. This is how we have constructed our overall range of 4% to 8% organic growth for the full-year for Stanley Black & Decker. For Tools & Storage, we're also assuming full-year growth of 4% to 8% which includes organic growth of 27% to 32% in the first half for the reasons previously mentioned, and a decline of 7% to 12% in the back half. While the growth in Tools is retracting versus 2020 in the back half, the range is up 4% to 10% versus the back half of 2019. This is a reasonable two-year assumption based on the historical growth numbers we have seen for this business. That being said, this is a short cycle business and we are ensuring the supply chain can accommodate second half scenarios that are improved versus this range. The potential scenario we must be prepared for is robust Tools & Storage markets that continue for the majority of 2021. We have not assumed this will occur in our guidance, but we will be ready to respond if this does evolve in the coming months. For Industrial, we're assuming 2% to 6% growth in 2021 with a stronger performance in the front half due to the easier comps. Engineered fastening and Attachment Tools have a lot of momentum and we're well-positioned to capitalize upon the recovery as it unfolds in 2021. As it relates to oil and gas and aerospace, we expect they will remain a significant headwind to growth in the front half. But this eases a bit as we move into the back half. Finally, for Security, we see a range for 4% to 6% growth for the full-year. This is fairly consistent across the two halves, as the front half has easier comps and the back half carries a stronger level of growth from the ramp-up of our health and safety focus growth initiatives. We're excited by the prospects for these tech enabled products, which contributed 1.5 points of growth in the fourth quarter and could represent up to $100 million of revenue in 2021. So in summary, we're expecting 4% to 8% organic full-year growth with growth in every segment. We're well-positioned to capture market recoveries and share gains in each of our businesses and feel this is a balanced range that acknowledges the current environment. We'll continue to watch our markets and will be prepared if the back half assumption proves to be conservative. Now I'll summarize the remaining guidance assumptions on Slide 11. We're reinitiating guidance in 2021, with an adjusted earnings per share range of $9.70 to $10.30, up approximately 11% versus prior-year at the mid-point. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $9.15 to $9.85, inclusive of various one-time charges related to facility moves, deal and integration costs and functional transformation initiatives. This range is $0.40 wider than our traditional guide, recognizing that while the visibility has improved, the operating environment remains dynamic. Since I just covered organic growth, let's jump right into the cost structure consideration. We expect $125 million of carryover cost savings net of the reversal of temporary actions from the cost program we implemented in the second quarter of 2020. These actions will primarily benefit the first quarter with a modest benefit in the second quarter. From an inflation perspective, we currently see the potential for approximately $75 million of headwind primarily associated with steel, base metals, transportation, electronic components and resins. Keep in mind; we generally lock-in our supply agreements one to two quarters out. So the timing of this headwind is back half weighted. Partially offsetting this headwind to the tailwind of roughly $45 million related to foreign exchange. Therefore, at this point in time, we have included $30 million of a headwind associated with these externally driven cost inputs. Should we see additional pressure in commodities or should currency reverse, we'll utilize our productivity programs and pricing to neutralize the pressure over time. However, specific to 2021, as a reminder, we have $100 million to $150 million of margin resiliency benefit as a contingency, which is not included in our guidance. This contingency will assist in mitigating new headwinds in these areas during 2020 if they emerge. Finally, we have disclosed our current full-year assumptions for the significant below the line items and our expectation for pre-tax M&A and other charges to assist with your modeling. Turning to cash flow, we expect another strong performance in 2021 with free cash flow conversion approximating GAAP net income. Underpinning this expectation is capital expenditures of approximately 3% of net sales. In addition, we will utilize the SBD operating model to drive efficiencies in working capital to deliver turns improvement. Lastly, we expect the first quarter's earnings per share to be approximately 24% of the full-year performance, which is primarily driven by operating leverage on the organic growth assumptions I walked through for Q1 and the $150 million of benefits from the carryover cost actions we have implemented. So in summary, for the total company, we expect 4% to 8% organic growth, and 7% to 14% adjusted EPS expansion. A strong forecast that represents a balance due recognizing the dynamic operating environment, but also incorporates more difficult comps and inflation assumptions into the plan, while delivering healthy margin expansion and EPS growth for the full-year. The organization remains focused on meeting the needs of several ongoing strong and sequentially improving markets. Leveraging our organic growth catalysts as well, executing margin resiliency, and generating strong free cash flow, while not losing sight of ensuring we keep our employees safe, and assisting our communities through the remainder of this pandemic. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Jim to close out with a summary of our prepared remarks. Jim? Jim Loree : Thanks, Don. Very clear, very transparent, very exciting. In summary, 2020 was an extraordinary year for Stanley Black & Decker. This performance was possible due to the agility, passion and dedication of our people combined with a strong cultural and financial foundation. It's hard to pick one element to get most enthused about given the 2020 performance, especially in the second half as well as the improving outlook. Is it the growth, the margin expansion or the extraordinary cash flow and the potential for more? Is it a demonstrated resilience of this purpose-driven company? Or is it the enormous potential given the way the company is positioned for 2021 and 2022? In my view, it's all of the above. We're energized by the existence of a multi-year runway for growth and profitability improvement. The shareholder value creation potential is certainly compelling over the medium to long-term. And while pursuing these shareholder rewards, we're also mindful of our responsibility to society and the multiple stakeholders that we serve and our sustained commitment to ESG and social responsibility is strong, authentic, and we continue to elevate it over time. And as you can see, there's a lot to be excited about with our MTD partnership and for 2021, these opportunities are planned to deliver more than $100 million of organic growth for SBD as well as to support additional growth for MTD. So I want to thank everybody. It's been an exciting year. There's a lot of really great things ahead. And now I'll turn it over to Dennis. Dennis? Dennis Lange : Great, thanks Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Congrats on beating your $8.90 guidance, you got there in a slightly different way, but well done there. So on MTD, just wanted to just touch on that. There's a bit of confusion out there just want to clarify MTD is not in your guidance at all. Let me just clarify that. And then on the 7 to 8 times EBITDA, updates on a trailing EBITDA, or would that be a forward EBITDA? Just want to clarify that as well. And then just my real question is on the road to mid-teens margins, what do you think are the biggest drivers of that move? And any kind of time scale on that would be helpful? Thanks. Jim Loree : Okay, thank you, Nigel. To be very clear, there's no acquisition of MTD in the guidance. There's some licensing income associated with some of the opportunities I described in the comments. There's some organic growth in Stanley based on some collaboration with MTD on products that we'll be selling through our own channels and our own brands. But there is no, nothing related to the acquisition in the guidance. The multiple is going to be a trailing multiple, because that's how the option is basically priced. It's based on a trailing EBITDA. And so that's where the 7 to 8 times comes from. And as far as the road to mid-teens operating margin, it's our objective to get the operating margins up to around somewhere around eight-ish percent next year, maybe a little higher if the volume kind of comes through the way we think. And so if we start from say a base of maybe 8% to 10%, there is a whole series of cost reduction value creation activities that exists in a plan, if you will, it's a somewhat high-level plan, because we're not able to get into super detailed diligence at this point. But we have been working with a major consulting firm to come up with some point of view on how we can get to a number something in the neighborhood of probably $50 million to $100 million of additional margin improvement that is not being implemented by MTD for various reasons. One, they may not have the appetite for it, or they may not have the capability to do it. But we have some ideas that are pretty specific in that regard. That gets us up into like the 12-ish kind of zone. And then from 12 to 15, it really is going to be a function of really leveraging the synergies between the companies, the channel synergies, the brand synergies, the growth and also a major thrust into the professional channel. I must say that having spent some time at MTD in September, I was blown away by the quality of their innovation pipeline, the collaboration to the extent we've been allowed to do that through based on certain legal constraints and so on, but the collaboration that we have been able to do in terms of lightweighting, electrification, autonomy, those types of things. It's really, really impressive. And what they've done on their own is impressive too. So the combination of all those things, I expect that we'll make a major thrust into the pro-channel, the products are going to be very, very strong. And when we start branding those products with some of our major brands such as DeWalt, I think there's going to be a really compelling value proposition for the channel and the end user to carry those products and buy those products. So that's kind of where we're going with MTD. You can start to see the -- in the marketplace in 2021, some of the call them collaborations around just the edges without really being 100% owned by us. And the ability for us to generate $100 million of organic growth, just with some, some modest collaboration, in terms of commercial and product is really kind of underlines the potential and the power of this relationship. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you, good morning. Congrats. Jim Loree : Good morning. Don Allan : Good morning. Jeff Sprague : Hard to say where to start, you guys could have just maybe dropped the mike and ended the call. But I was wondering, I guess it's for Don, but maybe elaborate a little bit more on how we should think about Tools margins going forward. As Jim said, you kind of showed us here with the cost back in the base what you can do. But it sounds like there's some investment coming back in and some other things. So should we be thinking about this kind of 18% to 20% range that I think you were talking about on the Q3 call is kind of a reasonable framework, as we pencil out 2021 here? Don Allan : Absolutely. I mean we feel even more confident now to kind of confirm what I said in October on the earnings call, that that range does make sense for 2021 between 18% and 20%. And you should see all four quarters in that range. So there shouldn't be a lot of significant variation in that regard. There will be a little bit of investment that we will make. But it's going to be more along the lines of some of the growth initiatives that we started here in 2020 in e-commerce and a few other areas. And so we're going to continue to invest in that space that'll drive additional share gains and more organic growth. So, we feel really positive about how the business positioned itself from a profitability perspective and although the rates are in the back half were over 20%. So we'll see a little bit of a retraction going into next year for the reasons I articulated. I think over the long-term, we feel like it's a business that will continue to progress and improve its profitability over the coming years. It won't just be a one or two-year phenomena. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Markus Mittermaier with UBS. Your line is open. Markus Mittermaier : Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for all the detail. Maybe in recent weeks, there's obviously been some concern around raw materials. And Don, you mentioned the $100 million to $150 million contingency that is not part of guidance. Just want to make sure that I understood that right that is not part of the guidance. And wondering how quickly, you could put that into effect? And also, what are you seeing up to-date so far on the raw material side? Thank you. Don Allan : Yes. I'll start with the raw material part of that question. I mean, we saw these trends kind of emerge in October timeframe, November. And in the categories I mentioned, of steel, resin, electronic components. And so that that is going to continue for a period of time, right now, we have $75 million of an increase in those types of categories in our guidance for 2021. I don't think it's going to radically deviate from that, it could go up a little bit as the year goes on. But we do have to keep in mind the way that we structure our contracts, it usually takes a good six months for that to really impact our P&L, which gives us time to respond with pricing actions, if that makes sense or productivity or whatever the case may be. And then that kind of helps us mitigate that over a longer period of time, maybe over a multi-year period of time, those actions. The margin resiliency program is an annual program that we started about three years ago, which was built on, let's look at the different areas of our company, the functions, the operations teams, how we price our products, et cetera and use technology such as Artificial Intelligence, Advanced Data Analytics, and make better decisions in those particular areas to drive efficiency and effectiveness. And we've seen that over the last few years the ongoing process of the team that's been created and the technology that they use; we have about 100 people that are focused on this full time in the company drives about $100 million to $150 million of annual value. Now we could put that in our P&L and make it part of our guidance. But we think it's more prudent involved for times like this to have it outside the guidance as a contingency. And so when new things come your way that are headwinds, you have an offset. These things are underway, they're in process, and so they're driving value this month in all 12 months out of the year. And so if the headwinds don't come, you get the opportunity to position yourself to outperform. And we think it's a very balanced way to approach guidance in the way to operate in this world, given the level of volatility that we've all seen in the last four years, but in particular, the last 12 months. Jim Loree : And I just wanted to comment, too, on the inflation perception, because it was really interesting, sitting here and listening to some of the feedback from investors over -- from the last couple of weeks about this inflation concern. And we were scratching our heads to some extent, because we've had inflation more often more years than not over the 20 plus years I've been here. And we've always been able to offset a part of it with price and new product in development, new product introductions, and so on. And then there's always productivity that has come through and helped offset the rest of it, and actually given us some decent margin accretion in certain years, even when there was inflation. And so this reflex reaction that, that occurred, which was oh, my gosh, Stanley Black & Decker is inflation prone. It didn't make any sense to us. But then when we thought about it, we realized that if you go back to the 2017, 2018, 2019, kind of timeframe, there was this billion dollars of headwinds that we have all behind us now. And that billion dollars of headwinds was a triad of things, it was the inflation, it was the tariffs, and it was the FX, and a billion dollars was just too big a series of headwinds to just offset with the normal types of offsets that I talked about. So we ended up having to do some restructuring. And by the way, we still generated 6% earnings growth during that timeframe. So it wasn't catastrophic, it was just a lot of work and a lot of pain in order to get through that period, and we did it. But in any one of those, whether it was the FX, or the inflation, or the tariffs, any one of those, we could have handled it easily through our normal contingencies and things like that. But when we put them all together, and that three years in a row, it just -- it became a lot. And so that perception, I think develops. So immediately when the winds of inflation started blowing in the third and fourth quarter, we got this reflex from the investment community. But I think, as of today, I hope that we can put that behind us because it is not a significant material issue to us in 2021. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open. Tim Wojs : Yes, hey, good morning, guys. Nice start. Jim Loree : Thanks, Tim. Don Allan : Thanks, Tim. Tim Wojs : My question really just, I'm curious if there's a way that you could kind of frame or parse out what you're seeing from the DIY and your Pro business. And I know, it's more of an art than a science, particularly in the home center channel, but just kind of curious and we started to hit tougher DIY comps in the second half, if your Pro business, and the Pro channels can help absorb this. So just any color on DIY versus Pro and if there's any acceleration in Pro that fits into your assumptions? Jim Loree : Well, I did lay out in my remarks, kind of the things that I thought were driving the demand, which is one is a secular shift to DIY with so many people at home and with the home being the focal point, as well as outdoor, being the focal point of people's activities, and the number of projects and the number of people doing projects and doing projects for the first time is at record levels. And I think another thing is the installed base of battery systems is a big deal, with this kind of growth that we have in 2020 and now into 2021. There are going to be more and more first timers or people that have bought new battery systems, investing in additional tools for their battery systems. And frankly, I think when once people discover DIY; it tends to be somewhat addictive. So I think that, we're going to have, it is a secular shift in my opinion, I think the home center CEOs would agree with that. I've heard them talk about that as well. So that's a big deal. Obviously, it abates over time as the comps kind of get tougher in terms of its percentage impact on growth. And what we saw in 2000, what relative to the Pros was in the beginning the Pros like let's say like April/May projects kind of came to a grinding halt for the most part except for the really essential ones and then into the summer, the Pro started coming back and into the third and fourth quarter, you can't even get a contractor in this country anymore if you want one. So at least I've had that experience. I think the contractors are very busy in the resi and both the remodeling and in the new construction areas. They've got a tremendous backlog. I think they're back. I mean, I think that that has played out. So, as we go forward, I think what we're really looking at is more of kind of going up against the comps and getting back to a more normal environment as we get into 2022 and beyond. But it's -- it is one, it is an artist, you say, and it's difficult to really parse in great detail exactly what's happening. But that is our gut feeling instinct based on what we could see here at this point. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. Jim Loree : Good morning. Nicole DeBlase : Can you just clear something up with respect to the inflation headwind? Is that just the pure inflation headwind? Or is there any offset from pricing embedded in there? And then secondly, my real question is, can you just talk a little bit about expectations for margins within the other two segments, whether you want to talk about expected incrementals on the volume growth that you set out, however you want to do it, but will be good to get some color there, too. Don Allan : Yes, the $75 million is growth inflation, doesn't have any price offset in it. And we'll work through those plans as these emerge and decide, where it makes sense for pricing actions and when, but it is a gross number. And so that means, the annualized number is probably 125 to 150, when you think about it. So -- and that's the right magnitude at this stage for these different areas. The areas that really are being hit hard are steel, resin, electronic components, and then battery cells or base metals, if you want to call it, however you want to call it, but those four categories are things that there's a high demand for right now, as we all know. The question is, how long does that demand last? Is there a parts of the economy that are really going strong, and there's other parts of the economy that are not, that have not recovered as well, and the timing of that recovery is going to depend on how the vaccines roll-out, and how we eventually get the herd immunity, and how quickly that occurs. So, we could be seeing a short-term bubble here that maybe moderates for a period of time, or it could be something that continues to grow modestly over multiple years. So time will tell. But I think we've got that in the right box right now. And it's something we can manage going forward with all the levers that I described. The other two segments for profitability improvement, I could -- I could probably give you all kinds of leverage factors. But I think it might be simpler to just say, if you think about the whole company's operating margin, right, we're trying to improve about 50 basis points year-over-year. Tools is trying to improve roughly the same number, maybe a little bit more and so that means Industrial and Security are going to improve about same number too. So I think you can kind of look at a 50, anywhere from 40 to 50 basis point improvement in all three segments, with the net result for the company about 50 basis points for the full-year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hey, appreciate all the detail this morning, especially on the inflation front. So I only have one question. I don't have like three imaginary ones and a real one. Just thinking about the 4% to 8% Tools & Storage growth for the full-year, Jim, I think you gave some parameters around inventory. Seems like it rounds to something in the neighborhood of two points of kind of full-year benefit from replenishment if we're way off with that, let us know. But is the rest of that, kind of evenly split North America and international, I think if I'm taking some of the inputs and making some assumptions that the team play kind of core growth in the U.S. business inclusive of Pro is pretty modest actually stock, is that kind of a fair calibration of the moving pieces? Jim Loree : Yes. I think it is. It's -- we -- we were talking about four weeks probably is a reasonable number to improve. It is a global number we're talking about because we do see opportunity across the globe, probably heavily, more heavily weighted to North America because we know those inventories are definitely at the very low end of the range of where we like to be. And so maybe 75% to 80% of it is weighted to the U.S. and North America. But I think when you think about the growth that could come with that, it's probably a couple points of growth, maybe two-and-a-half points of growth for the full-year, which means it could be five points in the first half. So that's the magnitude we're talking about. And I think we'll see it start to evolve in Q1. But it might be more heavily weighted to Q2, because the POS just seems really robust in Q1 at this stage. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Alaei Homan [ph] on for Mike. Thanks for taking my question. Just following-up on that. I was wondering if you could talk about your ability from a production and inventory standpoint, to continue to meet the strong POS demand, both in 1Q and just through the remainder of the year ramp-up. And any potential challenges either in capacity or other COVID-19 impacts? Jim Loree : Yes. We were very fortunate that we were able to really -- first of all, we started the year with a really solid on inventory position, both in the company and in the channels, which are at least in North American channels, where the demand really spiked. And so that, that was helpful, because it was kind of a strange situation, but it got into May. And we were looking at POS that was starting to skyrocket and the orders were not coming in from the channel. And so we ended up building quite a bit of inventory, starting in May, actually over $500 million of inventory we built to serve POS demand that was occurring, and we had to kind of bet that the POS was going to continue at that rate, and it did. And that enabled us to really get ahead of the situation so that we've been. Now, if you look at us at this point in time, we're essentially serving the POS and have them for two quarters now. And we're able to do that. Our end user -- our end users continue to be very, very robust in buying Tools, and our channel partners would like more, they would like their inventory restored. That is the challenge. And so one of the things that we've done, and we were also very fortunate from the standpoint of are made in our \"Make Where You Sell\" campaign that we've been working on for three or four years had some pretty significant capacity additions, both in Mexico and in North America and in the U.S., and a number of those are either online or coming online, including a major plant in Mexico and a major plant in the U.S. in later in 2021. And so as we look forward, we're not counting on those to necessarily get the inventories to where they need to be in the channels. But we're looking forward to the fact that we will have more capacity in the system significantly more capacity as we get into 2021. So we're not too concerned about that. In the meantime, there's a tremendous amount of inefficiency that's been built into our cost of goods sold here in the second, third and fourth quarters, especially the third and fourth quarters where in order to meet the fill rate objectives and keep the inventories at the levels that we've been able to, we've done a lot of heroic things that have been costly, things like air freight and expediting and items of that nature. And those items, ultimately will be released, I think to some extent by the capacity coming online in the future. But in the meantime, they're kind of built into the run rate, you can see the margins are even with those inefficiencies are pretty good. And we have really pushed our supply chain hard to serve our customers thus far, and it's been successful as you can see. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Shannon thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2021 first quarter conference call. On the call in addition to myself is Jim Loree, CEO; Don Allan, President and CFO and Lee Mcchesney Vice President of Corporate Finance and CFO of Tools & Storage. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim, Don and Lee will review our 2021 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with other calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Jim Loree. Jim Loree : Thanks, Dennis and good morning everyone. I have to say it\u2019s an exciting day for us here at Stanley Black & Decker. Today, we have the opportunity to report an outstanding start to 2021 highlighted by record revenue and EPS and many other accomplishments. These powerful results were backed by strong markets and excellent operational execution, which supports our improved outlook for the year. And thank you to our 53,000 employees around the globe who delivered these results by maintaining focus on our pandemic era priorities. The priorities of employee health and safety serving our customers with continuous operations and doing our part to help our communities mitigate the impact of the virus have served us extraordinarily well this past year. First quarter revenues were up 34% to $4.2 billion versus prior year, each of our segments and regions contributed to deliver an all-time record 31% organic growth. Our Tools & Storage business continued on its extraordinary growth trajectory, with 45% organic growth, yes, 45% growth in the quarter. All regions and business units contributed to the performance, with blazing hot markets across the globe, led by a confluence of positive factors. Vibrant markets and secular trends, including the consumers reconnection with a home and garden, ecommerce, and outdoor electrification in concert with our ubiquitous channel strategy and an intense focus on supply chain execution enabled a strong business growth. Our portfolio of iconic brands such as DeWalt, Craftsman and Stanley, in combination with industry leading innovation has proven to consistently deliver on-going gains and market share at the POS level and now at the selling level as well. The tools first quarter performance is an outstanding example of what this powerful combination can deliver. Industrial organic growth was 6% as we've seen a strong double digit recovery in automotive, general industrial and attachment tool and markets along with share gains. This was partially muted by continued market declines in aerospace and oil and gas. And for security, 1% organic growth was in line with our expectations given the many restrictions placed on our installation and service techs. We make continual progress with our digital health and safety product offerings, and the security business transformation to a data enabled technology provider is accelerating. We are excited about the full potential of these opportunities to support revenue growth throughout the year. And that was great news regarding our operating margin rate as well. The rate for the quarter was 17.6%, up 760 basis points from the prior year. But volume leverage, productivity, cost control, price and margin resiliency all contributing. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was another all-time record at $3.13, up 161% over prior year. And both our operating cash flow and free cash flow were each about $240 million higher than in the same period in 2020, a year in which the company generated a record $1.7 billion in free cash flow. All-in, an impressive first quarter and a strong start to 2021. This great performance and the sustained market recovery through April has given us more visibility into the second quarter and to some extent the back half as well. As a result, our point of view for 2021 and momentum going into 2022 has significantly improved since I outlined our initial observations during our January earnings call. First, as you can see, tools remains on a roll. In addition to all the positives already mentioned, the Pro is back in full force, and the commercial and industrial markets are hot as well. Europe is far stronger than previously imaginable given many countries are still bogged down in lock downs and the emerging markets are blazing. We are clearly benefiting from secular trends that have been amplified and accelerated by the pandemic. We're also benefiting from the extraordinary efforts of our people to manage the supply chain effectively amidst numerous challenges, including parts availability among others. With that said, many of our retail partners would like to replenish their inventories as our current production levels are basically serving their point of sale growth. In this regard, we recently have begun production in two new factories in Mexico and an additional one in Fort Worth, Texas will be up and running in a matter of weeks. Our current view is that this will enable the approximate four week channel inventory rebuild to occur in the back half of this year. The secular surge and global DIY driven by the consumers reconnection with the Home and Garden continues to be a key demand driver across our global markets. The massive shift to e-commerce continues and we achieved nearly 100% growth in this growing channel during the quarter. The electrification of the outdoor product market is accelerating just as we have launched a significant number of new products and increased listings. We now expect this business to reach $900 million in 2021 up approximately $250 million versus last year. We are already benefiting from our multi year relationship with MTD and our option to acquire the remaining 80% at a very attractive seven to eight times EBITDA multiple with a window that opens in July of this year. Our success comes from building a position as the world's leading Tool Company that can attract diverse world class talent in an array of iconic brands, market leading and leading innovation, immense category, breadth and depth, and a passion to serve our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. In this regard, I would like to underscore a key point. We are gaining share and making bold investments to widen our lead in the future. And as it relates to profitability, we once again delivered significant gross margin and operating margin expansion and are continuing to perform at historically strong levels. At this point, all temporary cost options have been restored. And we are making significant investments as I said. We have incorporated increased inflation into our outlook and we are taking aggressive actions to protect our margins in 2021, 2022 and Lee will review those in a few moments. Additionally, our tech enabled margin resiliency program will support our margin rates. And finally, the market rebounds across automotive, general industrial and attachment and markets and security continued. We remain optimistic that this will continue and the potential for increased global infrastructure spend could enable further gains across the portfolio. So in summary, we have high conviction in our prospects for growth, supported by our catalysts, the positive trends I outlined benefiting our markets and cyclical recoveries across the businesses. As a result, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $10.70 to $11 per share. This represents a significant update from our security's previous guidance. The revised midpoint of $10.85 now reflects a 20% increase versus prior year with a total company organic growth at 11% to 13% for the year. And as you can see, there's a lot to be excited about in what lies ahead of us in terms of significant opportunities for value creation. And now I will turn it over to Don Allan to cover the first quarter and our updated 2021 guidance. Don Allan : Thank you, Jim. And good morning everyone. I am pleased to report on the business segment results that contributed to our exceptional start to 2021. Tools & Storage delivered 48% revenue growth with volume up 42% and price and currency each contributing an additional three points, resulting in 45% organic growth for the first quarter. In addition, the operating margin rate for the segment was 21.4% up 990 basis points versus the prior year. This is the result of the team's relentless focus on margin excellence and strong operational performance. Volume, price, productivity and cost control were the main drivers of this expansion. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher costs and supply chains such as expediting product via air freight to serve the incredibly strong demand, as well as new growth investments to support share gains in the future. On a geographic basis, we had incredibly strong organic growth and market share gains across all regions, up 41% North America, 47% in Europe, and 67% in emerging markets. This performance was driven by our industry leading innovation, strong professional demand, and the on-going trends from secular shifts related to e-commerce, outdoor product electrification, and the consumers reconnection with the home and garden. The U.S. retail channel delivered 48% organic growth, as underlying consumer demand remained elevated with continued momentum from professional and DIY users. Additionally, our omni channel and etailer e commerce platforms nearly doubled in the first quarter, which further reinforces our conviction behind the additional investments we are making to capture this accelerating opportunity. Point-of-Sale growth for the quarter remained exceptionally strong and consistent with the high end of our forecasted Q1 range. Retailer inventories remain relatively in line with Q4 2020 levels, so the anticipated increase in store inventories of approximately four to five weeks is now expected to occur in the back half of the year. The North American commercial and industrial tool channels are continuing to experience positive sequential trends with growth in the mid-30s versus low single digit decline in Q4 2020. Pure play construction focus customers within these channels were up close to 40% more than two times the mid-teens growth we experienced last quarter. That resounding signal that the pro is back and demand is clearly accelerating this space. Also, with the recent positive trends in North American industrial manufacturing activity, our MRO customer base rebounded this quarter as well posting growth in the high 20s as compared to double digit decline in the fourth quarter. Now shifting to Europe, the European tools business relies impressive share gains across all regions generated by the rapid acceleration of e-commerce as well as a retail champ -- the retail channel strength. This performance was led by more than 80% organic growth in the U.K. while France, Central Europe, the Nordics, Italy and Iberia were all up over 30%. Finally, the momentum in emerging markets continued to accelerate with strong construction related demand in addition to impressive traction in e-commerce. Latin America was up 77% organically, with all countries up over 50% and led by an outstanding 86% growth in Brazil. Asia delivered 62% organic growth with China and India both at least doubling in size. South Korea, Malaysia, and Vietnam all grew in excess of 50%, while Japan, Thailand and Indonesia each posted strong double-digit growth for the quarter. Russia and Turkey remained strong, delivering 52% and 89% growth respectively. Those numbers are absolutely crazy, but they're wonderful. So let's turn our attention to Tools & Storage SPUs after reviewing the fantastic geographic revenue performance. Power Tools delivered 50% organic growth, which was the result of continued momentum from the positive home and construction trends, as well as sharp commercial, and supply chain execution combined with new product launches. New core innovations led the way, building upon our strength of Craftsman, the fastest growing brand in the industry, and DeWalt, the largest professional tool brand in the world as measured by total revenue. We built these positions with industry leading innovation, launching products such as Flexvolt, Atomic, Xtreme, Power Detect, Flexvolt Advantage all within the last five years. These products are delivering growth well ahead of the SPU average and are positioned for our pro users. To further highlight positive professional demand, Flexvolt grew over 80% in the quarter. This quarter and moving ahead, we are providing more top line disclosure for our outdoor products business, particularly as it increases importance of the growth catalysts and with our option to purchase the remaining 80% of MTD opening mid-year. I am pleased to report it was a record breaking start to the season with organic growth in excess of 120%. This performance is driven by the incremental listening wins we covered last quarter, and leveraging cordless innovations under the Black & Decker Craftsman and DeWalt brands. All of our major retailers participated in this explosive growth. It\u2019s exciting to see our new products at the market and early season reads on cell two are very positive. This is a major growth margin and ESG opportunity. As we shape the conversion to electrification and bring our cordless capabilities to the outdoor equipment market. We could not be more excited about this industry and the growth potential it creates for our company over the next several years. Finally, hand tools, accessories and storage grew 28% organically as market rebounds, and new product introductions fueled the growth. We continue to innovate in our key construction auto and industrial markets. We are seeing new product momentum, including a variety of Craftsman and DeWalt plastic and metal storage solutions, as well as robots growth and the new DeWalt tape measures and accessories. So in summary, there are a few points I want to reinforce related to our Tools & Storage business. One, we continue to leverage an industry leading position. The team has built this position over time and it is supported by our innovation, brands, category breadth, operational excellence, and focus on keeping our customers and end users at the center of what we do. Two, this is a global phenomenon. The powerful trends that we are harnessing for growth are not unique to one geography. And three, this is fueled, enabled by the dedication, passion and agility of our people. The business delivered the largest first quarter in history as it relates to sales, profits and margin rate and the execution was superb. Thank you to the entire team for a job well done. I am excited about the possibility of record breaking performance is continuing in the future quarters. Well done, tools team. Moving to Industrial, this segment delivered 11% total revenue growth, which includes 6% volume 3% currency, and 3% from the CAM acquisition. This was partially offset by one point from an oil and gas product line divestiture. Segment organic growth continued to improve sequentially with positive 6% growth in the quarter. The operating margin reached 15.9%, an increase of 270 basis points versus prior year as the benefits from volume, productivity and cost reductions were only partially offset by new growth investments. Looking further within the segment, engineered fastening revenues were up 9% organically, as we continue to see improving automotive and industrial end markets. Automotive fasteners were up 16%, outpacing global light vehicle production by approximately 500 basis points. This was held back somewhat as we move through the quarter and navigated OEM disruptions due to their supply shortages. Our automotive system business was up 17% a very good sign that capital spending is improving with our automotive OEM. Growth within industrial fasteners turned positive this quarter, delivering low double digit growth driven by the continued momentum and global manufacturing and industrial activity. Combined with a modest impact from customer inventory increases. Infrastructure organic revenues were down 2% however, attachment tools had 16% growth as demand increase from OEMs and independent dealers. This was more than offset by significantly reduced pipeline construction activity, which resulted in a 30% decline in oil and gas. Shifting to Security. Total revenue was up 2% with a four point positive impact from currency, from price and acquisitions each contributed a point. This was partially offset by a four point decline related to the international divestitures completed in the third quarter of last year. Overall, North America was flat organically as growth and health and safety offerings within automatic doors and healthcare were offset by lower installations within commercial electronic security. The field organization continues to experience productivity challenges, as their customers slowly reopen and allow more on site access. European organic growth was up 4% as new Data Driven Product Solutions supported 17% growth in France, and 4% in the Nordics. France in particular has embraced the technology transfer in a transformation we ignited in this business in 2019. And it's experiencing the growth that we believe is possible across the entirety of commercial electronic security. Our new solutions in health and safety continued to build momentum, contributing approximately two points of growth in the quarter. The positive secular trends and underlying demand once again proved resilient in these markets despite incremental lockdowns due to the pandemic. The bidding code activity for these new solutions continues to build. And that combined with the executable backlog at record highs gives us confidence that security is set up to deliver strong organic growth for the remainder of 2021. Overall security segment profit rate, excluding charges were 8.5%, up 110 basis points versus the prior year. As price and cost control was partially offset by the impact from growth investments related to our SaaS solutions, touchless door technology and other health and safety apps. I would now like to turn it over to Lee Mcchesney who is our VP of Corporate Finance and CFO for Tools & Storage. Many of you know Lee from investor conferences over the last year, and he will now walk you through the cash flow for the quarter. And our game plan to tackle inflation. Lee? Lee Mcchesney : Thank you, Don and good morning, everyone. Moving to slide seven, I will now review our free cash flow performance. Free cash flow improved $242 million versus prior year behind a strong operational performance and earnings growth. Now please keep in mind that a free cash outflow in the first quarter is in line with normal working capital seasonality, which was somewhat amplified by the strong demand to start the year as compared to historically slower period for the business. Working capital balances also are higher than prior year as you work to serve the strong demand as well as improve the inventory positions for us and our customers. Now, despite the higher balances, working capital turns hit 7.1 a one point turn improvement versus prior year. We remain confident that we will do with a strong cash flow generation for the year inclusive of CapEx investments to support further growth. We will continue to drive working capital efficiency across the company in combination with a strong earnings performance. I\u2019d now like to give you a quick update on commodity inflation. As many of you follow, steel and resin represent the two largest commodity exposures, and they have been impacted by rapid spot market increases as a global supply chain responds to the surge of demand and temporary supply gaps. This dynamic has occurred across many of our key commodities, opponents finished goods that we purchase. We now expect inflation headwinds to approximate $235 million, which is up $160 million versus our previous outlook of $75 million. Currency however, remains at $45 million positive offset to this cost pressure. The drivers of the incremental inflation are steel, resins, copper, aluminum, and some purchase materials such as batteries and electrical components. And as a reminder, we generally lock in our supply agreements one to two quarters in advance. And this pressure has to work its way through inventory and therefore, the majority of this year-over-year headwinds will be realized in the second half of the year. In response, we are initiating additional pricing and productivity actions, which will partially offset the 2021 impact of the headwinds as well provide a significant carryover benefits into 2022. We believe these actions can offset about a third to a half of the 160 million incremental headwinds, and I've included that assumption in our guidance. Additionally, we continue to have approximately $100 million of margin resiliency available over the balance of the year, which is not included in our guidance today. This will act as an additional contingency to help us offset any incremental headwinds that may materialize or support a better margin outcome for the full year. We are remaining agile in our response to inflation and are leveraging the SPD operating model to continue to deliver the strong margin levels we've established in full year 2020 and implied in our guidance for 2021. With that, I'll turn it back over to Don, who will walk you through our updated guidance. Don Allan : Thanks Lee. Turning to slide nine, I will now outline the organic growth assumptions for both the second quarter and full year. We expect second quarter organic revenue growth to approximate 30% for the company. In 2Q we expect the Tools & Storage business to grow 35% to 40% with continued strength across all regions and channels. We are planning for industrial to grow in the mid-to-high teens with continued momentum and industrial fasteners and markets and attachment tools. Automotive will continue to show growth on the easier comps. But we haven't cooperated moderated demand levels versus Q1 acknowledging the OEM supply constraints in the industry. Finally, aerospace and oil and gas were expected to remain depressed partially offsetting the stronger growth expectations and other areas of the segment. Turning to Security, we expect low double digit growth in the second quarter. We plan for revenue levels to improve sequentially, as we will benefit from increased access to customer sites to execute on the record backlog from the first quarter. Shifting to the full year we are raising the total company organic growth range to 11% to 13% with upward revisions in Tools & Storage and Industrial. Our confidence of growing market demand in Tools & Storage continues to strengthen. We are raising the Tools & Storage organic growth expectations to 14% to 16% versus our prior estimate of 4% to 8% for the full year. Both the first and second half assumptions improved. The first half assumption is based on stronger visibility to Q2 demand combined with the outstanding Q1 performance. The second half assumption includes the benefit from increases in channel inventory back to historical levels. Despite the improvement, we are assuming a decline between 2% to 4% in the back half acknowledging the tough comps. This represents growth of 12% to 16% versus 2019 and as a reasonable to your growth assumption given the strong market recovery occurring. However, we are preparing the supply chain for stronger demand scenarios and we will be ready should our planning assumption prove to be conservative, which is very which it very well could be given current global demand trends. The industrial outlook improved to 4% to 6% for 2021 as we have better visibility to industrial and attachment to market recoveries. We have built in the expected automotive customer supply chain constraints into our view. And then finally, aerospace and oil and gas will continue to be a significant headwind. Right now our view is that these markets will remain depressed for 2021 but become an upside opportunity next year. Lastly, we are maintaining our security organic growth assumption at 4% to 6% for the full year. The record backlog and commercial electronic security is encouraging and coupled with our data and technology based product offerings, and health and safety solutions. We are optimistic that the growth can accelerate throughout the remainder of the year. Now I'll summarize the remaining guidance assumptions on slide 10. We are raising and narrowing the 2021 adjusted EPS outlook to reflect the exceptional start to the year and improve demand outlook across most of our businesses. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $10.15 to $10.55 inclusive of various one time charges related to facility moves beyond integration costs and functional transformation initiatives. On an adjusted basis, we are increasing the EPS outlook from a $9.70 to $10.30 range, up to a $10.70 to $11 range. At the midpoint this is an increase of $0.85 versus the prior year guide and a 20% EPS growth versus the prior year. The drivers for improved adjusted EPS are outlined on the right hand side of the slide. Walking from the $10 midpoint from our January guidance, incremental pricing and volume net of incremental growth investments, along with margin resiliency, and other actions contribute approximately $1.50. This is partially offset by commodity inflation headwinds of approximately $0.80. In addition, we are planning to call our Series C Preferred Stock and the elimination of the preferred dividend adds a $0.15 benefit to 2021 bringing us to the current adjusted EPS midpoint of $10.85. Demand variability that I covered earlier remains at the primary driver beyond the adjusted EPS. We have also disclosed our current year full -- our current full year assumptions for the significant below the line items and our expectation for the pretax M&A and other charges to assist with your modeling. Additionally, the company is reiterating free cash flow to approximate GAAP net income. And lastly, we expect second quarters adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 25% of the full year performance. So in summary, we expect 11% to 13% organic growth, and approximately 18% to 22% adjusted EPS expansion for the company in 2021. A very healthy EPS expansion for the year, yet a balanced view recognizing the dynamic operating environment. As I said earlier, we are preparing for the potential for higher market demand beyond this guidance view and, as Lee mentioned have $100 million of margin resiliency not included in our guidance as a contingency to drive better performance or withstand new volatility. From a capital allocation point of view, we are very well positioned and have excellent flexibility due to our current cash position and leverage ratios. Therefore, we can retire the preferred stock mentioned earlier and react accordingly if our stock price trend presents an opportunity in the short term while staying on track with our expected timing of MTD later this year or early next. We are confident that we have positioned the company to deliver above market organic growth with operating leverage, strong free cash flow generation and top quartile shareholder returns over the long term, all while maintaining the safety of our employees and continuing to assist in our communities. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jim to conclude with a summary of our prepared remarks. Jim Loree : Thanks so much Don. And as you have they have seen and heard we had a very strong start to the year as we delivered record organic growth reflecting positive secular trends, vibrant markets and a strong array of growth catalysts. I am pleased with our team's continued efforts and excited about the enormous potential given the improved outlook and strong momentum we've built over the last 12 months. As we look to the future, our portfolio is uniquely positioned to benefit from these trends, several of which have been accelerated and amplified by the pandemic, the consumer reconnection with Home and Garden, ecommerce, electrification and health and safety. We are capitalizing on this opportunity by funding innovation, commercial and capacity investments to support continued organic growth and share gains. Additionally, our option to acquire the remaining stake in MTD in July has the potential to add up to $3 billion of revenue in 2022 and create an exciting multiyear runway for growth and significant EPS and cash flow accretion. Our passion for positive differentiated performance, becoming known as one of the world's most innovative companies and elevating our commitment to corporate social responsibility ESG has never been stronger. And that is in the wake of 1,016% TSR delivery during the 20 years or so since I've held C level positions in this company with support during that entire period from Don and Lee. We have a clear vision for winning in the 2020s taking our story to yet an even higher level, which you'll see up close and personal if you attend our virtual growth summit on May 13. This event will be a great opportunity for us to communicate more details on the compelling array of opportunities we are pursuing for growth and margin expansion, as well as our strong commitment to planet people, prosperity and governance. We will be showcasing a number of the executives leading these initiatives. So please reach out to Dennis, if you're interested in attending. And we look forward to seeing you there. And now we're ready for a Q&Q. Dennis? Dennis Lange : Great. Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] : Nigel Coe : Thanks, guys. Good morning. Jim Loree : Nigel, good morning. Nigel Coe : A lot to unpack here. But I think I'll get the ball rolling on inflation. Obviously a big, big step up in the 235 how well ringfenced is that 235 at this point. Are you seeing current spot prices hold, for the balance of the year, and maybe just talk about the price actions you're planning to try and cover that. In particular, I know it\u2019s industrial had neutral pricings. So I'm just wondering, what's, what's the strategy trying to recover price in industrial? Thanks. Jim Loree : Yes, sure. I'll start with that. And then Lee will probably add a little color to. Yes, I mean, we were at 235 for inflation, the impact this year, up about $160 million from what we said back in January. I would say this is a very volatile environment right now. And it really depends on where the demand goes in the back half of the year. I do believe as the year progresses and we get closer to July, it's difficult to have a material impact in the current year, if inflation continues to increase. That being said, there's been a few positive trends in some of these commodities in the last two or three weeks but it appears to be stabilizing. So two or three weeks does not make a trend. But it's something that at least is encouraging in the sense that maybe this is starting to modulate a little bit. But it will be one of the more volatile things that we'll have to manage. Now, the good news is that I do believe we will be managing to a very strong demand market for the remainder of the year, most likely into next year as well. And so that clearly is a benefit associated with inflation. We are aggressively underway have focused on pricing actions across the two major businesses where there's impact, which is obviously Tools & Storage and industrial. Tools & Storage will do what they typically do, which is a very surgical approach focused on areas that we think pricing does not impact demand in a significant way. And so we will manage through that dynamic with our customers as we always do. And I think we'll have a pretty good success rate. Industrial actually is an area that we feel better about. We feel like we have good processes in place, we've already got price actions that we've taken in the last 30 days. And we will likely take some more in the next 90 days in those particular businesses. But we feel like that is well under control and the industrial team has been very focused on that. So I think the area of interest that we're all going to be watching is making sure we get the right impact and pricing in the tools and storage business. Now that being said, we do, we normally do to manage to this dynamic, which is in the short term. We're looking at other areas of productivity. We look at margin resilience is our contingency to help offset that if needed. And we're optimistic as we go through the year that we will find a way to navigate this headwind and be able to offset it completely. Right now, as Lee said we think we're more like 1/3 to 50% at this stage, but as the next three months go by, I think we're going to make more progress in that regard. Anything you want to add Lee? Lee Mcchesney : Yes, I think you said it. Well, it's volatile. But we are we are off promoting on the action side, it's going on in all three businesses. Some have been announced. But we're in conversations with, with all really all parties. And then I remind everyone, we still have our margin resiliency contingency, where we have $100 million, that's not in our guidance. So if inflation was to creep up, we have some coverage there. And, I think we've built a pretty good place. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning. Jim Loree : Hey Jeff, good morning. Jeff Sprague : Good morning. Congrats, hey, maybe this play a little bit into the cost question, but just curious on the new plants, right, to Mexico and Fort Worth finally standing up, I think, you know, initially, those were viewed as kind of presenting an opportunity to shift geographically and get out from under [Indiscernible]. It sounds like they might just simply be need needed for volume, but to what extent do you see an opportunity, to geographically shift to sourcing. And, and kind of change the cost structure from that vantage point. Jim Loree : We'll get there eventually. I would say, unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how you look at it, but the volume you're spot on the volume has precluded any major shift, although you get minor shifts, because the waiting, the change in waiting just from having the additional production in, in these places. But the reality is, in when you're trying to serve, demand, that's up 45%, year-over-year, the opportunity to do production shifts is essentially, limited. And so once the demand returns to what I would call more historical levels, and at some point, it undoubtedly well, then the trend will be in great shape in terms of, we have the plans and programs, we have the people all set up to do it, we just need a window of opportunity to make that happen. And in the meantime, we'll continue to serve the demand that we have. Lee Mcchesney : Yes, I'll just add one thing to that. One thing we are doing is, as we bring up these new plants in Mexico, we are building out the supply base in Mexico with it. And so, to Jim's point, whenever we do get to the stage where we can ship, more production from China into Mexico as an example, the supply base will be well established and well connected to our existing facilities at that stage. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. I just wanted to circle back. Good morning, just wanted to circle back to the margin outlook. Looking at the sort of the guidance for Q2 and what you've said for the year, am I writing thinking that the second half sort of firm wide margin, you're looking at maybe a better sort of 15%, maybe a little bit lower margin in the second half. So down maybe a couple of 100 points year-on-year, just wanted to make sure I wasn't way off on that mat, and also sort of allied to that, if you could help us understand of the 235 million commodity headwinds, how much of that is in the second half, please? Jim Loree : Yes, the commodity headwinds is close to $200 million in the second half. So a large portion that $235 is hitting us in the second half. So which really is a good lead into your first part of your question, which, I do think the operating margin for the company in Q2 will be somewhere around 15%, maybe a little bit higher than 15%, then the back half, it'll be somewhere between 14% and 14.5%, depending on how -- where the demand goes and, and our success and really offsetting that headwind along the lines I described. And so for the full year, our operating margin rate will be up modestly year-over-year. When you look at the big drivers of that clearly a large part of that is in our tools business, because that's where a large part of the commodity headwind is focused at this stage. And so for the second quarter, tool should be around 19%, maybe a little bit better 19% than 19%. And in the back half, it'll be around 17% to 17.5% margins. And so we look at that and we say that's just slightly below our 18% to 20% range that we laid out there and we just want to remind everybody that range wasn't necessarily applicable for every single quarter, it was more about an annual performance and a long term performance as well. And so for the year, we would expect the tools operating margin rate to be, somewhere between 18.5% and 19%. And which would be a significant increase over last year's margin rate of 18.3%. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open. Tim Wojs : Yes. Hey, Hey, everybody. Nice. Nice work, good start to the year. Jim Loree : Thanks, Tim. Tim Wojs : Maybe my my question really just on supply chain? I guess where are you seeing the most acute pressure on the supply side? And maybe if you could just talk a little bit about some of the bigger actions that you're taking to just make sure you're at least keeping up with sell, sell through demand? Jim Loree : Yes. So I mean, it's fairly straightforward, in the sense that it's batteries, semiconductors. We don't have resin shortages, per se. So, some I know some manufacturers are facing resin shortages. That's not our issue. Batteries, I think we have pretty much solved the problem that if the second half, if the second half growth accelerates beyond the guidance. First of all, we're good at the guidance level. And if we're only talking about would upside ever be constrained, batteries, no issue. And I made a trip to Asia, specifically to free up battery capacity for the second half. And we were successful in that regard. So batteries are no issue and it just comes down to semiconductors and how many hundreds of millions of dollars of more upside versus what's in the guidance as it relates to revenue can we achieve before we start running into shortages. And we're working on that issue as well. And we think we have some ability to make headway on that as in that regard as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open. Rob Wertheimer : Hey, good morning, everybody. I know a lot of work with execution. It's, it's remarkable. I wanted to shift from the cost side to the revenue side, and you touched on some of the share gain that you've seen, including the online channel where I guess that kind of accelerates penetration to new markets. And I wonder, whatever additional color you're willing to give on the time, whether this is sent globally online is it continuing to shift. And maybe just for those of us who don't know, the markets as well, when you gain share in EM, or even in Europe, are you are you winning against other global players that, maybe a year or two or three behind you? Or, maybe more winning against smaller players who might have a hard time really ever catching up? I'll stop. Thanks. Jim Loree : Yes, I think our e-commerce strategy was born about 10 years ago, or so when we did the Black & Decker merger with Stanley. And at that time, e-commerce was zero, or close to zero, just a smidge. And year-after-year after year, we worked hard developing that channel after the acquisition or the merger. And last year, we were up in almost $1.8 billion of revenue. And not only did we do it with the major e-commerce player in the United States, but we did it systematically around the globe. And so pretty much everywhere you look we have deep relationships with the big B2B, B2C players, and a flourishing business and that channel shift, that occurred last year, when the percent of revenue went from 12% to 18%. And Tools was truly remarkable. And now, with almost 2x e-commerce growth in the first quarter, that 1.7 billion plus business has incredibly strong prospects globally for this year. And instead of resting on our laurels, and just enjoying that advantage, because we share about a three to one relative market share advantage in that channel, globally. Instead of resting on laurels, we have taken a really significant investments in this channel in beginning of the fourth quarter, third, third, third, fourth quarter of last year and then accelerating into 2021. To the extent that we now have big teams of people working on this project. B2B, B2C around the globe as well as we're starting to go in markets where we are under indexed. So take, for example, China, India, and Germany. And we are investing in D2C capability. And we'll be doing a lot in that regard because those channels are so difficult to penetrate, given the existing share positions of the players that are out there today. So I would say that the share gains are coming from the major power tools, players and other tools, and then maybe in hand tools, is where the minor where local players. And I think that's going to continue, we'll see, we'll see how the e-commerce investments grow in the industry over time, and I would expect them to, but right now, we have a big first mover advantage, and we are pressing the accelerator to the floor to make sure that we sustain that advantage for as long as possible. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Markus Mittermaier with UBS. Your line is open. Markus Mittermaier : Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Jim Loree : Morning. Markus Mittermaier : Morning. Could actually ask the question on security, and especially on the common from France up 17%, Europe up 4% in that data driven product solutions business? What exactly is up? And if there are near term kind of COVID beneficiary that you see? Or is that something that could really make a dent in overall security segment growth here going forward? Thank you. Jim Loree : Sure, Marcus. Yes, we actually holding up France as an example. And that's why I use that, in my comments is really what the business could be. Because they've taken the SaaS solutions, which really drive a lot of value with the customers were. So it's taking data from video analytics, and doing analysis and really helping our customers run their business more efficiently and effectively. And so they're ahead of the rest of the business in the geographies of electronic security. And they've been aggressively rolling this out. And they've, they've used the pandemic as an opportunity to work with our customers. To help them with the areas I described to ensure they achieved higher levels of productivity. They make better business decisions around in the case of if it's a retail operation, where their products are located in a store, when they do discounting and revenue and sales opportunities, etcetera. So this is a great pilot example of what the business can achieve. And then the North American business and the Nordics business in particular, is gaining some traction in this space as well. They're probably three or four quarters behind where France is, but we really see this as an exciting opportunity to continue to transform the business and a great pilot and as an example of what can be done. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open Nicole DeBlase : Yes, good morning guys. Jim Loree : Good morning. Nicole DeBlase : [Indiscernible] inflation discussion? How should we think about the carryover impact at this point to 2022, both with respect to the activity action that you guys plan to put into place perhaps put into place to offset a third? Jim Loree : Perfect Nicole. So as we highlighted earlier, we give you the 21 number. It's yes, I'd say it's the equivalent maybe $150 million to $200 million of potential pressure in 2022. There is a bit of a topic out there of is this inflation going to continue, because there has been some supply disruptions. But right now we're going with the mindset that it will. And accordingly, that's why we're working on the pricing actions to get the benefit. You'll see this year but, next year, you'll actually have a potential scenario where you actually have more benefits than we have head wins. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Alaei Homan [ph] on for Mike, congrats on the results. And thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about your sense for your POS in Tools & Storage relative to the underlying market and whether that delta is widening? So in other words, how much of the strong POS could be related to you gaining share versus an underlying continuing strong market? Jim Loree : Yes, I mean, the POS continues to be very robust, and it's in those numbers that we provided back in January in that range and the trends continue. And so we, we believe that we're gaining very significant share, but there also is a pretty strong market demand as well, that's occurring right now. And so it's difficult to gauge exactly at this stage, in the short window, how much is share gain versus market growth. But I think it's more slanted towards share gain than it is market growth at this stage. And, and so I think that's the right way to think about it, though, the proof will be in the pudding, two or three quarters from now when we're able to look at what the actual GDP performance was, and what the performance was for certain trends in the tool industry. But I believe that if you look at these rates right now, probably at least half of it is related to share gains, if not more. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is open. Ross Gilardi : Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just want to ask about the second half outlook for tools and storage, you took it up, but it's still down. And just really do you feel like you've got to have an inevitable contraction at some point in the next 12 to 18 months, just because the comps and because the markets running so hot, that's that's really more of a timing issue, or could we just be in the beginning of a multiyear sustained expansion? And then just the second part to that? Did you push the four to five week restock into the second half? And essentially leave the minus 7% to 12% underlying for the back half on change? I wasn't sure if I was interpreting your formal remarks properly. Lee Mcchesney : Yes, I will. And that second part of the question we, we did that we just we put the benefit of the inventory restock in the back half of the year. And but we did not change the underlying demand assumption from January. So that's the, that's really the opportunity as we progress through the next 90 days, and we provide an update to all of you in July, where are where are we at that stage? And I think that's the big opportunity in front of us which leads a little bit into the first part of your question that I personally, ask Jim to comment on this as well, because I know he has a strong point of view as well. I really think this is a robust market, we're going to see for a while. And I think when you look at all the different dynamics that are happening in various geographies, and the recovery coming out of the pandemic, people are still going to have a very intense focus on their homes, because many of us will continue to work in a hybrid environment, even when we get back to an office on a on a part time basis. So you want to have an environment at home that really is sufficient to meet the needs of both work and personal habits and behaviors. And then you have things like infrastructure, which are just, massive bills across the globe. I mean, we tend to talk about the U.S. as an area where there could be a potential large infrastructure investment, but there's a lot of other major countries, really, thinking about doing the same thing over the next 12 months to 24 months. So you can see a significant influx into the economy from that as well, both in the U.S. and globally. So I sit here and wonder, is there really a dip coming in the next 6 months to 12 months? And when the more I think about it, the more I feel like that we're going to continue to see this strong demand and growth continue. Obviously, I don't think we're going to grow 40% to 50%, every quarter for the next three years. But I do think there's a path for growth for the next two to three years. Jim? Jim Loree : Yes, I think you've covered it, very well done. But the only thing I would say is I, I think we're going to be able to solidify the base, and then get back to a more normal, kind of 5% to 10% kind of growth type environment after that. That's my best guess right now, just based on, everything I know about the secular trends in particular. You think of what all the different things we mentioned a number of them. But the resurgence of DIY, there's a whole generation of people now that have become familiar with DIY. We have a whole generation of people that are using DeWalt [Ph] Black & Decker, and other Craftsman, other tools that will continue to add to their collections. We have the reconnection with home and garden that Don referenced. Outdoor seems to be the electrification seems to be taken off in a big way. And of course, we'll enjoy electrifying the small gas engine market, when we do the MTD acquisition, which is in our planning assumptions for the second half of this year, in terms of executing the option, and we don't know when that will close and when that closes, not necessarily in our guidance. And then there's the urban exodus. There was a big article in the Wall Street Journal front page today about that. So this whole notion of gradual exodus from urban centers into suburban and rural areas, there's a tremendous amount of home improvement and home sales that go on as a result of that. And that is a generational thing as well. And, and on and on and on. So I just believe the base is preservable. I think our forecast for the second half, is on the conservative side. And in all likelihood, we'll see that base preserved in the second half and my my view, but we have some of the other uncertainties out there relative to inflation and other things that I think we took a very prudent approach to our guidance, we had a great increase. And, just the share gain in general with the company and our e-commerce, our e-commerce share, which is definitely an on-going, an on-going phenomenon. So on balance, I think anybody that's looking for a big contraction in 2022 is probably going to miss the boat. And we'll see. Operator : Thank you. I now turn like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for any closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Shannon thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if they have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2021 second quarter conference call. On the call in addition to myself is Jim Loree, CEO; Don Allan, President and CFO and Lee McChesney Vice President of Corporate Finance and CFO of Tools & Storage. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim, Don and Lee will review our 2021 second quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Jim Loree. James Loree : Thanks, Dennis and good morning everyone. This morning we announced a record second quarter which capped off a historic performance over the last 12 months. Over this period we have delivered $3.1 billion revenue growth now at a $17 billion LTM run rate. Adjusted operating margins reached new heights approaching 17%. Tools operating margins are in excess of 20% and we added $2.9 billion of sales growth in tools including outdoor over the last four quarters. My team and I are proud of the collective effort of our 56,000 Stanley Black & Decker colleagues. We thank them for their resilience and dedication, their agility to cut through the many challenges associated with executing on this massive growth trajectory during the global pandemic. The way they have stepped up is impressive, taking care of customers, our people, our communities, it's a great story. Turning to the second quarter, revenues were up 37% versus prior year to $4.3 billion. We achieved an all time organic growth record of 33% and marked the first time all three segments have currently organized achieved double-digit organic growth in the same quarter. The extraordinary organic growth of 41% in tools demonstrated the power of the world's leading tool company with the best brands and innovation in the industry. All regions delivered robust double-digit growth and our strong commercial and supply chain execution enabled us to capitalize on the positive secular trends and strong markets. Industrial accelerated to 14% organic growth behind the second straight quarter of double-digit growth and share gains in our automotive, general industrial and attachment tool businesses as recoveries in these end markets are continuing. The growth would have been even more robust if not for auto OEM [ph] production delays related to electronic component shortages, and by a few continued cyclically depressed markets such as aerospace. Security had its strongest quarter in the last 10 years delivering 14% organic growth. The security businesses transformation to a data enabled technology provider is accelerating and the team successfully converted a strong backlog into revenue. Order rates were red-hot in the quarter up 36% and the ending executable backlog was at record levels. We're excited about the full potential of these opportunities to support elevated revenue growth in the back half and beyond. Our overall company adjusted operating margin rate remained strong at 15.5%, up 270 basis points from the prior year, with volume leverage, price mix benefits from innovation and margin resiliency more than overcoming the cost of growth investments, commodity inflation and higher expedited transportation costs required to serve the strong demand in tools. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was a second quarter record at $3.08, up 93% over prior year and free cash flow for the quarter was $339 million, up 28% versus prior year, and over $300 million better on a year-to-date basis than our record setting 2020, a year in which free cash flow was $1.5 billion. On the heels of this great performance, we enter this second half with positive momentum and a portfolio that is well-positioned to capitalize on the key trends that are driving growth, a consumer reconnection with home and garden, e-commerce, electrification and health and safety. We are investing across our businesses to capture these opportunities and enable sustained above market growth with margin expansion. And to that end, we are raising our 2021 full year adjusted EPS guidance range to $11.35 to $11.65 per share, a 27% increase versus prior year at the midpoint. Finally, I'd also like to highlight the last week we increased our dividend for the 54th consecutive year. The quarterly payout now stands at $0.79 a share which represents a 13% increase. This is a reflection of the continued confidence we have in the cash generating power of the company.  A strong growing dividend is a key element of our shareholder value proposition and is consistent with our capital deployment strategy to return approximately half of our excess capital to shareholders over the long-term. Of course, repurchases are the other major vehicle we could employ to do that, and notably our Board increased our repurchase authorization last quarter to 20 million shares giving us the flexibility to do some of that as well. During our May Growth Summit broadcast, we showcased several significant catalysts that represent opportunities for a long and rewarding growth runway for Stanley Black & Decker. These catalysts capitalize on key 2020s trends many of which are expected to continue into the foreseeable future. We are expecting that the key market drivers across our global tools markets will continue to be strong demand drivers and support tools growth for some time. Including the secular surge in consumers reconnection with the home and garden as well as the cyclical expansion in North America home improvement, driven by new and existing home sales associated with household formation and the urban exodus. We are investing more than $200 million in innovation, e-commerce, sales and marketing and others, we have never been better positioned to capitalize on market trends. Across the board we have strategic differentiators that make us the world's leading tool company. Our iconic brands, DeWalt, Craftsman, Stanley, Stanley FatMax, and Black & Decker, our category depth, channel development and operations excellence and a track record and commitment to market-leading innovation, our pipeline has never been stronger. We are expanding our cordless product offerings up and down the power spectrum to new users and product categories with our flexible Flexvolt advantage and DeWalt power detect platforms, we are the industry leader in maximizing power output with plan to nearly double the number of products on these platforms over the next three years. Our Atomic and Xtreme platforms leverage the smallest most power dense brushless motor technology in the industry to deliver the highest power to weight ratio available in compact 20 V and 12 V platforms and will expand the product offering across these platforms roughly 4 times over the coming years. These breakthrough products have already delivered significant share gains and they are just getting started. The massive acceleration and the shift of demand to e-commerce was amplified during the pandemic which was an enormous positive for us. We have approximately three times the share in e-commerce as our next closest competitor and we grew our global e-commerce business from 13% of tool sales to 18% in a matter of 12 months, now about a $2 billion channel. This shift to e-commerce is going to continue and we are doubling down our investments in talent, digital capabilities, and our brands, including the revitalization of Black & Decker, which is an iconic brand that has a license to play in the largest breadth of categories within our portfolio. We see a significant opportunity over the coming years as the team re-imagines Black & Decker to drive it towards more youthful buyers as an e-commerce lifestyle brand. The increased focus on ESG and climate and what that means for electrification presents a very compelling multiyear opportunity for us as well. Our existing cordless outdoor power equipment business has grown over 70% in the first half of the year, and an engineered fastening the move from internal combustion engines to hybrid and EV platforms ultimately results into 3x increase in content per vehicle. And lastly, the transformation of our security business to become a technology driven, data solutions provider is gaining significant momentum, and the timing is excellent. The team has done a great job creating various solutions and products that are focused on health and safety, which has never been more relevant as the world continues to battle the pandemic. In addition to these growth opportunities, we are gaining momentum with our Margin Resiliency program. We continue to find new applications and use cases to apply our technology enabled approach that will deliver a runway for sustainable margin expansion in the coming years. And now a brief update on MTD. As many of you know, our option to acquire the remaining 80% of MTD opened up at the beginning of this month. This opportunity is exciting as we bring leading brands and capabilities in the electric outdoor category, as well as the ability to deploy the SBD Operating Model and apply our global scale. MTD brings superb product engineering and manufacturing expertise in outdoor power equipment, capabilities and robotics technology, as well as access to the independent dealer channel in outdoor. We were just at MTD's facilities in Valley City, Ohio last week and came away even more energized by the pipeline for innovation and the runway for growth in 2022 and beyond. The strategic fit is hand in glove and the revenue and cost synergy opportunities are compelling. We are currently in negotiations with MTD on the option execution and should they come to a successful conclusion, and subject to all regulatory approvals, we will begin work on tackling this multiyear opportunity for growth and margin expansion upon closing. And now I'll hand it over to Don Allan to cover a few financial details on MTD, a more detailed discussion on second quarter results, and offer up some 2021 guidance. Don? Donald Allan : Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. Before we leave Slide 5, as Jim mentioned, I want to make a few remarks about some significant financial attributes related to this exciting potential transaction. First, over the last 12 months ending June 30, MTD achieved revenue of approximately $2.5 billion. They have seen great traction on their Spotlight 10 initiative and have improved their EBITDA rate from approximately 4.5% in 2018 to high single digits over this LTM period. As I referenced at Investor Day, MTD has worked tirelessly to meet the supply chain challenges brought about by the pandemic, including limited throughput on larger products, as well as component and input shortages. However, this has muted their output in revenue over the last 12 months. We believe these are temporary and manageable disruptions that can improve with our application of the SBD Operating Model. Consistent with Investor Day and taking into account our recent diligence, we believe that our combined MTD and SBD outdoor platform can become a growth catalyst to deliver $200 million in organic growth per year over the medium-term. Our planning assumption for 2022 continues to call for the addition of MTD. Assuming $2.6 billion in revenue and continued progress on our own expansion, we believe this can contribute approximately 9% adjusted EBITDA margin or just over $230 million in consolidated adjusted EBITDA in 2022. Considering the benefits of our 20% stake currently in our P&L and applying interest and intangible amortization assumptions, this would result in approximately $0.50 of incremental adjusted EPS accretion in 2022. With our pathway for growth and margin expansion, this EPS accretion increases to over $1 by 2025, a strong P&L result that also carries a robust year forecast for our return on investment in the high teens. I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the second quarter. Tools & Storage delivered 46% revenue growth with volume up 38%, currency up 5%, and price contributing an additional 3 points. The operating margin rate for this segment was 20.2%, up 320 basis points versus prior year. Volume, price and benefits from innovation and productivity were partially offset by commodity inflation, higher expedited transit costs to serve stronger demand, and new growth investments. The extraordinary Tools & Storage growth was realized across the globe again in Q2, with organic growth of 30% in North America, 63% in Europe and 85% in emerging markets. This performance was driven by the ongoing strong professional demand and robust levels of innovation across our brands, in addition to the continuation of the global penetration of e-commerce, outdoor product electrification, and the consumers reconnection with home and garden. We continue to see growth and share gain across our brick-and-mortar and e-commerce platforms in U.S. retail with the channel up 22% organically in the second quarter. POS remained robust and retail inventories ended the quarter still below normalized levels. Professional products are leading the growth across the front half and the share gains are consolidating. The first half 2021 POS is up approximately 40% compared to 2019. The North American commercial and industrial tool channels once again experienced positive sequential trends, accelerating to 68% organic growth. The growth was supported by strong professional driven demand and positive trends in manufacturing and industrial production, while our company specific marketing and digital efforts drove share gains with our industrial customers. The European tools business realized 63% organic growth, driven by an expansion in commercial, retail brick-and-mortar, and e-commerce channels, due to the strength of the industrial rebound, coupled with professional construction demand. All regions contributed to double-digit growth and share gains were led by the UK, France and Greece, which were up 130%, 73%, and 67% respectively. Finally, emerging markets was up over 85%, driven by higher construction related demand, all markets contributed to share gains. Latin America was up 136% organically, with all countries at least doubling and Asia delivered 36% organic growth, with at least double-digit growth across the region and India up nearly 3 times. Russia and Turkey delivered another solid performance with organic growth of 78% and 114% respectively. As highlighted at our May Growth Summit, our e-commerce initiative is a strategic growth driver for the business, and we are continuing to invest for further expansion. Second quarter global e-commerce revenue was up nearly 40% versus 2020 with a double-digit growth result from each region. Turning our attention to the Tools & Storage SPUs, our three SPUs had excellent contributions to the overall performance. Power Tools delivered 39% organic growth benefiting from supportive markets and our growth catalysts. This was enabled by the relentless supply chain execution combined with new and innovative product launches across Craftsman, Stanley FatMax and DeWalt. This includes an industry-leading breakthrough innovation, such as DeWalt Power Detect, Flexvolt Advantage, Atomic and Xtreme. DeWalt Flexvolt was our first breakthrough as many of you know and was once again a leader in 2021. Under this brand we are introducing a 15Ah battery and the 60 V SDS-Max 2 inch hammer, both of which will be world's first innovations. Our Flexvolt system is now up to 45 products and is forecasted to represent over $600 million in 2021 revenue. It remains a key growth driver and is a unique and advantage platform that we continue to leverage. We are passionate about innovation and the pipeline continues to be robust. Stay tuned as more breakthroughs are on the horizon for our power tool products. The Outdoor products business grew 40% organically with all regions contributing. This performance is driven by new listings in cordless innovations under the Black & Decker, Craftsman and DeWalt brands. This also includes expanding our offering in walk behind mowers and pressure washers, leveraging our flexible technology and the Black & Decker robotic mower launch in Europe. We continue to expand our cordless technology and other innovations through the outdoor electric category to drive growth, and are very encouraged about the future product pipeline. Finally, hand tools, accessories, and storage grew 42% organically, fueled by robust market demand, and new product introductions. We launched the new DeWalt tough series tape measures and hammers, as well as brought new power tool accessories to the market. We are expanding our offering of new metal and plastic storage solutions across both Craftsman and DeWalt brands in addition to further innovations across our key construction, auto and industrial markets. In summary, growth continues across the globe and within all three of the Tools & Storage SPUs. Equally as important, this growth comes with strong margin performance as a result of the team's continued resilience and disciplined price and supply chain execution. It was a fantastic performance for the Tools & Storage and Outdoor teams. Thank you both teams. Now turning to Industrial. This segment delivered 16% total revenue growth, which includes 13% volume, 3% currency, and 1 point of price. This was partially offset by 1 point from an oil and gas product line divestiture. Segment organic growth improved sequentially with positive 14% growth in the quarter. The operating margin rate of 10.9% was an increase of 210 basis points versus the prior year. Benefits from volume, price and productivity were partially offset by commodity inflation, growth investments, and choppy markets in oil and gas, as well as aerospace. Looking further within this segment engineered fastening organic revenues were up 26% as we continue to see improving automotive and industrial end markets. Our automotive fastener and system sales were up 63% organically. Our fastener organic growth significantly outpaced global light vehicle production, and was up nearly 90% in the second quarter. Out automotive systems business was up 5%, the second consecutive quarter of growth and a positive indication of improving OEM capital investment. At the segment level, we had an approximate 2 point negative revenue impact versus our second quarter plan from OEM semiconductor shortages, which disrupted vehicle production throughout the quarter. Industrial fasteners accelerated to 29% organic growth behind the continued recovery in global manufacturing and industrial activity. All regions contributed double-digit growth and realized share gains. The business soundly outpaced the global industrial production index. Aerospace fastener revenues continued to reduce versus 2020, as they deal with very slow markets due to limited new plane production. However, the recovery is on the horizon and expected likely to begin in 2022. Infrastructure organic revenues were down 11%. Attachment tools realized 16% growth, which was driven by increased OEM and independent dealer demand. Momentum continues to build in this market, with strong backlogs in order rates at our OEM and independent dealer customers. However, there was more than an offset by the dramatic reduction in pipeline activity which resulted in a 55% decline in oil and gas. This market is longer cycle as we know and is yet to see a recovery in new pipeline construction. Shifting to Security, total revenue was up 16% with 13% organic volume, a 6 point positive impact from currency, and a 1 point contribution from price. This was partially offset by a 5 point decline related to Internet, [ph] the international divestitures that we completed in the third quarter of last year. Overall North America was up 16% organically. We continue to get better access to customer sites, and we're able to convert our backlog within commercial electronic security. North America also benefited from strong growth within automatic doors and healthcare. European organic growth was up 12% as new data driven product solutions supported gains in France, and the Nordics, a strong performance considering that many of these markets still have pandemic related restrictions impacting installations. Our new Digital Solutions continued to build momentum, contributing approximately 2 to 3 points of growth, as the business continues to execute a required digital transformation. Overall order rates grew 36% in the second quarter, and the quarter end executable backlog with a record high, which positions the business to deliver high single digit organic growth for the remainder of 2021. Overall Security segment profit rate excluding charges was 8.5%, down 110 basis points versus the prior year rate, as price and volume gains were more than offset by the inefficiencies related to pandemic restrictions, and the cost impact from growth investments such as SaaS solutions, touchless door technology, and other health and safety options. We believe these inefficiencies will fade when the pandemic reaches its final stages, and as the growth investments contribute larger revenue dollars we will see the profitability rate of this business expand as well. Now I will turn the call to Lee McChesney to review cash flow and an update on material inflation, expedited transit costs, and our price actions. Lee? Lee McChesney : Thank you, Don and good morning. Moving to Slide 7, we will review cash flow performance. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $339 million, which brings our year-to-date performance to $93 million. The quarter and year-to-date improvements versus prior year are predominantly driven by robust operational performance and earnings growth and was partially offset by higher working capital and capital spending versus prior year. We are investing in working capital to serve the unusual demands, as well as improvement inventory positions for our customers and for us. Working capital turns hit 6.7, a 1.1 turn improvement versus prior year, reflecting efficiencies delivered in accordance with the SBD Operating Model and the strong revenue performance. We are also making CapEx investments to drive margin resiliency and productivity as well to expand capacity and support further growth. We've had a great start to the year for free cash flow, up over $300 million versus the record 2020 performance, and remain confident that we will deliver strong cash flow generation for full year 2021. Turning to Slide 8. On the left side of the page I'll share some insight regarding the commodity and supply chain environment and SBD's counter measures. Looking at the top of the slide, we have included approximately $80 million of incremental expedited transit costs in the second half that we will incur to serve our improved demand assumption. The level of spend is fairly consistent to what we've realized in the front half of the year. This includes items such as premiums for expediting securing containers for our supply chain and air freight to keep pace with a hot tool market. These costs should alleviate as the global supply chain rebalances and presents an opportunity for cost savings and margin improvement in 2022 and beyond. Now moving to commodity inflation, we continue to see elevated commodity prices, and now expect $260 million of commodity inflation in the second half versus our prior assumption of $210 million. In particular, elevated steel pricing is largely driving the $50 million increase, and for the full year this is up about $65 million and approximately $300 million costs for 2021. Now in April, we discussed taking pricing and productivity actions to partially offset the incremental headwinds identified at that time. We are now in a full implementation mode, and believe we should be in a position to offset approximately 50% of the 2021 headwind. Netting material inflation and better price realization is a neutral effect versus the prior guidance. The goal was to have our actions in place during the third quarter, so that 2022 carryover benefits of price and margin actions fully offset the carryover inflation. And finally, we also have $50 to $60 million of margin resiliency savings that is not included in the guidance to absorb volatility or support better performance. Now I will turn it back to Don to cover our revenue assumptions for the back half. Donald Allan : Thanks Lee. Shifting to the right hand side of the slide, I will now outline the full year organic growth and margin rate assumptions, both overall and by segment. We are raising the total company organic growth range to 16% to 18% versus our prior assumption of 11% to 13%. The primary driver is an improved outlook for Tools & Storage. Our visibility and confidence for sustained market demand continues to strengthen in addition to bringing channel inventories back to historical levels. We are raising the organic growth expectations for the segment to the low 20's versus our prior estimate of 14% to 16%.This results in mid-to-high single digit organic growth in the second half, which is supported by increased customer inventory, as well as continued strong global demand. This assumption represents second half organic growth of about 26% versus 2019, which is consistent with what we just delivered in the front half of 2021. The Industrial outlook is in the low to mid single digit range, which is slightly lower than our mid single digit assumption in April. The primary factors for the change are the impacts from the second quarter, as well as moderating our assumption for oil and gas for the remainder of the year. Lastly, Security organic growth is assumed to be high single digits. The record backlog in commercial electronic security is encouraging and coupled with our data and technology based product offerings, and health and safety solutions, we are optimistic for a strong second half for the business. We are assuming the margin rate for the entire company will improve 40 to 50 basis points year-over-year. We expect the Tools & Storage and Industrial margins to increase year-over-year, even given; one, some of the significant inflationary pressures expected in the second half; and two, key new investments to drive 2022 growth. The Security margins will be relatively flat to the prior year as we manage through the inefficiencies related to the pandemic restrictions, as well as the cost impact from our key growth investments. Now I\u2019ll summarize the remaining guidance assumptions on Slide 9. On a GAAP basis we expect the earnings per share range to be $10.80 up to $11.20, inclusive of various one time charges related to facility moves, deal and integration costs and functional transformation initiatives. On an adjusted basis, we are increasing the EPS outlook to $11.35 up to $11.65 from the previous range of $10.70 to $11. Our revised 2021 guidance calls for organic revenue growth of 16% to 18% as just mentioned and at the midpoint adjusted EPS expansion of 27% versus prior year and 37% versus 2019. The updated outlook reflects our strong first half performance as well as improved visibility to demand in Tools & Storage. We continue to make investments to support our growth catalysts, increase the capacity in our supply chain, and drive our margin resiliency initiatives. The drivers for improved adjusted EPS are outlined on the right hand side of this slide. Walking from the $10.85 EPS midpoint from our April guidance, second quarter performance adds $0.35, second half volume leverage net of expedited transit costs required to meet the improved second half demand adds $0.30. Lastly, as Lee referenced earlier, strong realization in our price actions, offset increased commodity inflation and net to a neutral impact to our guidance. On the left side of this chart, we have disclosed our current year assumptions for the significant below the line items and our expectation for pre-tax M&A, and other charges to assist with your modeling. Behind the strong start to the year, the company is reiterating free cash flow to approximate GAAP net income. Therefore, we believe the free cash flow will likely approximate $1.7 billion in 2021. And lastly, we expect third quarter's adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 21.5% of full year earnings. So in summary, our revised guidance calls for organic revenue growth of 16% to 18% and approximately 26% to 29% adjusted EPS expansion for the company in 2021. This is a very strong year-over-year expansion, yet balanced, recognized in the dynamic operating environment we all continue to navigate. Many of you are probably trying to gauge what this all means for 2022. While it is too early to make a call in the markets for that period of time, our objective and mindset is to grow our core earnings in 2022 in addition to the MTD accretion I outlined earlier. As you heard from Lee, we are in a great position from a price cost perspective and are expecting a neutral impact in 2022 from these items at current commodity prices. Additionally, as you heard at our growth summit in May, we have invested in a powerful set of organic growth initiatives and we are driving several key margin resiliency catalysts that give me confidence that organic revenue and earnings growth is achievable in 2022. The organization remains focused on day-to-day execution, implementing price increases and margin resiliency programs in response to commodity inflation and we are operating in accordance with our SBD Operating Model. We believe the company is well positioned to deliver above market organic growth, with operating leverage, strong free cash flow generation, and top quartile share for the returns over the long-term. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jim to conclude with a summary of our prepared remarks. James Loree : Thanks, Don. I'll keep this summary very brief so as to get right to Q&A. And as you've seen and heard we had a very strong finish to the first half as we delivered exceptional organic growth, strong margin performance, reflecting positive secular trends, vibrant markets and a strong array of growth catalysts. I'm pleased with the team's continued efforts and excited about the enormous potential given the improved outlook, strong momentum we've built over the last 12 months. And as we look to the future, our portfolio is uniquely positioned to benefit from these trends, several of which have been accelerated and amplified by the pandemic, the consumer reconnection with home and garden, e-commerce, electrification, and health and safety. We're capitalizing on this opportunity by funding innovation and commercial and capacity investments to support continued organic growth and share gains. And additionally, our option to acquire the remaining stake in MTD has the potential to generate significant revenue in 2022 and create an exciting multiyear runway for growth and significant EPS and cash flow accretion. Our passion for and conviction in differentiated performance, becoming known as one of the world's most innovative companies and elevating our commitment to corporate social responsibility, or ESG has never been stronger. And now we are ready for Q&A. Dennis? Dennis Lange : Great, thanks Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open. Tim Wojs : Yes. Hey, good morning, guys. Nice shot on the first half here. James Loree : Thank you. Tim Wojs : My questions really on DIY versus Pro, just if you could elaborate on what you're seeing maybe in both markets, particularly DIY as you're starting to, my guess is or my sense is hitting tougher comps right about now in that market? And maybe you can dovetail back, or just with some color on some of the drivers Don, that you mentioned about the confidence around organic improvement in 2022? Donald Allan : Yes, I mean, I think the way to think about DIY and professionals, and clearly we've seen a really strong ramp in professional activity starting in the fourth quarter of last year. But what's interesting, when you look across all our brands, we're seeing strength everywhere. So you saw strength across the different geographies. I mentioned the robust organic growth numbers. You've seen it in all the SPUs, and you're seeing it with all the brands. And so the activity is still pretty intense, both on the DIY and the professional side. Who knows how long the DIY trend will continue. The potential for a Delta variant, maybe slowing down certain activities in the U.S. and other countries could actually continue to stimulate DIY activity for a period of time. But what really has us excited is what's happening on the professional side and how that continues to be very strong. The activity across the globe is continuing to expand at a very rapid pace and obviously the need for our products continues to expand with it as well. So I -- as we sit here today and feel pretty good about the trend we're seeing going into the back half, we do believe there is a way to demonstrate growth in 2022, as I said, and although we'll deal with some tough hurdles and comps, these markets are very strong. And then you combine it with all the growth initiatives that we talked about in our May growth summit, I mean Jim went through them in a fair amount of detail in his opening comments as well today, those really get us excited about the opportunity. So even if demand does start to slow, we see hundreds of millions of dollars of growth opportunities across those particular areas, which has us excited, which is why we think we have the potential to demonstrate organic and earnings growth next year. Dennis Lange : Shannon? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Brandon Reagan : Hey, good morning. This is Brandon Reagan on for Nigel Coe. I just was curious if you guys had any kind of position on the news that carriers potentially selling Chubb [ph] for $3 billion. Just wondering if this had any influence on your thoughts about the security options? James Loree : Well, that's a, it's a, it's an interesting question, because I just happened to see it flash up on my phone about 30 minutes ago, but it is a very nice price. First of all, $3.1 billion, we consider 14.5 times LTM EBITDA must be adjusted a little bit, but still very high multiple. We believe our business is probably worth at least as much if not more, probably another turn or two more than Chubb [ph] all else equal. So you know, that I think pins evaluation on our business that is perhaps a little higher than even we thought it was. And so, there's no direct response to your question right now other than we are obviously digesting the news. And we will continue to evaluate options, whether they be retention of the business, disposition of the business or something in between. So that's where we are right now. Donald Allan : And as I said, my comments would have us really excited before we make that decision that Jim was describing is the trajectory is on for organic growth with this really amazing performance in Q2, we think we could be looking at a business that is in the high single digit organic growth for the full year of 2021. And as the business continues to demonstrate that growth with its new growth initiatives into next year, the profitability rate will come with it. And we'll get past some of these pandemic restrictions as well as those growth investments will start to demonstrate more operating leverage. So we have the best of both worlds, I guess. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone and congrats on your results. James Loree : Thanks. Michael Rehaut : Yes, I just wanted to talk a moment about MTD and a couple questions if I could kind of burn into one in this topic. Number one, your top line you had mentioned, looking at maybe $2.6 billion for 2022 as the company has encountered some maybe supply chain issues. I was wondering if you can kind of give us -- you talked about a $200 million organic growth type of opportunity on a combined basis. But how do you see it, do you see that there was any kind of share issues that might have cropped up I assume the broader market grew nicely, and how you intend to perhaps regain that share and grow the business organically? And then when you talk about, in negotiations for with MTD, for the option exercise. I was just curious, I think too many people just seem relatively straightforward that you had the opportunity to exercise or not, if there are any types of nuances that we might not be aware of, or is it more just a lot of, more basic blocking and tackling? James Loree : Well, Michael, that's a lot of a lot of questions packed in one, but we'll tackle them. First of all, the market itself did grow nicely in 2021 and the growth for MTD was minimal nominal, and that can be traced entirely to supply chain issues. The demand was there and it continues to be there. But like many large equipment providers, they are -- they have struggled a bit with pandemic related issues, labor shortages, also some component shortages and things like that. Some companies have been situated in ways to manage them through the turbulence and still come out with great growth, as you can see in our tool business for example. Other companies may not have had all the wherewithal or the situation might not have lent itself to that same successful outcomes. And so, yes, there was a little bit of share loss because of the supply chain issues, but I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the fundamental strength of the company, the strength of the products, and the brands and the products themselves. I mean, we visited, as I mentioned, last week their headquarters and spent a couple hours looking at their product innovation pipeline. And I can tell you when we marry, successfully completing this deal with regulatory approvals, et cetera, when we are able to marry the brands of Stanley Black & Decker with the products that they've come up with already, and it's going to be a very, very exciting combination. So we're not concerned about the supply chain issues being a long-term issue. We have included in our pro formas a significant amount of resource to manage through those. We bring the scale and the expertise to help do that for them with them. The negotiations, really, so if you think back to the structure, the structure was predicated on essentially a multiple of EBITDA, and the incremental EBITDA that has grown since the time we initially took our 20% stake times 5.5 times, I mean, that's the formula. So, 5.5 times the EBITDA growth, under the theory that we both work together in different ways over the course of time to help them increase the EBITDA, so we should share that increase. And so, 5.5 times is half of11 times, which is what we paid for the 20%. So really, the only negotiation of significance boils down to certain due diligence items, which would be debt like items, maybe certain liabilities that we would see in environmental or tax or those types of things, as well as maybe some adjustments here and there for you to get from a GAAP EBITDA to an adjusted EBITDA, which the formula was based on. So, one example of that would be, since the formula was such a quantitative formula, that the temptation that most folks could have had and didn't actually do this, but they could have, say for instance, decreased their R&D, or they could have shut down their robotics business, which loses a modest amount of money to increase the EBITDA. We asked them to not do anything that would impair the company strategically for the benefit of financial, for their financial purchase price. And they've been very high integrity and so, there may be some adjustments of that sort, but that's fundamentally what's being negotiated. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. James Loree : Good morning. Donald Allan : Good morning. Nicole DeBlase : So I guess the 3Q 21.5% of full year EPS, clearly a bit lower than the normal contribution and there's obviously a lot of moving pieces this year. So maybe you could talk a little bit about when you went through like the freight costs and the impact of price costs, how does that differ, if any, between 3Q and 4Q, just to think about the cadence of margins for the rest of the year? James Loree : Yes, sure Nicole. Yes, I wouldn\u2019t say that the material difference between the third quarter and the fourth quarter, you obviously have some differences in the sense of the timing of the pricing, whereas we continue to have discussions with our customers on price to be implemented throughout the third quarter and that should be completed by the end of the third quarter. So you have a little bit of cadence of that with a full quarter impact in the fourth quarter as a positive. So, that will be helpful trends. You also have something going the other way and the seasonality that plays out of Q3 versus Q4 every year, just the mix of promotions and mix of activities that happen in Q4 versus Q3 can result in anywhere from an 80 basis point to 120 basis point decline in margins in the tools business from Q3 to Q4. And so, when you factor those types of things in yes, we think the tools margins in the back half will be somewhere between 16% and 17%. So roughly 16.5% on average. Q3 will be around the high point of that range, and Q4 will be around the low point of that range. And so that's probably the right way to think it's just, due to that dynamic that I just described. The other two businesses will continue to modestly improve as far as Q2, Q3 to Q4 and their profitability rates, but not in a significant way. So I think that's probably helpful color in that area for you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is open. Ross Gilardi : Yes, good morning, guys. James Loree : Good morning. Ross Gilardi : Yes, I just wanted to go back to MTD a bit, probably you guys are, you're characterizing it as the revenue issue as more of a supply side issue, but clearly gas powered outdoor equipment and losing share to battery electric, which is part of the reason your own outdoor business is up 40%. So I'm just a little bit confused as to why you'd characterize that the shortfall in revenue for MTD as purely a supply side issue. I mean, they're primarily, correct me if I'm wrong, a gas powered outdoor equipment company today and gas powered equipment is ceding share to cordless. So could you just elaborate on that a little bit more? James Loree : Well, if only it was as simple as that. The MTD folks basically make gas powered equipment and specialize in higher end of zero-turn mowers and riding mowers and have some but a relatively limited walk behind business in terms of dollar percentage of total. So electric penetration into riders and zero-turns is roughly about 1% and has stayed pretty constant. So we can't paint MTD with that brush that you are painting them with, number one, because their mix is gas powered. And we know that other gas powered, heavy outdoor power equipment makers grew. And these include some companies that we're very familiar with, that grew in the 10% to 20% range during that quarter. So it is what it is. It's not a shift to electric. We will make that happen later if we're able to execute on this and that's kind of where we are at this point. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Eric Bosshard : Good morning. Yes -- on the tools business, just two things would love to understand a little bit better. First of all, your sense from a market share standpoint, where you're making the most notable progress? And then secondly, your interaction with your retailers, you talked about inventory, but their commitment to building inventories from here and they're focus on that, if you could just expand on those two areas that would be great. Thank you. James Loree : I'd love to hear your opinion on that Eric, but market share in terms of progress, are you talking about products? Are you talking about competitors? All the above? I mean, clearly, there's a very intense battle going on between us and TTI. TTI has picked exclusive, an exclusive strategy in the home centers, with one player, as well as a kind of commercial and industrial strategy predicated on a lot of feet on the street and a lot of investment in sales and marketing resources in that regard. Brand to brand, I'd say, when you look at the two brands, DeWalt and Milwaukee, we believe DeWalt is a stronger brand, but not by that much. When we look at Craftsman and Ryobi, we think that Craftsman is a far stronger brand than Ryobi and that's based on actual research. So, that's kind of the setup there globally. TTI is making some progress, making some investments around the world, but it's largely focused historically on North America and on Australia, New Zealand. So that's kind of the stage there. The interaction with retailers, I think the retailers are as optimistic as we are about the future and I think they would love to have more inventory yesterday. And we keep getting those reminders as we operate our factory system at full bore. And, we're adding capacity, we're adding several plants this year, and that will help. We're also working on making sure that we're looking out far enough on all components that we need and expediting components all around the world to make sure that we can serve their needs from a supply chain perspective, and continue to gain share. So interaction with retailers is great, it's intense. People are kind of really seeking more product and we're doing everything we can to do that, meet their needs. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me, if you have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker\u2019s 2021 third quarter conference call. On the call in addition to myself is Jim Loree, CEO; Don Allan, President and CFO; and Lee McChesney, Vice President of Corporate Finance and CFO of Tools & Storage. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we'll refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 11 :00 a.m. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim, Don and Lee will review our 2021 third quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. And as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Jim Loree. Jim Loree : Thank you, Dennis, and good morning everyone. This morning, we announced a record third quarter, which was powered by 11% growth, primarily result of an impressive 10% organic growth performance. Customer demand remained at robust levels across commercial and retail end markets and strong trends continued in home building and remodeling, commercial construction, professional activity, and global economic growth. Innovation was also a positive, which is driving demand around electrification and other themes. We're continuing to prioritize meeting this heightened customer demand while operating in an unusually complex supply chain environment. I thank our 56,000 employees around the world for delivering record revenue under the circumstances. And in particular, I want to offer a special thanks to our employee makers in plants, DCs and operations organizations, as well as our sales and service people for their incredible dedication, agility, and resilience to serve our customers during this period, as they always do. Tools generated 13% organic growth in what we believe to be the strongest demand environment in our history, resulting from positive secular trends, robust professional activity and strong global markets. Our brands such as DEWALT, Craftsman, Stanley, and Black & Decker among others were fueled by a steady stream of innovation and a strong and resilient supply chain, which is putting great products in the hands of our loyal end users across the globe. Industrial grew 1% organically driven by continued double-digit growth and share gains in our general, industrial and attachment tool businesses. As these end markets remained solid. Industrial growth was tempered however, by lower auto production activity, as OEMs continue to be impacted by electronic and other component shortages. Aerospace also experienced trough conditions as the industry recovery while promising to be likely in the foreseeable future has yet to occur. Security delivered another strong quarter with 8% organic growth, the security transformation to a data enabled cloud-based technology provider is building significant momentum. And our team successfully converted this robust backlog into revenue growth. Order rates were strong and we posted the third straight record quarter and backlog. We're excited about the full potential of these opportunities to support elevated revenue growth in the fourth quarter and beyond. The overall company adjusted operating margin rate was 12.2% down from the prior year as growth investments and higher supply chain costs that accelerated in the quarter, more than offset volume, leverage, price, mixed benefits and margin resiliency. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $2.77 down 4% year-over-year. And similar to most companies engaged in global trade, our supply chain costs were higher this quarter. We have worked tirelessly to get components and finished products to where they need to be to serve this extraordinary customer demand. Through data analytics, we now have visibility into every container on and off the water and we utilize this visibility to prioritize and expedite the most critical items often with premium freight. To offset the additional expenses, we have deployed price increases, surcharges and productivity measures. To be clear, we have made a conscious decision to incur temporarily higher expediting costs to serve our customers and meet demand as effectively as possible. We have sized the pricing and productivity actions to ensure that we are well positioned to address the inflation and achieve margin accretion in 2022. This implies that our actions will be sufficient to restore our margins to normalize levels as the actions catch up to the higher costs in 2022. And further, we remain highly confident in our multi-year growth and margin expansion plans. There are several positive secular demand trends that are benefiting our businesses, and we remain bullish on the resi and non-resi construction markets. As well as the industrial recovery, we have developed an array of growth drivers to position our businesses to capture this opportunity. And we are continuing to invest in innovation, manufacturing, automation, inventory, and our supply chain to meet the strong demand in the near-term and fuel sustainable growth over the medium and long-term. And now I'll take a moment to review our recently announced MTD and Excel acquisitions. The combination of these two high quality complimentary companies with our existing outdoor business creates a powerful growth engine with approximately $4 billion of revenue across all categories and channels in the $25 billion plus outdoor category. Of the $4 billion, we expect approximately $3 billion of the $4 billion to be a direct result of closing the two transactions in the coming weeks. Even before that, we are starting from a position of strength with strong outdoor brands in DEWALT, Craftsman, and Black & Decker, as well as the fastest growing franchise in cordless electric outdoor products. Our legacy outdoor business is benefiting from the long-term trend of electrification, primarily now in handheld products and walk behind mowers. MTD is one of the leading players in U.S. retail with great brands, such as Cub Cadet and Troy-Bilt and brings a relentless dedication to innovation. Excel focuses on zero-turn mowers and offers a range of premier commercial grade and prosumer equipment with Tier 1 niche pro-brands, such as Hustler and BigDog. Excel also brings us access to a strong and extensive professional dealer network. These acquisitions are complimentary to each other and fill gaps in our current presence in the outdoor space, which brings me to another major growth driver. With these acquisitions, we have an ESG opportunity to lead large format electrification and outdoor, the customer adoption of electrified riders and zero-turn mowers is still in the early stages, but the future potential is compelling. In collaboration with MTD, we have been making great progress since 2019 in developing innovative electrified solutions that offer a compelling value proposition in terms of runtime, price point and environmental impact. Additionally, MTD has semi-autonomous and autonomous mowing technology, which we will commercialize in the coming years. Outdoor will undoubtedly unleash an array of impressive innovation over the next few years. Global channel development and professional branding are significant additional revenue synergies that we think as we think about ways to grow sales through our future outdoor activities, applying MTD strong innovation with a leading professional brand, like DEWALT presents an excellent opportunity to win the pro-user with a full lineup of gas and electric options. To fully realize its potential, we plan to build on our existing position in retail, as well as expand our sales in the pro-dealer network. MTD has a strong presence in the retail channel with approximately 1,500 dealer locations. Excel exclusively distributes through its 1,400 outlet dealer channel, which is largely geographically complimentary to MTD\u2019s dealers. The opportunities for brand, product and channel revenue synergies to expand sales and carry accretive margins are both meaningful and exciting. And finally, on one more outdoor growth front, we have an opportunity in the $4 billion high margin parts service segment as we build our presence and serve our customers. The benefits from this growth will also come with margin expansion. As we apply our SPD operating model and our global scale to execute on cost synergies, launch margin accretive innovation and develop a vibrant professional franchise. We expect these opportunities to provide a pathway to mid-teens or higher margins over the long-term. Both acquisitions are currently progressing through their respective regulatory processes. And for MTD, we are happy to say that the United States HSR review is complete. Additional reviews are underway in several other smaller countries. We currently anticipate a close in late 2021 or early 2022 for both transactions pending successful completion of the regulatory processes. And as must be obvious, we're excited about the future of outdoor products at SPD, the significant ESG growth and margin opportunities have the potential for excellent value creation in 2022 and beyond. Extreme innovation is at the heart of SPD\u2019s culture. It is one of our three strategic pillars, performance, innovation and social responsibility. Innovation differentiates all our franchises and defines our brands. Over the last couple of years, we have brought incredible innovation to the market from flexible to atomic and extreme, and now DEWALT POWERSTACK and Black & Decker reviva, which I will cover in a few moments. It is clear that our tools innovation machine has never been stronger. Nonetheless, we are doubling down on our investments in innovation and new product commercialization. These investments will support the largest pipeline we have ever had with new products across all our major categories and end users. Over the last 12 months, we have added approximately 1,300 new employees with deep domain expertise and technical knowledge in critical areas, including sales, engineering, product management, brand, industrial design, e-commerce and end user insights. Our supply chain investments are also key innovation enablers moving closer to the customer, adding capacity, improves agility, customer responsiveness, and speed to market as we develop and commercialize new products. We have approximately $200 million of new innovation and growth investment projects in process, which are included in our second half 2021 run rate. These projects will allow us to effectively better serve the strong global product demand for Tools and position us for sustained long-term growth. Earlier this month, we announced our latest breakthrough innovation, the DEWALT POWERSTACK battery, a remarkable design and engineering achievement. POWERSTACK is the world's first power tool battery to leverage lithium-ion pouch cell technology and introduces a new era of performance for DEWALT power tools. POWERSTACK batteries will begin shipping in the fourth quarter of this year with annual growth potential measured in hundreds of millions. This is another example of our leading edge, differentiated innovation driving the revenue growth potential of our core business. The POWERSTACK battery is 25% smaller, 15% lighter than our comparable DEWALT 20-volt 2 ampere hour battery and it delivers 50% more power with two times the charge cycles making this revolutionary design, the lightest and most powerful and longest lasting compact battery from DEWALT. And it is compatible with our DEWALT 20-volt system. The combination of POWERSTACK and our proven capabilities to design and manufacture the best and most compact brushless motors in the industry. We have just unlocked a new dimension for smaller, lighter and more powerful tools with enormous runway ahead. The importance of this innovation cannot be overstated, more power, more compact, lighter, last longer, guaranteed tough. We love it and so will the market. DEWALT is again asserting itself as the industry leader in professional power tools. And now for something also very exciting, but quite different. It's never been more important for companies to turn their attention to building a sustainable future for our global community. The Black & Decker reviva line is our latest customer offering in creating more sustainable products and driving innovation with purpose. This line of consumers, DIY tools features 50% post-consumer recycled content in the enclosures, which reduces virgin plastic use and supports closing the loop in a circular economy. Partnering with Eastman to apply their Tritan Renew material to our products has created the opportunity to reduce environmental impact, while continuing to develop the performance durability and quality that our customers require. We are delighted to have found a long-term partner in Eastman, a company that will support and accelerate our wider, broader commitment to becoming a force for good in society. This product is a great example of how corporations can embrace ESG in a way that provides meaningful innovation to the consumer, reduces our impact on the environment and drives business performance. The Black & Decker revitalization is a major growth opportunity for the company. And reviva is just one great example of how we're making that happen. And now I will turn it over to Don to talk about our supply chain investments, our business segment results and how we are positioning the company for sustained long-term growth. Don? Don Allan : Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. As Jim just highlighted in his opening remarks, we continue to see a range of powerful secular business drivers that are creating a path for strong multi-year growth for our businesses. In support of that, I want to spend a moment to share a few of the many actions we have taken to position our company for significant growth in 2022 and beyond. Three areas I would like to highlight include our latest investments in expanded manufacturing capacity, strategic sourcing partnerships and the further acceleration of our factory automation initiatives. Beginning with our manufacturing footprint. We are aligning our new investments with our Make Where We Sell strategy as we expand capacity globally. For example in 2021, we are opening two new power tool plants, and one new hand tool facility in North America. These three new facilities will enable shorter lead times and once in place our North American capacity will have tripled since 2016. These new manufacturing plants will be accompanied by a parallel regional development of our local supply chain base over time, enhancing local market sourcing and speed to market. As it relates to strategic sourcing, we have acted and continue to focus on securing sufficient supply of battery cells and electronic components used in our power tools to support our long term growth plans, which include the growing tailwind from electrification. We have co-invested with key battery suppliers to secure dedicated capacity for the next several years. In addition, we are adding new qualified suppliers to diversify our sourcing and working to increase our inventories for battery cells. We made great progress in 2021 and are well positioned for significant supply increases related to battery cells. As it relates to electronic components, we are following a very similar plan. We have made progress in 2021 and are on our way to securing the chips and the throughput to support at least 25% growth in our electronic component supply for 2022. This area is currently an intense pain point. However, we see a roadmap for significant improvement by early spring of 2022. Finally, we are leveraging our Industry 4.0 capabilities to drive manufacturing automation throughout many of our factories. We are deploying multiple projects in our Charlotte manufacturing facility that have a payback of less than one year. These flexible automation projects enable to labor efficiency and increase throughput required to deliver outsized productivity and enable our Make Where We Sell strategy. In summary, we have positioned our business to have the capacity, supply and throughput to deliver significant growth in 2022 and beyond. I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the third quarter. Tools and stores delivered record revenues as we maintained our focus on ensuring, we keep up with the existing market demands. This resulted in 14% revenue growth with volume up 11%, price up 2% and currency contributing an additional point. The operating margin rate for the segment was 15.7% down from 21.5% in the third quarter of last year. As volume, price, productivity and benefits from innovation were more than offset by accelerating transit costs incurred to meet the strong market demand. Additionally, rising commodity inflation and new growth investments related to digital marketing and feed on the street offset those positive items I mentioned. All regions delivered organic growth with North America up 9%, Europe up 20% and emerging markets up 28%. This performance was supported across all markets as the secular shifts related to the reconnection with the home and garden, as well as e-commerce were amplified by our industry leading innovation and the strong professional demand. The high single digit North American growth was underpinned by another strong retail performance up 6%, as point of sale demand remained at robust levels in U.S. retail and channel inventory remained below historical levels. The strong professional driven demand was also demonstrated in the commercial and industrial channels posting 15% growth versus the prior year. Our thesis on demand is playing out as underlying construction activity remained strong and the pro is driving growth. Overcoming a robust growth performance in the comparable period last year and a little bit of moderation in the DIY category. Further demonstrating the durability of these trends, our latest POS results showed mid single digit growth over the last four weeks covering late September through mid-October, with the last measured week up double digits, a very good signal of the healthy backdrop in U.S. retail. The European Tools business experienced growth across all major geographies, along with the commercial, retail brick-and-mortar and ecommerce channels. The region grew 17% organically with a standout ecommerce outperformance up 43% versus the prior year in addition to a notable DEWALT brand strength performance, which achieved 27% growth. Finally in emerging markets growth was pervasive across all regions and was led by trade solutions, cordless power tools and continued ecommerce momentum. All markets are consistently contributing to share gains, including 36% organic growth in Latin America and 22% organic growth in Asia. Finally, our enterprise-wide ecommerce strategic growth initiative continues to deliver strong results. With third quarter global ecommerce revenue up nearly 20% versus 2020. Now, let's turn to the tools and storage SKUs. Power tools delivered 11% organic growth, which was support by the new and innovative product launches across CRAFTSMAN, DEWALT and STANLEY FATMAX. Two great examples of these innovations are one STANLEY 20-volt product line launch with improved battery technology and two, several new offerings across both the extreme and atomic platforms. Moving on to the outdoor business. All regions contributed to an 11% organic growth performance. This was driven by new listings and cordless innovations under the Black & Decker Craftsman and DEWALT brands. Notably, global sales were up over 50% year-to-date as compared to 2020. We delivered industry leading growth rollout new offerings and mowers and handheld products in 2021. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the results of our 2022 line reviews, where we gain significant listings with all our major retailers, supporting our beliefs that outdoor electrification has the potential to be a major growth catalyst for the company. Finally, hand tools accessories and storage grew 16% organically fueled by a robust market demand and new product introductions across our key construction auto and industrial markets. A few highlights include the 20-volt spot laser and the elite circular sawblade within the construction space. Within the automotive aftermarket CRAFTSMAN unveiled a new set of V Series mechanics tools that are designed to professional specifications. We also launched a LENOX GEN-TECH carbide bandsaw for our industrial customers. A lot of wonderful innovation in the third quarter. Also during the quarter, the tools and storage team was awarded 46 Pro Tool Innovation Awards, representing best-in-class products in the construction industry. Well done tools team. I want to thank all the tools and storage employees around the world for their perseverance to navigate this dynamic environment to deliver a fantastic revenue result for the quarter. Demand in tools remains robust lapping strong 2020 growth comps and Q3 saw strong mid 20\u2019s percentile growth as compared to 2019. Now shifting to industrial. Segment revenue expanded by 1%, as 2 points of price and 1 point of currency was partially offset by 1 point of volume and 1 point from an oil and gas product line divestiture. Operating margin was 7.9% down versus 12.3% in the third quarter of last year, as the benefits from price and productivity were more than offset by commodity inflation, growth investments and volume declines in higher margin automotive and aerospace fasteners. Looking further within this segment, engineered fastening organic revenues were down 1% as strong general industrial growth of 23% was offset by market driven aerospace declines and lower automotive OEM production, resulting from the global semiconductor shortage. Our auto fastener growth outperformed light vehicle production by approximately 15 points for the quarter and year-to-date periods. This shows our value add business model is generating share gains, despite the OEM production schedule fluctuations. Infrastructure organic revenues were up 7%, as 16% growth in attachment tools was partially offset by lower pipeline project activity in oil and gas. Momentum continues to build in the attachment tools markets with strong backlogs and order rates at our OEM and independent dealer customers. As we look forward into 2022 and beyond, we are prepared to serve the cyclical growth recovery across many of our industrial end markets. Now shifting to security. Total revenue was up 5% with 7% volume and 1 point contributions from price, currency and acquisitions, which was partially offset by a 5 point decline related to the international divestitures completed in the third quarter of last year. North America was up 12% organically driven by strong backlog conversion and commercial electronic security and solid growth within automatic doors and healthcare. Europe was positive organically led by data driven product solutions in France, which is one of our most mature businesses in activating the new health and safety growth opportunities that we have outlined in the past. Our security business transformation is consistently driving top-line momentum. Order rates globally grew 14% in the third quarter resulting in the third consecutive record quarter-end backlog. Overall security segment profit rate, excluding charges was 9.2% down versus the priority year rate of 11%, as price and volume gains were more than offset by higher labor costs, pandemic related inefficiencies and growth investments such as SaaS solutions, touchless door technology, and other health and safety options. We now have broad customer access, but new safety protocols are extending installation timelines. We are implementing price actions for these new realities while we continue to invest to fuel top line momentum. I will now turn the call to Lee McChesney who will review cash flow and provide an update on our response to the rising costs in key areas of our supply chain. Lee? Lee McChesney : Thank you, Don. Moving to Slide 11, let's review free cash flow performance. Third quarter free cash flow was a use of cash of $125 million, which brings our year-to-date results to a use of cash of $31 million. As you heard from Jim, we are focused on serving our customers and have invested in inventory to serve the robust demand environment here in 2021 and in 2022 and beyond, which is a major item that explains a year-over-year performance. There's also normal seasonality pattern to our working capital that typically results in a significant amount of our cash flow generation occurring in the fourth quarter. We expect 2021 will follow that pattern and are planning for strong fourth quarter cash performance. While ensuring that we make the appropriate investments in inventory and CapEx to support all of our exciting growth initiatives. Let's now move to Page 12 and dive into the supply chain. The environment certainly remains dynamic as we serve the robust demand across the markets. During the third quarter, we experienced accelerated input cost inflation and higher cost to serve demand. We've initiated a comprehensive set of pricing and productivity actions in response. I'll now outline our latest expectations for inflation and our game plan for price recovery. Compared to our July guidance, key commodity inputs, such as steel resins and purchase components accelerated throughout the third quarter, contributing an incremental $100 million in costs. In addition, container and transportation costs, which largely drive our cost to serve experienced a dramatic increase during the quarter. Average container spot prices are now nearly seven times what we were paying earlier this year. Average transit time from Asian suppliers to the North American manufacturing facilities and distribution centers have increased more than twofold from approximately 40 days to 85. Combined, these container and transit cost impacts added an additional $130 million of cost pressure. These underlying assumptions raise our full year commodity and supply chain headwinds to an estimate of approximately $690 million, assuming that known impacts continue. We also are forecasting approximately $600 million to $650 million of carryover cost headwinds for 2022. Now, if you shift to the right side of the page teams across the globe are actively engaged to fully address these headwinds with robust productivity actions to further boost their operational efficiency. We've also completed the price increases that we discussed with you in July and have recently taken further actions, which include communicating a new 5% surcharge in our North America tools and outdoor business, and further price increases across all of our businesses and regions during the fourth quarter. The combination of our market leading brands, when coupled with our robust pipeline for innovation provide the setup for volume and price driven growth in 2022. And then finally, we continue to advance our margin resiliency initiatives and anticipate $100 million to $150 million of opportunity in 2022, which we can leverage to offset incremental headwinds, further invest in the business or contribute to margin outperformance. Within a complex environment, we believe that we've sized the productivity and pricing actions to exceed the anticipated 2022 headwinds. And we are taking the appropriate actions to position the business for margin improvement in the coming quarters. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Don to review guidance. Don Allan : Thanks, Lee. I will now outline the full year organic growth and margin rate assumptions overall and by segments. Our updated full year 2021 guidance calls for organic revenue growth of 16% to 17%, and at the midpoint adjusted EPS expansion of 22% versus the prior year and 31% versus 2019. Tools and Storage and security organic growth expectations are consistent with our prior guidance in the low 20s and the high single digits respectively. The teams will continue to leverage price and cost actions in addition to operational productivity to counteract the extremely dynamic supply chain cost pressures. We are anticipating a relatively consistent level of revenue for Tools and Storage across Q3 and Q4, which both represent total growth in the mid to high 20s versus the comparable periods in 2019. Across all the segments margin rates will be down year-over-year, largely due to the accelerated inflation impacts, which are partially mitigated by the incremental pricing actions that were or will be implemented during the third and fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $10.20, up to $10.45 inclusive of various one time charges related to facility moves, deal and integration costs and functional transformation initiatives. On an adjusted basis, we are moderating the EPS outlook to $10.90, up to $11.10 from the previous range of $11.35 to $11.65. The key assumption changes to the company's prior EPS outlook includes the following four items. One, an incremental $230 million in commodity, transit and labor inflation, which is approximately a $1.25 reduction into EPS. Two, recent currency movements have resulted in a $0.15 negative EPS for 2021. Three, these pressures will be partially mitigated by our incremental pricing actions and other actions, which add an incremental $0.30 EPS. And then four, the benefit of a lower full year tax rate and other below the line assumption will contribute approximately $0.60 of improvement in EPS. We have also disclosed several key full year assumptions and our expectation for pre-tax M&A and other charges to assist you with your modeling. Lastly, the company expects free cash flow to be approximately $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, which contemplates CapEx investment levels to be between 3% to 3.5% of revenue. This updated guidance reflects our desire to maintain temporarily higher levels of inventory to serve the strong demand and improve customer fill rates. That combined with our supply chain investments will set up \u2013 set us up strong for very strong performance in 2022. So in summary, our revised guidance calls for consistent revenue expectations generating organic growth of 16% to 17% and approximately 22% adjusted EPS expansion for the company in 2021. Considering the volatility in the operating environment that we all continue to navigate, this is an excellent top-line performance with significant year-over-year EPS expansion. Moving to the right side of the page. I'll now outline some initial thoughts on 2022. While the environment remains dynamic, we have strong conviction that we can grow our core earnings base in addition to the MTD and Excel accretion. We have been investing in our supply chain and in a powerful set of organic growth initiatives that can fuel mid-single digit organic volume growth in 2022. In addition, we have cost productivity to help us fund investments and enable healthy operating leverage. We are also actively addressing the inflationary environment with pricing actions that should result in 3.5 to four points of price next year, and will allow us to move to more than fully recover to carryover impacts from inflation experience in the second half of 2021. We believe this price and inflation dynamic can be a positive carryover benefit of approximately $0.20 of EPS in 2022. These factors added together should generate approximately $0.90 to $1.10 of EPS accretion. Additionally, MTD and Excel is expected to generate $0.50 of EPS and combined with the prior factors can result in significant double digit EPS growth from operations. Below the line, we are assuming a $0.50 headwind primarily from the tax benefit in 2021, which will not repeat next year. So to summarize with the current inflation and demand environment, we are programming the business to deliver $1 of EPS growth versus our 2021 guidance. Tools and security global markets continue to demonstrate strong demand and our customers have an optimistic view for 2022. Industrial begin to see a cyclical recover in 2022, most likely at a moderate place. We have a clear plan for 2022 growth assuming that conditions we are experiencing today continue. These initial thoughts on what is possible in 2022 will be refined with our guidance to be issued in January once we have a clearer picture of various external inputs. That being said, the market demand environment remains very strong and supportive. We have a phenomenal set of growth catalysts across the businesses, and we are actively addressing the supply and inflation environment, which has not worsened from what we have experienced in Q3. We remain well positioned to deliver above market organic growth with operating leverage, resulting a strong free cash generation that will drive top quartile shareholder returns over the long term. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jim to conclude with a summary of our prepared remarks. Jim? Jim Loree : Thank you, Don. What may not be obvious without stepping back from all this condensed information is this? When we deliver the organic growth in 2022 that Don discussed, and when we close the outdoor transactions. In combination, we will have added $6 billion of growth in the 2021, 2022 time period against a 2020 base of $14 billion that is over 40% growth. So in summary, we continue to execute on the strong demand trends and deliver exceptional organic growth, despite the temporarily challenging supply chain environment. We are enjoying positive secular trends, vibrant markets in a strong array of growth catalysts. And we expect this to continue. I am more than pleased with our team's efforts, and I'm excited about the enormous potential as we close up this year and look forward to continuing top and bottom-line growth to drive shareholder value creation in the coming months and years. And finally, I am excited about all the cultural advancements we have made in recent times to attract, inspire, and engage talent in the 2020s requires an acute awareness and commitment to deliver what that talent is looking for in their company's employee value proposition. We are a purpose driven company with an authentic commitment to diversity and inclusion. We are a company that cares about its stakeholders and is doing its share to be a force for good in society. This is an exciting place for people to thrive and live their purpose. So far it is working. Our ability to attract world class diverse talent has never been stronger and our passion for and conviction in differentiated performance, becoming known as one of the worlds\u2019 most innovative companies and elevating our commitment to corporate social responsibility inspires us and motivates us every day. We are for those who make the world. And with that, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis? Dennis Lange : Great. Thanks Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open. Rob Wertheimer : Hi, good morning. Lot of work going on there obviously. My question is on a couple on pricing. Do you feel reasonably confident on the surcharge going through? I don't know if you've had feedback from channel partners, if you've seen competition, what's been going on. So does that seem likely to go through? And then maybe just a little bit more of a structural question, you mentioned some really interesting data and analytics around the supply chain. Have you changed the analytics and internal rhythms around pricing as well? Such that I don't know if you're trying to move faster in an inflationary environment and I'll stop there. Thank you. Don Allan : Thanks Rob. Those are great questions. And the first one, the surcharge, we have really tied it to these cost to serve costs, additional costs to serve items that we believe obviously are transient in some level. It's just a question of how long they linger in the system. And we believe, we have a very solid basis to make that price increase through a surcharge. We've received a lot of initial feedback from our customers and feel like we're in a very good place to ensure that gets in place in the fourth quarter. So feeling good about that at this stage. On the second around data analytics, I mean, I believe that actually on the pricing side, we got ahead of that a little earlier than we did on the supply chain side. And so we have fairly robust analytics in place around pricing. We don't \u2013 we look at pricing in a much broader way. So pricing is not just about list pricing increases or in this case, a surcharge it's about how do you really manage the mix in the business appropriately? How do you manage the pricing of new products when you put them in the market to ensure that you're pricing them at the right premium, giving the innovations that they are bringing to the end user? All those things have to be factored in. And our Tools team actually has the small organization that works on that full time. And their focus is really how do they drive margin improvement with all those different levers, which can be price \u2013 direct price increases can be surcharges, can be mixed management, new product introductions, as I mentioned. So all those things have to be looked at and we've been doing that for about two years now. And so that's a little bit ahead of the supply chain data analytics that Jim described, which really that was driven by necessity in the summer and fall of last year, just given the complexity of supply chain. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning. Don Allan : Good morning Jim Loree : Good morning. Jeff Sprague : Just to explore price a little bit more, just correct me if I'm wrong on these kind of rough assumptions, but it seems like you're kind of modeling $700 million of price next year and I don't know, $400 million or so of it in North America. I just wonder if you could kind of address specifically North America price kind of the surcharge dynamic versus what you might be trying to do on base pricing. Just thinking about the mechanism here when you have to kind of give the surcharges back so to speak. So I'll leave it there. Lee McChesney : Okay. Hey Jeff, good question. Your numbers are definitely in the right zone. I would do a couple catalysts, keep in mind that in the third quarter, we did execute our, I'll say 4.5% to 5% price increase. So we're delighted with that global execution. And as you look forward here with a surcharge it's in this 5% zone. And then across the globe, the different price increases are in that same range. So that's what we we're doing now. As Don noted earlier, the surcharges linked to these costs to serve increases certainly it's a dynamic environment as we go through the quarter here, if other things come to bear will look at doing other price actions in the first quarter as well, where there could be a bit of a plus and a minus to your point. If the cost to serve environment improves right now, our mindset is that's not going to happen. Don Allan : Yes. I would just add to what Lee said at the end there. The cost to serve dynamic is interesting. It will improve eventually. The question is when will it approve? And so that's why, we took this approach around pricing fairly swiftly in the fourth quarter to respond to it. But we may be dealing with some of these supply chain challenges for another six to 12 months. Hopefully in the back half of 2022, we start to see them ease a little bit, but we're prepared for them to continue to remain for the full year of 2022. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open. Tim Wojs : Yes. Hey everybody, good morning. Maybe just on the volume growth for 2022, the mid single digits that you're kind of highlighting, just curious kind of your confidence behind that and maybe how much of that is driven by just end market sellout growth. Any potential restocking and some of the kind of new product introductions and when you think about POWERSTACK and reviva, how would you kind of think about framing those growth opportunities over the next few years? Jim Loree : Tim, we have made enormous investments in growth. As you can see by some of the output that we talked about here, and you just mentioned. 1300 new employees, $200 million of run rate investment in the run rate and just a massive commitment to increasing the intensity of sales, product development and e-commerce and all sorts of other growth oriented resources. And also as Don mentioned, adding capacity and so forth, the demand is strong. The conditions are supportive. So serving the demand, I think is the challenge. And I think we're confident we've created the demand and the environment is supportive and we need to serve the demand that is challenging, but you can see we delivered on our third quarter organic growth commitment, 10%, despite the challenges that we faced. And so we have a resilient organization and we have all the growth programs in place. And we have a high level of confidence that we can deliver that sort of growth. There's not a whole lot of restocking in that number, a couple of $100 million maybe a tad more, but I think it is important to point out that there's enough stock in the stores to support a POS growth environment, and that we're starting to see that in recent weeks. So we have gotten the inventories in retail up to where they were a year ago. And we still feel like there's a \u2013 maybe a two week to three week kind of additional opportunity for restocking and the retailers will enjoy higher fill rates, when that happens. But right now, the fill rates are sufficient to generate modest POS growth. And that's even before a lot of these new initiatives come to market. Don Allan : I just add one thing to what Jim said. There is the cyclical recovery of industrial. That's still out there, now whether that all happens in one year, because we think that's about $300 million, it's still to be debated, but maybe it happens over two years we get a $100 million to $200 million next year and you get the rest in 2023. So that's kind of an addition to all the things that Jim just mentioned. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Jim Loree : Good morning. Julian Mitchell : Good morning, just wanted to circle back on the operating margin assumption. So it looks like you're aiming for around firm wide and 11% operating margin or so in the fourth quarter, just wanted to check that was roughly the right ballpark. And then for next year, it looks like the margin is sort of flattish maybe up a bit for the whole company for the year so maybe 14% or so. Maybe just help us understand how you expect the first half, second half margin cadence to move given your comments on the price and cost dynamics. Thank you. Jim Loree : Yes, I would say that your presumption on the fourth quarter is pretty accurate. And next year, yes, the operating margin rate expands maybe 30, 40 basis points in that category year-over-year. If you look about, how things will kind of play out quarter-by-quarter, we will see a significant improvement in Q1 versus Q4. Things will get a little bit better in Q2 and then the back half, you'll see another step up of maybe half a point to a point in the back half versus the front half. So we would expect continued progression and improvement in those areas. The cost of serve will still be very high in particular in the first half of the year, but that's probably the right cadence for you to think about. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the question. So just to recap, so we've got a 4% to 5% base price increase going in during the fourth quarter that then rolls forward \u2013 whatever rolls forward into 2022. And then we've got a 5% surcharge in North America in Tools & Storage. Just want to clarify that's what the plan entails and then what's the competitive response here and just if you can just give some flavor in terms of what you're seeing from competitors, are they going out with similar price increases and surcharges and given the import model from similar competitors, which are obviously more import intensive than you are, kind of any share shift that you're seeing within your channels? Jim Loree : So I would say that, yes, the number you mentioned for price going in the fourth quarter is the right number. We believe that everyone for the most part is doing some type of price increasing. The question is what geographies and what magnitude, most of our competitors, if not all of them are being impacted by higher logistical costs to serve, additional costs, so to speak. So everybody's dealing with the same dynamic and it's a question of how much you want to have your margins impacted for a period of time versus offsetting it as quickly as you can with price increases. We've taken a very proactive approach where we have, as you saw from Lee, some significant headwinds that we're dealing with here in 2021 that carry over into 2022. They appear to have stabilized in the last 30 to 45 days, which is in our mind a very positive sign. Maybe we've hit the peak in this area. So now it's really about how do you drive the price increases on various products and different geographies to more than offset that. And so we feel fairly confident at this point that we can get, if not a 100% recovery on the price side versus the headwinds, pretty close to it. And so that's then our approach. Then we have productivity that over and above that, that'll help us fund investments and other things we need to do to continue to grow the business. That is the approach we're taking. And it's an unprecedented period of time around inflationary headwinds, but in some ways it helps us do what we need to do because it is so significant and everyone in the industries that we serve are dealing with it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Markus Mittermaier with UBS. Your line is open. Markus Mittermaier : Yes. Hi, good morning. Maybe just one on\u2026 Jim Loree : Good morning. Markus Mittermaier : Good morning. On supply chain and your comments on semiconductors improving by Q1 2022, just to be sure I understand that right. Is that a Stanley specific comment around sort of your relationships with suppliers or is that market assumptions you make? And do we need that to happen for that dollar of accretion in the markets that you outlined? Thank you. Jim Loree : It's certainly not a \u2013 we do not expect the industry-wide semiconductor market, the semiconductor industry-wide market to basically meet balanced supply and demand until probably 18 to 24 months from now just based on lead times and so forth. But we're a small player in the semiconductor world. We're a niche player and our ability to secure supply has been adequate at this point in time. And as Don mentioned in his remarks, we're already programming to have at least a 25% increase. But that is a Stanley specific phenomenon. And I can't speak for the auto industry or the appliance industry or other industries that use these types of semiconductors. Don Allan : And I would add to that. To be very, very specific in my comments, we have enough commitments in battery cells and electronic components/chips to be able to expand our supply chain by 25% in power tools, if the demand is there for that to be served. And so that will happen by the spring of 2022 is what I was trying to say. And as we said, the guidance that we had for 2022 was mid single digits volume increase. So what he\u2019s basically implying here is that there is, if the demand is there and it\u2019s very robust, we have \u2013 we will have the ability to serve that demand. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Mike Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to circle back to some of the pluses and minuses of the guidance change in 2021. And apologies, if I didn\u2019t catch all the details when you were kind of highlighting the four major differences. But you obviously, the big incremental headwind being the extra $230 million from the supply chain outlook and several offset to that, but still a net $0.50 impact on EPS. I was just trying to ascertain, you highlighted for next year the $100 million to $150 million of margin resiliency. I just wanted to understand how that had been factored in to guidance up until prior to today. And if you were expecting the $100 million to $150 million as a potential benefit this year if that\u2019s still the case and how that has or continue to be reflected in guidance? Don Allan : Yes. Sure, Michael. So as the year has gone on, obviously some of the margin resiliency has flowed through as each quarter has gone by. So as we got to the back half of the year, we still had $75 million to $100 million out there of possible margin resiliency available that was not in our guidance. A lot of that\u2019s dropping through when I made reference to pricing actions and other actions of $0.30 of a positive when I did the walk from our previous guidance to the new guidance. And so that\u2019s where you would see that play through. We do see another $100 million to $150 million next year that is not in the numbers that I mentioned. And so that would be there for contingency or outperformance as we usually do at the beginning of a year. And so I just wanted to clarify that as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Ken Zener : Good morning, everybody. Jim Loree : Hey, Ken. Ken Zener : So Jim, you kind of talked about verse 2019, the $6 billion of incremental, including MTB, and it is very impressive growth. I don\u2019t recall you guys putting a surcharge in all the years that I\u2019ve covered you. So can you talk about maybe just the battery technology that you talked about TTI\u2019s out there, you guys are here, the platform, the batteries, the competitors keep getting squeezed yet, as we saw you couldn\u2019t hit the growth rates in the fourth quarter because of these supply constraints. But could you just maybe take a step back and talk about how technology is really affecting the breadth of product and the tool platform is really increasingly squeezing out the competitors. And if that might change kind of less competitors, more capacity, if that might really change your kind of outlook in terms of how the competitive landscape is moving in your favor. Thank you. Jim Loree : Yes. Well, I wish the competitive landscape was getting easier, but it\u2019s not, it\u2019s intensifying and hence the investments in innovation and capacity and growth and everything. So the pouch technology is very exciting though. It is as I mentioned in my remarks, 50% more power, 25%, more compact, 15% lighter and it lasts twice as long. You get twice as many charge cycles. And one of the nice things about it too, is that the pouch technology batteries do not compete with automotive. So we don\u2019t have to worry about the cylindrical cells that go into power tools being much, much a smaller part of the cylindrical cell market. I don\u2019t think cylindrical cells will go away over time, because the pouch cells are slightly more expensive. So, there\u2019s probably a 10% to 20% type premium on the cost of a battery that lasts twice as long. It\u2019s going to be a very pro oriented product. It\u2019s going to play beautifully with the atomic and extreme compact tools. And over time, I expect it to grow to be a significant part of the market. But I don\u2019t see it crowding out of the competitors. I mean, there are active vital competitors who are continuing to invest and it\u2019s a hotly contested race for market share. I think we\u2019re doing well, but so are some of the competitors. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe O\u2019Dea with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Joe O\u2019Dea: Hi, good morning, everyone. Jim Loree : Good morning. Joe O\u2019Dea: Another one for you on pricing, but I just wanted to understand the mix of the surcharge and then the base pricing. And so when I think about kind of what\u2019s implied in terms of the benefit that you\u2019re anticipating next year, it looks like what would be \u2013 if we apply the total base pricing across the whole portfolio, it looks like what\u2019s implied is more in the kind of 2% range. So when you talk about what you\u2019re implementing right now versus what looks like could be maybe anticipated in terms of realized. Is that kind of the right interpretation that you\u2019re just not sort of fully baking in 4% to 5% of realized base pricing? And it\u2019s more the expectation that that could be 2%. And then why wouldn\u2019t that be better? Jim Loree : Yes. I\u2019ll take that. So I\u2019ll give you a quick answer, we can certainly answer more offline. But keep in mind that we put in the 4% to 5% price increase in the third quarter, and then globally here in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re going after another 5% target. So, you will get to exactly what Don talked about a little bit earlier, which is this kind of 3.5% to 4% zone. That\u2019s really the right mindset to have for 2022. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Thanks, Shannon. We\u2019d like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2021 fourth quarter and full year conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, CEO; Don Allen, President and CFO. And our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and the supplemental presentation, which we'll refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 11 A.M. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim and Don will review our 2021 fourth quarter and full year results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that you may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Jim Loree. Jim Loree : Good morning and thank you, Dennis. As you saw from our press release, we delivered a record year in \u201921 for revenue, organic growth, and EPS. We benefited from extraordinarily strong customer demand, which continues for our innovative products and portfolio of brands, both of which underpin and support our position as the world's number one tool company. I want to thank our colleagues across the globe for their unwavering commitment to serve our customers with the highest quality products as well as for their outstanding effort in helping to deliver this record-setting performance amidst the confluence of COVID era challenges related to supply chain inflation, other external factors. And during the year, we took several significant strategic actions to optimize our business portfolio, completing two outdoor power equipment acquisitions, adding $3 billion of revenue as well as the announced divestiture of our Electronic Security business for 16 times EBITDA, sharpening our focus on tools, outdoor, and industrial. These transactions are reshaping our portfolio into a faster growing, more profitable one with lots of runway to both support and benefit from the ESG movement as well. This portfolio will also benefit from important societal trends, including household formation, increased consumer nesting with focus on the home and garden, electrification, and infrastructure investment. In addition, this month, we plan to begin the return of $4 billion of capital to our shareholders through our previously announced share repurchase program, including as much as $2 billion to $2.5 billion in the first quarter of 2022. We believe these transactions, the acquisitions, the divestiture, and our substantial repurchase will result in significant value creation for investors in the short, medium, and long-term. To summarize our 2021 performance, our revenues were $15.6 billion, up 20%, driven by a record 17% organic growth, with all businesses contributing. Our total company operating margin rate for the year was 13.9%, down versus prior year due to the growing cost inflation and supply chain challenges that emerged as the year progressed, as we chose to take the necessary steps to deliver for our customers. We see this core margin rate as a temporary trough, given that we expect our continued 2021, 2022 pricing actions will be sufficient to fully offset the $1.4 billion of cost growth associated with inflation and increased cost to serve during the same two-year time period. Full year 2021 adjusted EPS was $10.48, a 30% increase versus 2020. And for the year ahead, we have a proactive plan and approach that is focused on execution, growth, margin improvement and strong cash flow. Our teams are focused on leveraging our operating model and execution principles that have allowed us to deliver consistent, strong revenue and EPS growth over many years, including in 2021. Although, we were pleased with the total year revenue and EPS performance, the fourth quarter was challenging, with supply chain and inflationary impacts, which impacted working capital. We strategically prioritized building additional inventory in 2021 to capture the strong demand. And in addition, we experienced the impacts from the clogged supply chain, which intensified as the year progressed as component shortages, shipping delays and inflation drove inventory levels even higher. Accordingly, free cash flow for the year was $144 million, which reflects a $1.8 billion increase in inventory. Suffice it to say this working capital increase was higher than anticipated, unnecessary but partially temporary investment which will reverse by at least $500 million this year, converting working capital back to a cash generator during the year. Our team has a long history of driving working capital turns improvement and asset efficiency with our SBD operating model. We have comprehensive enterprise-wide plans in place to ensure we serve our customers while also delivering strong cash flow in 2022 and beyond. Looking specifically at the fourth quarter. Revenue was up 2% to $4.1 billion with 5 points of price, 6 points from acquisitions. Volume was down 8% due to promotional shipment timing in 2020 and was impacted by logistical supply chain challenges as well. Overall, we remain confident in our multi-year growth and margin expansion plans. There are several positive secular demand trends that are benefiting our businesses. We remain bullish on construction, DIY as well as gradual recoveries in the automotive and aerospace OEM markets. We've developed an array of growth catalysts, including product innovation, e-commerce and electrification to position our businesses to capture this opportunity. And we are continuing to focus on innovation, manufacturing, automation, capacity expansion and our logistics capabilities to meet the elevated demand in the near-term and support strong sustainable growth over the medium and long-term. In this regard, we believe that we are well positioned in 2022 with a target of 7% to 8% organic growth; total revenue growth aggregating over $4 billion; adjusted EPS growth of 15% to 19%; and $2 billion of free cash flow. As noted, our tools and outdoor businesses enjoyed high demand levels across our global markets and channels. And as we think about some of the causal factors in North America, many of the traditional drivers of housing and repair/ remodel activity are trending in a positive direction. Household formation, driven by millennial first-time home purchasers as well as the urban exodus support strong housing demand and the low levels of existing housing inventory will continue to be a catalyst for new residential construction. Home prices have appreciated, building home equity, which generally supports home reinvestment growth through repair and remodel activity. In recent years, the consumer mindset and behavior patterns regarding home and garden have shifted as more time is spent in these environments. Homebase for many has grown in importance, serving multiple purposes, including as a sanctuary, as a locus for increased indoor, outdoor activities and as a workspace for more permanent remote and hybrid workers. These behavioral shifts are driving robust project activity for both contractors and DIYers not only in the US but globally as well. Leading indicators for non-resi construction, such as ABI and Dodge rebounded during much of 2021 and have remained positive as construction activity has continued to recover. Industrial production is returning to pre-pandemic levels as manufacturers look to replenish their supply chains. The growth momentum that we built in 2021 in our industrial fastener and attachment tools businesses is expected to continue in 2022, and we expect to benefit from the recently signed $1.2 trillion US infrastructure bill as well. And lastly, we are cautiously optimistic that the cyclical recovery in auto and aero will begin to emerge in 2022, a $300 million to $400 million multiyear revenue growth opportunity for industrial. And so while there is much to be excited about within our core markets, we will carefully watch for any impacts from a higher interest rate environment or changes in the elasticity of demand following price increases and react accordingly if things change. To keep our market and brand vitality fresh, we continue to invest selectively in growth catalysts, including innovation, e-commerce and electrification. These will position us for sustained share gains in the future. These catalysts capitalize on key global trends, many of which are expected to continue in the coming years. Across the board, we have competitive strategic differentiators that make us the world's leading tool company. Our iconic brands, DEWALT, Craftsman, Stanley, STANLEY FATMAX and BLACK+DECKER, our category depth channel development and operations excellence are coupled with a track record and commitment to market leading innovation. Our new power stack battery system launched in December is enjoying an excellent market reception and has the potential for several hundred million dollars of organic growth in 2022. Popular science called it, quote-unquote, \u201cthe best cordless power tool battery we've ever used.\u201d With our sharpened focus and increased innovation investments, our product development plans are robust as we look to nearly double the number of professional power tool products we offer over the next three years. The rapid acceleration and the shift of demand to e-commerce has continued, and we believe that we have at least twice the revenue in this channel as our next closest competitor. In 2021, we continue to enjoy strong double-digit growth in e-commerce, and it now represents a $2.5 billion channel for us globally and it's approaching 20% of our tool business revenue. The increased societal focus on ESG and climate and what that means for electrification presents a very attractive multiyear opportunity for outdoor power equipment. Our existing business grew almost 40% in 2021 as we continue to drive the conversion of handheld units and push mowers to cordless electric. With the addition of MTD and Excel in late 2021, we have assembled a $4 billion outdoor power franchise, which will lead the conversion of larger equipment such as riders and zero turns to electric and autonomous as well. We have the ability to capitalize on the electrification of automotive as well through engineered fastening. This moves from internal combustion to plug-in hybrid and EV platforms ultimately results in a 3 to 6x increase in Stanley Black & Decker dollar content per vehicle produced by OEMs. We are also focused on the other growth and revenue synergy opportunities in outdoor, such as global channel expansion and brand development. We have a compelling opportunity to serve the professional customer segment by developing gas and electric offerings under the DEWALT brand, among others. We now have access to more than 2,500 independent equipment dealers across the US that carry leading-edge higher-margin products, which serve a professional user. This dealer channel opportunity is compelling as it is sized similarly to the retail channel, but comes with historically higher profitability. Finally, we have an opportunity in the $4 billion high-margin parts and service segment as we build our presence, serve our customers. I'm excited to share that we are updating our expectations for 2022 EPS contribution from these outdoor acquisitions. MTD had a strong finish in 2021 and was able to outperform our initial plan for both revenue and margin. They also remain on track with their margin improvement trajectory as they did a nice job in 2021, implementing price actions to counter inflation and are continuing to do that in 2022. With a higher '21 base and improved forward outlook, we now expect our outdoor acquisitions to contribute $0.85 of EPS in 2022. This represents a $0.20 improvement and a $0.60 year-over-year tailwind for EPS growth. As I sum up my section today, I am excited by the portfolio changes we affected in 2021. The establishment of a high potential outdoor platform, the Security business divestiture and a commitment to repurchase $4 billion in 2022 all set the stage for value creation this year and beyond.  With that, I will turn it over to Don Allan, who will provide some additional insights. Don? Don Allan : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Jim mentioned, we are focused on serving robust demand and investing in our supply chain to position us for sustained growth. We took multiple actions in 2021 to navigate the global supply chain and position the business to have the capacity, sourcing, operational efficiency and resilience to serve our customers and deliver significant growth in revenue and cash flow in 2022 and beyond. These key investments include adding capacity consistent with our Make Where We Sell strategy, co-investing with strategic sourcing partners with a focus on batteries and semiconductors and investing in automation solutions to support productivity, labor efficiency and competitive costs. Our capacity additions are on track, and we have opened 2 new power tool plants and 1 new hand tool facility in North America, which are now ramping up. These new manufacturing plants will enable shorter lead times and be accompanied by parallel regional development of our supply chain base overtime, enhancing local sourcing and speed to market. As it relates to strategic sourcing, we have added new battery suppliers and made co-investments with key partners that have put us in a great position as we enter 2022. We have the necessary battery supply and capacity to support significant growth in tools and to fuel our electrification strategy in outdoor. The supply environment remains tight for semiconductors and electronic components. This plus the elongated global supply chain, which significantly increased inventory in transit, impacted our ability to generate more volume in the fourth quarter. Semiconductor shortages have been a pain point for many global industrials, and we have been investing to improve supply to enable significant tools growth. For example, adding new Tier 2 and 3 suppliers for chips, co-investing with Tier 1 suppliers to improve their capacity and taking actions to lower lead times across our supply base. As mentioned in October, we expect semiconductor supply to improve in Q2 versus current levels. Based on current commitments from our semiconductor suppliers, we expect a 20% to 30% increase in chips in Q2 versus the current run rate. In summary, we have been working to alleviate constraints on many key components and are now down to the last critical few, which will unlock more supply as we move into the second quarter. We are also advancing our Industry 4.0 capabilities, driving automation throughout our manufacturing environment. This will make our U.S. manufacturing plants more competitive, as well as improved productivity in factories across the globe. We just completed a significant flexible automation assembly line in our major U.S. power tool plant. It is up and running. Last year, we also made significant investments in inventory to help meet the outsized demand in the tools business. Excluding the consolidation impact from acquisitions, we increased our core inventory position by $1.8 billion as compared to year-end 2020. Two-thirds of this increase is composed of inputs, work in progress or goods in transit, that will work their way through our supply chain to support growth and improve fill rates with our customers. As a result, fourth quarter free cash flow was $175 million, which brings our year-to-date result to $144 million, significantly below our prior expectation for 2021. The main driver of the deviation was related to the congestion of the global supply chain on working capital. Let me unpack this to provide some additional color. First, we ended up building more inventory and tools versus our expectation. This was primarily related to a combination of goods in transit, expanding in the quarter as we experience port and other logistical delays. The increased tools inventory is needed to serve existing and projected demand, and therefore, we believe we will sell through this incremental inventory during 2022. Secondly, we are holding on to inventory longer than we have historically due to longer shipping and lead times, which has changed the relationship between inventory and payables. This dynamic also led to a deviation versus our October expectations. Finally, the MTD and Excel inventory build ahead of the outdoor season was not in our forecast back in October due to the unknown timing of each of those closings. The global supply chain is dynamic, as we all know, and requires new intensity, focus and agility to react to the changes as well as to be able to predict the dependencies that may be -- may not be consistent with past experiences. We have a long history of using the SBD operating model to drive high asset efficiency, strong cash flow and superior cash flow return on investment. These processes and tools, with some new enhancements, will ensure we mitigate the temporary portion of the inventory increase and the correlated impact to account payables. We will do this while holding the appropriate levels of inventory and making CapEx investments to support the strategic growth initiatives you heard about earlier. We expect to drive working capital efficiency in three primary areas which will increase supply chain predictability, optimize inventory location and improve inventory turns from acquired businesses. One, opportunities will definitely arise as the semiconductor pressure alleviates in Q2 and the electronic component supply improved. Two, we built a dedicated team focused on lowering in-transit inventory. This team will also focus on product SKU optimization of our days of stock, ensuring we have the right inventory when it's needed by our customers. And three, we are also deploying the SBD operating model across our recent acquisitions to drive efficiency in all aspects of working capital. MTD and Excel entered the portfolio around three turns, and we have line of sight to improving that metric across a multiyear period. This management team has dealt with headwinds and temporary shifts in business conditions for two decades plus. And therefore, we are confident that we will improve our turns and believe the cash flow working capital benefit is at least a $500 million opportunity, which is incorporated into our $2 billion cash flow commitment for 2022. In summary, our portfolio and supply chain actions from 2021 have put us in great shape for 2022 and beyond. I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the fourth quarter. Tools & Storage delivered 3% revenue growth as the acquisitions of MTD and Excel contributed 7% and price delivered 5 points. These factors were partially offset by a decline of 8% in volume and 1% from currency. Regional organic growth was 7% in the emerging markets with weaker performances in North America and Europe due to, one, a tough comparable related to the prior year holiday shipping timing; two, the current year volume constraints caused by supply chain logistical challenge I previously mentioned; and three, the anticipated Q4 semiconductor shortages we discussed in October. Pricing actions delivered strong mid-single-digit growth in response to commodity inflation and higher cost to serve aligned with expectations. This was the most significant quarterly price benefit the Tools & Storage business has seen in modern history. The operating margin rate for the segment was 11.4%, down versus last year as pricing benefits were more than offset by inflation, higher supply chain costs, growth investments in volume. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of 2021 as well as the first quarter of 2022 is currently expected to be the peak of the inflation and supply chain cost headwinds, and then these headwinds will begin to recede versus the prior year. This expected trend in headwinds combined with the pricing actions we completed in 2021, the additional price actions to be completed and implemented in 2022 that I will touch on a little bit later in the call, and the cost controls that we recently put in place will result in profitability rates trending back to normalized levels as we move through 2022 for Tools & Storage. End-user demand strength remains persistent across all markets as the consumer reconnection with the home and garden, innovation, and e-commerce continue to drive growth. Our e-commerce platforms grew over 30% in 2021, the innovation pipeline continues to be impressive with new product launches across the portfolio. In addition to an exciting line of new product introductions in 2022, within the DEWALT, FLEXVOLT, ATOMIC and XTREME power tool platform, and also across the construction, automotive and industrial end markets. Point-of-sale demand in US retail grew high single digits and channel inventory ended below historical levels. We saw strong professional driven demand in the commercial and industrial channels, which grew in the fourth quarter and achieved 28% organic growth in the year. Now turning to the Tools & Storage SBU. Power Tools delivered 20% organic growth in 2021, which was supported by the new and innovative product launches across CRAFTSMAN, DEWALT and STANLEY FATMAX, inclusive of DEWALT POWER STACK, which is off to a fantastic start. Hand tools, accessories and storage achieved full year organic growth of 17%, inclusive of 26% international organic growth, fueled by robust market demand and new product highlights, including the Craftsman trade stack and DEWALT ToughSystem portable storage solutions as well as new additions to the DEWALT Elite Series circular saw blade. Moving to Outdoor Products. This business grew 3% organically in the quarter, while the addition of MTD and Excel added over $200 million of revenue. The outdoor team had a great 2021, achieving 40% organic growth, inclusive of share gain led by electrification. This came from new listings and innovations under the Black + Decker, Craftsman and DEWALT brand. Our acquisitions also had strong innovation-led organic growth for 2021 with new launches such as the redesign Hustler FastTrack zero-turn mower line for commercial use and the first semi-autonomous zero-turn mower with Cub Cadet Share path. We are beginning the journey to integrate our acquisitions into a new $4 billion revenue strategic business unit and are making great strides towards becoming one team focused on innovation, growth and capturing the cost and revenue synergies from these transactions. The collective efforts of our tools and outdoor teams across the globe were unrelenting as they continue to navigate this dynamic operating environment. I want to acknowledge and thank the entire team for your perseverance and dedication. Now shifting to Industrial. Quarterly segment revenue declined 7% versus last year, as the three points of price realization were more than offset by 9% volume and 1% currency. Operating margin was 9.3%, down versus last year as the benefits from price and productivity were more than offset by commodity inflation and market driven volume declines in the higher margin automotive and aerospace fastener businesses due to our customers primarily in those markets lowering their production. Looking further within the segment. Engineered Fastening organic revenues were down 9% as strong general industrial growth of 12% was more than offset by aerospace market pressure and lower automotive OEM production, which obviously resulted from the global semiconductor shortage. Our auto fastener business navigated customer production fluctuations and a dynamic market as they move through the year. Despite these external challenges, auto fasteners demonstrated nine points of outperformance versus light vehicle production and the business successfully doubled its revenue tied to electric vehicle production. The business is exceptionally well-positioned for the cyclical rebound in production and for the secular trend of electrification. Our industrial fastener business realized 12% organic growth in the quarter and exit the year with a healthy backlog, which is up nearly 50% versus 2020. It was satisfying to see the business achieve organic growth over 18% in 2021, two times the global industrial production index. While aerospace continued to decline significantly versus prior year, we have started to see green shoots, with revenues sequentially improving for two quarters in a row. This business is focused on capturing the coming rebound in production that will begin in 2022 and continue beyond that. Infrastructure organic revenues were up 3% as 18% growth in attachment tools was largely offset by lower pipeline project activity in oil and gas. Momentum continues to build in the attachment tools market, the strong demand from our OEM and independent dealer customers, generating orders that were up 59% versus the prior year and a backlog that is nearly five times year ending 2020 levels. To summarize our thoughts on Industrial, we saw some pockets of strong growth, combined with early stages of stabilization in the challenged markets I mentioned as we close 2021. And we are looking forward to leveraging the cyclical recovery and to capitalizing on the auto electrification trend over the next two to three years. Turning to the operating environment. We are actively engaged on multiple fronts to support margin recovery and believe headwinds have now stabilized. The 2022 carryover impact inclusive of currency is sized at nearly $800 million. From an input cost and transport rate perspective, we had assumed that the levels seen in the fourth quarter continue for all of 2022. This could be a second half opportunity if recent trends in commodity pricing hold. However, with the continuing dynamic environment, we are not counting on that, and we remain diligent on executing several actions to support margin recovery. We are taking more price actions in the first quarter to offset these headwinds. We are notifying our North American Tools & Outdoor customers this week about new price increases of 5% to 10% or more depending on the category. These actions are in addition to the five points of price already delivered, which underscores that the price environment today is very different from history. Our expectation is 100% coverage of inflation during this cycle. Our 2022 plan now calls for 6% to 7% price, which will be exceeding the carryover cost impact. These actions in aggregate will support sequential margin improvement in the coming quarters and year-over-year margin improvement in the back half of the year. In terms of when price cost turns positive, we still expect that to occur in the middle of the year, as close to 90% of the $800 million of headwinds are estimated to occur in the front half of 2022. Finally, as always, we continue to advance our margin resiliency initiatives and see a pathway to generate $100 million to $150 million of 2022 opportunity. Now before diving into guidance, there's one point that I would like to mention. As a reminder from our release, this guidance does not include the commercial electronic security and health care businesses, which are now recorded as discontinued operations as a result of the announced divestiture in December. Moving to our 2022 guidance on Slide 11. We are planning for total revenue growth in the mid-20s, inclusive of organic growth of 7% to 8% and adjusted earnings per share range of $12, up to $12.50 or increasing approximately 15% to 19% versus 2021. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $10.10, up to $10.70, inclusive of various one-time charges related to facility moves, deal and integration costs, cost reduction and functional transformation initiatives. The current estimate for pre-tax charges is approximately $380 million. From a segment perspective, total Tools & Storage organic growth is expected to be in high single-digits, supported by price, core and breakthrough innovation, continued strong demand across our end markets and the improvement of our customer inventories. The Industrial segment is expected to achieve high single-digit to low double-digit organic growth, driven by new products, pricing, momentum in industrial fasteners and attachment tools and the beginning of a cyclical recovery in auto and aerospace. As it relates to the acquisitions, we believe they will contribute just over $3 billion in revenue in 2022, primarily from MTD and Excel with about 60% of that revenue occurring in the front half. The team is building momentum, and this will be an acquisitive growth driver in 2022, but more importantly, an organic growth driver for years to come. For the full year, it's still our expectation that Tools & Storage will have a strong year-over-year margin expansion on the core, driven by strong second half improvement, as I discussed earlier. Total segment margin will be down as our outdoor acquisitions enter the portfolio with high single-digit profitability. Improving margins from the outdoor acquisition is a focus in 2022 and, of course, beyond. We expect to improve these margins to low double-digits in the one to two-year timeframe and mid-teens in the medium term. For Industrial, the margin rate is expected to expand year-over-year, leveraging strong revenue growth, productivity, and price. Shifting now to the right side of the page, I will outline the drivers of our year-over-year EPS growth at the midpoint. Our plan is to grow our core earnings base with added benefits from the MTD and Excel acquisitions. As we discussed earlier, we are actively addressing the inflationary environment with a 6% to 7% pricing -- set of pricing actions that should allow us to more than fully recover the carryover impact from inflation and the elevated cost to serve, adding $1.20 up to $1.30 of EPS. The carryover impact of our growth investments in SG&A is a headwind of about $0.20 net of our recent cost containment actions. Our outdoor acquisitions are already building momentum and should generate $0.60 of year-over-year benefit, ahead of our prior estimates. We also realized the $0.65 benefit from the 2022 impact of our $4 billion share repurchase program. This is partially offset by tax and other below the line items of $0.55. Our full year tax rate assumption is 10% and we are also planning for increased interest expense due to a higher rate environment and the financing needs of our strategic capital deployment. So, in summary, we expect the business to deliver nearly $1.80 of EPS growth this year to achieve a midpoint of $12.25 of EPS. Now, to cover what this means in terms of the first quarter, which is expected to be about approximately 13.5% of the full year adjusted EPS. We are planning for tools to have a relatively flat organic growth and industrial to decline in the low single-digits, reflecting the tough comp in the automotive business. Acquisitions should contribute about $950 million in revenue as the outdoor season kicks off. Price cost will still be a negative as we experience a significant amount of our full year headwinds in the first quarter. Total company margins should step up from the fourth quarter and in each successive quarter thereafter. We also intend to execute our $2 billion to $2.5 billion of our previously announced $4 billion share repurchase program here in the first quarter. As you think about the quarterly profile for 2022, consider the following factors; one, 90% of our $800 million headwinds occur in the first half of the year; two, the additional pricing actions I mentioned pays into the P&L during the first half; and three, the share repurchase begins to occur in the middle of the first quarter. Therefore, we expect 60% of our annual EPS to be delivered in the second half. For the full year, we expect robust free cash flow generation of $2 billion. This plan considers continued investment in our supply chain, inventory optimization to serve our customers as well as the drawdown of at least $500 million of our working capital, as we previously discussed. We are confident in the steps we have taken and are continuing to take to navigate a dynamic supply environment and optimize our factories. The organization is focused on driving above-market organic growth, delivering on our price and cost control measures, successfully integrating MTD and Excel into the portfolio and leveraging the SBD operating model to improve our working capital efficiency in 2022. We expect executing on these actions, as well as our $4 billion allocation to repurchase shares will deliver 15% to 19% adjusted earnings per share growth and a historic free cash flow performance in 2022. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jim to conclude with a summary of our prepared remarks. Jim Loree : Thanks, Don for that immersion into what was a very complicated or complex quarter with a lot of ins and outs in the portfolio and lots of dynamics in the end markets and so on. So thanks for taking the time and really giving a very transparent view there. And so as you've seen and heard, we are focused on continuing to serve the robust demand in our markets. Our multiyear runway for growth is compelling. We talked about adding $2.5 billion of growth in 2021 and then another $4-plus billion in 2022.  Our EPS and revenue set records in last year, and we expect more of the same this year. So, we're determined that free cash flow will return to record levels in 2022 as the working capital reverts back to a source of cash. And we're confident in our ability to execute in today's dynamic, volatile environment. Our proven track record of performance over many years supports this. Our 6-year revenue and EPS CAGRs, our 6% for revenue, 10% for EPS, respectively, and a new and improved portfolio and a great strategic setup for 2022 and beyond. We're focused on several tactical operational levers to ensure outstanding near-term execution. First, we're leveraging our price productivity and cost control measures to support a margin rebound throughout the year as Don described that. We're well positioned to achieve price covering the entire $1.4 billion of inflation and cost to serve for the 2-year period 2021, 2022. The unusual cost input increases have stabilized for now, and we are monitoring trends closely to ensure that we respond to trend changes as they develop. We're investing in the supply chain to ensure that we have the necessary capacity and supply to fulfill the strong demand and support significant revenue growth this year and beyond. We're off to a good start integrating the outdoor acquisitions, which are positioned to contribute EPS accretion of $0.85 in total, $0.65 year-over-year and $0.20 ahead of our initial expectations. We're driving working capital reductions, which we expect to translate to an impressive cash flow performance in 2022. And lastly, we're expecting to execute on our $4 billion share repurchase program very, very soon. So I'm confident in our collective ability to deliver another strong year in 2022 with outstanding potential for value creation. With that, Dennis, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis Lange : Great. Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi good morning. A lot of good detail in the slides. Maybe 1 point I wanted to home in on was on the Tools volume side of things. I think it sounds like you're assuming that tools volumes organically at least down maybe mid-high single digit in Q1 after backing out price, so, not too different from the trend year-on-year in Q4. Just wanted to check that that's the case. And then maybe as you think about the balance of the year after Q1, there's clearly a lot going on with people trying to figure out the impact of interest rate increases, maybe we start to see some volume headwind from continuously rising prices. So how conservative do you think your tools volume guide is for the year? I think you're assuming volumes are maybe flattish or down a bit in tools for 2022 overall and down more than that in Q1? Don Allan : Yeah. I think, Julian, that's a good assessment of where we think we are with the tools and outdoor businesses from a core perspective, obviously, on an organic basis. So we \u2013 for the year, we're probably looking at a relatively flat volume performance, with a very strong price performance of 6% to 7%, so they're probably leaning closer to 7%. The Q1 dynamic will be volume probably down 4 or 5 points in the first quarter, and then improvement of that kind of modestly as the year goes on. No real big significant volume expectation in any given quarter at this stage. However, we do see that as an interesting opportunity. I mean, there is a lot of uncertainty to your point about where demand may go, what may happen based on all these inflationary pressures and the prices going into the marketplace. So we think we're well positioned by taking the approach we're taking on the price side. But we also see an opportunity that, if demand is strong, we've adjusted our supply chain to be prepared for that and in particular by Q2 on the semiconductor side. And so if demand is there, we'll be able to really meet that demand and improve the fill rates of our customers as well as the inventory levels in the store. Jim Loree : Yeah. The flattish volume is really more of a financial planning construct than it is in operational execution plan. So we are going for as much volume as makes sense and as much as double-digit volume in terms of what we're programming to try to achieve. However, given the uncertainty in the macro, given what remains to be seen in terms of price elasticity of demand for the products, we're trying to be financially conservative here so that, if any of the types of things that I described become factors that we still have a financial plan that makes a lot of sense. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning. Maybe to pick up on that point, right? You delivered what you delivered in 2021 with the semiconductor situation as it was. So Jim, I think you're then implying that with what we heard today on the call about semiconductors, there actually is an opportunity to kind of uncork more volume. I just wonder, if that's kind of the linchpin of the whole kind of volume debate in 2022 and if there are any other particular really pinch points or bottlenecks that you need to work through? Jim Loree : Yeah. Come April, I think we're going to be in a position to really open up that well. So it really is a couple of months of constrained production based on that. And then whatever we can get after that, we've got really good supply definitely enough to support double-digit organic growth beyond that. And of course, the other potential constraint, but it's not going to be an issue for us, would be battery cells, and we've got that one under control with investments that we've made in capacity with major battery suppliers. So, we have the capability come April to open the spigot for volume and produce whatever the market demands. Operator : Our next question comes from Markus Mittermaier with UBS. Your line is open. Markus Mittermaier : Yes, hi. Good morning. Maybe another one on pricing from my side, the 6% to 7%. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit on the various go-to-market channels you have? Has anything changed in your ability to price with the higher proportion of the online business, B2C or the addition of some of the other end markets that you're now going after? How has pricing changed to maybe what we know from the prior cycle? Don Allan : Well, I think, Markus, the way to think about it is there is really no cycle in history that you can really compare this to. I mean maybe you could go back to the 1970s and the inflationary periods back then. But the world clearly was much different and e-commerce didn't even exist back in the 1970s. So, it's a very different timeframe. And so when you look at this situation where you're dealing with $1.4 billion of headwinds at Stanley Black & Decker, we put a significant amount of price in the market in 2021. We have not seen an impact to demand related to that in any of the channels that you referenced. We're putting more, as I mentioned, price increases in the market here in the first quarter of 2022, anywhere ranging from 5% to 10%, depending on the product family or category, in some cases, even higher than that if we see significant gaps versus our competitors or we see a situation where a particular product is being impacted more heavily by the commodity inflation headwinds. So, we'll watch this very closely. I mean it's why we're taking this approach on the volume side where we're not being overly aggressive in forecasting where the volume might go. But we're prepared, as Jim and I both mentioned, to really pursue higher volume. But we have to watch the pricing impact very closely and see the elasticity impact, but it's different. It's a different cycle. This is not the typical cycle where you're looking at maybe putting 3% to 4% price increase in the market to offset your inflationary pressures. You're talking about something that's more above 10% in many cases. And if you look at our peers and other players in both the building products and industrial space, you're seeing the magnitude of those types of increases across the Board. And we believe that's the right approach at this stage. However, we also have to maintain the flexibility and watch this very closely day-to-day and week-to-week and respond accordingly. Jim Loree : There's an existence theorem for this type of environment, not so much the supply-constrained part of it, but the highly inflationary environment in some of the developing markets. So, for instance, Latin America, which often has massive inflation that comes quickly and often is currency-driven. But in those markets, our history of being able to recover price is excellent, our history of being able to stabilize margins at favorable rates is very good. And the continuation of organic growth and strong organic growth in those markets is something that we've been able to sustain for a long period of time. So if this is -- if this environment response is anything like what we've seen in some of those types of situations, the demand continues. So we don't know as Don said, it's uncharted territory. But we're ready for anything, as Don said. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hey good morning, guys. So just a follow up on the price discussion. I think, Don, you mentioned maybe some potential upside from commodities as some of those roll off. How much of the price equation is really tied to something surcharge related where maybe you give some of that back, or I guess, maybe said differently, what are the surcharges tied to in terms of like price benchmarking? And then I guess sort of related, how would you rate your price capture POS relative to what you've seen out of peers? Do you think you're ahead, behind? Some aspect of the competitive environment would be helpful? Don Allan : Yes, I think the surcharge component is probably a couple of points of price that we put in place in the fourth quarter. And it was really more heavily tied to the cost to serve aspect. And so, we had these -- as we all experienced this really intense wave of price increases in logistical space transportation in the summer of 2021 and going into the fall, and that surcharge is really in response to that. Those prices on container costs and other logistic costs have not really changed. They dipped down a little bit in the month of December, but then they pop back up to the previous levels in January. So I don't -- we don't really see any significant shifts in that particular area. And I think the supply chain could continue to be a little bit challenging from a cost perspective for a portion of this year. What I was referring to is more on certain commodities are shipping in the last month or 2, where you're seeing steel pull back a little bit and a couple of other commodities as well. Right now, that if those prices held, that could be a $50 million to $100 million opportunity for us later in the year. So that's kind of the sense of the magnitude. It's not a massive move at this stage. If it continued to improve, and obviously, that number could get better. So we're not seeing shifts that have us concerned about the pricing actions we've taken nor the pricing actions we plan to take here in the first quarter. But again, that will be something we closely monitor. And we also have to keep in mind that we \u2013 it takes a while to get price actions into many of our customers, and you saw that in 2021 play out. And so we're probably a 3 to 6 month lag versus what you might see in some industrial channels versus the building product channels that we're more heavily weighted to. And as a result, you're probably going to have an upside tail on the back end of this as things start to change. And so that's just something to keep in mind as you think about price, where if you compare it to an industrial peer who may have had priced much quicker in 2021 and price may move down sooner in 2022. The dynamic here will be different just because of what I laid out related to the lag and how it really plays out in the building product space. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. You mentioned price elasticity now a couple of times. I'm just wondering if you've seen any signs of that. The POS is strong, but just wondering if you've seen any early signs of that. And it feels like you're prepared to trade lower volumes for higher price. I just want to make sure that's the case. But my real question is, could we just get a bit more definition on how we see the Tools & Storage margins playing out through the year sequentially? It seems like we're starting up at comparable levels to what we saw in 4Q how do we see that building up through the year? Thanks. Jim Loree : I mean in a perfect world, Nigel, we would want to get our margins back to what they've been historically, and we would want to grow with the market and then in excess of the market, gaining share with our product development and our \u2013 all the other growth catalysts that we have. That's what we're aiming to do. Now I've said \u2013 I've mentioned price elasticity, because it's a reality of any pricing environment is such that at some point, there is a change in the consumer's willingness to purchase something at a given price, and there's a lot of different economic factors that consumers are dealing with right now. And so that's just an unknown. And it's not something that we're prepared \u2013 we're not necessarily prepared to trade volume. Let me put it this way, we're not necessarily prepared to trade market share for price. And we will continue to grow our market share. And so we just need to continue to monitor price elasticity, competitive dynamics, all those different things that one does when one manages in an environment like this. Don Allan : And you mentioned margins and profitability and tools, Nigel. And so as you saw, we had 11.4% in the fourth quarter operating margin for the Tools & Outdoor segment. I think the first quarter will be kind of in that ballpark, maybe a little bit better than that number. Then you see a fairly substantial jump in Q2 and in the back half. We're getting pretty close to that 18% number, in particular in the fourth quarter. So it's going to be a gradual improvement in operating margin rates with a bit of a pretty sluggish start in the first quarter because of the fact, as I mentioned. The fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 is really the peak periods for the headwinds. And so you're seeing pretty substantial headwinds in both those quarters, and then they start to recede going forward after that. So that's just something to keep in mind as you factor in your modeling. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Mike Rehaut : Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Just to make sure \u2013 and apologies, if we're beating a dead horse here, but in terms of where you were on last quarter's earnings call, where you're expecting, I believe, mid-single-digit volume growth, and now for Tools & Storage, flattish. I just want to kind of break down the differences between then and now in terms of the expectations. How much is coming from maybe supply chain constraints, which I think you've said you expect to more fully address in the second quarter and going forward versus conservatism from the price increases and that impact on volume in terms of demand elasticity. Just trying to understand where the differences come from. And if there's any other elements that's driving that change in terms of the end market demand for instance. And then secondly, on the price \u2013 the price increases of 6% to 7% company-wide if that is \u2013 we could think about that kind of a similar impact in terms of against Tools & Outdoor and industrial if it's a similar type of allocation. Thanks. Don Allan : Yes. So, Michael, I would say that as you think about what we said in October, obviously, we weren't providing guidance or just kind of giving a high-level framework. And -- but as we progress through the fourth quarter and began to finalize and create our guidance for the full year here in January, I guess, now February, we really recognize that there was a pursuing those actions here in the first quarter of 2022. 5% does not get us to where our margins should be, along the lines that Jim described and I described a few minutes ago. And so we really believe we need to take that approach, and that is the right approach. On the volume side, I would say that there's a little bit of the supply constraint dragging over into Q1 for sure. And so we had an expectation of a little bit better performance in Q1 back in October. But given the dynamics that played out during the -- especially November, December, we think the more prudent view of the approach we're taking with the Tools & Storage organic growth in Q1. And then your question on the 6% to 7%, was that more about, Dennis, more about the split between tools and outdoor? What was some? Dennis Lange : Yes. So, both segments -- no, tools and industrial. Don Allan : Tools & Industrial. Dennis Lange : Yes, I think it's actually when you look at both of those, they are both going after pretty aggressive price actions and there's not a big deviation between the two of them. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe O\u2019Dea with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Joe O\u2019Dea: Hi, good morning. It seems like there's a big step up in earnings expected from one 1Q to 2Q and I'm assuming that that's related to the supply chain side of things and you've talked about April getting better, but I wonder if you can just expand on the visibility you have into that because I think you're putting a finer point on it than others in terms of the timing of some of the supply chain getting better. But just how secure that is at this point for the visibility it gives you? Don Allan : Well, I think when you look at the dynamics of that kind of walk, you obviously have a volume improvement. That's pretty substantial for the reasons that you just touched on around supply chain and semiconductors. You'll see more price flowing through in the second quarter versus the first quarter because of the actions that we're now taking here in Q1. You'll get a bigger benefit in Q2. There's some cost containment actions we've touched on that you get a full quarter benefit of that in Q2 as well. So, -- and then, obviously, some of the headwinds start to level out and recede a little bit versus the prior years. So, all those things together are really driving that improvements from Q1 to Q2. What I would say volume and price being the larger components of those items. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. Everyone, have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the First Quarter 2022 Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2022 first quarter conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, CEO; and Don Allan, President and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim and Don will review our 2022 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. As such, statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Jim Loree. Jim Loree : Thanks, Dennis and good morning, everyone. As you saw from this morning's results, we achieved 20% revenue growth and over 200 basis points of sequential gross margin improvement in the first quarter. We benefited from a sustained strong demand environment, significant and growing price realization and our new strategic outdoor acquisitions. The first quarter results illustrate the operational focus and agility of our teams in managing through a choppy external environment characterized by supportive demand. We are executing pricing to offset inflation and restore margins and beginning a very successful integration process with the new outdoor acquisitions. We will benefit from recent portfolio moves which render a more focused company, anchored by our core tools, outdoor and industrial franchises. In this regard, we announced last Friday the sale of our Access Technologies business for $900 million in an all-cash transaction at a compelling valuation. It represents the final step in our security divestiture initiative and was preceded by the announced sale of our Electronic Security business to Securitas in the fourth quarter for $3.2 billion. These transactions, along with the outdoor acquisitions, will further strengthen our position as the number one tools and outdoor company in the world. With these acquisitions and the security divestitures, we have created a business portfolio that is extremely well positioned for sustained long-term growth and margin expansion as well as one that benefits from several positive secular trends and competitive advantages. During the quarter, we also initiated $2.3 billion in share repurchases through an accelerated share repurchase as well as open market buyback activity. These actions represent significant progress towards achieving our goal of returning $4 billion in capital to our shareholders through repurchases which we expect to complete in '23. Taking into account the approximately $0.5 billion in dividends we expect to pay in 2022, we will have returned $2.8 billion to shareholders by the end of the year, a record for Stanley Black & Decker. These important capital allocation actions along with, one, our now demonstrated and continuing ability to achieve substantial price inflation recovery; and two, progress in reducing supply chain constraints will result in higher growth and margin accretion and thus, significant value creation in both the short and long term. To summarize our first quarter, revenues were $4.4 billion, up 20% driven by our outdoor equipment acquisitions. Organic revenue was down 1% and customer demand remained strong across many of our global markets and price realization accelerated sequentially from the fourth quarter. The volume could have been higher but for the supply-constrained environment that we continue to make progress on resolving, with added supply of semiconductors and electronic components during this quarter, we expect to be able to alleviate all major electronics-related constraints by the end of the quarter. Our total company operating margin was 11.5%, up 250 basis points sequentially, reflecting the implementation of new pricing actions but down versus prior year due to cost inflation and supply chain challenges. This resulted in first quarter adjusted EPS of $2.10 which was ahead of our plan. As we look forward, I'd like to share a few comments on what we're seeing in the demand environment. In Tools & Outdoor, end-user demand across most markets and channels has remained stable, led by pro construction. Absolute dollar sell-through in North America retail continues at high levels, especially when measured sequentially and/or compared with the 2019 baseline. Additionally, we believe that we are gaining market share in North America and other geographies. For instance, based on publicly available disclosures by our top 2 home center customers, our 2021 point-of-sale growth was above category line average for each of them. In our end markets today, while the boom global conditions of 2020 and 2021 have leveled off, the fundamentals and secular drivers remain healthy and are still very much intact. As we look out over the balance of the year, the combination of repair/remodel, new residential construction and commercial construction have plenty of runway to continue to drive enduring demand in many of our markets around the world. Despite this factor of slowing global growth and increasing U.S. interest rates, repair/remodel activity is expected to grow at mid- to high single-digit rates over the next 2 years due to multiple factors, including an aging housing stock, record levels of home equity and strong price appreciation driving big ticket remodeling and tight existing housing supply leading consumers to invest in existing homes as well as spurring demand for new homes. In terms of new residential construction, the years of undersupply of new homes post the 2008 economic crisis has created a significant housing stock supply issue as just as millennials reach the age when they're most likely to purchase a home. We expect that this will continue to support new residential construction activity, even with the interest rate increases currently being contemplated by the Fed. Commercial construction is still in the early stages of a post-COVID recovery and the secular drivers for safe, healthy, professional working spaces and more efficient buildings will contribute to positive activity levels in 2022 and the coming years. And lastly, we have strong backlogs in our industrial businesses and we remain optimistic that cyclical recoveries in the auto and the aerospace sectors are beginning to emerge. This is very meaningful to both revenue growth and profitability for the segment. To size it, we think it is a $300 million to $400 million multiyear growth opportunity with accompanying margins returning to the mid- to high teens over time. And while we see continued momentum within our core markets, we will monitor and respond accordingly if and when we observe any adverse impact from a higher interest rate environment and/or significant elasticity of demand effects following our pricing actions. On top of the market, we continue to reinvest in growth, including leading-edge product innovation, e-commerce and electrification that will position us for sustained share gains. In fact, since the start of the pandemic, we have invested in over 1,500 human resource additions in R&D, commercial and e-commerce functions in Tools & Outdoor. And that is before the impact of any acquisitions. On that note, I'll now address our recent capital allocation and portfolio actions. A key aspect of the Stanley Black & Decker value-creation model is our active approach to portfolio management and commitment to an investor-friendly capital allocation strategy. Over the long term, we look to invest 50% of our excess capital into strategic M&A and return the other 50% to shareholders through a consistent growing dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. The 2 security divestitures were at a trailing EBITDA multiples of mid- to high teens and have a headline price of $4.1 billion in the aggregate, resulting in approximately $3.5 billion of after-tax proceeds. These impressive results validate the investments we made in transforming our security business over the last several years and have enabled significant return of capital to shareholders as well as reinvestment in our highly focused core businesses. Deploying capital into outdoor enabled us to acquire approximately $3 billion of revenue at 8.5x EBITDA and a material opportunity for margin enhancement over time as we fully integrate these businesses and leverage our combined scale, brands, manufacturing expertise, R&D and access to both the retail and the pro channels. Now there has been some noise and misinformation out there about our recent outdoor acquisitions and I'm now going to present you with the facts. We have a sound strategy for outdoor anchored on 4 pillars : electrification, brand and channel strength, cutting-edge innovation and large-format manufacturing capacity and experience. Overnight, we have assembled a formidable leading player in the $25 billion outdoor power equipment market that is capable of growing 10% to 15% organically at mid-teens operating margin for many years to come. This business will lead the charge in the electrification of both large-format and handheld professional outdoor power equipment. We will also bring our outstanding differentiated line of autonomous electrified products under the DEWALT brand to the professional landscaping channel, where the acquisitions comes in network of independent dealers with 2,500 unique outlets, skewing towards the pro market and representing half of the $25 billion addressable market. Such channel access represents a compelling competitive advantage and it is critical to above-average growth and profitability. I'm also excited about the breakthrough innovations resulting from the integration of the outdoor acquisitions. And even though the new team just completed its first quarter together, they've been working together for several years and will bring to market a strong set of new innovations at attractive margins just ahead of the 2023 outdoor season. We're off to a great start and I have strong conviction in our ability to deliver outstanding cordless and autonomous new products to the market that will result in growth and margin expansion. And the 13.7% operating margin delivered in our first quarter together is just a taste of the profitability potential ahead in the coming years. And lastly, we have added 8 manufacturing locations through our outdoor acquisitions. In addition to the instant capacity to support growing demand, the resulting extensive manufacturing footprint gives us an enormous competitive advantage over our small-format, electric-only competitors. In short, despite what you may have heard, our outdoor acquisitions have enabled us to become the outdoor power equipment leader, best positioned to electrify the industry given our multiple competitive advantages. Our outdoor business is now a powerful growth engine with approximately $4-plus billion in annual revenue with anticipated organic growth of 10% to 15% a year. This is an exciting period for our company with a portfolio focused on core businesses in tools, outdoor and industrial and attractive markets in construction, DIY, automotive and industrial. And I'd now like to turn the call over to Don Allan, who will provide an update on how we're positioning our supply chain for growth as well as more detailed commentary on first quarter actuals and our full year outlook. Don? Don Allan : Thank you, Jim and good morning, everyone. As Jim mentioned in his comments, our focus remains on ensuring we serve the continued healthy demand and investing in our supply chain to further strengthen our position for sustained growth. As I've highlighted on prior calls, we took multiple actions in 2021 to navigate through the global supply chain challenges and further strengthen our manufacturing capacity, sourcing, operational efficiency and agility. These actions are allowing us to better serve our customers and deliver growth in revenue and cash flow in 2022 and beyond. Key areas of investment included adding capacity consistent with our make where we sell strategy, co-investing with strategic sourcing partners with a focus on batteries and electronic components and deploying our manufacturing 4.0 automation solutions to enhance productivity, labor efficiency and competitive costs. Our investments in this area as well as our electronic component availability continue to progress as expected and remain on track. Demand continues to outpace availability for our hottest products amid this constrained supply chain environment. First, as it relates to inventory, our actions will position us to meet the current demand levels while improving working capital to deliver strong cash flow generation. Greater working capital efficiency and cash flow generation remains a significant opportunity in 2022 and beyond. As a reminder, last year, we made significant investments in inventory to help meet the outsized demand in the tools business. Our 2022 cash flow guidance assumes that we can modestly reduce inventory versus 2021 levels and we expect much of that improvement to occur in the second half of the year once we get through this spring to early summer selling season. Our inventory at the end of Q1 was up approximately $850 million versus the year-end '21 balance. The increase in our first quarter inventory was primarily due to working capital seasonality to support the peak outdoor buying season, spring merchandising and the Father's Day selling season. This investment in working capital, coupled with the earlier timing of certain tax payments, contributed to a free cash outflow of $1.4 billion in the first quarter. This Q1 performance will reverse as we execute on the remaining 2022 working capital initiatives. Within the supply chain, tight component supply and elongated transportation times continue to be a challenge. However, we have seen some signs of stabilization. For example, our goods in transit for the quarter remained stable and similar to year-end levels. The Port of L.A. has seen improvements with reduced congestion and moving goods from the ports to our DCs is not a significant source of delays. As it relates to China, we continue to frequently monitor our end-to-end supply chain. And while there has been some minor COVID-driven disruption to date, it remains manageable at this stage. This is a dynamic situation that we will continue to watch closely in the coming weeks. As it relates to semiconductors, we continue to see improved supply in line with expectations. Our Tier 1 contract manufacturers received more semiconductors in the first quarter which will enable us to increase the throughput for our professional power tools in Q2. We are on track for an improvement to our electronic component supply of approximately 20% in 2Q and further improvement in 3Q which will support better fill rates, customer inventory positions and higher revenues as we progress through the remainder of the year. So in summary, we are actively managing a very dynamic supply chain and responding with agility to position ourselves to meet the continued strong demand we are experiencing, especially within the professional power tool portion of our business. Turning to our segment results. The headline for the first quarter is that demand for our products remains healthy and we are executing the necessary pricing actions to mitigate higher input costs. In Tools & Outdoor, we grew revenue 24% as the strategic outdoor power equipment acquisitions contributed 27% and price drove 5 points of growth. Price realization accelerated sequentially because of the new global price increases implemented in response to commodity and transportation inflation experienced in late 2021. These factors were partially offset by a 6% decline in volume and 2% from currency. Volume was impacted by electronic component availability and we have not seen evidence of broad demand destruction related to price elasticity. We estimate that supply constraints resulted in approximately $200 million in unfulfilled professional power tool opportunities in the first quarter which, if realized, would have resulted in volume growth and a record prior year performance comp. We will better position to capitalize on this volume opportunity as we improve supply in the coming 2 quarters. Regional organic growth was relatively in line with our expectations, with Europe up 2%, emerging markets contributing 5% and North America down 3%. The Tools & Outdoor operating margin rate for the segment was 14%, representing a 260 basis point improvement versus the fourth quarter of 2021. We continue to execute on price to protect our margins and we saw the sequential benefit in Q1. Comparing the Tools & Outdoor margin rate versus prior year, we experienced the decline as price realization was more than offset by inflation, higher transportation costs, growth investments and lower volume. The outdoor acquisitions were near line average margin rates for the quarter, representing a very strong start to the year. U.S. retail point-of-sale remains at healthy levels, supported by strong professional construction markets and our innovation. While the POS comps were down versus a stimulus-aided Q1 2021, the normalized 2019 comparative growth rates accelerated from the levels we experienced in the back half of 2021. This strengthens our conviction that we continue to experience a very solid demand environment. Now turning to the Tools & Outdoor SBUs. Power tools was down 1% organically in the quarter. We continue to realize benefits from our price increases, along with continued demand for our innovative offerings for the pro and tradesperson. We have launched a series of products under our industry-leading CRAFTSMAN, STANLEY FATMAX, Black & Decker and DEWALT brands. Our recent breakthrough, DEWALT POWERSTACK, continues to be very well received by end users and is expected to be a multi-hundred million dollar contributor to growth in 2022. Hand tools, accessories and storage declined 1% in the quarter against a very difficult comparable. Revenue was supported by pricing and new product innovation. Some of our new innovations include extending our world's first DEWALT 20-volt laser platform with the new 20-volt MAX laser, expanding our DEWALT ToughSystem storage to include soft storage solutions designed to optimize efficiency in organization and we added a new IRWIN STRAIT-LINE tape to our industry-leading tape measure lineup. Moving to outdoor products. This business grew 4% organically, while the addition of MTD and Excel added over $800 million of revenue. Growth was driven by price realization, expanded distribution and new product innovations under the Black & Decker CRAFTSMAN and DEWALT brands. Our acquisitions are also benefiting from product innovation, including recent launches such as the redesigned FasTrak zero-turn mower line for commercial use and the first semi-autonomous zero-turn mower with the Cub Cadet SurePath. Despite the strong start for these acquisitions, this growth was modestly impacted from a later breaking outdoor season due to colder weather in many parts of North America. We expect these revenues to be recovered in the second and third quarter. Our first full quarter as one outdoor team was very successful and we remain on track to integrate 3 assets into a new $4 billion revenue platform, as you heard from Jim. As the integration progresses, we continue to build conviction around the innovation, growth and synergy opportunities. We are even more excited about the electrification growth opportunity as we work to integrate these organizations and processes. The team is energized, focused and off to a great start. I want to thank the Tools & Outdoor organization for their efforts in the first quarter. We made progress against our key operational goals for 2022 with strong price realization, improved power tool supply and actioning a strong plan for working capital reduction as we move throughout the year. This dynamic environment requires agility and I know we have the right people with the perseverance and dedication to be successful. Now, shifting to Industrial. Segment revenue declined 2% versus last year as the 5 points of price realization were more than offset by a 5% volume decline and a 2% negative impact from currency. Operating margin was 6.9% as the benefit from price realization was more than offset by commodity inflation and market-driven volume declines, in particular, in our higher-margin automotive business where our customers remain constrained by their own supply chain challenges. Looking within the segment, engineered fastening organic revenues were down 3% as 5% general industrial fastener growth was more than offset by lower automotive OEM production as well as a modest decline in aerospace. Our auto fastener business continues to successfully operate in a dynamic environment with customer production fluctuations. Despite this, auto fasteners once again demonstrated outperformance versus light vehicle production. And the business is also benefiting from accelerating growth and content gains across the electric vehicle production space. Our industrial fastener business enjoys a healthy backlog and delivered growth at nearly 2x global IPI in the first quarter. The aerospace fastener business delivered its third consecutive quarter of sequential revenue improvement. This business is focused on capturing the recovery in the OEM production which is beginning to emerge. We expect in 2022 aero fasteners will begin to demonstrate organic growth as it starts the cyclical recovery back towards historical levels of revenue. Infrastructure organic revenues were up 4% as 13% growth in attachment tools were partially offset by lower pipeline project activity in oil and gas. Momentum remains strong in attachment tools driven by record backlogs, dealer inventories continuing to trend below targeted levels and elevated market confidence due to the U.S. infrastructure bill. Our Industrial team is continuing to make steady progress with its revenue and profitability improvements. And we are primed to leverage the cyclical recovery that is on the horizon and capitalize on the auto electrification trend as well. Turning to the next slide. The operating environment continues to be dynamic and the recent invasion in the Ukraine by Russia has driven a new wave of inflation versus the backdrop earlier this year. From an input cost perspective, our updated expectations for 2022 commodity inflation and cost to serve is now $1.4 billion versus our January expectation of $800 million. The key drivers of the incremental $600 million reflects significant increases in battery inputs such as lithium, nickel and cobalt, oil-related inputs such as transport and resins and continued upward movements in other base metals and steel. Looking at the commodity indices since we issued our initial 2022 guidance, lithium, nickel and cobalt are all up approximately 90%, 50% and 7%, respectively, whereas oil is also up nearly 15%. If we break down the $600 million increase, it is in primarily 4 major categories : $200 million in batteries, $200 million in transportation costs, $100 million in resins due to oil prices and $50 million in gas engine costs. If you look at our commodity basket discretely, the increase to our total direct material spend is up over 30% since the end of 2020. Nearly half of this total impact occurred in February and March of this year. While these commodities continue to be volatile today, we do have solid visibility to the expected sustained impact. And we are building this into the plan and taking additional pricing actions to offset the impact to our margins. We have executed 3 rounds of price which are now in place across our global businesses. And we are in the process of implementing additional price actions in response to the new wave of inflation that has occurred in the last 60 days. These new price actions will be on top of the 6 to 7 points of price we included in our prior guidance and we now expect price to contribute high single digits for 2022. Our teams remain focused on pricing actions to offset the cumulative inflation impacts experienced in the last 9 to 10 months. We believe this will allow us to expand our core margins and that will begin to emerge in late 2022. As a reminder, before diving into the details on Slide 9, our guidance does not include our security businesses which are now recorded as discontinued operations. So moving on to our 2022 guidance. We are planning for total revenue growth in the mid-20s, inclusive of organic growth of 7%. We are updating our adjusted earnings per share to a range of $9.50 up to $10.50. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $7.20 up to $8.30, inclusive of onetime charges related to restructuring expenses, a voluntary retirement program, the Russian business closure and acquisition-related costs. The current estimate for pretax charges in 2022 is approximately $460 million. On the right side of the slide, we have outlined the components of our EPS adjustment versus our prior estimate. We made 2 portfolio decisions since January guidance which reduced EPS by $0.45. The divestiture of our Stanley Access Technologies business reduces EPS by $0.30. And there will be a $0.15 impact from the closure of our Russian business. Therefore, the January guidance midpoint adjusted for these 2 decisions is $11.80. Incremental commodity and cost to serve just discussed results in a $3 cost increase or reduction in EPS. Then you have the offset of the outlined price actions which add $1.70 benefit which is a net of a lower volume planning assumption to protect ourselves for any potential demand elasticity. Below-the-line items are relatively neutral as a lower tax rate and other expense assumptions are offset by the impact of shares from an adoption of a new accounting standard in Q1 related to preferred shares. This accounting standard change will only impact 2022 and reverses in 2023 as these shares will be retired in November of '22. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic growth is expected to be in the mid- to high single digits, supported by price, core and breakthrough innovation and healthy demand across our end markets. We expect that our strategic outdoor acquisitions will contribute just over $3 billion in revenue in 2022. For the full year, Tools & Outdoor consolidated margins are expected to be down on a year-over-year basis as inflation and acquisition mix pressure margins. As you think about Tools & Outdoor margins, excluding acquisitions, our plan calls for a relatively similar OEM in the second quarter to what we just delivered in Q1. We then expect year-over-year core margins to be up in the back half. There is a meaningful midterm opportunity to improve margins within the outdoor acquisitions over the coming years. And this continues to be a significant priority for us. We expect high single-digit margins this year and we see the potential for low double-digit margins over the next few years. We believe the Industrial segment will achieve low double-digit organic growth driven by innovation, pricing and cyclical recoveries across much of the portfolio. The Industrial margin rate is expected to be positive year-over-year. Leveraging strong revenue growth, productivity and price, this segment will experience sequential improvement each quarter in 2022. Let's now shift to some color on Q2, full year cash flow and our share repurchase program. We expect the second quarter adjusted EPS will approximate 21% to 22% of the full year. This assumes low single-digit organic growth and a strong revenue contribution from acquisitions. Now, turning to cash flow. As a result of our lower full earnings guidance and higher inventory values at year-end due to the additional wave of inflation we experienced in the last 60 days, we expect free cash flow to now be in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. This range does still reflect a modest working capital reduction year-over-year. We still plan to complete our $4 billion share repurchase program. However, since we see a lower cash flow performance in 2022 for the reasons just articulated, we will defer the remaining portion of -- or $1.7 billion until 2023. We continue to pursue a disciplined capital allocation approach that aims to balance share repurchase activity with a commitment to dividends and strong investment-grade credit ratings. We are committed to the completion of this repurchase program in 2023. The organization is focused on execution in this dynamic environment, with the key operational priorities centered around the following areas : improving supply chain and customer service levels, driving above-market organic growth, delivering on our price and cost control measures, successfully integrating our strategic outdoor acquisitions, closing the 2 security divestitures later in this year as planned and leveraging the SBD operating model to improve our working capital efficiency in 2022 and beyond. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jim to conclude with a summary of our prepared remarks. Jim? Jim Loree : Thank you, Don. There is no question that we are operating in one of the more challenging environments in recent times. And to succeed in such an environment, we are intensely focused on the inputs we can control. We've strategically optimized our business portfolio, creating a stronger, faster growing and highly profitable company with distinctive competitive advantages. We've continued our long history of returning excess capital to shareholders through our impressive annual dividend record and share repurchases, together totaling almost $3 billion in 2022 with more to come in 2023. We've reinvested in our core businesses, adding resources to support our growth catalysts in electrification, e-commerce and innovation. This type of focused reinvestment will be an ongoing and consistent approach for us and the company going forward and we've made substantial progress in resolving supply chain constraints, most of which are expected to dissipate during the balance of this year. And we have now proven our ability to offset the impact of hyperinflation through pricing actions that stick. We've made an enormous commitment to ESG as we've shifted our business portfolio to areas that both support growth and benefit our stakeholders and society. For an impressive immersion into this topic, I refer you to our 2021 ESG report which is available online effective today. And we are confident in the strategic positioning of our company and look forward to continuing to demonstrate our ability to thrive in 2022 and beyond by driving top and bottom line growth and shareholder value creation. With that, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis? Dennis Lange : Great. Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning. I guess just on price and I guess it's going to be a multipart question. But the argument here is you're pursuing price to offset cost. But based on the bridge, it looks like pricing is aiming at maybe offsetting 1/2 to 1/3 of the cost pressure. So maybe you could put that in some additional context. Perhaps it's the annualization of the way things work through the system. Are you actually targeting full recovery at a run rate with the price actions that you're taking? And separately, I wonder if you could just provide a little bit of color on what you might be doing to try to mitigate the incremental cost pressure that you laid out for us here. Don Allan : Yes, Jeff. So you're right on the commentary around the timing of the pricing. So the pricing impact in 2022 will be about roughly half the impact of what the annualized amount will be. So there'll be a carryover positive into 2023 related to pricing. And it's really due to the timing of -- as the inflation comes in, you have a timing aspect of being able to get price increases into the market. That can be anywhere from 3 to 4 months depending on the customer or the region. In some cases, it can be faster in certain regions around the globe. And so it's just factoring in that dynamic that is -- like we experienced last year and in early parts of this year as well. The question around -- what was the second part of the question, Dennis? Dennis Lange : What are you doing on the cost... Don Allan : The cost mitigation as you related to, the inflationary costs as they come in, we go through a very similar process, frankly, we experience with our customers which is justification of the cost, what's driving the cost increase. It's got to go through a review process with our GSM procurement organization and then has various approvals that has to go through as well before we can accept the cost increase. The projection that we're putting forth out there related to inflation is based on current spot prices for the most part. And so it assumes these spot prices stay in place for the remainder of the year going into next year. We don't know if that will be the case, they could go up or they could go down. And that's something that we'll see over time. But we manage it through a very robust process on the input side, very similar to what we see what our customers do with us to help justify why we're doing price increases as well. Jim Loree : And just for clarity, I think Don made this clear but I'm just going to emphasize that we are aiming to offset with our fourth price increase now over a 2-year period the entire amount of the inflation. So it's just a matter of timing. We got hit with this latest tranche of $600 million of inflation in the last 2 months. It takes a little time to get that price -- those price increases implemented and that's the dynamic at play here. There's no long-term degradation of margins associated with the hyperinflation because we are absolutely and I'm very, very pleased actually with the ability to implement price and offset the inflation with price increases because, historically, we never had this type of hyperinflation and we never had 100% price coverage of the inflation. And this era that we're in, we've been able to prove that we can do that successfully and that's what we're going to do here and the fourth increase as we go out to market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. So I just wanted to home in on that sort of price-cost delta again. So I think pricing was maybe -- I don't know, maybe $200 million or so in Q1. Maybe help us understand what was the gross cost headwind in Q1. And then how do we think about those 2 numbers in the second half? And as you kind of snap the line today, what's the cost headwind looking like for '23 at this point? Don Allan : Yes. So obviously, we had, as we mentioned in January, a very significant inflationary impact in Q1. And the number approximated a little more than $400 million. We expect probably a very similar number in Q2. And back in January, we were assuming in Q3 and Q4 those numbers were going to become very small. With the new wave of headwinds, we have a number that's about $300 million per quarter in the back half of the year. So that's a large part of the change. You've got certainly a bigger impact in Q2 than what we saw in the January guidance. That's about $400 million, where that was supposed to be ticking down. And then you had close to almost a neutral impact in the January guidance in Q3 and Q4. And now it's going to be roughly $300 million per quarter. The carryover impact, you'll have some inflationary carryover impact, obviously, with this new wave, maybe a quarter to 1.5 quarters of that into next year. And then you'll have a substantial price increase carryover as well that the price should exceed the inflation in 2023. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Rehaut : Hey, good morning, everyone. I appreciate taking my question. I wanted to actually -- a lot has been talked about, obviously, pricing, cost and I appreciate all the details. I wanted to actually shift a second to the outdoor business and the comments around the 10% to 15% annual growth that you highlighted. It sounds a little more bullish than before. And I just wanted to make sure that I was thinking about that correctly that this is -- the statement of a double-digit organic growth rate is something new into the equation. What's kind of driving that statement either from organic growth or new product introductions, distribution gains, etcetera? And then just one technical question, if you can lay out the share count progression over the next couple of quarters, understanding there might be some accounting issues that go away for next year. But just from a modeling perspective, that would be very helpful as well. Jim Loree : That's an artful one question but we'll take it. Don will take the second part, I'll take the first. We didn't get into this outdoor business because we thought it was low margin, low growth. And we are extremely pleased with what we've acquired and the teams that have come with these acquisitions. The innovation or new product development pipeline is revolutionary and especially in the professional products area and especially as it relates to the large format, zero turns and riders. It is clear that electrification will be an increasing force in this market with the advent of ESG and with the increased energy prices. So one of the factors that has slowed the adoption of electric large format has been the differential between the price for electric and the price for gas. And it historically has been fairly wide but it's coming -- it's converging as electric gets down the cost curve through innovation and cost reduction and energy prices drive higher prices for internal combustion-powered equipment and regulatory action has begun. So in the States, you have heard about regulatory action in several states, led by California. And so there is going to be a very, very significant amount of pressure to convert much of the gasoline to powered unit sales to electric. And we see that accelerating. We see the fact that we have been working together for several years on revolutionary innovation in electric and autonomous. And by the way, the labor shortages that exist all around and the cost of increasing labor are another factor getting us excited about the growth because the autonomous units that we have can literally cut lawns for landscapers without people on the mower. So there's a bunch of factors that make us very excited about what's happening in the market. And then there are the 8 facilities that we own that are up and running that make everything from walk-behind mowers to zero turns to basic riders. So we are poised and ready to go with products, with capacity and with a great team -- management team. So 10% to 15% in a market that has historically grown in the high single digits, mid- to high single digits is something that we think is very achievable. And we're going to make investments to support that. Don Allan : And your question on shares, Michael, it's -- I think the easiest thing, if you look at the next 3 quarters for the remainder of the year, it will average about $155 million. In the first quarter, it was about $165 million -- shares. Sorry, not dollars, shares [ph]. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open. Tim Wojs : Hey everybody, good morning. Maybe just on the volumes within Tools. It does seem like there's a little bit of a lower assumption there. I think volume kind of on an implied basis might be kind of flat to down now and you had kind of low to mid-single digits before. So could you just maybe walk through the drivers of that, especially since it sounds like POS is still doing pretty well and the inventory in North America is pretty low versus the industry? Don Allan : Yes. As I have mentioned in some of my comments, Tim, we have done a little bit of a haircut on the volume side versus January. It's down about 3 points from our original assumption. And that's really factored in just more price increases going into the market, maybe being a little more cautious on the impact on volume. It's not necessarily a view that we think demand is slowing. It's just more of with all the price increases going in, you're going to have -- we had almost 5.5% of price in the first quarter. We're going to have somewhere between 7.5% to 8% of price in Q2 and then it's going to get close to 10% in Q3 and Q4. That's a lot of price in the market very quickly. And so we thought it was prudent to just do a modest haircut on the volume side to represent the potential impact of all those price increases. But it is not an assumption that there's some significant slowdown related to overall demand. Other than what's happening in Russia which is relatively modest, it's an annual revenue of about $150 million. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Good morning. I think I will keep this to one question. So obviously, Don, you've been chasing the curve on inflation all the way up here. What -- you've kind of reset the inflation expectation. How do you take a step to try and ring-fence the plan now for FY '22? I mean, is there any buffer in there to maybe protect into further inflation? And then broadly speaking, it seems that the China supply chain, the context of the supply chain is really causing a lot of transportation and freight inflation. What steps are you taking to accelerate the transition back to domestic manufacturing? Don Allan : Yes. I would say that the first question, as I said, we're projecting inflation assuming current indices. And so we're projecting that's going to continue for the remainder of the year. Some people view that as maybe potentially conservative view. It's hard to make that view based on the level of inflation that we've seen over the last 12 months. Like any guidance we provide, we always put some level of contingency in there. It's usually in the $100 million to $150 million range. And I would say that's consistent with this particular guidance we just provided. As far as the China situation, yes, we're obviously watching what's happening very closely from a tactical perspective. But as we had mentioned in previous calls, we did open several plants in the North American markets between U.S. and Mexico to really be able to -- before the pandemic, to really receive a lot of the Asian production, in particular, the China production into those Mexican facilities and some -- and one U.S. facility as well. Because of the volume increase of roughly 20% in '21 and 20% in '22 -- I'm sorry, '21 and '20, you've had a significant spike in the overall output and therefore, it's been difficult to ramp down the Asian production. So we are looking at 2 different things. One, some additional expansion opportunities in both those countries of Mexico and the United States. But we've also been accelerating our manufacturing 4.0 automation and digitization efforts across the supply chain to try to accelerate that. We believe at this point we can make significant progress in this transition over the next 18 to 24 months. We will not completely mitigate the risk in that time frame but we have an accelerated plan based on the current revenue projections as well as the potential for more revenue growth to accelerate that progress over that time frame and we believe we can dramatically mitigate that risk and concern. Jim Loree : And it goes beyond just risk management. That's a huge part of it but also working capital management and efficiency. Getting the production closer to the market, within the home market, enables faster cycle times. It enables more ability to respond to volatile changes in demand which is the nature of the world today. And I think as e-commerce becomes more prominent, it's more important to have that production and supply chain closer to the customer, again, for purposes of agility and responsiveness. So there are offensive reasons for doing this as well. So it has a double benefit, a defensive risk management side to it but also an offensive go-to-market advantage in supply chain responsiveness for a changing end market in terms of what's expected and changing channel needs as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Joe O'Dea: Hi, good morning. I wanted to circle back to volume. You gave some helpful color on price and cadence over the course of the year and wondered if you could talk a little bit about the volume cadence specifically in Tools. And as you have maybe a little bit of -- I don't know if you call it buffer or cushion in there just related to uncertainties around what the pricing is going to do on demand. But generally, what the framework looks like and whether kind of back half of the year, we're talking volume that's more kind of flattish? Or are you anticipating volume declines in each quarter? Don Allan : Yes, I would say that you'll see a volume decline again in Q2, mid- to low single-digit decline. You'll see modest growth in volume in the back half, 1 or 2 points in Q3 or Q4 as the supply continues to improve, in particular, in the professional power tools space. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open. David MacGregor : Yes. Good morning, everyone. I guess a question on volume and you made reference to some of the new plants that you were ramping. Just wondering if you could talk about kind of the progress there and whether that's representing a sort of a bottleneck right now because maybe there's supply channel issues associated with supporting those plants as they ramp or if maybe that's not the case, maybe you could address that. And also just talk about the unabsorbed cost of ramping those plants through 2022 and what that might represent. Don Allan : Yes. The unabsorbed cost is not significant. Those plants have been ramping up for a period of time. And as the year goes on, they're going to continue to become more and more efficient. The main bottleneck is really semiconductors and the electronic components that they go into. As I mentioned in my commentary and Jim's commentary, that's going to continue to get better. There's a big step-up happening in Q2 of about 20% improvement. And we'll see another improvement in the back half of the year as well. And so as that starts to shake loose, we'll be able to meet the current demand levels and hopefully be able to look at other opportunities above and beyond the demand levels at that stage. The capacity in our plants is not really the challenge. The challenge is really in one particular area that I just touched on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Eric Bosshard : Thanks. You talked about favorable tool market share performance over the last year. And I know this is a point of discussion. Just curious what you think you're doing, what you were affected at in 1Q with tool market share and then what your assumption is for further tool market share progress in the back half of the year, especially with your thoughts on volume and guidance on volume for tools for the back half. Jim Loree : Yes. I mean we've been gaining share year in and year out for a long time. During the pandemic, the competitive dynamics are such that we have been gaining share at a slower rate than one of our other competitors. And we're roughly the same size now in power tools and we're bigger in total with hand tools and other items. But the share dynamics as we look at this year will be very interesting. This competitor ended up buying pretty substantial quantities of batteries and semiconductors prior to the pandemic. They've built several billion dollars\u2019 worth of inventory during the pandemic. They have -- a lot of their business is done on an FOB Asia perspective which means -- they're not reporting sellout. They're reporting sell-in. And a lot of the challenges that we have with the supply chain and the congestion on the Pacific Ocean, in their case, relate to their customer and who bears the burden of, at least for a good part of their business, those challenges. So this supply constraint issue has resulted in their ability to grow share a bit faster in this time period. When that gets resolved, I would bet on our channel access, our product innovation and our growing reinvestment in tools and outdoor and our outdoor platform in general to continue to help us grow the market share. And it will be an interesting couple of years as we go forward. But we're still very, very focused on gaining share, growing above market and continuing to, with our new focused portfolio, compete very, very aggressively and effectively. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.

This morning, Don and Corbin will review our 2022 second quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we will be just sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any Forward-Looking Statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan. Donald Allan : Thank you, Dennis and good morning, everyone. As you saw from this morning's results, we continue to navigate a dynamic macro environment including inflation, rising interest rates and now late in the quarter, we started to see these factors impact retail, customer demand across our global Tools & Outdoor markets. The significantly slower demand trends in June combined with a very late start to the Outdoor season due to weather resulted in significant volume pressure versus expectations and revenue, we landed well below our plans. In response to the sudden shift in demand, we have taken immediate corrective cost actions, which are already in progress. We are now expecting demand to normalize closer to 2019 levels for the remainder of 2022. The organization is focused on taking the necessary steps to reduce inventory, generate cash flow and re-size our cost base, through corporate simplification, organizational optimization and supply chain transformation. We will provide more detail on these areas later in our presentation, but we expect these initiatives can deliver pre-tax savings of $1 billion, as well as a significant reduction in inventory, beginning in the second half of 2022, and through the end of 2023. Over the last nine-months, we have executed a number of acquisitions and divestitures that have successfully focused our company around our market-leading Tools & Outdoor businesses, as well as our strongly positioned industrial products business. As you saw last week, our security and access technology transactions successfully closed, and we are using the $3.5 billion in gross cash proceeds net of tax to fund the $2.3 billion share repurchase, from earlier this year, as well as to strengthen the balance sheet and reduce debt levels in the third quarter. We also expect our oil and gas divestiture to close within the third quarter. These transactions enable us to intensify our focus on operational efficiency within our remaining, now simplified business portfolio. We also must continue to advance our strong innovation agenda, pursue a faster path of electrification in Outdoor and engineered fascinating, while we drive further global market penetration, along the way. We are redirecting resources within our Tools & Outdoor businesses to ensure we are extremely well-positioned for strong long-term growth, profitability expansion, consistent annual cash flow and improved shareholder returns. Incorporating the changes from this new demand environment, as well as factoring in the impact of our cost reduction plan caused us to revise our 2022 adjusted diluted EPS range down to $5 up to $6 and to update our free cash flow estimate to be $1 billion to $1.5 billion in the second half of 2022. This free cash flow range excludes the tax payments associated with our security divestitures. To summarize our second quarter, revenues were $4.4 billion, up 16%, driven by our Outdoor Equipment acquisition. Organic revenue was down 6%, which was impacted by slower Tools & Outdoor demand trends across many of our global markets due to poor weather start to the Outdoor season and reduce consumer spending. Price realization contributed 7%, which accelerated sequentially from the first quarter. Our total company operating margin was 9.2%, benefiting from the contribution of our pricing actions, but was down versus prior year due to lower volume, cost inflation and supply chain logistic cost increases. This resulted in second quarter adjusted EPS of a $1.77. More from Corbin on Q2 and 2022 guidance a bit later. As I previously mentioned, we saw a swift deterioration in Consumer Tools & Outdoor demand. This was in contrast to professional tool demand and the professional Outdoor independent channel, which remained healthy and continue to be active opportunities. During this timeframe, the consumer faced price increases across many categories, including essentials like food and energy. Consequently, our consumer categories have started to become impacted. We have seen this phenomena across many of our global markets, as central banks tighten the money supply to control high inflation. The chart on the left illustrates our tools U.S. POS trends against a 2019 base. Late in the quarter, it became clear that the point of sale trends were settling into a much lower growth position. And with information we have now, we believe it is prudent to build this into our plan for the back half. Price and a strong professional market delivered total dollar growth off the 2019 baseline. However, volumes turned negative versus 2019 in the later part of the quarter, or specifically in the month of June. We have analyzed the trends in the pricing in the market and do not see retail price gaps versus competition. This coupled with our information at the category and retailer level leads us to conclude that our markets are softening. Outdoor power equipment also experience slowing demand during the month of June. Customer inventory levels are elevated, largely driven by a very slow start of the season due to poor weather, which clearly is impacting replenishment demand across the retail Outdoor power equipment industry. The poor consumer Outdoor season is a well known fact in the industry initially due to poor weather start and then declining consumer spending due to inflationary pressures previously discussed. However, there are a couple significant positive factors to consider in this difficult demand environment. One, we will be past the constraints on semiconductor supply in the third quarter, and other inputs have greatly improved as well. Therefore, we are expecting better fill rates in the back half to capitalize on the continued strength we are seeing for professional end user driven demand and Tools & Outdoor. And two, the tools inventories at many of our major customers in north America are below 2019 levels, which should limit our destocking risk to customers in certain other geographies, such as Europe, and as well as the U.S. Outdoor retail category I mentioned. Across our industrial businesses, backlogs remain strong and demand for aerospace fasteners is steadily climbing, as the recovery and narrow body production has begun. The auto recovery continues to be choppy, but we do see some improvement and continue to outperform light vehicle production levels as demand of electric vehicles remains well above supply and OEMs continue to pursue strategic long-term transformation to EV centric portfolios. In summary, we see a demand environment that is modestly higher than 2019 levels and therefore, we are implementing an aggressive cost and inventory response to this new environment, while also pivoting the company to a new strategy for long-term success. We continued to have conviction in the long-term outlook of the markets we serve around construction, repair and remodel, Outdoor and across the industrial sector. With the housing inventory at historical lows and relative strength in the industrial markets we serve, our businesses are squarely positioned to satisfy our customer demands after we navigate the current environment. The portfolio transformation that we have orchestrated over the past nine-years is coming to conclusion, and we are setting up our core businesses to emerge even stronger on the other side of demand disruption. As we look ahead, Stanley Black & Decker is at an important point of inflection in our vision and strategy. We must ensure our customers and end users and their needs are where our energy and resources are fully focused. Our plan is to rapidly optimize our organizational structure to support our simplified company. We will take the complexity out of our businesses and the decision making processes. Then we will invest to accelerate growth to enable us to grow organically two to three times the market. The operating environment clearly has dramatically changed in the last month, especially, as we really evolved into the last stages of the quarter or June. Since accepting my current role, the leadership team and I have accelerated intensified the organization in operational streamlining efforts. We are rallying the teams are around a more focused portfolio and providing the businesses with the resources closer to the point of impact. Our tools Outdoor industrial businesses are high quality assets today, and we have the opportunity to improve them further through faster organic growth and significant operational enhancements to improve our margins. As we think about our leading franchises, the key areas of focus will be innovation, electrification, market leadership, and supply chain transformation. With always keeping the customer and end user needs in our sites. First, we are reimagining Tools & Outdoor innovation to create shorter innovation cycles and new technologies. So we can provide differentiated competitive offerings with speed to market. This includes introducing a high quality of new margin accretive core innovations to the portfolio in addition to more big swing innovations that carry the same disruptive power of our successful franchise extensions, such as flexible, atomic, extreme and power stack. Secondly, we are taking meaningful action to deliver innovation and electrification with power Tools & Outdoor power equipment, as well as capitalizing on our partnerships with auto OEMs to leverage our highly engineered auto fastening solutions, the electric vehicle market, as it rapidly expands. These are big opportunities for growth and margin expansion across the portfolio. We are accelerating our efforts in these areas, as these trends are moving quickly, and we must maintain our market leadership position during this technology shift. Next, we will step up our commercial support, bringing more digital tools to our commercial model and increasing sales leadership to directly engage with our customers and end users. These resources drive share gain and key information from our end users related to our products and potential new innovations. In addition, we will enhance our efforts in digital marketing around, new innovation launches, promotions and other key end user interactions. Finally, to enable this growth, we need to accelerate our supply chain transformation. One of many lessons from the pandemic is that complex and long supply chains are prone to disruption. And in our specific case are not matched well with the short cycle nature of our businesses. So you have a choice maintain very high levels of inventory due to the long supply chain or have your supply chain closer to your customer, elevate your agility, and resiliency to better serve those customers. We believe being closer to the customer is the right answer. Organizationally, we are working to ensure that I have the right people in the right roles to execute this vision. We have an accomplished leadership team supported by a diverse, extremely capable organization, which is comprised of Stanley Black and Decker veterans and supplemented by new talent, with fresh perspectives and industry expertise. We continue to bring in new members of our leadership team to partner with our existing seasoned leaders. A few examples of this are Robert Raff and John Wyatt are leading our tool and Outdoor businesses and Tamer Abuaita, sorry, Tamer who joined us at our Chief Supply Chain Officer in January. I\u2019m excited to see Robert rejoin the tools business to lead the team with fresh energy and insight. He is a veteran tool executive who also led our security business transformation. He knows the business, the team and our customers, and we will bring that perspective as he gets the tool organization focused on our shared vision. Tamer brings nearly 30-years of experience leading global transformations, expansions and post acquisition integrations of supply chains for multi-billion dollar consumer goods organizations. He is ideally suited to lead the transformation of our supply chain. All of these growth and supply chain investments are necessary to support higher growth and share gains with our target objective being two to three times the market growth. Now let's get tactical. Let me describe our global cost reduction program, which has a savings potential of $150 million to $200 million in 2022, growing to $1 billion by the end of next year and totaling $2 billion within three-years. These actions are necessary, as we successfully navigate the current market environment. But importantly, when the time is right, it will give us the ability to further accelerate investment in the commercial programs, I just outlined. Over the past two months, we have applied rigorous prioritization to eliminate and reduce overlapping capabilities and functions. As a more straightforward company, we don't need the same structure that was set up for diversified industrial model. The corporate simplification is nearing completion and it will generate $200 million of annualized savings. The resizing effort allows us to ensure our resources serve our core businesses and are closer to the point of impact with the customer and in our supply chain. As a result of these initiatives, we expect the 2023 corporate spending level will be below the 2019 spend. To help us to navigate today's economic cross currents, and in spirit of simplification, we are also attacking indirect spend. We are prioritizing across all categories and cost centers to re-qualify what we will continue in the near-term. We expect this exercise to generate an additional $200 million of annualized savings. Next, we have an opportunity to improve the speed and agility of our operating and decision making processes. We are doing this by reducing the complexity of how we are operating as an organization, including evaluating the number of layers in our structure from the C-suite to the point of impact. To put this in perspective, we believe, we can move from our current organizational structure which has 12 layers, down closer to seven to eight layers. I believe that, we function much better as a company when our leaders can come together quickly for prioritization and decision making and results in results in us moving forward in a more agile manner. Additionally, as we have gone deeper into our Outdoor integration, we see opportunities for savings, where there are synergies with our tools business. We are implementing the spans and layers and cost synergy exercises during Q3 and expect this effort to deliver an additional $100 million in annual savings. Lastly, we are accelerating our supply chain transformation. We believe there is approximately $1.5 billion of P&L efficiencies that can be gained by this acceleration over the next three years with $500 million by the end of 2023. I will go into more detail in this value stream in just a moment. So to summarize, we believe this program can deliver cost savings of $150 million to $200 million in 2022, $1 billion by the end of 2023 and $2 billion within three years. I will now dive a little bit deeper into the supply chain transformation, which is the largest driver of this global cost plan particularly in the medium-term. As mentioned, we are embarking on a three year journey that will completely reshape our supply chain. It will be focused on accelerating our Make Where We Sell strategy to be closer to our customers and more responsive to demand. Our supply chain needs to be agile and adaptive with new product innovation and therefore, as we ramp up our investments in innovation and expand the quantity of our new products we bring to market annually, we also need a supply chain that significantly reduces our innovation cycle time to launch new products much faster than today. This transformation is a key pillar of our strategy and a catalyst for returning our gross margins to 35% plus level. Our success with this transformation will build a more sustainable, agile and efficient supply chain that is resilient in an ever-changing and dynamic operating environment and further enable our advanced manufacturing technologies. We will be focused around four value streams. First product platforming shifts our optimization focus from cost to supply by leveraging product families designed around common building blocks. This shift enables us to standardize our components through platform solutions that create economies of scale with our key suppliers, which ultimately reduces the complexity in our product design and supply base. It also reduces time to market on innovation by leveraging common design. We also believe we can reduce the number of SKUs in our system by 40% plus. These programs collectively can deliver cost savings of approximately $300 million. The next significant opportunity is strategic sourcing, which has a savings potential of $500 million. As we look to set up our supply base through our Make Where We Sell strategy, we have an opportunity to deepen our relationships with suppliers and help them optimize supply and efficiency. In addition, we have significant opportunities to leverage contract manufacturing in, in parts of our supply chain that can improve cost and speed to market. Finally, our simplification efforts within our first value stream, product platforming also carries benefits here as we have less unique parts in sourcing complexity, which results in higher scale purchases. Our current supply chain is a result of organic growth in additions through acquisitions. And while it has been optimized over the years, there is significant opportunity to reduce complexity, eliminate logistical inefficiencies, increase scale for our manufacturing and serve our customers better. Currently, we have approximately 120 manufacturing facilities in our network. As we think about our supply chain of the future, we want to be closer to our customer and we want to do it at a lower cost. This means we need to simplify and consolidate our regional footprints around high performing industry core, technology enabled sites. Our target is to reduce our operating footprint by at least 30% and optimize our distribution network, which can generate approximately $300 million in savings. Lastly, we see an opportunity to capture $400 million through operational excellence. This is focused on driving incremental efficiencies across our facilities, leveraging the SPD operating model, having the right levels of inventory and streamlining the spans and layers within our operations organization to align around our core businesses. These value streams total approximately $1.5 billion of over three years with an opportunity for $500 million during the first 18-months of the program. Clearly, this represents a significant value creation opportunity. However, it also creates an opportunity to elevate the focus on our customers and end user needs. Corbin will now take you through more detailed commentary on the second quarter results, as well as what we believe this near-term demand environment means for the remainder of the year. Corbin. Corbin Walburger : Thank you, Don and good morning, everyone. Let me walk through the details of our second quarter business results. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor revenue grew 17% as the MTD and Excel acquisitions contributed $900 million of revenue and price realization contributed 7% accelerating approximately 1.5 point sequentially as a result of our third round of global price increases implemented in May. These factors were partially offset by a 16% decline in volume and a negative 2% impact from currency, which both softened as we move through the quarter as interest rates increased and inflation in non-discretionary categories like gas and fuel hit consumers\u2019 wallets. As a result, U.S. retail point of sale demand softened during May and June. That said, our professional customer channels and products remain solid and outperformed our consumer-oriented offerings. On an organic basis, regional performances were flat in the emerging markets down 10% in Europe, and down 11% in North America. Operating margin for the segment was 10.8%. Excluding acquisitions margin was a point better at 11.8%. However, still below the 19.9% level from the same period last year, as the benefit from our price actions was more than offset by inflation, higher supply chain costs and lower volume. Across channels sales were down versus 2021 levels. However, against a pre pandemic 2019 baseline retail was up mid-single digits and commercial and industrial was upload double digits. Turning to the Tools & Outdoor SBUs, power tools and hand tools declined organically by 6% and 8% respectively, driven by the softening of retail demand and against a very strong period in the prior year. Operationally, the teams have been successful and alleviating our semiconductor supply constraints and are beginning to see semiconductor driven fill rate improvements for the previously constrained products. The fill rates are on a path to return to targeted levels in the third quarter. As we look forward, our investments in innovation, electrification and commercial resources will support the launch of new product introductions expected in the back half, and into 2023. We are launching a series of new DEWALT cordless solutions continuing to electrify the professional job site. As we convert current product categories, still relying largely on corded and gas powered products to next generation battery powered tools, we will also pair these new products with the DEWALT power stack, our industry leading battery technology that launched only seven-months ago. Coming later this year is a world's first innovation, the new DEWALT impact connect, which consists of new accessories that attach to an impact driver and will allow end users to effortlessly cut copper and PVC pipe up to four times faster than standard hand tools. We will also launch new category solutions for the trade users with our CRAFTSMAN and STANLEY brands, expanding these 20-volt systems to more than a 100 products by early 2023. As we have throughout our history, we remain committed to serving the ongoing performance needs of the most demanding pro and trade users of the DEWALT, STANLEY and CRAFTSMAN solutions. The Outdoor business declined 8% on a pro forma organic basis. This decline was driven by a very slow start to the season due to poor weather, as well as softening consumer demand, similar to many other discretionary retail categories. Due to the softer demand, our retailers are working down inventory and have eased replenishment at this point. Despite this, season being slower than 2021, pro forma sales are still favorable as compared to 2019 levels, primarily driven by the secular gains we have experienced from electrification, which remains our focus going forward. The Outdoor team continues to advance our platform integration efforts, and we are excited about the innovation, growth and synergy opportunities ahead. Stay tuned for the exciting launch of a host of new Outdoor offerings, including innovations in handheld, walk behind and ride-on equipment for the 2023 season. Now shifting to industrial. Segment revenue increased 8% versus last year, as eight points of price realization coupled with four points of volume were partially offset by about a four point negative impact from currency. Operating margin was 9.3%, which compares to 10.5% in the second quarter of last year, as the benefit of price realization was more than offset by commodity inflation. Looking within the segment, engineered fastening organic revenues were up 7%, as 7% general industrial fastener growth was accompanied by 4% growth in the auto fastener business, along with an acceleration for aerospace fasteners, which was up 36%. The auto fastener business continues to successfully operate in a dynamic environment and outpace light vehicle production by five points. Our industrial fastener business has a healthy backlog, which is up 18% versus last year. Aerospace fasteners delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue improvement. This business is focused on capturing the recovery in OEM production, which is underway. Infrastructure organic revenues were up 26%, driven by 17% growth in attachment tools. Infrastructure backlog remains strong, up 44% versus last year, and the team continues to partner with suppliers to successfully fill booked orders. Moving on to our aggressive plan to reduce inventory to generate strong cash flow in the second half. Our second quarter ending inventory balance was $6.6 billion, up approximately $400 million versus the first quarter and up versus historical levels of stock. The main factors contributing to the increase versus prior years were; An elevated level of in process inventory as a result of the congested global supply chain, along with higher inflation, finished goods above current demand requirements and approximately $1 billion of additional inventory from the Outdoor acquisitions. We are implementing actions to significantly reduce working capital by $1 billion to $1.5 billion in the second half of 2022, primarily from inventory reductions. There are five parallel work streams already underway to enact as sequential inventory decline with a sense of urgency. First, production curtailments to slow finish goods manufacturing have already started. Second, commercial teams are working on expediting sell through of on-hand finished goods. Third, safety stock levels are being reviewed and optimized. Fourth, goods and transit are being actively addressed as we work to reduce lead times and slow production. And lastly, levels of raw material and whip are being evaluated to meet current production requirements. This inventory reduction plan has P&L cost implications for the next few quarters, but is necessary to realign our inventory to the current demand environment and meet our cash generation requirements. Let's transition to the next slide, where I will speak further about gross margin. Total company adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was approximately 28% down two points from the prior two quarters and against the 36% we had in the prior year. The confluence of the elongated supply chain, inflation and easing consumer demand impacted growth margins, partially offset by the implementation of price increases. Over the last 12-months, we have been responding to inflation with multiple rounds of price increases, which is reflected in our price performance over the last few quarters. At this stage, given the slowing demand environment and moderating spot commodity rates, we are targeting surgical opportunities for price as opposed to additional broad based global price increases. The cumulative impacts of rising inflation and global supply chain costs and inefficiencies are now capitalized in inventory. While we believe we can optimize moving forward, these capitalized costs will be with us until our inventory returns to normalized levels. In addition, there will be costs associated with plants running at curtail levels while we destock. We expect the cost dynamic of this inventory normalization process to take three to four quarters with gross margins sequentially improving as we move into and through the first half of 2023. These are short-term, but necessary impacts as we prioritize cash flow in this environment. To quantify this opportunity, we see 300 basis points of improvement potential. Once the destocking is complete. We are clearly not satisfied with 30% gross margins and have begun implementing the following actions to accelerate the pace and increase the magnitude of this improvement. First, we are immediately attacking the fixed and semi-fixed costs across our manufacturing base, capturing the quick wins from the first phase of our supply chain transformation. Second, spot commodity prices have moderated from the peak levels in April. While this will take until 2023 to work its way into the P&L, we plan to aggressively go after savings to capture this opportunity. In total, these two actions can accelerate the pace of margin improvement and enable us to achieve low 30s gross margins in the back half of next year. Our three-year target is to get our gross margins back to 35% plus and the $1.5 billion supply chain transformation that Don discussed is how we do it. So to summarize, prioritizing cash generation is the right decision for the company by curtailing our production plans and lowering our inventories to set ourselves up for a stronger 2023 and beyond. Now let me pull all this together into what it means for 2022 guidance. We are expecting total revenue growth to be in the low double-digits. We are updating our adjusted earnings per share to a range of $5 to $6. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $0.80 to $2.05, inclusive of onetime charges related to restructuring expenses, a voluntary retirement program, the Russian business closure and integration-related costs. The current estimate for pretax charges in 2022 is approximately $760 million to $810 million. The change in pretax charges from April guidance primarily relate to a roughly $170 million non-cash asset impairment charge related to the oil and gas divestiture and an estimate of $150 million to $200 million in restructuring to support our cost reduction plans. On the right side of the slide, we have outlined the components of our adjusted EPS assumptions versus our prior estimate. The slowing consumer demand in Tools & Outdoor, along with moderated price expectations, contributes to lower revenues and reduces EPS by $4.25. Currency translation, below-the-line items and second quarter performance impact EPS by another $0.55. We expect the plant production curtailments to range from $0.50 to $0.70 of a reduction as we minimize fixed and semi-fixed cost during this period, but do not completely avoid them. Then the 2022 benefit from the cost savings initiatives that we previously described adds $0.80 to $1. I want to spend a moment to recap the drivers of our cost savings plan. simplifying the corporate structure, reducing indirect spend, optimizing organizational spans and layers and streamlining the operational footprint are expected to total $100 million to $200 million in savings over the remainder of 2022 with cumulative savings of $1 billion by the end of 2023. We have also disclosed other below-the-line planning items for modeling purposes on the slide. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to decline mid- to high single digits with margins down on a year-over-year basis. Pricing is expected to contribute high single-digit growth for the back half and full-year. We believe there is a meaningful midterm opportunity to improve margins within the Outdoor acquisitions over the coming years, and this continues to be a significant priority for us. We expect high single-digit margins this year, and we see the potential for low double-digit margins over the coming years. We are targeting the Industrial segment to achieve high single-digit to low double-digit organic growth, driven by innovation, pricing and cyclical recoveries across much of the portfolio. The industrial margin rate is expected to be pressured year-over-year largely due to inflation and mix. We are closely following the recoveries in auto and aerospace and still believe there to be a solid growth outlook in those markets. Shifting more specifically to the third quarter, we expect adjusted EPS will approximate 13% of the full-year. This is comprised of relatively flat sequential tool sales, a slight sequential improvement for Industrial and a seasonally lighter Outdoor quarter as compared to the first half of the year. Now turning to cash flow. Second half free cash flow, excluding the tax payments from the security sale is expected to approximate $1 billion to $1.5 billion, supported by our inventory and cost optimization actions. The divestiture-related tax payment is expected to approximate $500 million to $600 million, and therefore, total free cash flow is expected to be $400 million to $1 billion in the second half. Stanley Black & Decker remains focused on disciplined capital allocation and our current priority for excess capital deployment will be debt repayment to support our strong investment-grade credit ratings and our commitment to the continued return of value to our shareholders as reflected by the recently announced 55th consecutive annual dividend increase. After we strengthen the balance sheet and the macro improves, our plan for excess capital is to prioritize our share repurchase program. And I'm sure many of you are thinking about what the normalized earnings power is for the company. It will take until the first half of next year to work through our inventory destocking plans and fully implement and realize the benefits from our cost reduction actions. We believe the initiatives we have outlined today are sufficient to return to our 2019 earnings power on an annualized basis once we hit the second half of next year. This does not assume any improvements to revenue. Here is how you get there. We believe destocking is a three to four quarter process that will improve our gross margins by approximately three points as we move into and through the front half of next year. Then the annualized benefit of our prioritization, complexity reduction efforts and impact from our indirect spend reductions are worth approximately $500 million by the end of 2023. Finally, the supply chain transformation can add another two to three points to gross margins as those savings are realized. These are all items within our control, and if we were to achieve them at a faster pace or realize improvements from revenue or input pricing, we will be prepared to accelerate investment in our core businesses and capitalize on the growth or realize improvements from revenue or input pricing, we will be prepared to accelerate investment in our core businesses and capitalize on the growth opportunities that Don outlined. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Don to conclude with a summary of our prepared remarks. Don. Donald Allan : Thank you, Corbin. There is no doubt challenging environments in recent history, which underscores the need to accelerate our strategic transformation that will carry the benefits of increasing agility and improving our responsiveness to customer demand. Our portfolio transformation comes at an ideal time as it enables us to unlock significant value by rapidly pivoting the organizational structure and operating plan towards a more focused company, centered around great franchises within our Tools & Outdoor and industrial businesses. We have an aggressive cost program that we expect will yield $1 billion of savings by the end of next year and approaching a cumulative savings of $2 billion within three years. This will allow us to accelerate investments in our core businesses as the demand environment clears. As we look forward, we have a clear vision, and we believe these actions will reshape our organization and elevate our focus on our customer and end user needs, enabling us to deliver strong shareholder value through long-term growth and enhanced profitability. With that, we are now ready for Q&A, Dennis. Dennis Lange : Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you. Q - Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning. I guess my 1 question would be picking up with more kind of Corbin close back to the kind of earnings power question over time. I just want to clarify really how you are defining earnings power relative to 2019. Obviously, we have got Outdoor in. We have got security out. We have got a different share base. Are you suggesting that kind of earnings power is shown by EPS or some other metric is in line with 2019. So maybe just give us a little more color on that and how you see that trajectory to play out through the quarters of 2023. Donald Allan : Yes. I will start and then pass it over to Corbin with a little more detail. But obviously, we have utilized 2019 as a base to compare things to because it was pre-pandemic. And so before all the unusual activities of 2020 and 2021 of a recession in early '20 and then a boom for three or four quarters and now things are starting to shift with potentially a significant recession on the horizon. We believe that we are kind of normalizing back to 2019 levels as a result of what we are seeing right now. The earnings are not at that point yet, as you can see from the back half guidance we are providing. But if you start to think through the cost actions we are taking, some of the temporary pressures that we are going to experience in the back half, as Corbin described around inventory liquidation, you start to build a pass that gets you closer and closer to what the 2019 EPS was which was about $7.25 roughly. Yes, very different comparable as far as Outdoor versus security. But it does give you kind of a guideline of what we are thinking about internally for kind of our initial objectives of where we want to take earnings. And then obviously, with a $2 billion plan over a three year period. If we have a stable environment from a revenue perspective over that three year period or a growth environment over that three year period, which I would expect would occur. You can see a path where earnings really start to improve in a more dramatic way as we get through 2023 and then into 2024. Corbin, Any more color or details you like to get on that? Corbin Walburger : The only thing I would add is if you think about the second half of 2022 and then you annualize that, that gets you a little over $3 and then if you take the $1 billion of incremental cost in 2023, that gets you a little over $4. And so you get - it is another way to get back to what we did in 2019 at $3 plus $4, a little over $7 a share. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Bosch with Baird. Your line is now open. Timothy Wojs : Yes. Hey guys good morning. I kind of have a two-parter, but I guess what gives you the confidence that this is really, I guess, a market phenomenon versus something that is more kind of Stanley specific? And as you are thinking about these cost reductions, can you just talk through how you are kind of protecting brand and R&D investments just to make sure there is no long-lasting impact on some of the brand values. Donald Allan : Yes. Thanks, Tim, for the question. When I think about what is happening right now, I mean, there is a lot of information that we have, data we have around POS that is impacting clearly, our business and our products. We also have conversations with many of our customers that we serve. We also have seen some recent earnings releases from other companies that are in spaces where we are as well as - or close to that type of category in the building product space. So I feel like when you triangulate all that information, it definitively says there is a slowing demand environment happening that is occurring. And so we also are looking at it, we have looked at all our pricing, as I mentioned, versus our competitors. And our price points are pretty much at par with all our competitor products in all the major key categories. So we don't see any big gaps where we have premiums that are significant versus our competition. Based on all that factor, it doesn't feel like there is anything unique that is happening related to Stanley Black & Decker that this is truly more of a market phenomenon that that is playing out, which makes sense because a lot of the products that we are providing. There is some discretion associated with those products and certain buying decisions versus some of the other building products that are necessary to build a home, whether that is lumber or whether that is insulation, windows, doors, there is still a fair amount of backlog that exists in the pro market. And although we are starting to see signs that maybe that backlog is dwindling a little bit. And the orders going in there are not as strong as they have been in the last year. However, there is a fair amount of backlog to continue probably a strong pro performance for another six to nine-months. But when you get to the discretionary decisions on tools, and some of the other categories that I mentioned, you can start to see where we begin to begin the tip of a spear of a downturn, and that is really what I believe we are seeing right now. On the cost side, thank you for asking that question, we have been very thoughtful about how we are going to do this. So the $2 billion, $1.5 billion will be very focused on supply chain transformation. I went through all the details of that. That is not touching brand that is not touching engineers. That is not touching the sales organization. So that leaves you with the $500 million of SG&A, $200 million of that is the corporate simplification, where we are really just taking out a lot of the complexity of our corporate organization. We are no longer a diversified industrial company. We are primarily a Tools & Outdoor company, with an excellent industrial business alongside of it as well. It makes us a very simpler company than we can be more streamlined, more efficient and effective and then we have a significant indirect spend component, which is not people related. And then there is the, what I would call, the optimization of spans and layers, which is about $100 million. And that is really looking at that structure of how our businesses are organized and how many layers do we need, what is the span of control and really trying to optimize that. And that really, for the most part, will avoid the R&D organization, the sales organization, our digital marketing organization and really be more focused on the leadership team and the management of the businesses and also simplifying the processes that they utilize to make decisions throughout the day and the week as they drive the business. I feel pretty confident that we are very much focused on making sure we do not impact the organization that you mentioned. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe : Thanks good morning everyone. If you go back to 2023, obviously, 2023 seems like a long way. But just going back to the comments, Corbin, you made about sort of getting back to a normalized earnings kind of number. And I think you said $6 to $7 when you layer in the cost savings and initiatives and things like that. Number one, is that the right way to read that? And then just around that sort of mathematics, are we seeing any benefit whatsoever from raw material deflation coming through. Obviously, your kind of input costs you laid out in April are well off those levels back in April. But is that part of your supply chain savings? And I'm assuming that the 2023 buyback is off the table at this point, just if you can hit as well. Donald Allan : Yes. I would say that when we go through those questions there, why don't we start with the buyback, we will get to the buyback as soon as we can. But as Corbin said, we are focused on inventory reduction, getting our cash flow performance to higher levels, fairly significant performance in the back half of this year as we both described. Another strong performance next year will be expected for cash flow and we will be focused on that. We will also be focused on getting our debt levels down to where we want them to be, where we have had them historically related to debt-to-EBITDA ratios. When we feel like we are in a good position to do that, we will do the buyback. That could be in 2023 or it could be a little bit later. Time will tell. We will see how things play out. Corbin, maybe you can take the question on the $6 to $7 and 2023 and provide a little more granularity and clarification of that. Corbin Walburger : Yes, you bet, Nigel. The way that I was thinking about it was if you take the run rate for the second half of which is about $1.50, and you analyze that, that becomes about $3 on an annual basis of an EPS base. And then if you add the $4 which is the $800 million of additional cost savings we plan to get in 2023, that is $4. So the $3 plus $4 gets you to $7, which is close to what the 2019 base is. Just another way to think about 2019 being a baseline for earnings going forward. Donald Allan : Yes. And so the other part of Nigel's question was about commodity trends. So yes, we had a high in the March, April time frame. We have seen commodities pull back significantly, except for lithium. Lithium is still holding in pretty strong because there is still a high demand for batteries across many industries. But a lot of those spot prices have dropped back to levels that are closer to where they were at the beginning of the year. And so we are aggressively pursuing that opportunity. It is unlikely to have an impact on 2022 just because of where we are with inventory at this stage and trying to really liquidate a large portion of our inventory. But as we go into 2023, we have not factored that into our transformation savings. So that is an opportunity that we want to pursue. If these spot levels are maintained where they are, that clearly could be a significant opportunity that would improve the performance that we are talking about that could potentially play out for 2023. But as the year goes on and we get more progress in that area and we begin to see the impact of that in the later stages of 2022 as we start to plan for 2023, we will provide more color, but that is an opportunity that is out there that we will be pursuing as it has really reached a level of significance from a spot rate differential versus where it was in April. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to focus you had kind of alluded to your competitive positioning earlier, Don. And I know you put a lot of thought and analysis into that. As you look into the back half, I think there was a part where you said you are still considering surgical price increases. And I'm just kind of curious as you look at how the retail sales backdrop is softening and given the level of competition that is out there, what is the ability to hold on to price in the current environment? And as you look into 2023, you had mentioned that a lot of the cost savings don't necessarily come at the expense of the front forwarding, the front-facing part of the business, so to speak. But to the extent that we are in this reverted or more normalized demand backdrop, which is much less than this past 18-months. How do you assess the need to perhaps invest more in the business and plow some of those cost savings back into the company, either through some targeted price reductions or areas of investment in terms of marketing or R&D. Donald Allan : Yes. I think, Michael, it is a good question. As you think about the dynamics, we are navigating here. And I guess I will start with, as we have done three rounds of price. I mentioned in my presentation that our price points are very consistent with our competitor price points in virtually every category. So we feel like the current price environment is a level playing field from that perspective. We did mention surgical price increases as an opportunity in the back half. But that is very modest. That is not a large number we are pursuing. Corbin also mentioned, we are not doing a round for price because of the dynamics we just described around commodity prices and slowing demand playing out as well. We also have to remember there was a big part of a front-end inflationary period last year where we didn't have price recovery for the first six to nine-months in some cases of that cycle. And so as the tale of the cycle plays out, where we start to experience deflation, we tend to hold on to the price through the cycle as that tail plays out. And then once we are starting to capture significant benefits in our P&L from commodity deflation, we begin to look at where are our margins, where do we want our margins to go, where is the pricing versus the market, do we need to make some surgical changes based on that. And we have a very robust team and process that we have created over the last two-years that is 100% dedicated to this work in this type of analysis that allows us to be very fluid and agile, but I always remind people of there is a significant gap we had at the beginning of the cycle, where we had very little recovery of inflation versus price. And at the tail, there will be a period of time where we have the benefit of higher prices as commodity inflation is receding or we are having deflation in this particular case. That is the way it is historically paid out. It is most likely the way this is going to play out. That doesn't mean there won't be occasional surgical promotional things that happened versus those list prices to drive higher levels of volume or performance in certain categories. Those things will happen. But in a general playing field, that is likely how the price versus commodity deflation will play out over the next 12 to 18-months. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Hi good morning and thank you. I suppose I just wanted to sort of circle back on to the margin outlook. Just to try and understand what sort of operating margin trajectory you are dialing in for the back half, any major ramp-up in Q4 there. And also as we think about sort of early 2023, which you have alluded to a few times, do we expect a sort of similar margin rate first half of next year to second half of this year? Just trying to get a bit more color around that and sort of the confidence that once those savings and cost actions are realized you can really retain those in your margins and not have to pass them on. Donald Allan : Yes. I will start and then pass it over to Corbin for a little more detail. There is nothing unusual in the margins between the two quarters in the back half of this year. So there is no dramatically low number in Q3 and dramatically high number in Q4. They are relatively consistent overall for the company. Corbin talked about what we expect to do with gross margins as a company as we go into next year and getting into the low 30s with a road map for the longer term of 35-plus percent. We believe that is a model that works very effectively for this portfolio of businesses and products. And that is something that if you look at history, you have a history that would demonstrate that. But really, the model that I described when I laid out kind of the strategy of where we need to go and the focus on investing in innovation, investing in commercial leadership, investing in our supply chain, et cetera, et cetera, all those different areas. That consistent investment model will allow for not only strong growth two to three times the market growth but also allows for higher levels of profitability. One of the benefits of having the Pro market and the Pro brand like the Walt in particular, but some of our other niche brands such as Pacome and Proto our programs as well. Obviously, on the Outdoor side, we have got some great brands with Hustler from the Excel acquisition, Cub Cadet DEWALT as well in that category. Those channels have and always have had high levels of profitability. And so that gives us confidence as well because we are looking to continue to shift, especially on the Outdoor side, more and more into the pro category where the higher levels of profitability are. But Corbin, maybe you give a little bit of color on. SP1. Corbin Walburger : Julian, the only thing else I would add is that if you think about going into 2023, the benefits that we will start to see from a gross margin standpoint from the supply chain transformation and then from an SG&A standpoint, from the other cost reduction that we laid out, those will be pretty even throughout the course of 2023. So you will start to see both gross margin and operating income margin slowly start to improve throughout the year. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Shannon, thanks. We would like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Third Quarter 2022 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2022 third quarter webcast. On the webcast, in addition to myself, Don Allan, President and CEO; and Corbin Walburger, Vice President and Interim CFO. On our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today. This morning, Don and Corbin will review our 2022 third quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan. Don Allan : Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. As you saw from today's release, we made tangible progress during the third quarter towards our strategy around focusing our business and transforming our supply chain. We are building positive momentum as we deliver improved customer fill rates, deployed a new organizational structure, implemented cost controls and actively reduced our inventories. In addition, we made significant progress reducing debt, utilizing $3.3 billion in proceeds from our strategic divestitures. All key priorities we set out heading into the third quarter. All of this is not yet apparent in the financials, but we are encouraged by a few items. One, our headcount reductions are largely complete. Two, inventory is coming down. Three, cash generation was positive in September, and we believe this can continue in the fourth quarter and next year. And four, gross margin will be the last to turn as we face the high cost of destocking, but we expect to be through that and pivot to better performance by the middle of next year. While the macroeconomic environment remains challenging, notably softer North America consumer and European markets, combined with stubborn cost inflation, there were relative bright spots with continued strength in Professional Construction and Industrial customer demand, as well as incremental progress unlocking global supply chain constraints. Our actions to alleviate semiconductor constraints are progressing as expected and are contributing to results through our improved fill rates as well as slightly better organic revenue performance in Q3. Third quarter revenue was $4.1 billion, up 9%, driven by our Outdoor Equipment acquisitions. Organic revenue declined 2%, which was an improvement over what we delivered in the first half, due to increased professional power tool supply and a solid performance by the Industrial business as organic growth was up 14%. Price realization sequentially improved 8% versus the prior year. U.S. retail point of sale was relatively consistent with the levels we saw exiting 2Q, supported by price and professional demand, even as softer DIY consumer demand persisted. Europe continues to operate in a challenging environment as a result of the broader macro, the war in the Ukraine as well as the continued impacts from customer destocking due to elevated channel inventories. Our improved supply position has set us up for strong merchandising support for the holidays across all major brands and categories, with much of the product already shipped to our customers in September and October. We have gained back some key Isle end caps and off-shelf promotion areas after 12 months of limited promotional activity. During the third quarter, we successfully delivered $65 million in pretax savings from our global cost initiatives and reduced our inventory by approximately $300 million. In a few moments, I will dive deeper into our progress related to the Company's transformation plan announced in Q2. Operating margin was 6.2% in the third quarter, pressured by input cost inflation, which was partially offset by customer price increases. Additionally, our margins were impacted from our inventory destock as we began the process of significantly reducing manufacturing production levels in June and during the third quarter. This resulted in third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.76. The divestitures of Electronic Security, Access Technologies and Oil & Gas businesses were successfully completed in the third quarter, which further focuses Stanley Black & Decker's portfolio on our leading Tools & Outdoor and Industrial businesses. Proceeds from the transaction supported $3.3 billion of sequential debt reduction. These deals also conclude the strategic portfolio moves we've been executing over the last 12 months and further intensifies the operational execution focus of our company as we move forward. In terms of financial guidance, because of the ongoing changes to the demand environment, the impact related to foreign exchange and incremental costs due to our more aggressive pullback on production to accelerate inventory destocking in the first half of 2023, we are revising our 2022 adjusted diluted EPS range down to $4.15 up to $4.65, and updating our free cash flow estimate to approximate to $0.3 billion up to $0.6 billion for the fourth quarter, which includes a substantial tax payment related to the gains on the business sales I previously mentioned. Our near-term priority is cash generation, and September marked a turning point with planned production curtailments beginning to meaningfully contribute to inventory reductions, supporting positive cash generation in the month. The decision to escalate and continue production curtailments in Q4 will clearly carry a negative P&L implication as we incur the impact of our underabsorption of fixed plant costs, while concurrently liquidating higher cost inventory from the balance sheet. Although the immediate P&L impacts are significant, and will be incurred in Q4 and likely in the early stages of 2023, we believe proactively reducing inventory in a disciplined yet swift manner is the right strategy and will put our business in a position to optimize growth and margin expansion going forward. Now, I'd like to review how we are moving forward to accelerate organic growth. We have optimized the corporate structure, focused our operating model and are transforming our supply chain to drive efficiency and fuel reinvestment. As we deploy our new organization structure and operating model, we are elevating three key priorities to sharpen our focus : one, end user obsession and innovation; two, customer focus; and three, delivering operational and functional excellence. These are built upon the non-negotiable priorities and values that make up our culture, such as people focus and talent management, health and safety, integrity, compliance, DE&I and ESG. In the next three years, we expect to redeploy $300 million to $500 million to advance innovation across our iconic brands, accelerate electrification in our Outdoor and Engineered Fastening businesses, rapidly accelerate our end-user market activation and create the supply chain of the future. These investments will position the Company for strong, sustainable, long-term growth, profitability, consistent free cash flow generation and shareholder return. We have a strong track record as the industry leader in breakthrough, world's first innovations in our businesses. From FLEXVOLT to ATOMIC and XTREME to POWERSTACK, we will build upon this strength to deliver an even higher quality of core and breakthrough innovations with shorter development cycles and new technologies. Electrification is a key growth driver across our Tools & Outdoor and Engineered Fastening businesses. We plan to make incremental investments to accelerate our efforts, capitalize on share gain opportunities and fortify our market leadership position as the technology continues to shift and adoption accelerates. Market leadership includes more user activation at the front end of our businesses. As we introduce our new products and innovation, we will bring more digital tools and capabilities as well as additional commercial resources to engage directly with our customers, enhance interactions with our end users and drive market share gains. Lastly, to fully leverage these investments, we need to have a world-class and more agile supply chain that brings us closer to our customers, increases our flexibility in response to demand and enhances our customer service levels, all to drive greater growth for us and for our customers. Aligned with these growth investments and as we execute this strategy, we will be focused on a few key success criteria. One, our powerful innovation engine will position us to grow organic revenue 2x to 3x the market over the long term. Two, our supply chain transformation is a key enabler to improve our customer service levels and operational efficiency to return gross margins back to the 35% plus level, with customer fill rates greater than 95%. Three, we have a long track record of generating strong free cash flow, and we'll continue to target 100% free cash flow conversion to net income over the long term, while ensuring consistent annual performance. We are now a more focused company, executing a clear strategy with both immediate and near-term tactical actions to deliver strong value for our shareholders over the long term. Key to our success is and will continue to be market-leading innovation, and I will now highlight a few exciting new launches on the next slide. As the world's largest tool and outdoor company. We are continuing to push the bounds of our category offerings to serve the full spectrum of our makers and creators, from the DIY consumer to trade users and up to the most demanding pro. We are expanding DEWALT POWERSTACK with the launch of a new 5-amp hour battery. This is the most powerful, longest-lasting 20-volt MAX battery in its class, and is compatible with our 300-tool strong DEWALT 20-volt system. POWERSTACK is the first pouch cell technology, battery of its kind, designed to deliver unparalleled bower density to best serve our most demanding professional customers and is expected to deliver over $100 million of revenue in its first 12 months since launch. Today, the 5-amp hour product is already in the European market and has received great reviews by our customers. We are also continuing to advance our high-power DEWALT FLEXVOLT line. By the end of this year, the portfolio will reach 60 products across power tools and outdoor power equipment, generating approximately $500 million of annual revenue and continuing to grow, approaching nearly 70 products by the end of 2023. The DEWALT FLEXVOLT 15 Amp-hour battery was introduced last year as a world's first innovation. DEWALT FLEXVOLT converts users who are using corded, small-gas engine or pneumatic tools due to a high power need, and they convert them over to battery power. And it is one reason why 3/4 of the DEWALT power tool revenue is cordless today. Our FLEXVOLT technology is also advancing innovation and sustainability across our industrial business, where customers desire to replace existing hydraulic tools with cordless solutions to increase portability and efficiency. To that end, the Stanley infrastructure team recently launched the first cordless automatic rail maintenance tool, the RD60 rail drill, which is powered by DEWALT FLEXVOLT. These are just a few subset of examples where we are continuing to deliver industry-leading innovations to push the bounds of our categories and accelerate our success. Another key enabler to our strategy is generating cost savings by taking the complexity out of our businesses while investing to accelerate our organic growth, recovering gross margins and generating consistent strong free cash flow. From an SG&A perspective, we are executing on our plan to rapidly optimize our organizational structure to become flatter and more agile. The new structure is largely complete, including a leaner corporate team. These actions will generate the $300 million of annualized cost savings as targeted. Rigor around indirect spend is in place. Initial savings of $40 million were realized in Q3 and we are on pace to deliver approximately $200 million by the end of next year. As we shared with many of you, we moved quickly to deploy this new structure, so the organization can focus on its priorities and execution. We remain on track to deliver the cumulative savings of $500 million we set out to achieve last quarter, covering the simplification of the corporate structure, the reduction of indirect spend and the streamlining of spans and layers, all by the end of 2023. Pivoting to supply chain, we also activated this transformation with a sense of urgency. Detailed planning and, in some cases, project execution is underway across all four pillars of the strategy. I will now cover some noteworthy progress in the quarter. Regarding the SKU rationalization, we have approved and initiated action on approximately 50,000 SKUs, which represents roughly half of the targeted reduction. We expect the remaining SKU reductions to occur from now through the end of 2023. Second, within the strategic sourcing initiatives, we are activating quick wins that are already generating savings. In tandem, we are defining the wave one implementation plan for 2023, which covers about 1/3 of the addressable spend. Lastly, we are being thoughtful as we progress the facility consolidation and distribution optimization to ensure we plan effectively for successful execution with our teams and for our customers, even as we work with speed. We have completed the feasibility analysis and are now finalizing detailed planning, with implementation targeted to begin in 2023. Additionally, we expect to take initial actions to begin the optimization of our distribution network in the fourth quarter. We have gained some significant early traction and are on pace to deliver the savings targeted for 2022, and we'll continue to build momentum as we enter 2023. I will now pass it to Corbin, who will take you through more detailed commentary on the third quarter performance, including gross margin and inventory levels, as well as the latest guidance on how we expect to close out 2022. Corbin Walburger : Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Let me walk through the details of our third quarter business segment performance. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor, revenue grew 10% to $3.5 billion as the MTD and Excel outdoor acquisitions contributed nearly $600 million of revenue or approximately 18% growth, and price realization contributed 7%. These factors were partially offset by a 12% decline in volume and a negative 3% impact from currency. On an organic basis, we were down low single digits in emerging markets in North America and down 12% in Europe. U. S. retail point-of-sale was supported by professional demand and remained consistent with levels exiting the second quarter of 2022. Aggregate weeks of inventory in these channels remain below 2019 levels. The European results were impacted by retail market pressure due to high levels of customer inventory and inflation as recessionary concerns and the war in Ukraine continue to weigh on consumer spending, particularly in the Northern region. Adjusted operating margin for the segment was 6.8%. Excluding charges and acquisitions, margin was 140 basis points better at 8.2%, however, still below the 15.5% level from the same period last year as the benefit from price realization was more than offset by commodity inflation, higher supply chain costs, production curtailment costs and lower volume. Consistent with normal seasonality, the MTD and Excel outdoor businesses deliver only about 40% of full year volume in the back half at operating margin substantially below the annual average as margins in the first half of the year are typically bolstered by peak outdoor seasonal volume leverage. Across the North American channels, organic sales in retail and e-commerce were down versus 2021 levels, with moderate strength in Commercial and Industrial. However, as compared to a pre-pandemic 2019 baseline, organic sales performance was up double digits across these channels. Turning to the strategic business units within our Tools & Outdoor segment. Power Tools declined organically by 2%. This modest decline reflects an improvement versus the front half performance as we're seeing better semiconductor supply, which helped to raise customer fill rates and contributed to positive organic growth in North America. Looking ahead, we expect further progress in the fourth quarter and are serving a normalized merchandising and promotional schedule for our professional products with our customers. Hand tools declined organically by 7%, driven by retail consumer demand softness in European customer destock. These factors were partially offset by strength among professional-oriented customers in the U.S. commercial and industrial channels as well as successful new product launches in our CRAFTSMAN plastic storage. The Outdoor business declined 12% on a pro forma organic basis. Total revenue was impacted by moderated consumer demand like many other discretionary retail categories and lower orders, as our retailers are also working down inventory. The outdoor team is progressing on our platform integration initiatives, and we have a host of new outdoor innovations across our brands and categories in the pipeline to be launched for the 2023 season. Now shifting to Industrial, which had a great quarter, leveraging the cyclical recovery, with 14% organic growth and margin expansion back to the double digits. Segment revenue increased 5% versus last year as nine points of price realization, coupled with five points of volume, were partially offset by six points from currency headwinds and three points from the Oil & Gas divestiture, which closed in August. The team leveraged this growth and our price increases to overcome commodity inflation and deliver adjusted operating margin of 11.1%, up sequentially 180 basis points and up 340 basis points versus last year. Looking within the segment, Engineered Fastening organic revenues were up 15%, led by aerospace growth of 28%, auto growth of 22% and 4% growth in general industrial fasteners. The auto fasteners business continues to navigate a dynamic supply environment for our customers and is also leveraging tailwinds related to the recovery in auto manufacturing. Our industrial fastener business is continuing to outperform the Industrial Production Index and is maintaining a healthy backlog, which is up 7% versus last year. Aerospace fasteners delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue improvement. This business continues to focus on capturing the emerging recoveries in both narrow-body and wide-body OEM production. Infrastructure organic revenues were up 12%, driven by 19% growth in attachment tools, which was partially offset by the Oil & Gas divestiture in the latter half of the quarter. Orders from our dealer channel partners are beginning to slow, yet our backlog remains robust, and year-to-date OEM orders are up versus last year. I'll now spend a few moments covering our gross margin and inventory performance and expectations. Third quarter gross margins continued to be pressured by several points as we navigated the impacts from inflation and temporary impacts from under-absorption of fixed costs related to our planned production curtailments. This is a strategic choice as we prioritize cash flow generation through inventory reductions. We're making progress with our inventory reductions, which totaled nearly $300 million in the third quarter. We expect to make further progress in the fourth quarter, which will translate into positive cash flow. While these curtailments put temporary pressure on our margins that are necessary as we get our days of inventory back closer to historical levels. With this goal in mind, we made the strategic choice to extend our planned production curtailments versus our original plan to ensure we make continued progress through the middle of next year. Back in July, we assumed our production levels will begin to normalize at year-end. However, we're now planning to maintain low production levels through the first quarter of 2023. This puts additional pressure on our gross margins and depresses payables for the near term, with the trade-off and capturing a cash generation opportunity as inventory continues to decline. These items also impact our total cash generation forecast for 2022 and we incorporate assumptions for lower working capital reductions, including the previously mentioned impact of payables and a lower earnings base. However, the cash flow generation for the Company is gaining momentum. We generated positive free cash flow in the month of September, and we believe this will continue for the fourth quarter. Our capital deployment priority is debt reduction as we look to get to our targeted 2x debt-to-EBITDA level. In the third quarter, we reduced debt by approximately $3.3 billion, utilizing the cash from our divestitures. We expect to achieve further reductions to our debt levels as we generate cash flow in the fourth quarter and in 2023. Turning to gross margins. We believe that this quarter and the first quarter of 2023 should represent the trough as production curtailments and higher cost inventory liquidations are most impactful over the next six months, pressuring margins to the low 20s. The destock impact is expected to alleviate beginning in the second quarter of 2023, with gross margins recovering into the high 20s before any of the benefits from our supply chain transformation. As you heard from Don, we expect that the supply chain transformation savings will start to accrue as we move through the year and build to approximately $500 million by the end of 2023, which will provide further support for the improved gross margins into the 30s on the journey towards 35% plus gross margins in 2025. We believe our focus on inventory reduction, cash generation and balance sheet health are prudent as we work in parallel on structural supply chain savings to improve our gross margins in 2023 and beyond. I'll now walk through what this means for our 2022 guidance. For full year 2022, we expect low double-digit total revenue growth for the Company. We're updating our adjusted earnings per share full year guidance to a range of $4.15 to $4.65. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $0.10 to $0.80, inclusive of one-time charges. The current estimate for pretax charges in 2022 is approximately $755 million to $795 million. On the right side of the slide, we've outlined the key assumption changes to our adjusted EPS versus our prior estimate. Lower fourth quarter revenue, primarily driven by European retail market pressure due to high levels of customer inventory and inflation, reduces EPS by $0.30. Foreign currency translation pressure further reduces EPS by $0.23. Our strategic choice to prioritize inventory reduction and free cash flow generation is accompanied by higher production curtailment costs and inventory destocking costs, which are estimated to be $0.82 of a reduction. Then the 2022 tax impact from lower earnings is expected to increase EPS by $0.25, bringing the revised midpoint to $4.40. We're continuing to expect $150 million to $200 million of gross savings to be achieved in 2022 from our transformation programs, of which $65 million was realized in the third quarter. We have also disclosed other below-the-line planning items for modeling purposes on the slide. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor is expected to realize a mid- to high single-digit organic revenue decline. Margins continue to be down versus prior year as a result of inflation, acquisition mix and volume deleverage. We are continuing to focus on the outdoor acquisition synergy realization as a lever to improve margins within this business unit over the coming years. The Industrial segment organic revenue growth expectation remains unchanged at high single to low double digits. The industrial margin rate is expected to continue to improve sequentially. However, it will be pressured year-over-year largely due to inflation and mix. Turning to cash flow. The fourth quarter free cash flow is expected to approximate $300 million to $600 million, which will support our strong commitment and track record for returning value to our shareholders via cash dividends as well as further debt reduction. As we look into 2023, we've positioned the Company with $1 billion of annualized cost savings, which Don covered earlier. We're also aggressively working to capture the opportunities of recent spot market pullbacks on many of our commodities, such as metals and resins, transportation as well as others. These input savings could benefit us next year after our planned destocking. We believe we are taking the appropriate actions which are in our control to position the Company to navigate a variety of demand environments and contribute to gross margin accretion. Once our visibility improves, we will also invest for share gain by advancing our innovation, electrification and end-user activation. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Don to conclude with a summary of our prepared remarks. Don Allan : Thank you, Corbin. So in summary, a lot of progress was made in our first 90 days and these benefits will become even more apparent within the financials in the coming quarters. Our headcount reductions are largely complete. Inventory is now coming down. Cash generation was positive in September, and we believe this will continue in the fourth quarter and next year. Gross margin will be the last to turn as we face the high cost of destocking but we expect to be through that and pivot to better performance by the middle of next year. And we will continue to focus on debt reduction, further strengthening the balance sheet. All as we continue our commitment to return value to our shareholders through cash dividends. As we move forward, we have a clear strategy, vision and execution plan. And we are laser-focused on optimizing what is within our control. The macroeconomic environment will definitely continue to be choppy and 2023 will clearly bring new challenges. However, we believe our actions to reshape, focus and streamline our organization, as well as reinvest in our core businesses, will enable us to deliver strong shareholder value over the long term via robust organic growth and enhanced profitability. With that, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis? Dennis Lange : Okay. Thanks. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : For my question, I'd just like to circle back to Slide 9, which was very helpful, and completely agree with the effort to get cash flow up even if it means near-term earnings are down. But I guess two related questions on that. One is the free cash flow was still negative $500 million in Q3. You've got the plus $400 million to $500 million in Q4. So really just trying to test the conviction in that tailwind on free cash given that it was, I think, worse than expected in the third quarter. And then secondly, when you look at that gross margin chart sort of bottoming in Q1 next year, just wondered what you're assuming for the macro on that point. Because I guess the risk would be that as you keep trying to lower inventories, the macro rolls and they stay kind of stubbornly high, so extra on the production is needed. So just trying to test sort of what are you assuming on the macro, on the pro channel for early next year when looking at that gross margin recovery slope? Don Allan : Thank you, Julian, for the question, and so we'll give you a little more color in response to that. But as I think through the -- you're right with your opening comment, this is really a heavy focus on cash flow right now. And I was very pleased to see that we generated some solid cash flow in the month of September. Our conviction related to the fourth quarter is very strong. I feel like that we've done all the right things to ensure that our inventory continues to go down. We took additional steps in the third quarter to lower production even further, which is obviously having a bigger impact on Q4 versus Q3. We made that decision as we started to get a little more insight into what we needed to produce in the first half of next year, what the inventory levels were going to be. And we looked at a variety of different scenarios : growth scenarios, flat scenarios and declining scenarios. And we utilized all those scenarios to help, what we feel is the best decision we can make related to production at this stage. The chart is a depiction at a high level of what we believe the gross margin rates will be when you blend all those different centers together and you look at all the possible outcomes. Could there be a scenario where we have a deeper decline in revenue and we have to pullback production even further? Yes, that could play out over 2023, but we'll see how that -- we'll see how things evolve as we get deeper into the end of this year into early next year. The focus for us, though, continues to be, as I mentioned at the start of this commentary, our top priority is cash flow. We believe there's $1.5 billion of inventory that still needs to be liquidated. You could look at history and even say that number might be as high as $2 billion. So it's somewhere in that range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. We are going to aggressively pursue that. There will be some pain to our margins in the short term as we go through this transition, and the pain might be even a little more challenging if we see further top line deterioration in 2023. That being said, it is the absolute right thing to do, and I think we all agree with that. The second thing is we need to really aggressively pursue and we have been pursuing what's happening with commodity deflation and freight deflation. We see that as a big opportunity to potentially offset maybe some of these pressures we might see in a declining revenue environment in that particular situation. But either way, we need to pursue those as opportunities because they are becoming significant. You have declines since April in commodity prices at 30%, 40%, even 50% in some cases. And there's an opportunity that we have been actively pursuing for the last several months that we will continue to pursue. And yes, it will not hit our P&L until the later stages of 2023 post the liquidation of a large chunk of this inventory, but we have to make that come to life. That's another -- that's a lever that can help us maybe offset some of the pressure we might see at the top line if that does play out. And the third thing I'd say is we have a robust supply chain transformation plan, that will create $1.5 billion of value, as we both mentioned in our opening commentary over the next three years. That is significant. We see opportunities within product platforming, strategic sourcing, facility consolidation and then operational excellence that are significant that add up to that opportunity. And we will begin to achieve some of those benefits in 2023 and then further enhance those and benefits in 2024. All those levers are there and available for us to pursue to ensure that we have healthy cash flow in 2023 and we continue to make progress in the back half of the year in improving our gross margin rate. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open. Tom Wojs : Maybe if you could just talk a little bit, Don, about some of the improvements in some of the market-facing metrics that you kind of talked about on the call in terms of where are fill rates today versus where they might have been kind of early part of this year and what the progress on that looks like. And then just as you're talking with your customers, how are they kind of thinking about promotional activity and pricing as you move into '23? Don Allan : Yes. Thanks, Tim, for that question. Yes, I'm really pleased with the team's progress in fill rates over the last 90 days. It's not 95% or above, so we still have more opportunity in front of us. But depending on the product category, we've made anywhere from 300 basis point improvement to 600 basis point improvement in the last 90 days. And so that's a great accomplishment by the team in a very short period of time. Now a large part of it is triggered by the supply constraint that we were dealing with in semiconductors, that now is pretty much behind us at this stage. And therefore, we feel like we can really focus on making sure that we're meeting the demand that our customers have. Another metric that we've looked at is what is the on-shelf percentage of all our products within our major customers. And those numbers are actually very good, 95-plus percent when you look at our products on the shelves -- those products are on the shelf. We have very little out-of-stock situations at this point in time. The third thing that I looked at is we actually did a really sizable promotion set of shipments to many customers in September and here in the month of October. A substantial amount of promotional activity is something that we haven't seen in well over a year, and so we're very pleased to be able to get back kind of at the end cap, get into some of the off-shelf areas within our major customers and begin to really drive some of that promotional activity and share gain in those particular circumstances. So, all three of those things are what we're looking at to really say, hey, we're making progress and we're getting back to a nice mix of core business and promotional activity, which is really, what makes the Tools and the Outdoor business successful over the midterm and the long term. As far as 2023, at this point, our customers are very excited about the upcoming year and the opportunities they see. They still believe that professional will continue to be strong. As I mentioned earlier, we are preparing a variety of different scenarios that could be a healthy environment or could be a significant decline that we have to manage through. And so therefore, we think given the amount of inventory we have, we have the ability to meet the needs of the customers, both core and promotional activities. And hence, why we continue to cut back production to ensure that we do actually lower our levels of inventory over the next 12 months. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : So Don, a question on inventory, you might be shocked by that. So obviously, no surprise, I'm just wondering if maybe you could quantify the actual -- you've called out the $0.82 of incremental production penalty to the guide, but where does that stand for the full year? I mean, how much are you absorbing maybe on an annualized basis so we can try and gauge the opportunity when inventory does eventually normalize? And then secondly, just kind of second part of that question is you talked about promotional activity, which obviously is top part of the business, but do you have to promote and discount to shift that inventory over the next couple of quarters? Don Allan : Yes. Thanks, Nigel. Yes, I would say that we've seen obviously a pretty significant impact on our margins [Technical Difficulty] year due to basically heavy pullback in production. And we've done it probably almost -- we had to make three to four different adjustments as the year has gone on. As we got into late May and June, we had to make an adjustment based on what we're seeing with the slower consumer demand. We did it again in the early July time frame to prepare for our back half. And then we did -- we're doing it again here in the late stages of the third quarter into the fourth quarter for the early part of next year. So the impact to the P&L is probably around $400 million. It's a pretty substantial number for us in 2022. So that would equate to well over $2 of EPS, probably higher than that given our tax rate is very low. So, it's substantial. And so that, in my view, obviously, is a temporary situation that we have to navigate through and really figure out what that impact would be as things start to come back in a positive way. What was the second question, Nigel, I forgot? Nigel Coe : Discounting. Don Allan : Discounting, yes, on the inventory. So right now, I think we're being very balanced in our approach on how we liquidate inventory. We're looking at promotional activities. We're looking at alternative channels. The interesting part of the situation is that this is not old inventory. This is inventory that's been created in the last 15 to 18 months, that is very healthy inventory that we should be able to sell at reasonable price points. The question is time, how long do we want to take for the liquidation to occur. So I think we're going to strike the right balance between pursuing promotional discount activities and really just pursuing it more through normal core activity at normal price points. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nicole DeBlase : Just maybe we could talk a little bit about pricing. I think that's also an important variable as we all kind of think through the puts and takes for 2023. So with demand now moving into negative territory and now that we're seeing some refreshing declines in commodity prices. What's the conviction that you guys can stick the price increases that you've taken so far? And maybe what is your view of what's going on from a competitive perspective as well? Don Allan : Yes. I think when I look -- when I think about this situation, it obviously is something that's very unusual. We can't go back in time and look at anything in Stanley Black & Decker and say we had a period of time where we had 10% to 12% price increases. That just hasn't been part of any history here within the Company, at least recent history. And so therefore, you have to look at it a little bit differently. That being said, we all have to remember there's been a period of time leading up to this where we had no price increase of any substance, and we were incurring substantial impact in our P&L from the inflation back in 2021. And so we can't forget that. We have to recognize that that's a dynamic that we went through. And then when the tail end of this happens and we're recovering the commodity deflation that we're now experiencing, which actually won't hit our P&L until the later stages of 2023, we have to be vigilant with the price increases and recognize that just because the commodity indices have changed, it does not mean we can lower our prices, because we have the high-cost inventory in our system that has to flow through and be sold to our customers and eventually the end users over some period of time, which is probably at least nine to 12 months at a minimum. And therefore, I think the tail, we will continue to be disciplined about this. We always are looking at what's happening with our competitors in the market. At this stage, we feel like our price points are very consistent with their price points across virtually every category. So, we don't see anything unusual happening there. And we do know there are some competitors that are still putting some price increases into the market even today. So there's going to be a tail here that we're going to have to navigate through. I believe the impact of deflation and what happens with price over the next two years will still be a substantial positive for Stanley Black & Decker's P&L. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is open. Chris Snyder : So I just wanted to ask more about the decision to have higher production curtailments versus what the Company expected three months ago. Because back half demand is trending as expected versus the July update, so does this reflect a softer outlook on demand into 2023? Or just more urgency around bringing working capital down and generating cash, maybe after that working capital winds down that the Company expected in the September quarter? Don Allan : Thank you. Maybe, Corbin, you can provide that -- give some color to that question. Dennis Lange : No, I don't think that our view in North America is pretty consistent as we -- we're seeing levels of demand that were consistent with how we exited the second quarter. Obviously, we're seeing weaker demand in Europe. But the production curtailments are really, to your point, about generating cash and that's really what's been driving it. So, that as Don said, we've been through three or four of these. And as we look at the desire to get the inventory out, there are a few ways to do it. But the quickest way for us was to reduce our production, which we've done throughout the last three or four months. Don Allan : Yes. I think I'll just add to that, that when I made some comments in response to the first question, we have looked at a variety of different scenarios. And one of the scenarios is a continued retraction of demand as the housing market continues to slow and potentially construction slows down for a period of time. And therefore, we're factoring that into our decision as well. So it's a combination of what Corbin said, but it's also looking at what we think are potential scenarios for next year, and being thoughtful about what our production should be today. We have to remember that our supply chain is fairly lengthy. So things that we're producing today, we're selling -- something we produce this month, we're probably selling in the month of March and April of next year. And so that's really the decision we're making. And we're trying to strike the right balance and reducing the inventory, as Corbin was describing, and being as proactive and aggressive about that to continue to drive a healthy cash flow performance going forward. And then two, making sure we meet the needs of our customers and not have a retraction in our fill rates. And I think based on the decision we've made around production, we are striking the proper balance in that particular area. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Rehaut : Just wanted to try and get a sense, obviously, a lot of near-term disruption. And just trying to -- I guess, in two ways, number one, kind of zero in on the next couple of quarters, I guess, 4Q, for example, is going to be low digit margins in Tools & Storage. How much of that margin level is what you'd consider to be relatively temporary primarily, I think, driven by the inventory reductions? And how much is kind of a reset versus expectations 90 days ago? And I guess, ultimately, where I'm going with this is, I think in your most -- in Slide 9, you're talking about a high 20s gross margin by the end of the year. Potentially, it could -- the opportunity for low 30s, but it does look like that's a little bit of a reset versus also 90 days ago. And what type of headwinds are you seeing today compared to getting to, I believe, you kind of threw out like that $7 per share run rate by the end of 2023? It looks like there's a few more moving pieces or headwinds that might take that number down by $1 or $2 even. Don Allan : Well, so I'll -- there was a lot in that, Michael. So I'll start with the first question you had around fourth quarter margins and how much they may be being impacted by these pullback in production decisions. The impact in the fourth quarter is about 5 points or 500 basis points. So it's substantial, clearly. So we're also dealing with the last stages or the middle stages of the high-cost inventory from the big inflation wage that we've had that are in our inventory now, and that we're starting to sell that through. So that's another factor that's pushing down margins that will take time to work through. Because even when you get 90% or 100% price recovery when you go to these actions, you still have an impact in your margin rate that's substantial. And in this case, the differential in our margin rate is about 300 basis points just from the difference of inflation, dollar and price dollar, because it's not a one-for-one offset. The only way you're going to offset it completely in your margin rate is going to be if you get like 120%, 130% recovery on inflation through price. And so you got a bit of a double impact that's impacting the margins right now in Q4. And so I think that's something that we just have to be thoughtful about as we analyze the view of Q4. We're not going to give a ton of color on 2023. What we're trying to do is help people understand that there's a path to get our gross margins back to the high 20s and eventually to 35-plus percent. The path is really about eliminating some of these temporary things, because these things are temporary in the sense of pulling back on production will eventually get back to a more normal level of production because we're going through a period of time that's whatever this recession is going to be and how long it's going to last. But if you just kind of put that in the rearview mirror and focus post the recession, we are going to be back to normal levels of production. We're going to have transformed our supply chain. We will have pursued all the commodity deflation that's out there. And yes, could there be a partial price offset to that? Yes, there could be. But at the end of the day, all these different things are going to have -- these are levers that drive our margin back to those levels. As far as what we guided back in July, what we're doing now has nothing to do with guidance in July. We have a new view on 2023, and so we're adjusting our manufacturing on that. I talked about the different scenarios we looked at as a result of that. We're getting closer to 2023, so it gives us the opportunity to adjust our manufacturing at this point. And then, we also want to be more aggressive and focus on generating more cash flow and reduce our inventory in the short and midterm. And that's really what's driving the temporary impact to our gross margins. I understand nobody likes the gross margins where they are. I don't like them where they are either. But I feel like we're pulling all the right levers that are in our control that are going to get our gross margins back to where they need to be. But it's going to be a multiyear period of time for that to happen. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead. Adam Baumgarten : I'm just wondering if you could run through some of the point-of-sale trends that you saw in U.S. retail throughout the quarter and maybe into October, if you saw any deceleration. It sounded like it was relatively stable, but any nuance would be helpful as we enter the fourth quarter. Don Allan : Sure. Do you want to take that, Corbin? Dennis Lange : Yes. As we said earlier, we really did not see a big difference in the third quarter from what we exited in the second quarter. So in some ways, particularly around power tools, they've held up pretty well. Hand tools obviously was down a little bit. But in general, I think the POS sales in the U. S. have held up somewhat surprisingly well third quarter. Hard to tell what's going to happen in the fourth quarter and next year, as Don mentioned. But in the third quarter, we were relatively -- on a relative basis, pleased with what we saw. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open. David MacGregor : Yes, I think we got a pretty good handle on inventory and gross margins at this point. Let me just ask about the outdoor acquisitions and you talked about slower consumer demand and the seasonal patterns, which I guess we understand is probably comes as a surprise to anyone. The seasonal pattern, was it consistent or was there something changing there? And just talk about margin contribution expectations and the progress on integration. And how do you avoid not being distracted by everything you're focusing on with inventory and gross margins and keep an appropriate level of focus on the integration and the achievement of value for the steel? Don Allan : That's a great question. We've actually integrated or folded in the integration process of MTD and Excel into the transformation plan in all the rhythms and rigors that we have around that. I mean we spend a lot of time every day, every week, focusing on these different things that we're talking about over the last hour. And so we have created a set of processes and rhythms that allow us to really polish these different things, make decisions related to a variety of different items and folding in the integration of MTD and Excel into that has actually been a bit of an efficiency for us to make sure that we don't lose sight of the importance of those acquisitions and effectively integrating them into the Stanley Black & Decker operating system. I think -- when I think about the outdoor business, yes, it was a rough outdoor season this year for sure due to weather primarily. And then, there was a bit of a consumer impact at the tail end of it as well as consumers started shifting their dollars to other areas. That being said, as you talk to our customers, they -- as usual, they're very bullish about the upcoming outdoor season and early next year. I think it will be a good season if the weather cooperates. Again, I think we've planned for a variety of different scenarios that could play out, whether it's a flat scenario or an up scenario or a down scenario, will be determined. But our production levels have been focused on those different scenarios because we are producing product in the fourth quarter for the upcoming season. So, it's difficult to know where that season is going to go. But if you listen to our customers, they're very excited about it. We're taking a balanced point of view on it to make sure that we effectively meet the needs of our customers and ensure that we don't get stuck with a lot of extra inventory if something unusual plays out. Maybe Corbin, you might want to talk a little bit about where we are with margin profile, how the integration is going and provide a little more color on that. Corbin Walburger : Yes. The integration, I think, has gone very well. And the colleagues that joined from MTD and Excel have been fantastic, and it's great to have them as target team, and the very innovative right now. Given the seasonal weakness that we saw in the spring and summer, obviously, margin rates were hit probably more than we expected because of the weaker season. However, as we go forward, we don't -- our view hasn't changed in where we think the business can get to over time. And we're generally very strong on hitting our synergy targets and getting the margins of our acquisitions to where we want, and we feel the same for both MTD and Excel on this one. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Shannon thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2022 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Webcast. On the webcast in addition to myself, Don Allan, President and CEO; and Corbin Walburger, Vice President and Interim CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and the supplemental presentation, which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today. This morning, Don and Corbin will review our 2022 fourth quarter and full year results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and, as such, involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34-F filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan. Don Allan : Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter performance marked another meaningful step forward on our journey to streamline and optimize Stanley Black & Decker. Building on our number one worldwide market position in Tools & Outdoor, as well as our leading Industrial business, we continue to focus on advancing our simplification and transformation strategy. Across the second half of 2022, we improved customer fill rates significantly, reduced inventories by $800 million and realized $200 million in efficiency benefits from our leaner organizational structure as well as enhanced cost control in the back office and the supply chain. These actions generated more than $500 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, which supported a corresponding similar amount of reduction in our debt, a key objective of our capital allocation plan in the second half of 2022. Overall, we are making progress, and I am confident that our strategy and priorities are positioning the company for a strong, sustainable, long-term growth, cash flow generation, profitability enhancement and shareholder return. This transformation journey has just started, and significant efforts are still ahead of us. Our success will be dependent on staying agile while maintaining a disciplined approach, which ensures we stay focused on our key set of priorities. Our team has seen significant changes over the second half of 2022, and they will lead us through the next phase of the transformation in 2023. I would like to take a moment to thank all of our leaders and employees across the globe and recognize them for their focus, commitment and hard work, especially over the last 7 months to 8 months. Our 2022 full year revenue reached $16.9 billion, up 11% versus a record of 2021, led by the outdoor power equipment acquisitions as well as 9% organic growth in the Industrial segment, and a 7% improvement in price realization. However, these top line growth drivers were partially muted by significant retractions in consumer and DIY demand, as well as certain supply chain constraints we experienced in early 2022. Our margins were significantly impacted by inflation, and when we chose to prioritize inventory reductions by lowering manufacturing production levels in this last four to five months of 2022, this was to allow us to generate solid free cash flow as we experienced in the fourth quarter. These negative profitability impacts resulted in a full year adjusted diluted earnings per share being down year-over-year to $4.62. For the fourth quarter, revenues were in line with the prior year at $4 billion. Demand from our professional end markets remained healthy. With our differentiated offerings and improved product availability, we successfully executed our promotional plans in support of the holiday season for our retail partners. Adjusted EPS for the period was a loss of $0.10, a result of our planned prioritization efforts around inventory reduction and cash generation. Notably, we lowered inventory by $500 million as compared to the end of the third quarter. We entered 2023 prepared to navigate a challenging macroeconomic backdrop as interest rate hikes begin to yield their intended effects. That said, we are committed to advancing our transformation. While there is more work to be done, we have a clear road map forward. We are watching the demand environment and global economic dynamics very closely. Although, current demand remains consistent with levels experienced in the back half of last year, we are planning for all scenarios, which balance the potential continuation of the current trends with the prospect of a further demand slowdown due to intensifying macro pressures. While changes in demand are difficult to predict, our base case or midpoint of guidance assumes a decline in volume versus 2022 as we believe markets will continue to be challenged during 2023 as new housing starts are projected to decline 15% to 25% and repair and remodel activity will decline modestly year-over-year, we are also prepared to respond if revenue impacts are worse or better than our base case to ensure we appropriately manage the risks and opportunities that could arise. This guidance will have a P&L loss in the front half, which is impacted by our strategic choice to continue to reduce our inventory levels. For the full year, we are guiding an adjusted EPS range of zero up to $2. Our free cash flow guidance is much stronger at $500 million up to $1 billion in 2023, well ahead of net income as we drive another $750 million up to $1 billion of inventory reduction during the year. As you have heard me say many times over the past year, we believe the long-term view for the industries, which our products serve is very positive with powerful generational shifts in the housing, more time at home due to hybrid work, an aging housing stock that needs repair and remodel, the continued improvement in aerospace demand and the acceleration of electrification within the automotive markets. We also have powerful secular drivers in Tools & Outdoor from the shift to cordless power tools and electric powered outdoor equipment as we leverage our brands and innovation to gain market share. Our priorities in 2023 will continue to be aligned with our messaging over the last six months; one, strong focus on cash flow through inventory reduction to assist with ongoing debt deleveraging; two, sequential improvement in our gross margins as we drive further supply chain transformation initiatives; and three, get back to gaining market share in all major categories of our Tools & Outdoor business. Our 2023 guidance base case is planning for an improved profitability performance in the back half of the year as we see more benefits from the transformation program. We believe our annualized EBITDA will achieve a run rate of close to $1.5 billion in the back half. That will be a major step forward in returning our company back to 2019 EBITDA levels, which were just above $2 billion. Given the significant benefits expected to be realized beyond 2023 from our supply chain transformation program, there appears to be a very reasonable glide path to exceed 2019 levels for EBITDA. Our teams around the world remain focused on executing our primary areas of long-term strategic focus, continuing to advance innovation, electrification, and global market penetration to achieve organic growth of two to three times the market growth, streamlining and simplifying the organization as well as shifting resources to prioritize investments that we believe have a positive and more direct impact for our customers and end users; accelerating the operations and supply chain transformation to return gross margins to historical 35% plus levels, while improving fill rates to better match inventory with customer demand; and then prioritizing cash flow generation and inventory optimization. We are making deliberate strategic investments in our businesses to position the company to fully capitalize on these long-term opportunities to gain share within the industries that we serve and to accelerate our organic growth. With that in mind, last year, we invested approximately $350 million in research and development, up over 25% versus 2021 and well ahead of our total sales growth. This increase in R&D will ensure we continue to fund incremental investments beyond our core and breakthrough innovation, electrification across the portfolio, and market leadership, including digital and end user activation. This is an area where we have a long legacy of key investments to maintain our market-leading innovation ecosystem. We clearly took another step forward in 2022 and we will again in 2023. Our business transformation remains on track and we are building momentum towards delivering approximately $1 billion in annualized savings by the end of 2023. That will support both gross and operating margin expansion once our inventory destock is complete. Let's spend some time on the topic of innovation. We are continuing to release new products and bring advancements and innovation to our industries. Today, I will highlight a few exciting launches. As it relates to outdoor electrification, we are introducing new CRAFTSMAN and DEWALT outdoor offerings. For the 2023 season, CRAFTSMAN will carry a new range of lithium-ion electric ride-on mowers and an expansion of our 20-volt CRAFTSMAN Outdoor Essentials, notably new brushless string trimmers and blowers as well as a new cordless pressure washer. For the PRO, we are continuing to expand the DEWALT FLEXVOLT 20-volt MAX system, including the addition of a new pruning chainsaw that is lightweight and compact with an 8-inch bar and a high-efficiency brushless motor. Shifting to professional job site products and solutions, this is another key area for long-term growth. We recently debuted a range of revolutionary tools, accessories, and storage solutions for pros in the commercial concrete and construction industries as we continue to electrify the job site. We are expanding the FLEXVOLT product family with the launch of the world's first cordless in-line SCS MAX Chipping Hammer and Cordless Hexbreaker Hammer. We are also introducing the most powerful cordless DEWALT large angle grinder. All three of these new cordless tools include Perform and Protect safety features as well. Additionally, we have a new DEWALT ToughSystem Solution for storing, charging, and transporting DEWALT 20-volt and FLEXVOLT batteries. And lastly, our DEWALT product team partnered with CONVERGE, a leading concrete material and operations optimization company, to develop and unveil new concrete DNA compatible sensors. This new product allows DEWALT pros to begin work sooner as users can directly measure concrete hardening using advanced artificial intelligence rather than relying on estimations. In addition, this product helps reduce cement consumption by tailoring the exact amount needed. Together with CONVERGE, we are helping to tackle the challenge of reducing carbon emissions through our product innovation. As the worldwide leader in tools and outdoor, these are prime examples of the types of core and breakthrough innovations that we expect to continue to introduce to our customers and deliver for our end users. Now, diving a bit deeper into our business transformation. The team has made great progress. We realized $200 million of savings in the second half of 2022 from efficiency benefits, including our organizational changes, as well as indirect cost savings. We expect to deliver cumulative SG&A savings of $500 million by the end of 2023, covering simplification of the corporate structure, streamlined leadership spans of controls and organizational layers and the reduction of indirect spend. Our new organizational structure is now in place, and the teams are activating our priorities. As you saw in our recent announcements, we have brought on two new business leaders who are critical for our transformation. Patrick Hallinan was named our incoming Chief Financial Officer. Patrick is a seasoned executive who has led global high-performing finance functions across top consumer brands. Patrick joins us in April from Fortune Brands Innovations, where he currently serves as their CFO, and is the ideal candidate for the next leader of our finance function. John Lucas joined us as our new CHRO and brings a highly distinguished track record with world-class experience in organizational and human capital management. John will be instrumental to enabling our culture and values and to the long-term success of our business. I want to thank Corbin Walburger and Deborah Wintner for their leadership and significant contributions during this critical transformation period for the company. I look forward to continuing to work with them as key Stanley Black & Decker leaders. Turning to our supply chain transformation. We have line of sight to deliver cumulative savings of $500 million by the end of 2023 and $1.5 billion by 2025. Building off the momentum from last quarter, we activated our transformation with a sense of urgency to optimize our operations, which better serve our customers while also being efficient and agile with our footprint and cost structure. After approving and initiating action on our SKU reductions, we now have approximately 50,000 SKUs that we are no longer manufacturing and are approved for decommission. Throughout 2023, we will work to transition our customers to the products that deliver the most value for our end users. As we shared last quarter, the strategic sourcing team activated quick wins. We are pleased to share that, this early traction has already generated $40 million in savings. Wave one is now fully activated and addresses approximately $2 billion of spend, which is covered by 20 RFPs that are due back this quarter. We also successfully advanced our facility optimization and distribution network planning. The detailed feasibility analysis nearing completion this quarter, with execution of the plan to follow shortly thereafter. Lastly, we have heightened our focus on manufacturing excellence, reemphasizing SBD Kaizen and Lean manufacturing practices at our factories. Activation at four plants will be complete this quarter. And in March, we will initiate the next wave. We have exited the acute phase of pandemic-driven supply constraints. And as such, refocusing our plans on continuous improvement rigor will enable the acceleration of value across the network. You can expect us to continue to take strides forward, and we will provide you with updates towards achieving our cumulative $1 billion of savings by the end of 2023 on our path to delivering total program savings of $2 billion by 2025. I will now pass it to Corbin, who will take you through more detailed commentary on the fourth quarter and full year performance as well as our 2023 guidance. Corbin? Corbin Walburger : Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Let me walk through the details of our business segment performance. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor, fourth quarter revenues were in line with last year at $3.4 billion, benefiting from a 7% improvement from price actions and an eight-point contribution from the MTD and Excel outdoor acquisitions. Both of these acquisitions are now a part of organic growth beginning in December. These factors were offset by a 12% decline in volume and a negative 3% impact from currency. From a full year perspective, Tools & Outdoor achieved record revenue of $14.4 billion, driven by a 7% improvement from price actions, and 21% growth contributed by our outdoor acquisitions, which was offset by softer consumer demand and currency. Looking at the regions, Latin America achieved 4% organic growth. Although Europe declined 3% organically, performance improved sequentially from the third quarter, and we believe the more significant impacts from UK channel destocking are now behind us. North America was down 7% as a result of lower consumer and DIY market demand, as well as the third quarter carrying heavier holiday promotional shipments compared to last year. US retail point of sale was supported by price increases and professional demand. Compared to a pre-COVID 2019 baseline, the fourth quarter POS growth was consistent with the growth levels experienced in the third quarter of 2022. Aggregate weeks of supply in these channels ended 1.5 weeks below 2019 levels. Adjusted operating margin for the segment was 1% in the quarter as the benefit from price realization was more than offset by commodity inflation, higher supply chain costs, planned production curtailments and lower volume. For the year, operating margin was 8.4%, down versus prior year. Turning to the strategic business units. For the full year, Power Tools declined 5% organically due to weakness in consumer and DIY and front half constraints related to electronic components. These volume impacts were partially offset by the benefits of our price increases and the continued performance of our strong DEWALT cordless innovation across our FLEXVOLT, ATOMIC and XTREME product families as well as our new and differentiated power stack battery packs. Hand tools declined 5% organically in the year. Consumer related headwinds were partially offset by price realization as well as new product innovation, notably the DEWALT Impact Connect, which consists of accessories that attach to an impact driver, allowing up faster cutting than standard hand tools. We also benefited from innovation in storage solutions such as mobile tool storage within the DEWALT Tough system and the CRAFTSMAN Premium S2000 metal storage platform. The Outdoor business declined 7% organically on a pro forma basis for 2022 due to the difficult outdoor season outlined earlier in the year. The fourth quarter marked the one-year anniversary of the MTD and Excel acquisitions, and we're pleased with the progress made to advance the outdoor platform integration. We now have a combined dealer channel sales team and launched one go-to-market approach to grow share. We've activated a brand portfolio strategy, leveraging DEWALT, Cub Cade,t and Hustler in the Pro and high-end resi market segment while targeting CRAFTSMAN, Troy-Bilt, WolfGarden, and Black & Decker for the residential end user. I want to acknowledge and thank the entire team for their dedication to this process and ongoing commitment to delivering the best products for our customers. Now, shifting to Industrial, which had another strong quarter, recording 10% organic growth and double-digit adjusted operating margin. Segment revenue declined 1% versus last year as nine points of price realization and one point of volume were offset by five points from currency and six points from the oil and gas divestiture. The team leveraged the price increases and volume growth to overcome commodity inflation and higher supply chain costs to deliver adjusted operating margin of 11.5%, up sequentially 40 basis points and up 220 basis points versus last year. Looking within the segment, Engineered Fastening organic revenues were up 9% in the quarter, led by aerospace growth of 37% and auto growth of 14%, which were partially offset by industrial markets. Aerospace fasteners delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue improvement as the recovery in commercial OEM production continues. The auto fasteners' strong quarter, demonstrated by the business' ability to gain share in a dynamic environment and outpaced global light vehicle production in the quarter and for the full year. Attachment tools organic revenues were up 18%, driven by strategic pricing actions. While orders particularly from our dealer channel partners have been moderating, our backlog remains above 2019 levels. We continue to make progress with our inventory reduction in the fourth quarter, taking out nearly $500 million and resulting in a total second half inventory reduction of $775 million. Our production curtailment actions have been successful, helping to reduce DSI by approximately 20 days in the quarter and it was good to see the significant inventory reduction in the second half translate into free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter. As we look to the front half of 2023, we are targeting another $500 million reduction with the majority of this progress to be made in the second quarter. Although we typically see a seasonal inventory build as we prepare for the outdoor and spring selling season, we have the ability to work down our input materials and components as well as drive commercial actions to sell through finished goods. Our full year 2023 inventory reduction target is $750 million to $1 billion, which will drive significant cash flow generation that will be used to pay down debt and further strengthen our balance sheet. The timing of this reduction is demand-dependent. In a few moments, I'll cover how these assumptions impact the 2023 guidance range. Turning to gross margins. We expect the impact of planned production curtailments and higher cost inventory liquidations will continue to weigh on margins through the first half of 2023, resulting in margins in the low 20s. Production curtailments in the fourth quarter were down approximately 30% versus the long-term average and impacted gross margins by approximately six to seven points in the quarter. In our base case, we expect to improve from these levels but not fully eased production curtailments until the third quarter of 2023, which should support a gross margin recovery into the mid to high 20s in the back half. The normalized production and better gross margins could potentially shift earlier or later in the year depending on the overall demand environment and the speed of destocking. We have the teams focused on inventory reduction, cash generation, and balance sheet health as we work to drive gross margins to our historical 35% plus target level in 2025. I'll now walk through how the company is planning for three demand scenarios for our 2023 guidance as the macroeconomic outlook remains dynamic. Our base case scenario assumes a modestly unfavorable market demand environment, compared to what we experienced during the second half of last year. In this scenario, we are assuming total organic growth to be down low single digits with the first quarter being the toughest comp. Tools & Outdoor total organic revenue, inclusive of positive price is expected to be down low single digits, while Industrial is planned for low single-digit growth. Specifically, for Tools & Outdoor, this would imply a full year volume decline of approximately 5%, ahead of our forecast for the market. For the second half, volume is expected to be down 3% to 3.5%. In this base case, we would maintain our production curtailments with the goal of returning to normalized levels in the third quarter. As a result, the under absorption of fixed manufacturing costs would continue to constrain first half 2023 operating margins to low single digits. As production returns to normalized levels in the back half of the year, we expect operating margin rate to improve to the mid to high single-digit range. While our teams are aggressively focused on capturing deflation, this scenario does not include moderating commodity prices benefiting the P&L until late 2023 after the destock, and can be a positive driver heading into 2024. As we monitor the demand environment, we will be measured in the timing and magnitude of our investments, reinvesting into our businesses at the point of impact as part of our transformation strategy, and our base case scenario includes approximately $125 million of annualized reinvestment targeted at commercial leadership, driving innovation and complexity reduction. Shifting to our second half acceleration scenario. This contemplates the possibility of a stronger demand environment supporting organic growth in the second half of 2023. Total organic growth would be relatively flat for the year. To support the improved second half demand, production levels would normalize towards the end of the second quarter. This scenario would position us to deliver high single-digit operating margins in the second half as well as an elevated level of reinvestment to accelerate our transformation. Lastly, we are preparing a downside case that reflects a deceleration of demand due to elevated recessionary pressures. In this case, we expect full year organic revenues to decline by mid-single digits with volume declines in both the tools and outdoor and industrial segments. If this were to occur, our production curtailments would likely continue through the end of 2023, extending the time line of our gross margin recovery. Under this scenario, we would opt to conservatively meter the level of reinvestment until we had more clarity on the extent and duration of the macro impacts and economic cycle. Overall, we feel it's prudent to consider this range of potential 2023 demand possibilities production and reinvestment levels as we continue to prioritize inventory reduction and cash generation. As such, we are guiding full year adjusted earnings per share in the range of zero to $2. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be negative $1.65 to positive $0.85, inclusive of one-time charges from the global supply chain optimization and the remaining outdoor integration-related expenses. The current pre-tax estimate for one-time charges is approximately $225 million to $325 million with $50 million to $100 million in non-cash charges. Now some added quarterly context from our base case. For the first quarter, we're expecting similar levels of operating profit to what we delivered in the fourth quarter. However, we do not expect the discrete tax benefits to repeat, resulting in a first quarter adjusted loss of $0.75 per share at the midpoint. We believe profitability can improve sequentially into the second quarter, resulting in a stronger performance. In total, we expect our actions [Technical Difficulty] but will translate to positive first half free cash flow driven by $500 million of inventory reduction, most of which will come in the second quarter. As we get through the first half destock, we expect earnings to inflect positively in the second half of the year, generating an annualized EBITDA run rate of approximately $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion. We view this as a jumping off point to further improve with our transformation. Our guidance calls for $500 million to $1 billion of free cash flow in 2023, primarily from inventory reduction. We're focused on our key priorities; number one, generate strong cash flow through inventory reduction to assist with ongoing debt deleveraging; number two, sequential improvement in our gross margins as we drive further supply chain transformation initiatives; and number three, focus on gaining market share in all major categories. We're planning for the dynamic operating environment to continue and feel we have the strategy in place to successfully navigate our path forward as we remain focused on driving above market long-term organic growth. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Don. Don Allan : Thank you, Corbin. So in summary, we successfully advanced our cost reduction and business transformation strategy over the last quarter and made meaningful progress on a number of key objectives, including inventory reduction, cash generation, debt reduction and streamlining our organizational structure and supply chain. We have given you an indication today of what annualized EBITDA could be on the first step of this journey. We believe we can build from 2023's back half as our supply chain savings continue to accrue and contribute to the restoration of our gross margin to the 35% plus level. As we look ahead, we aim to get our levels of EBITDA back to 2019 levels and beyond as we continue to transform our business. While the macroeconomic environment is uncertain and 2023 will clearly bring us challenges, we are prepared to navigate forward and believe our actions to reshape, focus and streamline our organization, as well as reinvest in our core businesses will enable us to deliver strong shareholder value over the long-term via robust organic growth and enhanced profitability. With that, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis? Dennis Lange : Great. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start Q&A, please. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Don Allan : Good morning. Julian Mitchell : Good morning. Maybe just my question would be around -- I guess, two quick parts. One would be, it looks like you're guiding for positive price, I think, in Tools this year, maybe the conviction in that given what seems to be a lot of inventory kind of out there at customers and competitors. And then also, the second part would just be I heard what you said on the annualized EBITDA run rate. Are we still assuming a sort of $7 plus or so of EPS potential at Stanley in the medium-term based off that, or has that view changed? Don Allan : Yes. So I'll start and then Corbin probably will add a little color too on both of those topics. But I would say that our price model has about 1.5 to 2 points in it for the year for 2023. And based on where we are now with commodity prices, which you've seen some improvement or reduction, but overall, when you look at the basket of commodities for us, we really don't see any significant deflation and a little bit of inflation here in the first half of the year. So we still see based on that, that we can maintain price throughout the year. Now your question on the angle of there's a lot of inventory in the channel, and therefore, we're going to have to take specific promotional actions that might be unusual to drive inventory out of the channel, which, therefore, would impact our price. We don't really see that in our plan today. So we see normal promotional activity in the spring and the Father's Day season and then, of course, in the later stages around Thanksgiving and other holidays at the end of the year. And so at this point, we do not believe there's a need to do anything unusual around pricing activities to push things to the channel. One thing I'll just point out related to inventory levels in the channel. For us specifically, we actually feel where the inventory is in our customers is pretty reasonable at this point, and it's actually down a little bit from 2019 levels. And so probably about a week to two weeks down from those levels, which is a good place to be. And we feel like we've gone into the year with the adequate amount of inventory in their stores. And what we're dealing with is higher levels of inventory in our own distribution network that we have to work through during 2023 and probably some early stages of 2024. But the vast majority of that reduction is going to happen this year in 2023. The second question was related to\u2026 Corbin Walburger : Long-term EPS, medium-term. Don Allan : Long-term EPS and the $7 and some commentary around that. So I think as you start to dissect the guidance we're providing at the midpoint, you'll see that the back half is getting itself close to a couple of dollars EPS for this year. And if you annualize that and factor in seasonality from the outdoor season that happens in the first half of the year primarily, you're probably trending something for 2024 that's closer to $5. And now that assumes that we deal with an environment that we have guided here, which is the midpoint is pretty muted from a volume perspective. We -- as you heard from Corbin in his presentation, the back half is assuming for the Tools & Outdoor business that the organic performance will be down about three points. And as a result, that's really us seeing a continuation of current trends on the consumer side, but also likely some slowing on the pro side as you start to look at lower housing start numbers, lower repair remodel numbers year-over-year and as -- and we think this year, we'll see a negative organic performance at our base case. Now if that doesn't play out, and the performance is stronger, you heard from Corbin that it could be two to three points better for the year, and obviously, the back half would be a better performance as well. If that played out, and then you went into 2024 with that type of momentum, there could be a case where you actually do work yourself closer back to the $7. So I think we're probably, at this point, somewhere around $5, with it eventually having the possibility, if the volume and demand is stronger than our base case, where it could be higher than that. Anything you want to add to that, Corbin? Corbin Walburger : No. The only thing, Julian, maybe for your model from a pricing standpoint, we're going to have some price carryover in the first half of a point or two, and then that obviously anniversaries out by the second half. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open. Tim Wojs : Yeah. Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for all the details. Don, maybe just following on to your question, or to some of the answers from the last question. Just what are you seeing from the Pro today? And I guess, what -- within the scenarios that you've outlined, I mean, what are you assuming that the Pro does as you work through 2023? Don Allan : Yeah. I would actually say coming out of the gate here in 2023, it was just one month under our belt, we're actually not seeing any slowing of the Pro. So the Pro business continues to be healthy. As we talk to our customers, they say the same thing. What we are, though, forecasting in our model is a slowing down of some of that activity. And when you look at the organic projection that we have for our Tools & Outdoor business, we expect it to slow down as we get deeper into the year and for that to continue in the back half of the year in a modest way. And so I think that's a reasonable assumption when you give -- when you start to look at things like housing starts and the projections for housing starts, repair, remodel, what our customers are saying and their expectations are around likely performance year-over-year and what you hear from many of the peers in the space as well. I mean, everybody seems to be thinking that the market will probably be down somewhere 3% to 5%. And that's kind of where we are with our Tools & Outdoor business. And it aligns very much with the trends you're seeing in construction. And I think it is a good base case to start with, but as I said before, it could be better than that if the Pro doesn't weaken as much as I just described. It also could be worse than that, which I think our downside case covers that as Corbin articulated very well in his presentation. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning and thanks for the question. Don, on the inventory reduction, I think you're still going to be carrying $5 billion of inventory at year-end. So just wondering why not be even more aggressive on that inventory reduction? And is there a risk that, that this could carry forward into 2024? And maybe just address the dividend. We've got a few questions this morning. Just is there any scenario you look at/or any scenario where you might have to revisit the dividend this year? Thanks for asking the questions. Don Allan : Sure. I think on the inventory part of your question, I feel like going after $1 billion, $750 million to $1 billion is the reasonable level that we should pursue given where our business model is today and our supply chain is today. Could we, over time, over the next 12 months, get to a number above $1 billion? Yes, that's possible. It probably wouldn't be dramatically above that number, though. Now as you go into 2024, I don't think there's a need for another major step down in inventory. I think what we're going to see, if things go the way we would like them to go in 2023, we'll get a substantial chunk of inventory out in the first half of the year, a lot of that probably in Q2. We'll do some more at the end of the year in the fourth quarter, which tends to be part of the normal routine of our company. And beyond that, I think it's just going to get back to managing and optimizing the supply chain to maximize the efficiency of it. And we'll continue to drive down inventory. But it won't be at the -- having an impact on our production. It will be more managing it efficiently, looking at how we do certain types of activities that drive reductions of $250 million to $500 million each year for maybe the subsequent two years, more in that magnitude. And I think that's the right way to look at it. I really would like to get production levels back to normal in the back half of 2023. That is our goal. We think it's achievable based on our base case right now. And we'll continue to look at that. Obviously, Corbin articulated at the downside case, if we saw demand being even worse then the production levels would have to stay lower probably through the remainder of the year. But in our base case, I think there's a good chance we can get production levels back to normal in the summertime of 2023. On the dividend, very good question. Thank you for asking that. The dividend continues to be a very important part of our capital allocation strategy. We believe that it's a necessary thing for us to maintain the level of the dividend that we have today. We'll continue to evaluate that through the remainder of the year, but there's no change in that strategy at this stage. Obviously, buying back stock is not an opportunity for us given the leverage we have on our balance sheet. And so therefore, returning value back to our shareholders, the main lever we have today is our dividend. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Mike Rehaut with JPMorgan, your line is open, please shut your mute button. Mike Rehaut : Sorry, about that. Appreciate the taking my question. Just wanted to make sure I fully appreciated the base case in terms of -- I think you said earlier that it incorporates a view around repair remodel activity being down also low single-digits. I just want to make sure I understand that's right. I mean, obviously, you have existing home sale turnover trending down 30% year-over-year currently. And I think that might be, at least in our view, a little optimistic. But just wanted to understand your assumptions behind that? And also, if I could just kind of shift gears on the modeling side, I appreciate any views on some of the other line items from a guidance standpoint, corporate expense, interest expense, other net, some of those line items would be helpful? Thanks. Dennis Lange : Hey, Mike, I'll take that. On the base case, as we said, the whole company we view in the base cases being down two to three points organically. Volume is more than that. There's some coverage from price. If you look at tools organically, tools will be down about three to five points, volume down a little bit back from price. And then the second half, as Don mentioned, volumes down in the kind of 3% to 3.5%. And from an Industrial standpoint, we see that being up low single digits, both from price and from volume. So that's the case for how we got to the base case. Don Allan : I think the other thing that I would add is we \u2013 if you look back at history of Stanley Black & Decker and if you put the Great Recession in 2009 in a totally different category, because we had a significant amount of overbuild residential inventory, in particular, in housing and say that's an unusual situation that's probably not indicative of where we are today because we don't have that type of overbuild situation and we don't have the same type of leverage issues within the consumer in the housing market as well. The other recessions that Stanley Black & Decker has historically experienced, the average decline has been about 3% to 5%. And so when you think about it from that perspective and recognize that we just went through a period of time where we're dealing with supply constraints and then a bit of a consumer dip in the back half of 2022, now we believe we're going to see a bit of a pro dip here in 2023, we're kind of aligned with our 3% to 5% in 2023 with that historical point of view. There hasn't been many recessions that have impacted housing beyond the 5% except for the one that I mentioned, which was the Great Recession, which is very different than usual. So it's just something that we need to keep in mind as you factor all the different scenarios that Corbin went through in the presentation and really center around our base case. Our base case is very consistent with what history would say. Corbin Walburger : Hey, Mike, just to touch on your other question around specific line items. As we said, the corporate expenses, we've really targeted to get back to 2019 levels. That's where we expect them and then interest because rates have gone up and the quantum has gone up, you'll probably see an increase in interest expense of about 20%. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is now open. Rob Wertheimer : Hi. Good morning everybody. Don Allan : Good morning. Rob Wertheimer : To the extent you can comment, how was your pricing in Tools & Storage achieved in 4Q compare with your channel partners, your home center pricing achieved? I mean, is there still a risk of major discounting to clear out inventory or otherwise reflect an environment, or do you think that we've come close to balance there? Don Allan : I think as we look at the pricing dynamics in Tools & Outdoor, we are monitoring all the different things that are happening across the different product families and categories related to price. And we really look at what our competitors are doing. We're obviously paying attention to monitoring what we're doing as well and making sure it's consistent with our expectations. But we didn't see any major turbulence in the market around pricing from our competitors during the fourth quarter. We do see here random, kind of, what I would call promotional activities to move inventory through some of our customers' stores. So you saw some of that happen in the fourth quarter. But it didn't dramatically shift the pricing dynamic, the list pricing dynamic in particular in that time horizon. That's something we will continue to monitor here going into 2023 and make sure we stay focused on that throughout the year. And it's always something that we have to factor into our decision-making. But we think the promotional calendar that we've built with our customers so far for this year. And the other activities that we're able to do will allow us to achieve the level of inventory reduction we would like to get to, which is $750 million to $1 billion. And we obviously have to be agile and flexible and look at what happens in the market. But at this stage, we're not seeing any irrational pricing activity. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is now open. Chris Snyder : Thank you. So I wanted to ask about the gross margin recovery during 2023. When we see gross margin going from the 20% currently to the mid to high 20s by the back half of the year, could you provide just a bit more color on the buildup here between the improvement of just getting past the destock versus some of the benefits of the Phase 1 supply chain transformation plan starting to come through? Thank you. Dennis Lange : Yes, you bet, Chris. So the gross margins, as we said, in the second half of 2022, on average, we're around 22%. And there was probably about four-point penalty driven by the production curtailments and liquidating the high-cost inventory. As we go through the course of 2023, that four-point penalty slowly starts to decline to about 3.5 and then to 2.5 points by the end of the year. And again, it's a mix between -- we don't -- as I mentioned in my view on our guidance, we don't expect production curtailments to continue throughout the whole course of the year. So that will help us. And then as we liquidate the high-cost inventory, that also helps us. So by the end of the year, on an incurred basis, we will see margins slightly above 25%, but there will still be a little bit of penalty that would get us into the high 20s. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Dan Oppenheim : Great. Thanks very much. I was wondering of the plans in different scenarios in terms of inventory, where you've talked about those situations and what -- how it impact production, but it doesn't seem as though you would change your goals in terms of that $750 million to $1 billion reduction of inventory. Why not think about reducing inventory by more? Is there something in the supply chain that's leading you to thinking about keeping a higher level than where you've had historically? What's the overall thought there in terms of why not more inventory reduction? Don Allan : Yes. I would say the range actually is indicative of the range of EPS. So if the low end of range of EPS played out that Corbin articulated, then we'd probably be looking at $750 million of inventory reduction. Even though we would be continuing curtailments, the demand levels would be much lower. And so you have two or three points lower demand versus the base case. On the high end of the case, I think the $1 billion becomes very achievable because you're dealing with much higher levels of demand where organic for Tools & Outdoor would probably be flat year-over-year. And therefore, the $1 billion feels more achievable in that environment, and you're getting your production levels back to normal levels in the back half of the year or maybe sooner. And so that's where the range kind of plays out. As I mentioned earlier in response to Nigel's question, I do think if demand is stronger in the back half, we could see a possible improvement above the $1 billion. I don't think it would be a dramatic number, but a few hundred million dollars above that, it certainly makes sense. And so that's really where that range comes from. It really correlates well with the EPS range, which correlates well to the demand associated with those three different scenarios. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Nicole DeBlase : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning guys. Don Allan : Good morning. Nicole DeBlase : Just to maybe piggyback on one of the earlier questions. Can you just give a little bit more color on the ramp of the cost savings that you guys expect to achieve throughout 2023, would take into the base case? And then any help at all on as we think about 2024 and 2025? It might be a bit early to give us explicit numbers. But is more of the plan coming through in 2024, or is it more back-end loaded towards the end of the three-year period? Thank you. Corbin Walburger : Hey, Nicole, it's Corbin. I'll take it. So as Don mentioned, in 2022 in the second half, we've got about $200 million of savings. And as we look into 2023, from an SG&A standpoint, we expect to get about $300 million. About 70% of that will come in the front half and about 30% will come in the back half as you lap 2022. And then on the COGS side, we expect about $450 million, and that will build throughout the year. So Q1 will be a little bit higher and then it will build in 2Q, 3Q, and 4Q will be pretty even. Don Allan : Yeah. And I think for 2024 and 2025, I mean, we're trying -- obviously, with the numbers that you just heard, we believe we'll have $1 billion of value creation by the end of 2023. And then there's another $1 billion related to the supply chain transformation in the subsequent two years of 2024 and 2025. Right now, based on the plan we have that our operations and business teams have collectively worked together on, that $1 billion has a specific level of detail and actions that are associated with it that we believe are close to being rock solid. And, therefore, we do think in those two years, we'll probably get about $500 million or so of that in each year. And we'll see as we get deeper into 2023, whether more comes in 2024 versus 2025, time will tell. But at this stage, it feels like the way that we're phasing this because it is a pretty significant level of transformation that we're doing across our supply chain, and we need to be thoughtful as to when we do different phases of it, so we don't cause any major disruption to our customers, which is why it's going to take three years to do. At the same time, it's also why the value probably would be pretty evenly prorated over a three-year time horizon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. Eric Bosshard : Good morning. Thanks. Curious on, Don, you talked about 2024 of $5 to $7 in rough frame. And I know six months ago, that was the concept for 2023. What's so notably different in 2023 that pushed out that level of earnings to 2024? Don Allan : Yeah. I would say there's a couple of dynamics. I mean, obviously, volume continues to be challenging. We think volume is going to be challenging for 2023. I talked about what I think is going to happen with the Pro market in 2023, and we'll see a modest recession aligned with what the historical recessions are for Stanley Black & Decker of down 3% to 5%. Clearly, that's a significant factor in all of this. We're also -- we've decided to be much more aggressive in the inventory reduction than we were thinking three, five months ago, where we were going to be more methodical in that reduction. We're being more aggressive. We're really trying to get a large part of this done by the middle of 2023 to get production levels, as I said, back to normal in the back half of 2023. And those are probably the two main drivers of the difference in the timing. Eric Bosshard : Great. That's helpful color. Don Allan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn hand the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for their time and participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have further questions. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2023 First Quarter Webcast. On the webcast in addition to myself, Don Allan, President and CEO; and Pat Hallinan, Executive Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and the supplemental presentation, which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today. This morning, Don and Pat will review our 2023 first quarter year results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and, as such, involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34-F filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan. Don Allan : Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I am extremely pleased to have Patrick Hallinan on Board and joining our call today as Stanley Black & Decker\u2019s newly appointed Chief Financial Officer. Pat brings to the team a deep track record of delivering business performance, growth and value creation and complex competitive consumer branded businesses. Following my remarks, Pat will take you through the financial highlights as well as our current outlook. Welcome, Pat. Earlier this week, we also announced that Chris Nelson will be joining the company in mid-June as Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President and President of Tools and Outdoor. Chris is an experienced global leader with exceptional industry knowledge and existing relationships with many of our customers. His track record of success implementing growth strategies, which have delivered customer-centric innovation and profitable market share expansion make him the ideal leader for our tools and outdoor business. I look forward to partnering with Pat, Chris and the entire leadership team to streamline and optimize the company around our core businesses and strong portfolio of global brands as we execute our strategy and generate sustainable growth. In terms of our Q1 performance, we continue to build momentum and make strong progress as the organization remains focused on our business transformation plan. We took additional steps forward in the quarter to better serve our customers and deliver for key stakeholders by reducing inventory, leveraging enhanced cost controls and optimizing our global supply chain while continuing to increase our investments in innovation and end-user activation. The global cost reduction program delivered $230 million in pre-tax run rate savings this quarter which is modestly ahead of plan. Since we launched the program we've captured a total of $430 million of annualized savings. This is a great start and we believe we are on track to achieve the expected $1 billion of total program run rate savings by year-end. Inventory reduction is also ahead of plan, with incremental $200 million improvement in the quarter. Even while we strategically build inventory in some categories to prepare for the upcoming outdoor and Father's Day merchandising season, we have now reduced approximately $1 billion of inventory since mid-2022. I am encouraged by our progress thus far and I am confident that by executing our strategy we are positioning the company for a strong long-term growth, cash flow generation, profitability and shareholder return. Our first quarter revenue of $3.9 billion was in line with Q4 2022. This was down versus prior year as price realization and solid industrial and professional construction demand was more than offset by lower consumer and DIY volume, currency and the oil and gas business divestiture. Let me now provide some perspective on end market demand. The U.S. retail point of sale for our tools and outdoor products remained in a growth position this quarter versus 2019 levels, bolstered by price and healthy pro demand. The outdoor season had a slow start in March, but April weekly point of sale trends have been encouraging. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 23.1%, up 360 basis points sequentially versus Q4 2022. While there still is more work to be done, we are seeing adjusted gross margin improve as destocking impacts moderate. Adjusted EPS for the period was a loss of $0.41, significantly impacted by our plan prioritization efforts around inventory reduction. We are committed to advancing our business transformation plan and continuing our journey forward with persistent focus on what is within our control. We are monitoring the demand environment and global economic dynamics and planning for a range of outcomes, which balance the potential continuation of the current trends with the possibility of improvement as well as the prospect of a further demand slowdown. We have planned for all three of these scenarios and will respond accordingly if we see current trends shift. We are reiterating our 2023 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $0 to $2 as well as our free cash flow guidance of $500 million to $1 billion. Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. As we generate cost savings, we are continuing to make strategic investments in our iconic brands, innovation engine, electrification and commercialization activation to position the business for sustainable growth and margin expansion. This includes hiring additional engineers focused on product platforming, electrification and innovation as well as speed on the street to elevate user activation activities, which will ensure we extend the leadership positions of these iconic brands. Our priorities in 2023 remain unchanged. One, strong focus on cash flow through inventory reduction to assist with ongoing debt deleveraging. Two, sequential improvement in our adjusted gross margin as we drive further supply chain transformation initiatives. Three, get back to gaining market share in all major categories of our Tools & Outdoor business. Successfully executing these priorities will result in a stronger balance sheet and significantly improved EBITDA in the second half of 2023 as we head into 2024. Now let me walk through the details of our business segment performance. Beginning with tools and outdoor. Revenue was $3.3 billion, a decline of 13% as price realization was more than offset by a decline in volume and a negative impact from currency. Volume was impacted by lower consumer and DIY market demand modestly reduced channel inventory and a slow start to the retail outdoor season due to a cold March with temperatures well below the 5-year average. Tools & Outdoor adjusted operating margin was 3%, down versus the prior year as price realization was more than offset by inflation, higher supply chain cost, production curtailment and lower volume. North America and Europe were both down 12% organically as both reasons were impacted by the factors covered for the overall segment. Emerging markets were down 2% organically, but excluding the impacts from our Russian business access the region had 6% organic growth. This was led by strength in Brazil, China and the Middle East. Moving to our strategic business unit performance, power tools and hand tools were primarily impacted by softer consumer demand declining organically 12% and 6%, respectively. The Outdoor business declined 16% organically, largely impacted by softer consumer demand and the cooler weather. The slow start to the season pressured our outdoor results versus planned by approximately 5 to 6 points. We are monitoring demand to determine if this could be potentially recaptured in 2023 with encouraging POS in recent weeks signalling the season is now ramping up. A key growth area for outdoor is leveraging the 2,500 Pro dealers that we acquired with our acquisition. This channel delivered a strong performance in the quarter and was up double digits year-over-year. Pro products under our Cub Cadet and Hustler brands had a solid start and we are building traction with our DEWALT cordless handheld products across the dealer network. Now shifting to our industrial business, which had 3% organic growth in the quarter with double-digit operating margin. Total segment revenue declined 5% versus 2022 as price realization was more than offset by last year\u2019s oil & gas divestiture, currency and volume. The team leveraged price realization and productivity to deliver adjusted operating margin of 11%, up 410 basis points versus the prior year. Within this segment, Engineered Fastening organic revenues were up 3%, led by aerospace growth of 30% and auto growth of 7%, offset by softer industrial market. Attachment tools organic revenues were up 5%, driven by strategic pricing actions and continued conversion of this businesses significant backlog. In summary, this was a job well done across the board of our team we continue to reduce inventory and drove improved gross margin in a mixed revenue environment. My thanks to the entire team as we maintained our focus on the right areas and we are seeing the results of our efforts. On the next slide, I would like to review our long-term strategy that we launched last July as we transformed Stanley Black & Decker to drive consistent organic growth at accelerated levels well above market growth. Our teams around the world are gaining traction and executing on our primary areas of focus. One, streamlining and simplifying the organisation as well as shifting resources to prioritise investment that we believe have a positive and more direct impact for our customers and end users. Two, accelerating the operations and supply chain transformation to return adjusted gross margins to historical 35% plus level while improving fill rate to better match inventory with custom advance. Three, prioritizing cash flow generation and inventory optimization and four, continuing to advance innovation, electrification and global market penetration to achieve organic growth of two to three times the market. Our business transformation remains on track to deliver on these financial commitments as we strive to elevate our customer and end user experiences to world class level. The streamlining of our company and the supply chain initiatives are tracking to expectations and continuing to gain momentum. The four value creation streams within our supply chain transformation strategy are advancing with meaningful strides forward and a $110 million of savings achieved in the first quarter. Our global team is activating against our strategy with speed. The energy and passion is evident and I\u2019d like to extend my sincere thanks to our operations associates across the globe. We have made so much progress in the last nine months and every completed milestone is contributing to our shared vision for the supply chain of the future. Now a few updates in this particular area. Within the few rationalization and product platforming value stream we have approved the reduction of 60,000 SKUs across the portfolio of which 16,000 are now decommissioned. The remaining balance is no longer being manufactured and we are working with our customers to transition to new SKUs in the coming quarters. Strategic sourcing has been a strong contributor to savings as we complete the $2 billion first tranche of spend assessment. We are on track to achieve the targeted savings. Our supply base will include both existing and new vendors with a deliberate intent to improve geographic diversification and consolidation. Our dedicated team is capturing cost savings while deploying new processes to ensure sourcing changes are executed successfully. Our initial announcements related to the manufacturing footprint optimization were made in March, which includes site expansions, transformations into manufacturing centers of excellence, as well as site consolidation. We are on track with our expectations and are taking a holistic approach to our manufacturing base and logistics network to ensure we optimize the efficiency and utilization of our asset base. Finally, we are increasing our focus on manufacturing excellence and re-emphasizing the SBD operating model along with lean manufacturing practices at our factories. We deployed this playbook at four plants in the first quarter and in March we kicked off at nine additional sites. We are seeing strong traction and are capturing improved productivity efficiencies where these tools were activated. We are excited with the progress and you can expect us to continue to make strides in the coming months and quarters. Turning to SG&A, we captured approximately $120 million of savings this quarter and are on pace for $500 million of pre-tax savings by the end of the year from simplifying the corporate structure, streamlining leadership spans of control and organizational layers, and reducing indirect spend. We are confident in our ability to capture $1 billion of run rate savings by the end of 2023 and $2 billion of annualized savings by 2025 from this program. A key tenet of our strategy is the acceleration of investment in innovation and electrification. We are making deliberate strategic investments to maintain our market-leading innovation ecosystem. A couple highlights from this year's outdoor season. In terms of delivering innovative cordless products, the CRAFTSMAN 20-volt line-up is designed for extended runtime and better performance. This includes the new brushless string trimmer that is lighter weight than its gas-powered equivalent and carries more runtime and force than prior generations. The new cordless pressure washer also joins this line-up in addition to the range of other new 20-volt cordless lawn and garden tools. Continuing to expand our 20-volt system is enabling users to go wherever the work is without the limitation of cords or gas engines. These items are currently available for this season and we are excited about the initial market reception. Additionally, we just received notice that we won eight 2023 Popular Mechanics Yard and Garden Best New Product Awards across DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN, and Black & Decker. In addition to the CRAFTSMAN offerings just highlighted, the DEWALT pruning saw and String Trimmer were awarded as Best for Contractors and the Black & Decker pruning chainsaw was named best for light duty use. This is a great recognition of the quality of the innovation we bring to the market and our ability to serve our entire user base from the consumer to the most demanding pro. Let me now turn the call over to Pat for some further financial highlights on the quarter and our latest outlets. Patrick Hallinan : Thank you, Don, and good morning everyone. I'm honored to join Stanley Black & Decker, the worldwide leader in Tools & Outdoor, at such a pivotal moment in the company's history. I have tremendous respect for the leadership team and Stanley Black & Decker's iconic portfolio of professional and consumer brands. During my initial weeks, I have been impressed with the breadth and depth of the company-wide transformation underway. Observing the early traction of the multi-year program and the savings captured during the initial phases, it is clear that the company's transformation is progressing rapidly and powerfully. I am energized to help accelerate the company's journey forward and to enhance our long legacy of market leading innovation and profit performance. Now let me walk through the details of the company's progress towards reducing inventory and improving gross margins. We exited last year with $5.9 billion of inventory. We reduced his by over $200 million in the first quarter. Since mid-2022, we have successfully reduced inventory by approximately $1 billion. This achievement was driven by improved supply chain conditions and planned production curtailments instituted during the back half of 2022 and which continue today. The targeted inventory reduction helped minimize the magnitude of the seasonal working capital build typical of our first quarter. As a frame of reference, our first quarter working capital build has averaged $700 million over the last five years, while this quarter it was $200 million, improving our cash performance primarily via inventory reduction. We are on track to achieve our expected $500 million of first half inventory reduction as we work down raw material and component inventory while selling out finished goods. Our full year 2023 inventory reduction target remains $750 million to $1 billion to drive significant cash flow generation and to pay down debt, strengthen our balance sheet, and back our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends. Overall, the pace of our inventory reduction will be demand dependent and in a few moments I will cover the range of demand scenarios we are considering within our 2023 guidance. Turning to gross margins, which are also improving in a manner consistent with our plan. First quarter adjusted gross margins were approximately 23%, up 360 basis points sequentially versus the fourth quarter 2022, as we saw a smaller headwind from destocking actions and as our transformation initiatives provide a greater income statement benefit, something we expect to continue. Production containments in the first quarter were at levels relatively similar to those of the back half of last year and the destock impacted gross margin by approximately 400 to 500 basis points. We expect a similar impact to the second quarter resulting in second quarter adjusted gross margin consistent with that of the first quarter. Our base case guidance anticipates the adverse margin impact from our targeted production curtailments and destocking will ease through the year. Supporting adjusted gross margin expansion into the mid-to-high 20s for the second half of the year. The timing of normalized production and improved gross margin could shift earlier or later depending on the demand environment and corresponding speed of inventory reduction. We will actively monitor demand and adjust our supply chain to optimize the pace of margin improvement and inventory reduction throughout 2023. An important leading indicator for gross margin is the 110 million of supply chain transformation savings delivered in the first quarter. As these savings turn through inventory later this year, gross margin will expand further. It is encouraging to see the initial progress towards our multi-year target to return adjusted gross margins to the 35 plus percent range. We are prioritizing cash generation, gross margin improvement, and balance sheet strength. By executing against these priorities, we are positioning the company for long-term growth and value creation. Now turning to 2023 guidance. We are reiterating our four-year adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $0 to $2 per share. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings range per share to be negative $1.65 to $0.60, inclusive of one-time charges primarily from the global supply chain transformation and outdoor integration. The current pre-tax charges estimate was narrowed to 275 to 325 million with approximately 25% of these expenses being non-cash. We continue to target free cash flow generation of $500 million to $1 billion, primarily driven by inventory reduction. Consistent with the framework shared in February, we planned and continue to forecast around three 2023 demand scenarios as the macroeconomic outlook remains dynamic. Our base case scenario assumes a modestly unfavorable market demand environment compared to what we experienced during the second half of last year. In this scenario, we are assuming total organic growth to be down low to mid-single-digit, incorporating the softer start to the outdoor season. Tools & Outdoor, total organic revenue is expected to be down low to mid-single-digit, while we expect low single-digit growth for industrial. The base case also assumes that we maintain the production curtailment with the intention to return to normalized production levels during the third quarter. As a result, the under-absorption of fixed manufacturing costs would continue to constrain second quarter operating margins to low single-digit. As production returns to normalized levels in the back half of the year, we expect operating margin to improve to the mid-to-high single-digit range, resulting in full-year operating margins in the mid-single-digit. Finally, the base case includes approximately 125 million of annualized reinvestment targeting Tools & Outdoor growth acceleration and complexity reduction. We plan to be measured with the magnitude and timing of such investments depending on the demand environment. The second half acceleration scenario contemplates a stronger demand environment, supporting organic growth in the second half of 2023. In this scenario, we would expect a quicker normalization of inventory levels and gross margin improvement. Total organic growth would be relatively flat for the year. This scenario would position the company to deliver high single-digit operating margins in the second half, as well as a larger level of reinvestment to accelerate our transformation. The downside case reflects a deceleration of demand due to elevated recessionary pressures. If this scenario becomes the macro reality, we would expect full-year organic revenues to decline by mid-single-digit, with volume declines in both the Tools & Outdoor and industrial segments. In this scenario, production curtailments would likely remain in place through the end of 2023, extending the timeline of our gross margin recovery. With lower demand, we would adjust the level of reinvestment in CapEx until we have more clarity on the extent and duration of the macro impacts. We believe it is prudent to maintain these ranges of 2023 demand outcomes, production levels, and approaches to reinvestment as we prioritize our transformation and inventory reduction and cash generation. Turning to important remaining elements of guidance, for the full year, we expect the below-the-line expenses in total to be relatively similar to the guidance issued in early February. We are building an expectation for higher interest expense, which is offset by a modestly lower 2023 tax expense assumption. For the second quarter, we are expecting a sequential improvement in operating profit, primarily from seasonally higher levels of revenue. Adjusted gross margin is planned to be in the low 20s, relatively similar to that of the first quarter. Adjusted EPS is planned to be at a loss of approximately $0.40 per share at the midpoint, incorporating an expectation for a higher tax expense versus the first quarter. Free cash flow is expected to be positive in the second quarter, primarily from inventory reduction. Our plan calls for earnings to inflect positively in the second half of the year, generating an annualized EBITDA run rate of approximately $1.3 to $1.7 billion. This range is similar to our view in February, and we believe this is the appropriate base to build off as we deliver our transformation savings over the next couple of years. We are planning for the dynamic operating environment to continue, and feel we have the strategy in place to successfully navigate our path forward as we remain focused on driving above-market, long-term organic growth and margin expansion. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Don. Don Allan : Thank you, Pat. We are continuing to forge our path forward. We made solid progress again in the first quarter with strong cost savings, inventory reduction, and advancements across all elements of the transformation plan. As we execute against our strategy in 2023, and over the three-year time horizon, we believe our transformation efforts will begin to drive more material financial benefits. Our focus will be to continue to reinvest $300 million to $500 million of these benefits toward faster growth as we strengthen the innovation machine and stimulate demand with enhanced end-user activation. We believe our actions to reshape, focus, and streamline our organization, as well as reinvest in our core businesses, will enable us to deliver strong shareholder value over the long-term via robust organic growth and enhanced profitability. We have the best people, the best brands, and the most powerful innovation engine in our industry. Combine this with the passion, energy, and commitment I see across the organization every day, and it gives me great confidence that we will focus on what we can control to be successful, and we ultimately will recreate a significant market share gaining machine. With that, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis? Dennis Lange : Great. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start Q&A, please. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Don Allan : Good morning. Nigel Coe : Good morning, and Pat, look forward to meeting you soon, and Don, congratulations on hiring Chris Nelson. He's someone we know really well, so good guy. Don Allan : Thank you. Nigel Coe : So my question is really just -- maybe just more detail on the Tools & Storage sales in North America. You talked about footprint of sales being above 2019 levels, but just wondering how that looked year-over-year, maybe the fact the Pro and DIY. And then the pricing of 2%. To what extent was that a lot of promotional activity around maybe outdoor? And how do you see pricing trending through the year? Thanks. Don Allan : Yes, I'll give a little color on POS, and then ask Pat to give a little color on the pricing part of the question. So I - the POS trends are obviously, when you look at them year-over-year, for some of our customers, they're down in the mid-single digits to high-single digits. Other customers are only down in the low-single digits to flat. So you got a mixed bag of different things happening there, but overall, we are seeing POS down year-over-year in Q1 and that trend will likely continue in Q2 at a lesser magnitude, because as the comp gets easier from Q1 to Q2, that trend will continue. The trend around PRO continues to be very healthy. We're not seeing any major shifts in that dynamic. The consumer side continues to be relatively flat sequentially to what we've been experiencing for the last, two or three quarters since the second quarter of last year. No major shifts there, but certainly not any strengthening on the consumer side as people continue to shift their dollars to different areas across the United States. But overall, I would say POS is kind of trending the way we would expect. Outdoor is a little choppy in the last six to eight weeks, as we saw a pretty rough March due to the weather. Things got better first half to the later stages of April as the weather got better, and then obviously we've seen a little bit of bumpiness in the last week or so as the weather hasn't been great in the Midwest and New England and Northeast in that time frame. And not to be a weather forecaster, but the weather is looking much better as we go into next week, so hopefully that trend shifts back to a positive. But it's a little bit of choppiness. I think, all of us, the retailers, our customers, ourselves, are all looking at probably the next month or so as to what the trends will be in POS, and that will really ultimately define the success of the season. But I do think we've factored our guidance in a way that allows us to navigate that effectively. And, Pat, maybe a little color on price now. Patrick Hallinan : Pricing environment has been stable. The price increase dynamic for us that you referenced in the first quarter was largely a carry-in price increase. Broadly in the channels and across competitors, the pricing environment remains stable. It appears to us that most in the market are focused on margin enhancement and, therefore, preserving pricing. We don't expect additional price in our outlook through the balance of the year, so stable pricing. We will be, given the supply chain improvements we've been making, we will be engaging in traditional seasonal promotions throughout the year, so that dynamic will be returning, but that's less of a new pricing dynamic and more of a return to traditional seasonal promotions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. Maybe just my question would be around, when you think about that uplift of margins from sort of low single digits amid the high single digits in the second half, maybe try to parse out how much of that is sort of sales uplift versus less destock versus less underproduction? And how we think about the phasing of third quarter versus fourth quarter earnings, anything major to call out there? Don Allan : Yes. Most of that margin uplift from the first half to the second half is driven by gross profit margin uplift as opposed to some particularly strong volume or SG&A component. And most of it is, as we get into the back half of the year, you'll have more of the progress and the transformation going through the income statement and less of the inventory destock and production curtailment providing headwinds in that. And the order of magnitude is in the 300 to 500 basis points of gross margin improvement first half to back half. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open. Tim Wojs : Hey. Good morning, everybody, and welcome, Pat. Maybe just on the channels, I guess, what do you \u2013 it sounds like you've got kind of varying levels of kind of POS activity between your customers. I mean, how does that kind of translate into channel inventory and kind of what they're holding and kind of what their comfort of current channel inventory is looking like? Don Allan : Yes. Thanks for asking that question, Tim, because I didn't really get into that when I was talking about POS. But, yes, I would say the inventory levels in the channels and our major customers in North America and Europe are still high when you kind of look at traditional historical levels of inventory, but they are starting to come down. And so we're starting to see improvement in that. And I think for us in particular, the good news has always been that we weren't starting with a high level of inventory compared to maybe other folks within the industry and other competitors. So when you look at Home Depot as an example, we're not far away from where you would traditionally see. We're within a week or so of what we would typically want it to be and what they would want it to be. Lowe's is a little bit higher than that, but Lowe's tends to run at a much higher level of inventory, as we all know, versus Home Depot. So we feel pretty good about it. I think you'll see a continued little bit of working down of our inventory and our customers in Q2 and maybe a little bit of that in the Q3 as we work through the year, depending on where demand goes. So I don't think we're done with the de-stocking, but I think it's something that's very manageable for us versus maybe what some of our competitors are dealing with right now. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning, guys. Don Allan : Good morning. Josh Pokrzywinski : So, Don, I just want to maybe follow up on the SKU reduction. So for what you guys have contemplated and maybe what you've done so far, what has been the drag on organic growth? I guess how much of that drops through to just kind of shelf space loss, et cetera, versus something you can backfill with similar products? Don Allan : Yes, that's a good question for me to clarify. Thank you for asking that. So we're being very thoughtful on how we do this. And so those 60,000 SKUs is a lot of SKUs. When you hear about that, you start to wonder if that's going to have an impact on revenue. But the ones that we've eliminated in the first phase really had, very little revenue tied to them and very little inventory in the system. So, it was really just eliminating something that hasn't really been selling over the last several years. What you're left with now are the ones that, which is about 45,000 SKUs, that we stopped manufacturing, there's revenue tied to that, and there's inventory in our system tied to it as well. And so, you need to go through a thoughtful process with all of our customers of conversion from those products to other products that exist in Stanley Black & Decker that are very similar in nature. Now, whether that's an upgraded version that has been upgraded through innovation and the customer is still selling the older version, it could be an example of that. It could be an example of a brand being sold under a certain product and that we want to switch that brand over in that particular customer to a similar product but a different brand. And that takes probably 12 to 18 months to navigate through. And so, it's going to be a very slow methodical process with the overall objective being to not have an impact on revenue and to really minimize any potential write-outs that might exist in the world of inventory. And so far, the team has been very successful in doing that, but there's still a lot of work ahead of us. And we have dedicated resources that are focused on this within our tools and outdoor business. And they have a very good grasp of the commercial aspects of this as well as supply chain. And I think they're doing an effective job so far navigating through it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And Pat, welcome and nice to see you again, so to speak. First, well, I guess my only question; I wanted to get a sense of maybe if I can kind of break it into two parts, actually. One is just a clarification on the first quarter results. What drove the upside on the operating margins? I believe you're looking for something more flattish to 4Q. But then secondly, on the guidance, you talked about PRO remaining healthy. I was just curious in terms of how you're thinking about PRO, particularly in the back half. And when you think about tools and storage with the guidance in the base case, if that is looking for a positive inflection or just being more flat, and how PRO figures in that? Patrick Hallinan : Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. In terms of the first quarter favorability, we are executing well on the transformation. And so the transformation is running ahead of plan. And we're feeling good, not just about 2023, but about the road beyond 2023 and delivering on that transformation. So I would say just, when you get to the phasing of it throughout the year, that's more just it's difficult to predict perfectly how inventory rolls off your balance sheet and what level of inventory rolls off your balance sheet. So I would say having guidance that's highly consistent with the original guidance of low 20% gross profit margins in the first half and high 20% gross profit margins in the back half is the way you should think of the business. You should have confidence in the transformation delivering that. And the way it flows quarter to quarter is always going to depend a little bit on mix and what type of inventory is coming off the balance sheet. So I wouldn't subscribe anything other than that to the first half gross profit margin. Solid transformation performance and just an update on where the inventory is falling off the balance sheet. In terms of the outlook of the end market dynamics in Tools & Outdoor for the balance of the year, we would expect what we've seen in the first quarter to persist throughout the balance of the year, which is continued strength in the pro-environment and a softer consumer environment and that dynamic to be relatively consistent across the quarters. But as Don mentioned earlier, Q&A, the comp gets easier as we get from the second quarter to the third quarter. So it's less about a change in end market buyer behavior in the last three quarters of the year, and it's more the comp easing in the latter part of the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is now open. Chris Snyder : Thank you. So the Q1 inventory reduction certainly seems to be tracking ahead of expectations. But you guys left the 1 HD stock guide unchanged at 500 million. Does this signal that maybe some of the destock was pulled forward into Q1? Or should we think about potential upside on the rate of the first half destock? Because it does sound like outdoor is improving in April relative to March. Thank you. Patrick Hallinan : Yes, I'd start by reiterating that, we're committed to destocking 750 million to a billion for the year. And that's the commitment. And the team is working through that, given a dynamic macro environment. The reason to not change the flow throughout the first half and the second half is really, channels remain conservative as you would expect with a dynamic macro environment and relatively high short-term borrowing costs. And so, we'll continue to navigate the same environment that they're facing and achieve the year. But right now, it's just too soon to change our outlook on the first half and the second year, second half inventory changes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. Eric Bosshard : Thanks. Good morning. Patrick, I hear the guidance on the 750 to a billion. I'm curious as you think about solving that in an environment where retail inventories are a little bit heavy. The demand is where it is. I'm curious as you think about promotions and really working through your inventory into an environment where things are slow and the inventories are a bit heavy. Is there a desire to be patient in the pace at which you work through that inventory? Or is there an opportunity to be more aggressive through promotions to clear out that inventory through 2023 to be better positioned for 2024? How do you navigate or solve through that dynamic? Patrick Hallinan : Now, thanks for the question, Eric. Our inclination is to be more thoughtful around sales and operations planning. It is not our intent, except for around the SKU rationalization areas, it's not our intent to drive an inventory change through aggressive pricing. That is not our intent. We're going to be disciplined on pricing and we're going to be focused on improving margins throughout 2023 and beyond 2023. So we'll be addressing that, Eric, really by internal planning around production relative to sales and we'll update, the guidance as appropriate as the macro unfolds and as channel behavior unfolds. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Thanks, Shannon. We'd like to thank everyone again for their time and participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2023 second quarter webcast. On the webcast in addition to myself is Don Allan, President and CEO; Pat Hallinan, EVP and CFO; and joining us for Q&A this morning is Chris Nelson, COO, EVP, and President of Tools and Outdoor. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. This morning, Don and Pat will review our second quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to our cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan. Donald Allan : Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Stanley Black & Decker's second quarter performance represented strong execution across the organization, driving significant progress towards our business transformation objectives on multiple fronts. Before I get into the results, I am extremely pleased to welcome Chris Nelson to our leadership team and we have him joining us on the call for Q&A today. Chris started in June as our Chief Operating Officer and President of our Tools and Outdoor business. Chris is an experienced global business leader with strong industry knowledge and a successful track record of implementing growth strategies, which have delivered customer-centric innovation and profitable market share expansion. I'm excited to see Chris assume leadership of the Tools and Outdoor business. He is bringing new energy and perspective, which will further position us for strong execution and faster profitable growth. Welcome, Chris. With this critical appointment, Stanley Black & Decker's senior leadership team is now in place. Together we will bring our shared vision to life, optimizing the company around our core businesses and strong portfolio of global brands, as we execute our strategy to generate sustainable growth and margin expansion. As you'll hear from Pat in a few moments, our cost and supply chain optimization program is ahead of plan to the first six months of 2023 and building momentum. The compelling long-term growth opportunities in the markets we serve combined with the progress we've made transforming our business, including our improved cost position, gives us the confidence to pursue further growth investments in the second half of this year. Deploying these growth investments as part of our $300 million to $500 million target over the next three years is intended to accelerate market share gains. As we drive these investment priorities, we are also maintaining our commitment to return value to our shareholders. And to that end, our Board of Directors approved a modest increase to our quarterly cash dividend amounting to $0.81 per share. Shifting now to our second quarter performance. We demonstrated that we are continuing to advance our transformation journey and ahead of the planned program. Specifically, we reduced inventory by nearly $400 million in Q2, which brings our aggregate program to date reduction to $1.4 billion since mid-2022. Our Global Cost Reduction Program delivered $230 million of pre-tax run-rate savings in the quarter, on track for the expected $1 billion in annualized savings by the end of this year. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 23.6%, a sequential improvement of 50 basis points, our second consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. And all of these actions translated into $200 million of free cash flow in Q2. Second quarter revenue was $4.2 billion which was down versus the prior year due to lower consumer Outdoor and DIY volume, as rising interest rates have tempered consumer spending in addition to the negative year-over-year impact of the oil and gas divestiture completed last year. That said, demand remains solid for the professional side of the market, which represents roughly 70% of our Tools business. As it relates to the end markets, the US retail point-of-sale for our Tools and Outdoor products remained in a growth position this quarter versus 2019 levels, bolstered by price and healthy pro demand. Both Tools and Outdoor POS through the first four weeks of July is growing versus prior year, a potentially positive signal for the back half of 2023. We're also encouraged by a stabilizing residential construction market, despite the rising interest-rate cycle. US homes starts are running at a pace of 1.4 million units in June, a strong signal that demand for housing remains sound. This is complemented by US permits to build single-family homes rising to a one-year high and positive trend in housing completions. Additionally, contractor backlog in the US remains healthy for repair and remodel activity. The European markets are experiencing similar trends with softer DIY markets balanced with a healthier level of construction activity and professionals with backlogs through the end of this year. And then finally, our channel partners continued to be focused on optimizing inventory levels and we expect that to be a modest headwind throughout 2023. Across our Industrial end markets, we are seeing continued strength in global automotive and aerospace. So while the end markets across Stanley Black & Decker remain relatively stable with pockets of strength, we are monitoring the demand environment and continue to plan for a range of outcomes and we will respond accordingly if we see current trends shift. Operationally, we continue to be focused on the prioritization of inventory reduction and cash generation, with 2Q adjusted diluted EPS coming in at a loss of $0.11 which was better than our plan. Due to the solid progress we have made on our key financial goals in the first half, we are narrowing our 2023 full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $0.70 up to $1.30 and narrowing our free cash flow range to $600 million to $900 million. Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. Now let me walk through the details of our business segment performance. Beginning with Tools and Outdoor, total revenue was $3.5 billion down 5% organically versus prior year, that favourable price realization was more than offset by volume decline. We continue to make progress on the Tools and Outdoor adjusted operating margin, which was 4.5% up 150 basis points sequentially driven by benefits from volume leverage and cost control versus prior year our operating margin rate was down as price realization was more than offset by selling through high-cost inventory, planned production curtailment costs and lower volume. I would now like to provide some more detail on our various Tools and Outdoor geographies. North America was down mid-single-digits organically weighted by lower consumer Outdoor and DIY tool demand as well as modest customer destocking. Organic revenues were stronger sequentially as we lap tougher comparables and saw benefits from better order fill rates with our customers while leveraging strength and professional demand. Our European revenue was down 1% organically with bright spots in the UK and Southern regions as they both posted high-single-digit organic growth. The emerging markets' performance was down 3% organically. However, when you exclude the impacts from our Russian business exit, the remaining countries had high-single-digit organic growth. This was led by strong demand in Brazil, particularly within the professional channels. Moving to our strategic business unit performance, we experienced an Outdoor organic revenue decline of 12%. As widely reported by many in this industry, the challenging start to the outdoor season persisted for the entire season. And we did experience notable softness in POS and replenishment in the quarter especially surrounding higher price point retail products. The hand tools business was flat organically versus prior year and overcame softer DIY volume with international growth and certain categories strength. Notably, DEWALT storage solution growth including the expanded softline and TOUGHSYSTEM 2.0 portfolio offerings introduced earlier this year. Power tools declined 4% organically as softer consumer market demand persisted and customers remain cautious with inventory levels. This result was notably better than the first quarter as we saw continued Pro momentum, coupled with positive impacts from a healthier supply chain, leading to better service levels and increased promotional opportunities, particularly with DEWALT and CRAFTSMAN. Now shifting to our industrial business, which had 3% organic growth in the quarter. The total segment revenue declined 5% versus 2Q 2022 as price realization was more than offset by last year's oil and gas divestiture and currency. We improved the adjusted operating margin by 370 basis points versus prior year, including continued price realization and cost actions to deliver adjusted operating margin of 13%. This represents strong execution and a great financial outcome this quarter for our industrial team. Within this segment Engineered Fastening organic revenues were up 8%, including aerospace growth of 31% and auto growth of 15% as we captured cyclical rebounds in these markets along with share gains. This favourable performance was partially offset by industrial fastening and attachment tools' organic revenue declines, primarily as a result of customers destocking to optimize their inventory levels. While long-term fundamentals for growth remain solid, we believe temporary channel inventory reductions will continue to impact these industrial businesses in the second half of the year as well. In summary, the team continues to navigate market conditions with several pockets of strength in a few areas of pressure while we continue to improve our margins. I want to thank the entire Stanley Black & Decker organization for your focus on our key priorities. The progress to date is very encouraging and energizing as we take the next several steps of our business transformational journey. Turning to the next slide. I would like to underscore the importance of the strategy that we launched a year ago to transform Stanley Black & Decker to accelerate market share gains and drive consistent organic growth. Our teams around the world are gaining traction and executing on our primary areas of focus. One, streamlining and simplifying the organization as well as shifting resources to prioritize investments that we believe have a positive and more direct impact for our end-users and various channel customers. Two, accelerating the operations and supply chain transformation to return adjusted gross margins to historical 35% plus levels, while improving fill rate to better match inventory with customer demand. Three, prioritizing cash flow generation and inventory optimization. And four, continuing to advance innovation, electrification, and global market penetration to achieve organic growth of two times to three times the market. Our business transformation is our path to continuing to enhance our customer and end-user experiences while delivering on our financial commitments and enabling the pursuit of strategic growth investments behind our iconic brands, innovation engine, electrification and commercial activation. Key investments in innovation, coupled with market activation are being accelerated to maximize the impact of our product launches with our global customers and end-users. For example, our fully integrated CRAFTSMAN campaign was built to drive traffic to our key retail partners, instant repeat purchases, and engage new users. To-date, we've shown strong initial results breaking through the industry clutter. Since the campaign launched in the second quarter, we've driven both online and offline traffic to retail and demonstrated improved tools point-of-sale run-rate versus the prior year to support brand market share growth. We're excited to see continued positive momentum from this exciting CRAFTSMAN brand campaign. We are also leveraging the strength of our DEWALT brand with a Pro-inspired product roadmap to expand core innovation as we released enhanced product offerings to improve the End-User experience. We recently launched two new DEWALT Sealed Head Ratchets. The 20-volt MAX XR as well as the extreme 12-volt MAX options, delivering power, versatility, and durability engineered with the professional in mind, particularly, automotive, electrical, and mechanical tradespeople. The innovative design meets the needs of Pros across industries on any job site. The new DEWALT 20-volt MAX XR Brushless Cordless Rivet Tools were also introduced this quarter. Design for precision fastening and pre-fabrication, assembly, HVAC, roofing, and automotive applications. These tools have features such as on-board nose piece storage and a mandrel collector to catch rivets after each shot. Lastly, we introduced a new DEWALT 25-foot LED tape measure, a great example of core innovation within our Tough Series product line. Our engineering team continues to advance our innovation roadmap with best-in-class products and solutions for our end-users as we electrify and enhance safety on the job site as well as push the balance of power and performance across our categories. Let me now turn the call over to Pat to share the latest progress updates and our transformation, financial insights on the quarter and our latest outlook. Patrick Hallinan : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Don mentioned, we made meaningful progress on our transformation in the quarter and first half of the year. Our cost reduction program is on track to deliver $1 billion of pre-tax run-rate savings in 2023 and is modestly ahead of plan year-to-date. Our simplification and prioritization efforts coupled with our supply chain transformation delivered $230 million of run-rate savings in the second quarter totaling $460 million year-to-date and $660 million since program inception. Approximately half of our 2023 savings were manufacturing costs related and as such we'll begin to see these benefits turn through inventory, off the balance sheet, and on to the P&L starting in the second half and continuing to build in 2024. Our organization is bringing our vision for the supply chain of the future to life with persistent sustainable progress. Strategic sourcing is a major contributor of 2023 savings and is ahead of plan. We have the capabilities in place to ensure changes are executed successfully and we are currently activating additional RFPs to secure further savings. The momentum behind the SBD operating model along with lean manufacturing practices is yielding sustainable productivity efficiencies such as alleviating manufacturing bottlenecks as well as reducing process waste and production downtime. This will become an important source of savings in the coming months and quarters. Our manufacturing and logistics network optimization remains on track, as we work to improve the efficiency and utilization of the asset base. Finally, as it relates to our complexity reduction, the SKU rationalization initiative is progressing in an orderly fashion. At this stage, we have approved the reduction of approximately 70,000 SKUs. We are working with our customers to assist with their transition to replacing products over the coming quarters. We have now decommissioned over 20,000 SKUs. We believe that as we exit the remaining 50,000 offerings, we will have suitable substitutes that will mitigate effectively all of the potential revenue risks which we size at less than 50 million annually. We believe managing this in a methodical way creates value via complexity reduction, without undue disruption to our customers or loss of share. We are pleased with the progress of our global cost reduction program and are confident in our ability to capture $1 billion of run-rate savings by the end of 2023 and $2 billion of run-rate savings by the end of 2025. Turning to our inventory reduction progress and gross margin trajectory. In the second quarter, we reduced inventory by $375 million bringing our year-to-date progress to $575 million. Over the last 12 months, we've achieved approximately $1.4 billion in inventory reduction through the improved supply chain conditions and planned production curtailments instituted during the back half of 2022. To contextualize our first-half performance, the $575 million reduction compares favourably to the average pre-pandemic first-half inventory build of approximately $400 million. We are expecting our full-year 2023 inventory reduction to be between $700 million and $900 million, which represents the DSI, that is about a 155 days. We remain committed to ongoing inventory productivity improvement to generate cash flow that will be used to strengthen our balance sheet while supporting our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends. Turning to gross margin. The pace of improvement has been modestly ahead of expectations as transformation execution and freight deflation are favourable to plan. Second quarter adjusted gross margin was 23.6%, up 50 basis points sequentially versus the first quarter of 2023, the impact from liquidating high-cost inventory and the production curtailments represented approximately 400 basis points to 500 basis points of margin headwinds in the second quarter. Moving forward, we expect continued sequential improvement in adjusted gross margin driven by a lower impact from turning high-cost inventory and an increased benefit as our cost transformation improves the P&L. Assuming the demand levels and other assumptions that underpin our guidance, we expect adjusted gross margin to be 27% to 29% in the second half, a strong improvement versus recent quarters. While this is a significant step up from the front-half performance, we have line-of-sight into the cost-savings already generated and on the balance sheet that corresponds to lower-cost of sales and margin improvement in the coming quarters. To conclude, we're starting to reap the benefits from the inventory reductions and supply chain transformation and we'll remain focused on delivering our targeted adjusted gross margin of 35% plus by 2025. Now turning to 2023 guidance. Our expected GAAP earnings per share range has been narrowed to negative $1.25 to negative $0.50 from negative $1.65 to positive $0.60, inclusive of one-time charges, primarily from the global supply chain transformation and outdoor integration. The current pre-tax charges estimate was narrowed to $300 million to $325 million with approximately 25% of these expenses being non-cash. The 2023 quarterly profile of GAAP taxes and GAAP earnings per share is significantly impacted by the pre-tax loss in the first half and the interim tax impact of certain benefits factored into our annual effective tax rate assumption. However, as we expect to generate pre-tax income in the second half. This interim tax benefit will reverse and we expect our full-year tax rate to be relatively consistent with prior guidance. In parallel, we are also narrowing our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $0.70 to $1.30 from our previous guidance range of zero to $2. We are keeping the $1 midpoint consistent with the prior guidance framework versus our previous expectation, we have assumed modestly lower organic growth offset by better gross margin. At the midpoint, this results in an improved full-year adjusted operating profit and margin. This stronger operating performance is offset by an approximate $0.25 impact from higher interest and other expenses below the line, of which, 40% to 50% is interest-rate driven. We are narrowing our full-year free cash flow range to $600 million to $900 million from $500 million to $1 billion. We expect second half cash flow to be supported by positive net income, a further reduction in inventory, and the normal Tools and Outdoor seasonal benefit from working capital. We are planning for total company organic growth to be down mid-single-digits for the year. In terms of the business segment outlook, Tools and Outdoor total organic revenue is expected to be down mid-to-high single-digits for the year, incorporating the softer outlook in Outdoor as well as expectations for continued DIY softness and channel inventory conservatism. We are expecting to regain Cordless Power Tool promotions in the second half, reflecting our improved supply position. And as such, pricing is assumed to be relatively flat to slightly negative consistent with these activities. We continue to see the Pro tool user holding strong. And at this point, we believe the range of outcomes for volume covers some variability for the US consumer and DIY demand balance with the potential for stronger professional demand in the back half. In Industrial, we expect flat to low-single-digit organic growth on a full-year basis supported by a cyclical rebound in aerospace and auto. This is modestly lower than our prior outlook as we incorporate an assumption for continued customer destocking in attachment tools and industrial fastening. Production normalization and the pace of growth investments will both be flexed based on demand. We are planning for production to normalize in the fourth quarter recognizing the lower volume. We remain disciplined and flexible in our approach to reinvesting to drive organic growth. Our focus is to deliver on our financial expectations while utilizing gross margin improvements to fund growth investments. Our outlook assumes approximately $125 million of annualized investment with a goal to ultimately deploy $300 million to $500 million over the next three years. Clearly, our willingness to invest increases as we progress along our gross margin expansion trajectory. We expect second half adjusted operating margins to be in the mid-to-high single-digit as our cost efficiencies offset volume pressures. Turning to the important remaining elements of guidance. The expectation for the third quarter would be a sequential improvement in operating profit, primarily from the benefits of our cost reduction initiatives and a lesser impact from destocking. Adjusted EPS for the third quarter is planned to be approximately 80% of the full-year adjusted EPS amounts. And due to losses within the first half, the back-half adjusted EPS will be more than a 100% of the full-year total adjusted EPS. So in summary, we are exiting the first half with strong momentum across our cost-savings and cash generation initiatives with some of the more significant impacts from our inventory reduction now in the rear-view mirror, we are focusing on driving the items within our control to deliver further margin improvement and to fund investments. We continue to manage the business with the long-term in mind and we believe we have the right strategy in place to successfully navigate our path forward as we remain focused on driving above-market organic growth with margin expansion and enhance shareholder returns. With that, I will now pass the call back over to Don. Donald Allan : Thank you, Pat. We are pleased to report another quarter of meaningful progress related to our transformation journey. Successful execution against our plan gives us the confidence to increase our focus on reinvestment toward faster growth as we fuel our team with more resources to unleash the power of our amazing brands, strengthen the innovation machine, and stimulate demand with enhanced end user activation. We believe our actions to reshape, focus and streamline our organization as well as reinvest in our core businesses will enable us to deliver significant shareholder value over the long term via robust organic growth and enhanced profitability. I am proud to be alongside the best people, the best brands, and the most powerful innovation engine in our industry. As we continue to focus on what we can control to be successful, I am confident that we are recreating a significant market share gaining machine. With that, we are now ready for Q&A, Dennis. Dennis Lange : Great. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start Q&A, please. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open. Timothy Wojs : Hey guys. Good morning. Donald Allan : Good morning. Timothy Wojs : At risk of being yelled at, I'm going to try to ask a two-parter. So I guess the first question, just as you're looking at gross margins kind of first half to second half, if, Pat, maybe you could give us some color on the bridge in terms of how you go from kind of low 23s in the first half to that 27% to 29% in the back half, how much of that is production versus some of the cost savings that you're seeing there? And then I guess second, since we've got, Chris, on the call, maybe just hoping to get a little bit of his kind of early thoughts and observations as you've gotten into the business. Patrick Hallinan : You know, I'll start, Tim, with gross margin. It's a meaningful step up, but it's an important part of our journey. And we're confident in delivering it for the back half of this year. A big chunk of it is the roll-off of high-cost inventory. I'd say, you know, the bridge from roughly at 23%, 24% up to 28%-ish number is about 100 points of production curtailment fading away slightly and the balance is a mix of both cost savings generated by our transformation and dissipation of the high-cost inventory over the past, probably, equal parts of each in that regard. Chris Nelson : This is Chris. Tim, thanks for the question. And I just wanted to start by saying how honored I am to join Don and the entire Stanley Black & Decker leadership team to help bring the company's long-term strategic vision of accelerated organic growth to life. As you well know, Don and the team have made meaning -- meaningful progress on this ambitious plan and I'm just grateful for the opportunity to help drive the company's transformation forward. As I've come on board, as you might expect, it's been a lot of taking time to learn and listen. And I got to say, it's been quite a whirlwind thus far in the first six-ish weeks. Then, seven factories spent at least today with every major business unit going through market trends, the products, the product roadmaps for the future, bend all the key design centers in North America, and had several key customer meetings. And through this process, what I'd say is that, the three real key observations and opportunities stand out. First is the long-term commercial opportunities exist due to the impressive strength of Stanley Black & Decker's brands and products. Simply put, our customers really, really like our products and our brands and want to grow with us. And that's something that cannot be underestimated for the future. Secondly is that the innovation engine within Stanley Black & Decker is amazing and I do believe it is a differentiating capability. Our ability to start with -- work with the end-user to understand their environment as well as the issues that they are trying to solve and then rapidly be able to turn that into design and implementation of products and solutions to help our customers solve their problems and become more efficient is really going to be an important future catalyst for growth. And then third is, as I've been out and spent time in the factories and in the operations, seeing the amount of traction that exists on the operations and supply chain transformation. There are obviously real benefits accruing through the P&L and Pat referenced those earlier, but as importantly, I can see the foundation that is putting -- being put in place that will make this a sustainable and long-term opportunity for the company. And it's also clear that the -- that there's ample future runway and that we're in the early innings of the transformation and that the future savings will be able to be reinvested back in the business to continue to fuel growth as well as margin expansion. So really the combination of these three key observations and opportunities really -- it has been very excited as far as the opportunity for long-term value creation within Stanley Black & Decker. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning and welcome to Chris. Maybe just my question was understood just now that bridge from first half to second half of this year, but just wanted to check on any color you could give on the bridge from this year as a whole into next. And I suppose, if we look at your second half guidance for this year, it's about including some sort of outdoor seasonality assumption. It's maybe 3.50 of annualized EPS based off your second half guide at the midpoint. You had talked about a $5-ish EPS for next year previously, so I just wondered sort of any updated thoughts on that EPS step-up into 2024. And sort of related to that, it looks like your inventories will still be well above historical norms at the end of December, but you talk about production normalization during Q4, so I just wanted to sort of square that away when thinking about next year. Thank you. Donald Allan : Thank you for the questions. And I'll kick it off and then pass it over to Pat for a little more detail, as far as our perspective on next year. We have talked about in previous calls a $5 -- or a $4 to $5 range for 2024 for EPS. Given what we're seeing in the back half and what we're currently projecting for revenues, the improvement in the gross margins, we're making some investments in SG&A that will plant some seeds for future share gain activity. We do think we're positioning ourselves to be in that $4 to $5 for next year, depending on a couple of factors. Does the revenue maintain itself or grow? Or do we see continued pressure due to economic reasons? And how much more investment do we want to do to really drive that share gain opportunity across the globe? Those are questions that we'll figure out in the back half of the year. And when we provide guidance in early '24, we'll give more insight, but we think we've built a foundation that allows us to achieve that range I mentioned. I'll pass the inventory portion of the question over to Pat and let him give you a little more sense of where we think we are in the journey of inventory and where we go from here. Patrick Hallinan : Yes, Julian, I'll pick up where Don left off. I think, from an operating performance and productivity range, we're targeting towards that EPS level, but as Don said, as we get to next year's guidance, we'll look at the macro and we'll look at our investment level for long-term growth. And I think that will decide our EPS for next year. In terms of gross margin this year and into next year, following on that opening question, we can really already see on our balance sheet and already in our savings rhythm the gross margin levels that we're projecting for the back half of this year. So those rates of gross margin delivery are, for the most part, on our balance sheet already for this year. And then your question around how do we step that into next year. Think of every one of the next few years going through the end of 2025 as $500 incremental million of COGS savings off of our revenue base. You're talking 200 to 300 basis points a calendar year of gross margin improvement. And so we continue to track on our long-term cost transformation. And so if we finish this year at 28-ish percent gross margin in the back half of the year, you could kind of expect that 200-plus basis point level of gross margin improvement to be carried into next year. And that's the kind of momentum you should be expecting the next couple of years. In terms of inventory, we're going to make significant inventory progress this year, but you're correct to point out that, by the time we get to the end of this year, our absolute inventory dollars at the end of this year will be in the $5 billion-ish range, which is around 155 days-ish range, which is higher than our long-term history of inventory levels, which have obviously changed since we acquired an outdoors business from the legacy Stanley Black & Decker levels, but still below 155. We'll continue to make progress and we will talk about that more specifically when we give guidance for next year, but we will continue to make progress and be working towards a level that is below 150 across a multi or rather below 140 across a multiyear time horizon. Next year, our progress will be balanced against some of our network changes. We are bringing online some new DCs next year and a new DC footprint altogether, so while we'll make some progress next year, it will be balanced against some of the long-term decisions we're making to improve service and costs in our DC footprint. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Donald Allan : Good morning. Nigel Coe : I'll try and make this question a bit punchier. Thanks, guys. And Chris, welcome. Good to hear you. So the EPS, $0.80 for, well, $0.80 roughly for 3Q midpoint. And so I think that implies 4Q down slightly, so just wondering how we should think about that gross margin cadence between 3Q and 4Q. I'd have thought that maybe some of the cost benefits would benefit 4Q more than 3Q. So just maybe just run through that. And then the comment about pricing flat to slightly negative, is that for the whole corporation, or is that just specifically for Tools & outdoor segment? Patrick Hallinan : Yes, Nigel, I'd say all you're seeing in 3Q EPS to 4Q is really just a normal seasonal cadence, right? We tend to ship in, in the third quarter a lot of the product that is sold through the holiday season, so it's just a normal cadence that you would see from one quarter to the next. From a gross margin perspective, they'll roughly be even across quarters, if not the fourth quarter being slightly higher, so the margin journey will be on the right momentum track. And all you're seeing in EPS dollars is seasonality. I think, in terms of pricing, 85% of our business is Tools & Outdoor. And all you're seeing in pricing is the fact that this year we're back to a normal seasonal promotional cadence, especially around the Black Friday time frame, without new kind of gross price increases offsetting that introduction of -- reintroduction, I should say, of a normal promotional cadence. So it's just the dynamic of us re-entering a normal promotional cadence that will potentially take us below flat pricing, but it should be a real small marginal amount. That's all you're seeing with both of those dynamics. Donald Allan : And just a reminder recognizing that, as we launch new products at new price points throughout the year, the impact of the higher price versus the previous product that it's replacing does not flow through that price line, but it does flow through your margins. So you don't necessarily see the full impact of pricing decisions and processes that we have across the company because of that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael Rehaut : All right. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and welcome, Chris. Wanted to dial in a little bit more into the change in your organic growth outlook for Tools & Outdoor. I think you kind of said it was driven by several different factors, softer outlook in outdoor, DIY weakness, channel inventory conservatism. I was hoping if you could kind of bucket those drivers in terms of what's driving the difference, if you can kind of tie it to the difference, I guess, which is maybe 3% or 4% of a change. And also if the POS turning positive, that was kind of part of your prior guidance because you said it could be a potentially positive signal for the back half. If that continues, would that drive any upside to the guidance? Patrick Hallinan : Mike, we obviously had to think of a few moving parts as we outlined the back half of the year. And so I think where I'd start is our primary objective this year is to deliver margin improvement, working capital reduction in cash, obviously. And we want to keep competing in the marketplace. And the second quarter had many dynamics going on. I would say, in the second quarter, we saw consistently weak outdoor, especially for high-price-point items. And we saw the DIY consumer be under a bit more pressure and on the margin both in tools and outdoors and in subsegments of our Industrial business, channel conservancy -- conservatism on inventory. So all of those things were dynamics that played out. We anticipated them in the second quarter. And that's why, when we gave guidance at the end of the first quarter, we softened up our revenue expectations on the second quarter; and they played out about as we expected in the quarter. And we thought it best, given the fact that those dynamics have kind of stabilized and stayed with us, for the most part, to play those out in the back half of the year. And that's the adjustment you saw, so almost all the adjustment in the back half of the year was to anticipate a similar level of consumer price sensitivity with winter outdoor goods, a continued DIY consumer softness predominantly in North America and then channel destocking in our infrastructure business. And I'd say they've all been kind of equal drivers of us taking a couple hundred million dollars out of our back half sales forecast, but I'd say the good news is we feel like right now, absent a new macro change, our demand environment has stabilized. And that demand environment has stabilized around a strong pro and really strong aero and automotive in our Industrial business. Then I don't think there's any kind of new dynamic with the DIY consumer. Our intent is up for when student loan repayments start around October, but absent that bringing a new macro dynamic into the picture, we feel like our demand outlook has stabilized and we're feeling good about our back half. And then Don referenced there have been some bright spots, things like power tool POS at the very end of the quarter. And we'll see. Those things may emerge, I think, throughout this year given the fed actions. I'd say the broader demand environment has actually surprised us in the sense that it hasn't been more challenging. And so hopefully, those positive trends continue, and if they do, they present upside. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is now open. Christopher Snyder : Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the earlier commentary on the bridge into 2024. I understand, if you annualize the back half, you're at $3 EPS, but the back half is a seasonally low point. It feels like, if we adjust for seasonality, we're already closer to $4 of annualized EPS. And you guys also said, next year, it sounds like gross margin up maybe in the low 30s versus the high 20s. That's obviously a very significant EPS tailwind and it feels like that would more than offset the incremental step-up in growth investments, so can you just maybe provide some more color on that? Thank you. Donald Allan : Well, I think what I articulated and Pat added some detail to it and more robust detail to it is a pretty good summary of where we think we are at this point. And you could build a bullish case that the numbers should be higher for next year, but you do have to factor in the fact that we really want to make sure that we continue to invest in certain key things in our company. We have to get more resources out on the field, closer to our end users. We need to have more engineering resources in key pockets to drive additional innovation opportunities. We've talked about electrification. We want to continue to do that in certain categories that are changing very rapidly. We have to continue to invest in that space. There's more investing we need to do on the digital marketing front, around social media and the activities that we do with our products, to really make our end users as fully aware as to the great innovation machine that we have and what we're putting in the marketplace. Those are things that we have to continue to invest in and so we want to strike the right balance in 2024 of earnings in the sense and cash flow of what's the opportunity for growth as we look at the markets and evaluate that later this year going into 2024. We have a good sense of what's going to happen with gross margins, as Pat articulated. And then the other wildcard is really how much do we want to invest to really plant more seeds for share gain opportunities in the future. That's an important part of our business model that's going to ensure that we're successful for the next several decades, and we want to make sure we do it in the right way and the right level of balance. And that's why we think, as you think about next year, that range of $4 to $5 probably makes sense. If we change our perspective because of market conditions or how much we want to invest, we'll provide that as soon as possible, but I think it's the right way to think about next year at this stage. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Nicole DeBlase : Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys. Donald Allan : Good morning Nicole DeBlase : Maybe just a couple of follow-ups from prior questions that were asked. So on pricing, can you just characterize the competitive environment that you're seeing? Anything concerning out there? And then with respect to the channel inventory dynamics in the tools business, I think you guys talked about some channel adjustments this quarter. Is the expectation that, that kind of continues into the back half? Where are your inventories versus where you would like them to be in the channel? That would be great. Thank you. Donald Allan : Sure. So I'll take the pricing question and I'll pass the channel inventory question over to Pat. I think where we are is, we're seeing a lot of different things occurring around deflation in the freight space. So I think, when we look at freight, we've all seen freight costs have gone down dramatically. We're experiencing that. We're seeing that benefit in our P&L and we'll continue to try to leverage that opportunity as much as possible. On the metals side and commodity space, we're seeing a little bit of indication that things are starting to pull back, as far as commodity prices. And so we're chasing that opportunity, but overall the commodity basket for us is not moving down dramatically at this stage. Now we are pursuing these opportunities to ensure that we actually get the benefit when they do emerge later this year or into next year, depending on how that plays out, but also we have to recognize that we probably won't see much of that benefit here in 2023 just given the level of inventory we have on our books. And that will get hung up in the inventory and will read through eventually in 2024, so the question then becomes what does that mean to pricing. And so what adjustments do we need to make? What's happening in the market? And at this point, we feel like our pricing is where it needs to be versus market conditions and the competitors. We tend to want to be, especially with brands like DEWALT, at a premium versus many of our competitors. And we feel like right now the pricing position is in a healthy place, and so we don't see any need for any adjustments associated with that. If deflation becomes a bigger number as we go into 2024, we will continue to look at that and evaluate that. However, we do have to remember that, as we went through this historical inflationary cycle, we did not get 100% price recovery on that. It took many quarters for the pricing actions to get into our customers and so we experienced a lot of margin pain in that transition period. And so there has to be a tail at the back end associated with this deflationary cycle, whatever it is. And we're going to work with our customers in a balanced way to do the right thing for ourselves, our company and for them. And we'll continue to take that approach, as we've done in the past, and we think it's the right approach for this particular cycle. Pat, do you want to talk about where we are with channel inventory and where we're going? Patrick Hallinan : Yes. Nicole, channel inventories. We look at our current level of channel inventories relative to history. We're very much at or right around normal levels of channel inventory. And so I think, if there wasn't macro uncertainty or if short-term rates weren't as high as they are, we would be biased to stay where we are or to the upside, but I think, because of the rate picture in particular, with our channel partners paying much more in short-term rates to support their inventory and the fact there is macro uncertainty, their bias is to keep things low and, if not, to try to find new lows. We don't think there's big moves out there ahead of us. It's something very modest. And I would say our back half guidance anticipates somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 million to $100 million of inventory reduction in our guidance, as we've talked here today, and we think that's a pretty good number for the back half of the year. I mean obviously it could range outside of that if the macro environment changes, but that's what we've considered for the back half of the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Zelman & Associates. Your line is now open. Adam Baumgarten : Hey, good morning. Donald Allan : Good morning. Adam Baumgarten : Can you just talk about how demand trended throughout the quarter into July? It seems like it built throughout the quarter. And the July commentary is pretty encouraging. Just maybe some additional color there would be helpful. Donald Allan : Well, I think the markets are -- do have some volatility to them. However, when you step back and look at the trends that have been emerging in the first six months of 2023, we all know it was a very challenging outdoor season. And everyone in the industry experienced it. We experienced it to. And the higher-priced ticket items, as I mentioned in my presentation, continue to be a pressure point. There's no doubt that the outdoor business went through a bubble during the pandemic. And there was a lot of purchasing activity because people were at home, and we're starting to see the back-end effect of that here in -- we experienced some of it last year and we're experiencing more here again in '23, and then we'll see what '24 brings in the future. The trends in POS continue to be positive, and I said that in my comments. July has been a good start to the quarter. At this point, it's not something that is an indication that we already feel like we're going to outperform expectations. As Pat said, it's a potential upside for us to evaluate and monitor as we go throughout the summer. And we'll see where things are trending, but the consumer continues to shift a lot of money away from home improvement and we just have to make sure that we continue to monitor that and see what happens. So I look at it as an opportunity and a positive that, hopefully, evolves as the back half plays out, but I don't want to get too excited about three or four weeks of activity at this stage. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for their time and participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me, if you have further questions. Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker\u2019s 2023 third quarter webcast. On the webcast in addition to myself is Don Allan, President and CEO; Chris Nelson, COO, EVP, and President of Tools and Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan, EVP and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning\u2019s webcast will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today. This morning, Don, Chris, and Pat will review our 2023 third quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It\u2019s therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan. Don Allan : Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Stanley Black & Decker\u2019s third quarter performance reflects the continued successful advancement of our strategic business transformation. Our focused execution resulted in improvements versus prior year in adjusted gross margin and earnings per share, as well as free cash flow. Reflecting on our journey over the last five quarters, we have made significant progress. One, our cost and inventory position is healthier behind the momentum of our supply chain transformation and we are confident in the runway for this to continue. Two, our execution is stronger and the results now demonstrate the focus across the organization to enhance the customer experience and improve our financial position. Three, our performance today provides a solid foundation for the additional investments we are launching in innovation and market activation to capture the compelling long-term growth opportunities in the markets we serve. Four, our view is that the markets will remain dynamic. Our focus is on delivering best-in-class product innovation through our portfolio of world class brands, implementing cost efficiency measures within our control and driving share gain in our core markets. All aim to further improve margin, earnings and cash flow. While there are many important steps ahead of us on our journey, I am confident that we have the right strategy, a highly capable and motivated leadership team, and a strong competitive position to successfully execute our transformation. Shifting now to our third quarter performance. Revenue was $4 billion, which was down versus the prior year primarily due to lower Outdoor and DIY volume. The demand for our Pro Tools, as well as automotive and aerospace fasteners remained healthy and demonstrated growth in the quarter. Across our end markets, the U.S. retail point-of-sale for our Tools and Outdoor products remained in a growth position this quarter versus 2019 levels. As we assess our competitive positions and demand trends, we believe that we are stabilizing our share position in a mixed market environment, while we continue to invest in market activation and field resources to drive future share gains. Our Global Cost Reduction Program delivered $215 million of pretax run rate savings in the quarter, on track for the expected $2 billion run rate savings by the end of 2025. Adjusted gross margin rose to 27.6%, a 400-basis-point sequential improvement and 290 basis points favorable as compared to last year. The benefits from our inventory optimization and supply chain transformation are now clearly being reflected in our performance. As we navigate uncertain market conditions, we are continuing to focus on what is within our control to improve our margins. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect additional sequential and year-over-year gross margin gains. We delivered approximately $300 million of inventory reduction this quarter, which brings us to $1.7 billion reduction since mid-2022 when we started this journey. This contributed to over $360 million of Q3 free cash flow generation, which supported our quarterly dividend and $285 million of debt reduction in the quarter. Benefits from lower supply chain costs contributed to third quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $1.05, which was better than our plan. Our year-to-date performance supports increasing our 2023 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $1.10 up to $1.40, which would be up $0.25 at the midpoint. I want to thank our 50,000 plus employees around the world for their focus, dedication and passion that contributed to another successful step forward in the third quarter. Our progress is encouraging and I am confident that by executing our strategy, we are positioning the company to deliver higher levels of organic growth, profitability and cash flow, as well as strong long-term shareholder returns. Now shifting to our third quarter segment results. I will discuss our Industrial business performance and then pass it to Chris Nelson to review the Tools and Outdoor results. Third quarter Industrial revenue declined 4% versus last year, as price realization and currency were more than offset by lower volume and a 3-point impact from our Q3 2022 Oil and Gas business divestiture. We improved Industrial adjusted operating margin by 110 basis points versus prior year, driven by continued price realization and cost actions to deliver adjusted operating margin of 12.2% in the quarter. This represents strong execution and continued year-over-year margin expansion for our Industrial team. Within this segment Engineered Fastening organic revenues were up 6%, including aerospace growth of 29% and auto growth of 9%, as we continue to capture the strong cyclical recoveries in these markets, which was partially offset by what occurred in industrial fastening. Our Attachment Tool business experienced organic revenue declines, primarily as a result of customer destocking to normalize their inventory levels. The long-term fundamentals for growth remain solid in all these businesses and we believe the temporary channel inventory destocking in Attachment Tool will be complete as we exit 2023. I want to thank the Industrial business for their strong execution. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted operating margin for the segment. We are excited by the runway for growth, share gain and operating leverage in these businesses. I will now turn the call over to Chris to review our Tools and Outdoor performance. Chris Nelson : Thank you, Don. And good morning everyone. I am now at the 4.5-month mark at Stanley Black & Decker and this period has really reinforced my excitement about the future for this business. I have spent my time with end-users, customers and our passionate and highly capable Tools and Outdoor organization. We have iconic brands such as DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN, Stanley and Cub Cadet, a strong pipeline of innovation, and customers and users who are eager for our newest products. We remain focused on capturing that opportunity. We are rapidly making progress with our transformation. The organization remains committed to supporting the necessary cost efficiencies as we prioritize the additional investments in innovation, brand support and commercial resources that will be most impactful to reaccelerate growth and share gain in the market. Now turning to the Tools and Outdoor third quarter performance. Total revenue was $3.4 billion, down 5% organically versus prior year as a result of lower consumer Outdoor and DIY market demand. Our Tools SPUs in aggregate were positive organically in the quarter, excluding the Russian business exit, while Outdoor, was down 23% consistent with our expectations. Price for the segment was down 2 points in the period, as we successfully regained margin accretive cordless promotions consistent with historical activity. We made substantial progress in improving adjusted operating margin to 9.3%, this was a sequential step up of 480 basis points and 250 basis points better than last year. This improvement was driven by reduced sell-through of high cost inventory, supply chain transformation savings and reduced shipping costs, which were partially offset by lower organic revenue. In terms of performance by region, North America was down mid-single digits organically similar to the overall segment North America Tools organic growth was positive, while Outdoor declined. U.S. retail point-of-sale for the quarter remained above pre-pandemic 2019 levels supported by strength in professional demand and price. Third quarter POS for DEWALT was positive versus last year, supported by promotions, our pro-inspired new product offerings and sustain professional demand. Our European organic revenue was down 3% with bright spots from double-digit organic growth in the U.K. and low single-digit growth in the Nordics. We are leveraging targeted programs to capture professional share with DEWALT cordless tools. In emerging markets, we grew mid-single digits organically, excluding the impact from the Russia business exit. Including this impact, organic sales declined 4%. Solid emerging markets performance was led by Latin America, which is now recorded four consecutive quarters of organic growth. We have seen notable strength in Brazil, particularly within the professional channels. Moving to our strategic business unit performance. The hand tools business grew 2% organically versus prior year. This includes mid-single-digit organic growth in North America and Latin America, supported by expanded offerings at our retailers and strong new product sales. Power Tools declined 2% organically, pressured by Consumer Tools. Pro driven momentum coupled with positive impacts from a healthier supply chain is supporting enhanced service levels and promotional opportunities. Transitioning to Outdoor, organic revenue declined due to market demand choppiness as the industry resets from the pandemic era. This resulted in fewer shipments in the quarter as there are elevated inventory levels globally impacting replenishment cycles. Despite the current market environment, we are excited about the long-term opportunity and bringing leading innovation to Outdoor across our powerful brands. I want to thank the team for their strong execution in the quarter as we continue to focus on winning with our customers and capturing this amazing growth margin and shareholder return opportunity. Turning to the next slide, I would like now to highlight a few examples of how we are evolving our trade focused offerings and Cordless Outdoor expansion. With Professional Trades torque cordless impact wrench in its class, ideal for use in heavy-duty applications. We also introduced the world\u2019s first battery charger box, The DEWALT TOUGHSYSTEM 2.0 Dual-Port Charger. Users now can protect store and charge dual batteries in a durable weather resistant container to keep professional\u2019s productive despite rough job site conditions. In Outdoor as we gear up for winter, DEWALT has entered the snow category with the 60-volt MAX Single Stage Snow Blower. Powered by two flexible batteries, it is engineered to tackle tough demands and breakdown heavy wet or pack snow. Our Pro inspired innovation roadmap will continued to introduce solutions across our categories that enhanced safety on the job site while elevating power and performance. Now changing gears into DEWALT\u2019s new involvement with our social responsibility efforts, we are working to close the trade skills gap and shaping the future of construction technology and the electrical and plumbing trades. In the third quarter, we opened the 2023 DEWALT Grow the Trades Grant and Trades Scholarship program. These initiatives provide non-profits with the necessary resources to train, reskill and prepare tomorrow\u2019s trades people by directly supporting end-user trade education. This is a great example of our broader commitment to invest $30 million to grow trade skills by 2027. Now I will turn the call back to Don. Don Allan : Thanks, Chris. I appreciate the energy and perspective that you have brought to the team and I am excited to continue our company\u2019s strategic business transformation with you as a key leader on our strong management team. Turning to the next slide, I would like to reinforce the focus areas across our company\u2019s transformation. One, streamlining and simplifying the organization, as well as shifting resources to prioritize investments that we believe have a positive and more direct impact for our end-users and various channel customers. Two, accelerating the operations and supply chain transformation to return adjusted gross margin to historical 35% plus levels, while improving fill rate to better match inventory with customer demand. Three, prioritizing cash flow generation and inventory optimization. And then four, continuing to advance innovation, electrification and global market penetration to achieve organic revenue growth of 2 times to 3 times the market. We believe this strategy will ensure our best in class product innovation is maintained, while we continue to meet or exceed the expectations of our end-users and we dramatically improved the channel customer experience. In parallel, we will maximize cost opportunities within our control to fuel investment as we deliver our margin, earnings and cash flow goals. As our margins expand, our focus is to accelerate share gains. We are prioritizing innovation and market activation investments across our powerful brands and targeting the best prospects to maximize share gain growth and return. We continue to benefit from being a simpler, more focused company across Tools and Outdoor and Industrial, and we expect over the next 12 months to 18 months, we will find opportunities for further simplification across our businesses. As we evaluate where to invest and the best ways to maximize shareholder return, we will continue to take a pragmatic view of our portfolio of businesses. Our track record demonstrates we will act decisively when the time is right on those portfolio decisions. I will now turn the call over to Pat to share the latest progress updates on our transformation, financial insights on the quarter and our revised outlook for the year. Pat? Pat Hallinan : Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. We continue to generate strong transformation results and go-forward momentum. Our cost reduction program delivered approximately $215 million of pretax run rate cost savings in the quarter. Bringing our aggregate savings to approximately $875 million since program inception. This positions us well to deliver our slightly exceed our $1 billion run rate savings target this year and to deliver $2 billion run rate savings by 2025. As it relates to the supply chain transformation, strategic sourcing initiatives remain the largest contributor to supply chain savings since program inception. The early actions focused on strategic components and logistics, as well as other areas. We have now covered approximately two thirds of the targeted procurement spend, establishing a carry on savings trajectory consistent with that contemplated in the 2024 program target. Our supply chain management and engineering teams will continue to drive sourcing improvement through 2025 and beyond. Activating our Operations Excellence program has also contributed significant savings this year. In the plants where this has been activated, we are seeing increased productivity, leveraging lean manufacturing principles. Our footprint related projects are progressing on schedule with initial savings to begin this year. As it relates to complexity reduction, our teams are assisting customers as they transition to replacement products with the goal of exiting 30,000 SKUs by the end of 2023. We are confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margins to 35% or greater. These actions are creating the flexibility to fund additional organic growth investments in our core business. Turning to our inventory reduction in gross margin improvement. We reduced inventory by approximately $300 million bringing our year-to-date progress to approximately $880 million. The third quarter inventory reduction supported the generation of approximately $360 million of free cash flow in the period, resulting in one of the strongest third quarter cash generations in the company\u2019s history. We have reduced inventory by $1.7 billion since the middle of 2022. We achieved this through improved supply chain conditions, strategic inventory management and the planned production curtailments initiated during the back half of 2022. We expect modest inventory improvement in the fourth quarter, which would bring our full year 2023 inventory reduction to at or near our 2023 objective of $1 billion as we prepare for next year\u2019s Outdoor season and supply chain network changes. Inventory reduction will be a major contributor to our full year free cash flow target of $600 million to $900 million. Looking to 2024 and beyond, we expect the additional multiyear inventory reduction opportunity to be at or above $1 billion. We expect to pursue further inventory reduction at the pace of $400 million to $500 million per year. We will balance our goal of inventory efficiency with ensuring sufficient working capital. Our priority for capital deployment is to fund our longstanding commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and to further strengthen our balance sheet. Shifting to profitability. We recorded adjusted gross margin of 27.6%, up 290 basis points versus prior year and improving 400 basis points versus the second quarter. This is the third consecutive quarter that we delivered sequential gross margin improvement. Year-over-year expansion was driven by lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation benefits and reduce shipping costs. All of which more than offset the impact of lower organic revenue. Moving forward, we expect continued adjusted gross margin rate expansion driven by the benefits of the supply chain transformation. Our guidance calls for adjusted gross margin to incrementally improve again in the fourth quarter. Now that the high cost inventory has turn through the P&L, we expect to continue to deliver expanding adjusted gross margin into the first half and full year 2024 supported by the success of our supply chain transformation. Achieving adjusted gross margins approaching 28% in the third quarter was a significant milestone on our journey to restore 35% plus adjusted gross margin. The momentum of our supply chain transformation is translating to sustainable upward progression in our margins and cash flow, and will provide resources to fund investment to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth toward our goal of 2 times to 3 times the market. Now turning to our 2023 guidance. Our expected GAAP earnings per share range has been revised to negative $1.45 to negative $1 from negative $1.25 to negative $0.50, charges primarily from the global supply chain transformation and Outdoor business integration. The current pretax estimate of acquisition related and other charges is now $425 million to $450 million, with approximately half of these expenses being non-cash. Based on the strength of the third quarter, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $1.10 to $1.40 from our previous guidance range of $0.70 to $1.30. We delivered a strong third quarter cash performance and are maintaining our full year free cash flow target of $600 million to $900 million. We expect fourth quarter cash flow to be supported by positive cash earnings, inventory reduction and the typical seasonal receivables reduction in Tools and Outdoor. The organic growth outlook for the year is unchanged with the total company expected to be down mid-single digits. This implies a revenue midpoint of $15.9 billion for the year and includes estimated risks for auto strikes and continued infrastructure customer destocking. Turning to important remaining elements of guidance. Our expectation is for production to continue to normalize in the fourth quarter. We remain disciplined and flexible in our approach to invest, to drive organic growth and share gains. Our outlook assumes approximately $125 million of annualized innovation and market activation investment with a goal to ultimately deploy $300 million to $500 million over the next three years. We expect fourth quarter adjusted operating profit to approximate $290 million with adjusted gross margin to sequentially improve to the 28% zone both the business. With that, I will now pass the call back over to Don. Don Allan : Thank you, Pat. We are pleased to report another quarter of progress on our journey of transforming Stanley Black & Decker. Consistent successful execution against our plan gives us the confidence to increase investments, which will accelerate organic growth behind our most powerful brands. As we continue to focus on what we can control to be successful, I am confident that we are creating a stronger and more focused company with our great people, amazing brands and industry leading end-user inspired innovation. We believe the outcome of our transformation will produce sustainable market share gaining machine. With that, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis? Dennis Lange : Great. Thanks Don. Shannon, we can now start Q&A, please. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. And great to hear that update from Chris on the momentum in the Tools business. Maybe my question just around slide nine and some of the commentary there on margins. So, I guess, one is just, it looks like the gross margins up sequentially in Q4, but sort of operating margin down somewhat. So maybe just any sort of moving parts within that worth calling out. And then you talk about the gross margin moving higher sequentially into the first half of next year. So maybe you put that in context for us in terms of what does that tell us about the confidence in that sort of $4 to $5 of EPS number that you have mentioned in the past is perhaps some kind of framework for earnings next year? Thank you. Don Allan : Thanks for the long multiple questions there, Julian. But good questions, because there are -- the things that we are very focused on as far as our margin rate improvement we are really pleased with what occurred in Q3 and what we believe will play out in Q4. And I am going to ask Pat to give us more color on your questions around margin and then tying it into the $4 to $5 for next year, we still feel that that is a good range and potential outcome for us. And Pat will give a little more color on as well. So, Pat. Pat Hallinan : Yeah. Hey, Julian. Our focus is going to remain margins and cash generation until we are back to the operating model that business has traditionally had. I\u2019d say, gross margins you saw, both effects, the effects of the program driving the cost savings we expected to the tune of, one, 100 basis points to 150 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. Deflation also help in the quarter mostly from shipping coming off the balance sheet of another 100 basis points to 150 basis points. And then broader high cost inventory coming off the balance sheet of around 300 basis points. And that was our expectation. It\u2019s great to see the teams working hard together to deliver the program on cadence, but as we have been telegraphing to investors, we could see the rate at which high cost inventory was coming off the balance sheet and that came well within our expectations and drove the important gross margin expansion. From here we have a pathway to 35%, obviously, the pathway going forward, it\u2019s not going to be perfectly linear, but it\u2019s certainly going to be more in the range of 50 basis points to 100 basis points a quarter on gross margin. As our operating margin question, that had more to do with just, it was about $200 plus million less revenue in this quarter and that was really the driver of the operating margin difference as we continue to invest in the business. And we are going to go forward both in the fourth quarter and as we head into a dynamic 2024 focused on continued gross margin expansion and cash generation. We are going to be investing for growth and that\u2019s part of what we are doing in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s what we are going to plan to do in 2024 as well. But we will be mindful of the macro environment and what that means for cash delivery and de-levering along that route. And the $4 to $5, I would say, given the performance of the business in the back half of the year in a dynamic market. I would still say, we see the $4 to $5 as a reasonable range. Certainly, it\u2019s dependent on the macro and deflation versus inflationary environment. I would say that, the $4 to $5 anticipates a stable or improving macro. If you are at the stable side of the macro, you are probably on the lower side of the range and if you are at an improving macro, you kind of go towards the higher side of that range. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open. Tim Baird, your line is now open. Please check your mute button. Dennis Lange : Tim? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and hello, Chris. Good to hear your voice again. The -- I guess, maybe a little bit of a multi partner also, but just kind of thinking about, as you pivot from just kind of outright cost reduction to reinvesting for growth and the like. Does all most of this reinvestment happened inside of COGS and the gross margin discussion. How much of it ends up kind of in selling sales force, things that you are doing on kind of developing the trades that you mentioned. And maybe just as part of that selling related question, maybe just a little bit more color on what you are seeing on promotion and just kind of the general pricing environment in the market? Thank you. Don Allan : Yeah. Jeff, I will ask Chris to give a little more color on that. It clearly is going to be heavily weighted to SG&A and selling resources and activities. But let\u2019s give Chris an opportunity to give you more color on that. Chris? Chris Nelson : Yeah, Jeff. Thanks a lot. Nice hearing from you again. And what I\u2019d say is that per Don\u2019s comments, as we think about how we are going to move forward, and I would say, have focused investments in the business in the areas that we believe will drive the most leverage, making sure that we see which brands we want to invest in and what levers we want to pull there. And obviously, we have seen the strength of the Pro and there was we did, as far as near-term look, DEWALT was a positive story in the quarter, we need to keep on gathering steam with that. What I\u2019d say is that, as far as in the investment buckets and where we are thinking we could have the most leverage. Certainly having the right products for the professional end-user is a large emphasis for us. We referenced a few of the launches that we have in the near-term, we are going to continue to double down on those types of investments for the Pro end-user, because of the strength of the brand, as well as what we see in the marketplace. Similarly, we want to make sure that we have the right commercial resources in the right markets on the ground with our customers, working with them on ways that we can grow together, because we really think that there is some great opportunities in the area -- in that area. So, that\u2019s where really out of the gate, the emphasis is going to lie. As far as your other question on where we see, what we saw in the promotional activities? We are -- we did reference that we are going to be back in returning to traditional levels of promotion and we did that in Q3 and it started our quarter out strong and we are happy to be back in that promotional mindset, because it is an important part of the business and we think it is healthy and accretive for the business going forward. Now, we also are certainly going to supplement that with the new launches and we are going to lean into the new launches going into the back half of the year to continue that growth. But all in all, we are seeing the, in Q3, our sell-through was in line with our expectations. As far as pricing, we see disciplined in the marketplace as far as no deep discounting and we are going to make sure and continue in our healthy and traditional promotional mix. But then, like I said, also be driving growth organically through leaning into the opportunities that we see with the Pro. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Appreciate it. I just wanted to kind of understand some of the puts and takes on the updated guidance if I may. Kind of what really in effect drove the upside in the third quarter and it seems like, on an EPS basis year in effect reiterating the implied fourth quarter guide. I think you referenced investing in growth. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s something that maybe perhaps you are increasing in the fourth quarter relative to prior expectations. But would love to understand that dynamic of what drove the 3Q upside and why you are reiterating 4Q. And also, to that point, the reiteration of the free cash flow guidance relative to the raising of the EPS guidance. What\u2019s the bridge there as well? Thank you. Don Allan : Yeah, Mike. Good morning. Third quarter was a strong quarter for us. Our sales came in roughly as we were expecting and we drove the EPS be on the strength of gross margin performance in SG&A management. The gross margin is a factor of the program running a bit ahead of both pace in absolute dollar generation and that drove strength in the quarter from a gross margin perspective. Our teams are managing SG&A thoughtfully in the macro environment. Also, as you know, Chris and team came on Board and spent part of the quarter kind of revisiting current and future year priorities, there was probably a bit of SG&A that will shift from the third quarter to the fourth quarter that helped out the third quarter net. As we head into the fourth quarter, the topline is probably a bit softer, probably to the tune of around $100-ish million or so versus the expectations we would have had a quarter ago. Most of that is baking in the trends in Outdoors and Attachment Tools that we saw in the third quarter and also an expectation that unsettled UAW strike with at least two of the big auto manufacturers could pose some headwinds to our fastening business. So a softness in the fourth quarter at the topline slightly is one of the reasons that the guidance in absolute terms in the fourth quarter is there. And then we are investing, as I mentioned, some will be a little bit of a shift of SG&A from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, but we are at a point where we are confident in our margin and cash generation trajectory. We need to start investing for growth and we are doing that in the fourth quarter. And those two things together keep the EPS amount constant in the fourth quarter. And then on free cash flow, you are much of this year\u2019s free cash flow is generated by working capital dynamics and much of those dynamics are continuing to play out according to plan and forecast and that\u2019s largely why the free cash flow guide stays where it is for the year and the quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open. Tim Wois, your line is open, please check your mute button. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is now open. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the prior commentary of about 50 bps to 100 bps of quarterly gross margin improvement. It seems that would imply 2024 exiting up around 300 basis points year-on year at the midpoint. So, obviously, very strong growth next year. Can you just maybe talk a little bit about what that assumes from both macro and volume standpoint and also from a cost interest standpoint. I guess metal and freight maybe up? Thank you. Don Allan : Yeah. We will give detailed 2024 guidance at the end of the year when we do our fourth quarter. But I can point in a few directions, especially around the gross margin, because it\u2019s such an important point of our progress and where our focused energy is. I think on a full year basis for 2024, we would expect full year gross margins around 30%, potentially a little bit higher than 30%, obviously, that means exiting above 30%, because we come in somewhere in the 28%-ish range. And so, I think you have it right, it is an exit rate, that\u2019s going to be somewhere in the low 30%s, we will update to what degree that is in January. I think when you talk about the macro -- the macro, while there certainly a dynamic environment, it\u2019s probably given all that\u2019s going on in the world held in a bit stronger than we would expect and a lot of what\u2019s going on in our business is kind of the resetting of inventories and channel this year, the resetting of the Outdoor business post-COVID and a little bit of the shift that consumers have from buying goods to buying services. And so I think the topline next year, we are expecting a similar stablish type macro environment with some dynamic elements around it, but it\u2019s really going to depend on our volume next year, is really going to depend on has the consumer stabilized and the rebalance between goods and services and has the outdoor business stabilized post-COVID. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe : Oh! Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the question. It seems like everyone is getting in three or four questions into one question. I will try and keep a bit simpler. But maybe no, who knows. I am just thinking, in the sort of a flat macro, given the imagery destocked especially in the Attachments, and obviously, Outdoor. Even unstable macro, do you think you can grow topline in that kind of setup? And then maybe my follow on question within the question is, what does the write-down at the Irwin and Troy-Bilt tell us about those brands. I mean, is this part of the SKU reduction initiative. Any kind of like insights into what\u2019s driving those write-downs? Don Allan : Yeah. I think, the -- I will start with the brand question and navigate to the macro question related to next year and thoughts about could we grow our topline. The Irwin and Troy-Bilt brands that are very good brands and they are outstanding brands in our portfolio. But as we have continued to focus on the simplification of our company, there\u2019s a lot of aspects of that. There\u2019s the aspects of how we do business with our customers and our suppliers. How we work internally in a more efficient and effective way. But there\u2019s also looking at the simplification of the brands we have and how we go to market, and where we can effectively utilize them the most. We clearly have three very powerful brands that are incredibly important to our strategy in DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN and Stanley, and those would be focal points for that strategy going forward. But as you get into the next tier of brands like Irwin or LENOX or Troy-Bilt, et cetera. We will utilize them effectively but we will utilize them in a more simplified way and then you really seeing the impact of that with the adjustment to the valuation of what was on our balance sheet. It\u2019s really nothing more than that. There\u2019s a little bit of the SKU rationalization impact in there, but I think it\u2019s more of the strategic way we are going to utilize it going forward. Looking at the macro for next year, I mean, Pat gave really good answers to our view is things are not, they are kind of mixed and it\u2019s dynamic. That\u2019s the way it is today and then we are kind of going into next year thinking that\u2019s going to be similar to that. We have pockets of strength like our Professional Tool business. We have weak points in Outdoor and consumer trends. We get strength in aerospace and auto in our fastener and Industrial businesses. And we have some destocking happening in some other portions of our Industrial business and probably will be behind us as we go into next year. So, we think it\u2019s going to be mix like that throughout most of next year. Could things get worse? Possibly. Could things be better? Yes, that\u2019s possible, too. I think we are all watching the Fed to see what it does related to interest rates. If interest rates do not continue to rise, then I think we feel like there will be a stable environment that we can manage through that will be somewhat consistent to this. And if it is stable, can we grow? Well, we are investing for the main objective and reason to is to focus and gaining market share. And we have had a long history of gaining market share at Stanley Black & Decker. And we went through a period of time, in particular, in late 2021 and 2022, where we felt the impact of the shortage of semiconductors that really put us in a position where we actually lost some market share and we have been pretty frank and clear about that. But we are positioning ourselves again to get back to gaining share and we believe we stabilized a lot of that at this stage, and these investments that Chris referred to and Pat in their commentary are things that we believe will allow us to grow above the market, whatever the market is. And if the market is negative, we will -- we won\u2019t be slight as much negative, if it\u2019s stable or neutral will probably grow a little bit. And that\u2019s really the goal and objective that we are going after, and over time, we would like to, as we have said be able to say that we can grow somewhere between 2 times to 3 times the market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is now open. Rob Wertheimer : Thank you. I\u2019d actually like to start where you just ended on, on market share and trends there. And my question, I guess, specifically, there has been obviously a change in the mix of construction in North America or you have larger projects, major projects, whenever. Maybe housing is holding in there. I am little bit curious if there are any margin or market share or go-to-market impacts from that, maybe have more Pro, maybe have more high need, high reliability, maybe not. I am just curious about whether that has any impact on the business? Thank you. Don Allan : Thanks, Rob. Yeah. I think, the -- we are probably over using the word dynamic, but I think it\u2019s an appropriate word to describe the current market situation, because there\u2019s a lot of different shifts happening. There is certainly a great deal of construction activity, but it\u2019s shifted quite a bit from what it was 18 months, 24 months ago where it was very heavily residential focused and commercial focus to some extent and then we went through the pandemic and the commercial activity slowed down. So, we continue to see different types of shifts. We do not see radical shifts in our business model though or how we go to market at this stage. One of the really great things about Stanley Black & Decker is that we have over the years been very focused on what are the right channels to the end-user. The professional that ultimately is the ones the individuals that use our tools and because of that history and those channels that we have very strong presence in not only North-America, but the European markets, as well as emerging markets around the globe. We have their presence to be able to ensure that we are meeting the needs of the end-user and if the end-user is shifting to e-commerce, we have the ability to serve them an e-commerce as well or if they continue to want to go to the traditional distributor that they have spent time with, we sell through that channel. So I think we are positioned well for whatever may happen in the future. Clearly, there will be a shift -- continued shift over time, we are more and more people focus on e-commerce activity. We positioned ourselves well over the last decade to be able to continue to address that. I think you will see more of that shifting as you get into some of these commercial and industrial channels with larger distributors as they built some e-commerce platforms during the pandemic to deal with a period of time where people didn\u2019t want to get close to each other and we have been able to address that as well. So we are going to continue to do that. They will probably be an area that we will invest in overtime to make sure that we meet those needs of the channel. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Joe O'Dea: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on the sort of returns targets around investment spend. And so when you think about investing $125 million, how do you think about the returns there and tracking them. And so, both from the market outgrowth, as well as the evidence of that. So when you spend $125 million, how do you go about tracking that it\u2019s actually achieving the targeted outcomes? Don Allan : Yeah. Joe, what I would say is, long-term we want to have very productive investments in SG&A that\u2019s mostly where these investments we are talking to you are centered. And our long-term financial algorithm probably has SG&A somewhere around that 19%-ish of the net sales. And so long-term every time we put a $1 into SG&A, you need to be getting more than five of those out of the topline at a gross margin that are above our fleet average and that\u2019s certainly as we go into these investments, very, very much be intend. The pace at which that happens, obviously, can differ depending on where you are in your certain competitive dynamics of which investments you are making at a given point in time. But that\u2019s our financial algorithm. Right now and maybe, Chris, might want to add some things to this, but our focus right now is on reenergizing the engineering in innovation engine and then reenergizing the activation around our pre-existing marketing investments in around that innovation. Those two together are probably 80% to 90% of the investment per spend that we are making and it\u2019s all to get the growth of the biggest brands getting back to above market growth. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything you want to add to that, Chris? Chris Nelson : No. I just think that the comment that Don made about the three flagship brands that we have. And it\u2019s not only about net incremental investment, but it\u2019s also taking a look and seeing how we can reallocate existing dollars towards those three priority brands and the key initiatives that we see with the Pro end-user, as well as making sure that we have the right commercial resources in place to be driving those returns as well. So we are thinking at -- looking at the entirety of the spend and not just the net incremental and then driving that into measurable initiatives to be able to make sure that we are getting the types of returns above fleet average that Pat referenced. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Nicole DeBlase : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Don Allan : Good morning. Nicole DeBlase : Just wanted to ask one on pricing. So I think originally you guys were kind of expecting flat to slightly down in the quarter for Tools, obviously, a little bit weaker than that. Just maybe a little bit more color on this from a competitive perspective and your thought process on pricing into 4Q and perhaps thoughts around 2024? Thank you. Don Allan : Go ahead, Pat. Pat Hallinan : Yeah. Nicole, I mean, purely from a guidance and actuals perspective, I\u2019d say, very much within the bounds. I\u2019d say the only dynamic that played out a bit differently in the quarter is the promotional mix around margin accretive Power Tools was a bit higher, which was net accretive to the P&L, you saw the gross margin performance in the quarter. It just as you reconcile and provide out the actual color and pricing was a little bit more than we would have expect. But I think that\u2019s kind of on the margin of just how promotional activity unfolds in the quarter. But I and Chris may want to add to this. I don\u2019t think we see any kind of change to the competitive dynamics inclusive of the pricing related to the competitive dynamics. Chris Nelson : No. As I said earlier, I think, we are -- we see fairly good stability in the pricing and not a lot of competitive deep discounting and our -- just to reiterate, our focus is to be healthily involved in the promotional aspect of the business, because we think it\u2019s important to have those key brands and products out in front of our end-users and our customers and we intend to continue at kind of those traditional levels. But more importantly, we are looking through our innovations and how we think about launching new products to be able to continue to supplement and grow those margins as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Don Allan : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : So, you talked about getting a normalized production in the fourth quarter. I am curious, maybe two-part question, do you expect to stay at normalized production throughout 2024 and then as you kind of think about maybe some of the one-time hit to your profitability in 2023. What -- can you quantify whether it\u2019s the inventory piece, the production piece, how much does that help the bridge for 2024? Don Allan : Yeah. I will let Pat give it a little more color on that, but we are pleased that we have gotten to a more stable manufacturing level here in the fourth quarter. And at this point the view of next year is, if we assume the environment that Pat described around the $45 of EPS, that-- for in that range, because of where the macro is we would expect it to continue to be stable. We will continue to focus on optimizing inventory next year. So Pat, maybe give it a little more color on that. Pat Hallinan : Yeah. Yeah. I think, Joe, we certainly feel like we have opportunity to get inventory much leaner, right, probably to the tune of $1 billion to $1.5 billion over the next two years to three years at a pace of $400 million to $500 million a year. I think as it relates to the production normalization, you asked about and as it relates to kind of one-time items in the cost structure. I\u2019d say for the most part 2024, we expect production to be normalized. Obviously, as we and the rest of the Outdoor industry find the new kind of post-COVID Outdoor base, we will be mindful of the production levels in our Outdoor space. But that\u2019s kind of $2 billion-ish of $13 billion, $14 billion T&O business. So I think those production schedules will be in tied to the market realities we see in Outdoor. But broadly speaking, in this fourth quarter and as we head into 2024, Tools production has normalized. I think as you talk about the one-time costs. Those you are kind of seeing in our gross profit as we exit the fourth quarter of this year. So, during this year, you have seen a cost of about 400 basis points in total, 300 basis points of which was roughly high cost inventory and one of which -- 100 basis points of which was kind of under absorption of fixed cost. That has played out within 2023 and you are seeing that in the gross profit margin at almost did 28% in the third quarter and will probably be at or above in the fourth quarter. And so that\u2019s kind of behind us and we are building off of that 28% plus gross margin next year as we head into 2024 and the program continues. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to hand the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Shannon, thanks. We would like to thank everyone again for their time and participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have further questions. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2023 fourth quarter and full year webcast. Here today, in addition to myself, is Don Allan, President and CEO; Chris Nelson, COO, EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan, EVP and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today. This morning, Don, Chris and Pat will review our 2023 fourth quarter and full year results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcasts, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan. Don Allan : Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Stanley Black & Decker's performance in 2023 reflects our relentless focus on the execution of our strategic business transformation, which resulted in us building a strong foundation for improved profitability in 2024. Stanley Black & Decker today is a more streamlined business, built on the strength of our people and culture, with an intensified focus on our core market leadership positions in Tools & Outdoor and Industrial. Despite a challenging market backdrop, that pressured volumes during the year, adjusted gross margin improved in each quarter and we generated over $850 million of free cash flow. These results demonstrate significant progress against two of our most important areas of focus during 2023. Here are just a few additional examples of our accomplishments from the past year. We improved the health of our cost structure as a result of the momentum from our supply chain transformation. We achieved our 2023 target and delivered over $1 billion of savings program to-date. We remain on track for the expected $2 billion of savings targeted by the end of 2025. Our fourth quarter adjusted gross margin approached 30%. This result outperformed the plan, as our teams accelerated efforts to deliver profit and cash in response to the soft volume environment. Our strong free cash flow generation was primarily the result of $1.1 billion of inventory reduction, as we successfully executed our supply chain initiatives. We continue to actively manage our portfolio of businesses. In December, we announced the agreement to sell our Infrastructure business, and currently expect that transaction to close at the end of the first quarter. This aligns with our simplification efforts and focus on shareholder value creation, while advancing our capital allocation priorities. We strengthened our leadership team with the addition of three new highly-capable seasoned and respected leaders in Chris Nelson, Pat Hallinan and John Lucas, each of whom brings a fresh and exciting set of perspectives. Stepping back, over the past year-and-a-half, we have transformed Stanley Black & Decker into a different company, refocused and reenergized. Together, our talented and motivated leadership team, along with our diverse and high-performing associates across the globe, are executing our transformation strategy with urgency and diligence to ensure we continue to achieve our goals. Our performance to-date is encouraging and reinforces our confidence in making investments to pursue the compelling long-term growth opportunities in the markets that we serve. Shifting now to our fourth quarter performance. Revenue was $3.7 billion, which was down mid-single digits versus the prior year, primarily due to lower outdoor and DIY volume as well as infrastructure customer destocking. Our profitability exceeded our plan as we recorded adjusted gross margin of 29.8% in the quarter. Adjusted gross margin was up over 10 points versus the prior year and improved 220 basis points versus the third quarter. As a result of our focused efforts, this is the fourth consecutive quarter that we delivered sequential adjusted gross margin improvement. We also reduced inventory by $240 million this quarter, which brings our total inventory reduction to $1.9 billion since mid-2022 when we began this journey. 2024 will be the next chapter of transformation, an opportunity to demonstrate our ability to further improve profitability and cash flow, as we plant the seeds for future growth and success for Stanley Black & Decker. While it will be a transitional year, we are continuing to strengthen our foundation to create greater future earnings power. We will remain focused on delivering differentiated product innovation through our portfolio of world-class brands, implementing cost efficiency measures within our control, and driving share gain in our core markets, all aimed to improve margin, earnings and cash flow. Turning to the markets we serve, our view is that these markets will remain dynamic in 2024. Overall, we expect relative strength and demand from professional tools and portions of our industrial markets. However, we believe the consumer and outdoor demand trends will continue to be weak. Together, this results in a modestly negative outlook in aggregate for all of our markets. Our global trade weighted GDP estimates are slightly positive, with US Real GDP growth projected to slow, but remain positive in 2024. Global commercial construction is expected to moderate, and industrial tool markets are expected to remain supportive. The global industrial fastener end categories will be led by aerospace, while automotive and industrial production markets will be relatively flat. There are a few key macroeconomic indicators that more directly impact our larger markets in North America, which are somewhat mixed. Examples of this mix North American Tools & Outdoor market are as follows. New residential builds are forecasted to improve from current levels, yet remain modestly negative year-over-year. Residential repair and remodel is currently expected to retract. And the outdoor power equipment industry continues to show signs of customer destocking, and we don't expect to pivot to growth during 2024. In summary, we're focused on the pro user and the healthiest market segments to generate share gains. We are prepared for weak consumer and outdoor demand trends to persist. The midpoint of our 2024 plan represents a continuation of the current demand environment, which in aggregate is slightly negative for all markets. We will remain agile and ready to serve incremental demand if it accelerates in the second half. We believe that with our powerful brands and strong innovation machine, we have the opportunity to capture new wins with our customers and outperform the market. Our plan for the year is underpinned by the continued supply chain cost improvements that are broadly in our control. We expect to deliver gross margin accretion, earnings growth and strong free cash flow. Pat will discuss this in more detail in just a few moments. 2024 will be a year of focus, excitement and purpose. And it is fitting that we are celebrating the 100 year anniversary of DEWALT, a noteworthy milestone and a reminder that we have been revolutionizing jobsites for a century. We will always relentlessly innovate for our pros and all our end users, allowing them to achieve better, safer and faster results. I want to thank our 50,000-plus employees around the world for their persistence and commitment to our mission in 2023. They each have contributed to the progress we've made on our transformation journey. Now, stepping into the business segment results. I will discuss our Industrial business performance, and then pass it to Chris Nelson to review the Tools & Outdoor results. Fourth quarter Industrial revenue declined 4% versus last year. Price realization was more than offset by lower volume, which was driven by the continuation of customer destocking in Infrastructure. Within this segment, engineered fastening fourth quarter organic revenues were up 7%. This includes aerospace growth of 27% and auto growth of 10%, as we benefit from recoveries in those markets. This growth was partially muted by market softness in general industrial fastening. The fourth quarter Industrial adjusted segment margin was 11.1%, down 40 basis points versus prior year, as lower volume more than offset price realization and cost control. For the year, we are very pleased with the performance of our Industrial segment. While organic revenue growth was flat, engineered fastening, which is our focus moving forward within this segment, was up 6% organically, behind the strength in automotive and aerospace. The team delivered full year adjusted segment margin of 11.8%, up 210 basis points versus 2022. This expansion was driven by price realization and cost actions taken to improve productivity throughout the year. I want to thank the Industrial business team for their strong execution in 2023. And I'd like to especially thank the Infrastructure team for their valuable contribution to Stanley Black & Decker. I am confident that the business is positioned for a future of innovation and growth with Epiroc. I will now turn the call over to Chris to review our Tools & Outdoor performance. Chris Nelson : Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Now, turning to the Tools & Outdoor fourth quarter operating performance. Fourth quarter revenue was approximately $3.2 billion, down 8% organically versus prior year as a result of lower volumes primarily from soft consumer outdoor and DIY market demand, while price remained flat. We made substantial progress improving profitability through the year, driving adjusted segment margin to 10% in the fourth quarter. This was a sequential step-up of 70 basis points versus the third quarter and 900 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2022. We achieved this by realizing lower inventory destocking costs, delivering supply chain transformation savings and capturing the benefits of shipping cost deflation, which were partially offset by lower volume. Now, turning to the product lines. Organic revenue for hand tools declined 6%, while power tools was up 1 point organically, as pro-driven momentum offset pressures in DIY demand. Outdoor was significantly challenged as customers right-sized their inventory levels. We expect that trend to continue into the start of the 2024 selling season. In tools, we finished the year with a relatively stable market backdrop, supported by pro demand. For example, power tools organic performance improved each quarter in 2023 and exited in a growth position. This demonstrates the demand for our iconic pro-centric DEWALT brand and the best-in-class products that we are bringing to the market. As the outdoor market achieves post-COVID normalization, we are focused on improving our cost structure while prioritizing investments to capture targeted share gain opportunities with customers and accelerating innovation in handheld electrification, which is a growing and highly-profitable category. Now, turning to fourth quarter performance by region. North America was down 10% organically, with the tools product line down low-single digits. The commercial and industrial channel, which has a heavy professional user base, grew low-single digits organically. Fourth quarter US retail point-of-sale demand remained negative versus the prior year, but above 2019 levels, supported by price increases and strength in professional tools. European organic revenue was down 1%, with outperformance in the Nordics and Italy, which generated double-digit organic growth as we continue to invest in expanding our professional product offerings and activating new battery-powered innovations within the region. Emerging markets grew mid-single digits organically, excluding the impact from the Russia business exit. Including this impact, organic sales declined 1%. Solid emerging market performance was led by high-teens organic growth in Brazil, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of organic growth in the country. I want to thank the Tools & Outdoor team for their focused efforts throughout the year, which has positioned us well as we continue to focus on winning with our customers and capturing long-term profitable growth and market share. Now, turning to the next slide, I would like to now introduce our new groundbreaking equipment system, DEWALT POWERSHIFT. We are proud to bring this to market later this year as it demonstrates the company's commitment to innovation and electrification for the pros. The DEWALT POWERSHIFT system was unveiled at the World of Concrete trade show last week, and is designed to meet the critical needs of concrete professionals. The electrified line will allow the pro to transition away from gas-powered equipment without compromising efficiency and performance. Each of the six concrete tools in the system uses the DEWALT POWERSHIFT 554 watt-hour battery and high-speed charger to streamline efficiency. The battery can deliver up to 5,000 watts of continuous power, that is equivalent to 6.5 horsepower and is designed to withstand the toughest jobsite conditions. The POWERSHIFT battery leverages pouch cell technology, which DEWALT first brought to the industry in October of 2021. Pouch technology enables the cordless jobsite of the future, bringing more power, runtime and efficiency. Take, for example, the POWERSHIFT vibrator, used for concrete placement. It is 85% more efficient than gas vibrators in the market today. POWERSHIFT vibrators deliver 60 continuous minutes of non-stop work, which gives the user about 30% more runtime than a tank of gas. There are electrified vibrators in the market today that can only deliver 15 minutes of runtime. Adding to the extended runtime, this tool is 5 pounds lighter than a gas unit and is 10 pounds lighter than any other electrified unit available. DEWALT POWERSHIFT represents the next addition to the 100-year legacy of the DEWALT Innovation Mission to deliver comprehensive end-to-end workflow solutions. Raymond DeWalt's founding principles of innovation, safety and productivity remain the core ethos of our company today. DEWALT's future remains strong, and we will lead the way in empowering trades people to succeed while defining the next era of industry innovation and minimizing environmental impact. Thank you. And with that, I'll pass the call over to Pat Hallinan. Pat Hallinan : Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Turning to the next slide, I would like to highlight the progress we have achieved streamlining the business and transforming our operations. We are on track to deliver our $2 billion pre-tax run rate cost savings target by the end of 2025. We achieved approximately $160 million pre-tax run rate cost savings in the fourth quarter, bringing our aggregate savings to over $1 billion since program inception. This performance is slightly ahead of plan as our teams accelerated savings efforts to offset macroeconomic volume headwinds that were greater than expected throughout the year, including during the fourth quarter. Strategic sourcing initiatives remain the largest contributor to our supply chain transformation to-date. In addition to the program, freight rate and demurrage savings also contributed to margin improvement starting early in 2023 and holding throughout the year. Consistent with expectations set at transformation inception, we expect strategic sourcing to be the leading contributor to savings and we expect this to be the case in 2024. Our operations excellence program continues to leverage lean manufacturing principles to improve productivity across both business segments. This workstream will expand in scope during 2024 and drive further cost efficiency in our manufacturing base. The footprint related projects are progressing on schedule and production transfers into centers of excellence are in the various stages of qualification, testing and execution. Similarly, logistics network optimization programs are also on track with regional distribution center redesigns underway. Concerning complexity reduction, our teams have identified approximately 85,000 SKUs for discontinuation and are assisting customers as they transition to replacement products. We have successfully eliminated over 45,000 SKUs as of the end of 2023 with more expected in 2024. These actions are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024, supporting the funding of additional growth investments in our core business. As we move into the next phase of our transformation, footprint and product changes, such as those from platforming, will become more important and results in a lumpier cost savings trajectory as you would expect. We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater. Moving to the next slide, two of our primary areas of focus during 2023 were free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion. We reduced inventory by approximately $240 million in the fourth quarter, inclusive of approximately $100 million attributable to the Infrastructure business held for sale accounting. This brings our inventory reduction to approximately $1.1 billion in 2023 and $1.9 billion since the middle of 2022. Our disciplined inventory reduction efforts throughout the year supported $853 million of free cash flow generation, which we used to fund our dividend and reduce debt by approximately $280 million versus the prior year. We remain focused on working capital optimization in addition to improving profitability to generate significant free cash flow. In 2024, we plan to reduce inventory by $400 million to $500 million, as we continue to prioritize working capital efficiency. CapEx is expected to range between $400 million to $500 million, increasing versus 2023, predominantly in support of the footprint-related transformation initiatives planned for 2024. These items, in combination with organic cash generation, underpin our full year free cash flow range of $600 million to $800 million. As a reminder, we expect a typical profile for our working capital as we build inventory for the 2024 Tools & Outdoor spring selling season, resulting in the typical first quarter operating cash outflow. Our priority for capital deployment remains consistent, making transformation investments, funding our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividend, and further strengthening our balance sheet. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin of 29.8% in the fourth quarter was up 10.3 points versus the prior year, driven by lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs, which more than offset the impact from lower volume. Adjusted gross margin finished ahead of plan as we intentionally accelerated supply chain transformation actions in 2023 while navigating weak consumer and outdoor demand and channel inventory conservatism to meet our profitability and cash flow objectives. Additionally, pricing was 0.5 point better than our expectation due to lower promotional mix in the quarter. We will continue our measured and disciplined approach to cost management to moderately improve on our second-half 2023 adjusted gross margin gain into the first half of 2024 while managing the margin pressures that accompany the outdoor selling season. This is notable given that we're able to deliver second-half 2023 adjusted gross margin 1 point above the high end of our initial '23 guidance, demonstrating the transformation is on our targeted trajectory. We are planning for adjusted gross margin to approximate 30% for the full year of 2024 and expect to exit the year in the low 30%s, consistent with prior expectations. We are leveraging our $0.5 billion of cost reductions from the supply chain transformation and working hard to navigate another year without a macroeconomic tailwind. We made significant progress throughout 2023 on our journey to restore our historical 35%-plus adjusted gross margin and our efforts are enabling incremental investments to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth. Now, let's turn to our 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. To reiterate, we are planning for 2024 to be another year where we prioritize cash flow generation and gross margin improvement. We are initiating a full year free cash flow guidance range of $600 million to $800 million, GAAP earnings per share range of $1.60 to $2.85, and an adjusted earnings per share range of $3.50 to $4.50. We expect relative strength in demand for professional tools in some of our industrial markets. Conversely, we are prepared for weak consumer and outdoor demand trends to persist. Together, these dynamics result in a modestly negative outlook in aggregate for our markets. We are planning for organic revenue to be relatively flat at the midpoint, supported by targeted share gains in our businesses. Our EPS range contemplates plus or minus 2 points of volume growth, with the variation representing the market demand scenarios in the plan. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat at the midpoint, behind our focus to win with the pro through industry-leading innovation, investments in field resources and consumer share gains, leveraging our strong portfolio of brands. The Industrial segment revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive organically, primarily driven by aerospace market recovery, as well as leveraging our core business model and electrification to deliver share gains. Industrial growth in 2024 is expected to be moderated by Infrastructure destocking in Q1 before the closure of the signed divestiture and expected softness in general industrial fastening markets. We will continue to invest for long-term organic growth and share gain throughout 2024 and plan to invest an incremental $100 million to accelerate innovation, market activation and to support our powerful DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN and STANLEY brands. Our planning expectation is that SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2024 remains consistent with our recent fourth quarter, around 21%, which includes investments. Turning to profitability, we expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to improve to approximately 10% for the full year, supported by the benefits of the transformation program. Segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year, also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial segment margin is expected to be flat to up slightly versus prior year, as operating improvement in engineered fastening is offset by the dilution from the previously announced divestiture of the Infrastructure business. For additional context around Infrastructure, our guidance assumes approximately $100 million of first quarter sales, with the divestiture closing at the end of the quarter. Thereafter, we have excluded the profit and assume the proceeds will be used to reduce our commercial paper debt balance. With these assumptions, we've established a $1 adjusted EPS range, with the largest contributor being market demand variability. We will work to optimize adjusted gross margin through our transformation program, we will manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year, given the macro uncertainty, but we will be working hard to preserve investments to position the business for longer-term growth. Turning to the other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $290 million to $340 million, largely related to the supply chain transformation program, with approximately 25% of these expenses being non-cash footprint rationalization costs. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to step-up in 2024 to 10% with the first three quarters generally in the mid-20%s. Discrete tax planning items are expected to reduce the full year rate and we currently expect these to occur in the fourth quarter. Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 13% of the full year at the midpoint. The EPS for the first quarter is impacted by the tax profile I discussed earlier and a heavier contribution from interest expense associated with the expected first quarter commercial paper debt balance. Adjusted first quarter EBITDA as a percentage of the full year is expected to be over 20%, consistent with pre-pandemic history. First quarter total company organic sales growth is expected to be down low-single digits, primarily due to the same factors driving fourth quarter '23 softness. Adjusted EBITDA margins are planned to be strongly versus prior year, leveraging the carryover benefits of the program and comping the destocking period. In summary, 2024 represents another step along our transformation journey with a continued focus on gross margin and cash while targeting share gains in a stable, but tough macro environment. We believe our actions continue to position the company for long-term growth and shareholder return. With that, I'll now pass the call back to Don. Don Allan : Thank you, Pat. We embarked on a bold transformation in the middle of 2022 to set Stanley Black & Decker on a path to drive strong, long-term shareholder returns through sustainable growth, profitability and cash flow improvement. As we report another quarter of progress, our consistent execution against our plan gives us the confidence to increase investments, supporting the acceleration of organic growth behind our most powerful brands, particularly DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN, STANLEY. In the face of dynamic markets, we're focused on delivering best-in-class product innovation, implementing cost efficiency measures within our control, and driving share gain in our core markets. I am confident that we are creating a stronger and more focused company, capable of gaining market share consistently over the long term, with the best people, the most iconic brands and the highest quality innovation engine in the industry. With that, we are now ready for Q&A, Dennis. Dennis Lange : Great. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start the Q&A, please. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Don Allan : Good morning. Julian Mitchell : Good morning. Maybe just a question for me around that rate of improvement as we're going through the year, just trying to understand, I guess, particularly the gross margin delta and also on the free cash flow progression. What's the confidence that that gross margin can sort of move up sequentially as you go through the year to get to that low 30%s exit rate? And on free cash, kind of how weighted should that $700 million midpoint be to the second half? Thank you. Pat Hallinan : Hey, Julian, it's Pat. Thanks for the questions. Our focus next year is on both of these topics, gross margin and cash delivery. And as we moved through '23 and made very strong progress on gross margin, we certainly had the benefit in '23 of that progression being the consumption of high-cost inventory off the balance sheet. So, throughout '23, you saw a very, very significant degree of progression throughout the year. Throughout 2024, we're confident in our plan and we're targeting the 300 basis points roughly of progression throughout the year. It will be back-half weighted, and part of that is the low volumes that we saw the back half of '23 and expect to see the front half of '24, but we have every confidence we're going to deliver it. And as we started talking to investors the back half of last year, we guided people to measure our gross margin progress in half year increments. And if you look at the back half of '23, we were about 28.7% for our back half of 2023 progression. And we expect to be in expansion mode the front half of '24, it will be modest in the 50-ish basis point range, and we'll be stepping up more significantly in the back half of '24 as we accelerate some of the savings efforts we have on the docket for the year quickly to offset some of the volume softness we've been experiencing in the last six to 12 months. But we have every confidence we're going to get there. In terms of cash, the main difference in cash year-over-year is really the difference in the transformation initiatives that are planned for 2024, where we're doing a bigger proportion of the footprint moves, which are going to drive more CapEx during '24 than during 2023 about $100 million, and more cash-oriented restructuring charges around $50 million. So, the big difference year-over-year in cash drivers are the restructuring agenda. If you look at the rest of the cash drivers, we're still targeting pretty meaningful inventory reduction, but less than the $1 billion that we drove off the balance sheet in '23. We're going to be in the $400 million to $500 million range. But that difference in inventory reduction is made up by a higher operating profit. So, those two things roughly offset each other and the drivers are really the difference in year-over-year CapEx and the difference in year-over-year cash restructuring charges. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open. Tim Wojs : Hey, guys. Good morning. Nice job on the margins. Maybe just -- I have two cost questions. So, first just on investments, Pat, what are you kind of explicitly investing or at least what's planned to be invested in 2024? And how variable are you kind of planning to manage those investments as you go through the year? And then secondly, just on cost inflation, could you give us just an idea of kind of what you're seeing in kind of key cost inputs, and then also what's kind of explicitly baked in for price/cost? Pat Hallinan : Yeah. So, on investments, we're continuing to invest predominantly in innovation and then in the field and marketing resources to activate it. So, of the $100 million we're targeting for '24, I'd say three quarters or more are around that. Obviously, a lot of that in our biggest business, our Tools & Outdoor business, but some in Industrial as well. It's mostly about innovation and market activation and field resources to support it, maybe 20% to 25% is another capability building to make us a more productive organization. And then, as we go through the year, I mean, obviously, we're going into a year with a pretty muted macro and the uncertainty we've been experiencing the last 12 or 18 months, we're certainly going to be paying close attention to the macro and managing our cost structure as we go throughout the year to be in step with that macro. But we are really focused on the long-term growth of this business, and we're going to be working hard as a leadership team and as an organization to preserve those investments, even if the macro creates a bit more headwinds than we're expecting, because we're not going to just completely collapse '24 investment at the risk of longer-term brand health and brand share gaining power. In terms of inflation and deflation for the year, our plan expects roughly flat across kind of materials and freight. You've obviously had some of the battery metals go down in significant percentage terms, but in dollar terms, those don't drive our basket as much as some others. There's been some recent upticks in steel resins, and we'll probably face some marginal pressure from Red Sea freight. But overall, you put metals and freight together, roughly flat. Still kind of a high labor rate environment, but that's embedded in our gross margin and SG&A assumptions. And then finally, price/cost, again, roughly neutral. It will have some carry-in price in Industrial, that's to the good, offset by just the normalization of promotional cadence in Tools & Outdoor. Again, recall the back half of '23, we're getting back to a normal promotional cadence as our supply chain healed and that will be playing through the front half of '24 as well. But I'd say those two forces together enterprise-wide get us to roughly flat price dynamics for the year and again a roughly flat inflation backdrop in total. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is now open. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I just wanted to follow-up about the flat-lining of gross margin that's expected into the first half relative to the Q4 exit rate. It seems like there is a lot of savings on the balance sheet that is yet to flow through the P&L. And I think the expectation is that those come through on a couple quarter lag. So just, maybe why is that not coming through in the first half? And I understand the outdoor mix will pick up. But I would also think that tools gross margin gets better from Q4 into the first half as you move past the holiday promo. So, any color on the gross margin delta between those product lines, to help understand that mix would be helpful. Thank you. Pat Hallinan : Yeah. No, like I said, we do expect some modest expansion front half to front half. We had, as we went through 2023 and we saw volumes being really soft, I think commend the team for still delivering over $500 million of savings across the volume backdrop that was for the year, about 300 basis points or 400 basis points below what we expected. And we got beyond the high side of our guidance for '23 gross margin. So, we came out at quite a strong rate. As you point out, the trajectory in the first half is positive even if a bit muted. And I'd say the couple of forces of that are, one that you pointed to, you have a heavier outdoor mix in the first half of the year, and you have some of the under absorption that was associated with low volumes from the back half of '23. And those are really the two forces, and they play out in the front half by muting some of the rate of that progress, but they don't take us off-track for the full year savings. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is now open. Rob Wertheimer : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Pat Hallinan : Good morning. Rob Wertheimer : My question is on dynamics at the retail channel. And if I understood it right, you had volumes a little soft, you had promotional activity down, which is good. And I'm just curious about how that works out in market share, whether the competition is stepping up promotional activity, whether channel inventory is now normalized, there is less promotion. Maybe just give us a comment on market share, on promotions, on dynamics of retail. Thank you. Don Allan : Sure. Thanks, Rob. I think the competitive landscape has not really shifted or changed as we went through the end of '23 into the early stages of '24. There is modest movements in certain brands moving across retailers. But aside from that, we're not seeing unusual pricing or discounting happening. And for the most part, it's really all of us navigating a somewhat muted market right now and continuing to position ourselves for share gain. But I'll ask Chris Nelson to give a little more color on what he's seeing. Chris Nelson : Yeah. I'd say that as you think about the -- just referencing POS, I would say that the POS played out roughly as we would have planned it in Q4 where we saw it was down year-over-year but above 2019 levels. And if you think about the kind of buckets therein, we saw strength out of the pro and the expected level of -- kind of difficulties that we are going to see in the consumer and DIY segment. So, that's on plan, and it's what we're contemplating, as we said, moving into this year for that being a fairly stable macro that we're playing the backdrop against. As Don referenced, we're not seeing major changes in the competitive dynamics. What we are seeing and we're excited about is getting back to our normal promotional rhythms as we have been able to take care of our customers and fill -- our fill rates have been proved. That's made a big difference in our opportunity to compete well in retail. And then, I think the final part of your question that you referenced was regarding inventory levels. And certainly, on a global basis, as people take a look at what is somewhat of a dynamic or tepid macro, people are thinking about right-sizing their inventories for that environment, and we see that somewhat anecdotally in places like Europe and in some of our professional channels. But when you take a look at the biggest chunks of the inventory where we have really clean data in our major retailers, we're at historical levels. We feel good where we are there positioned, and we think that that's going to be kind of a neutral dynamic heading into 2024. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Believe it or not, I was actually at World of Concrete. I saw the new products. Pretty impressive I'd say. So, congrats on that launch. Just on the pricing, came in obviously better than last quarter in Tools & Outdoors. So, just wondering -- if you talked about normalization of the promotional activity and I'm just wondering if maybe you pulled back in the fourth quarter and perhaps that kind of put some of the maybe the weakness in Tools & Outdoor. But just I'd really be curious on the footprint changes you're making with the CapEx. Obviously, we've got Trump talking about China tariffs. I'm just wondering if there's going to be a material change in your sourcing and footprint during 2024. Don Allan : Yeah. So, Nigel, I'll have Chris answer your first question, and then I'll take the second question after he's done. Chris Nelson : So, from a pricing perspective -- Nigel, good to hear from you. I'm glad you were able to see the new products. Sorry I missed you there. But no, we did not see a significant pullback in the promotional volume. What we saw was an overall -- as we said, more challenge in the overall macro environment that I think contributed to that more than anything. And as we transition into next year, we're expecting that pricing dynamic to stay fairly stable. We feel good about our plans there. And overall, I think it's fair to say that, as Pat pointed out, we're kind of at a neutral price cost. We're not banking on a bunch of inflation. And as we take a look at in the rearview mirror, we have recouped a significant but not all of the costs we took on, as we saw inflation. And so, keeping that neutral price cost is important for our gross margin trajectory moving forward as well. Don Allan : Yeah. The comment on the footprint, I mean, yeah, the geopolitical dynamics continue to be intriguing and interesting for sure, what may play out in the future. But as it comes to our footprint transformation, we started with an overarching strategy of finding ways to get closer to our customer with our supply base and our manufacturing [Technical Difficulty] certain types of products that are high volume, in particular. Other products, you have to focus more on the low-cost location. And so, you end up with a mixed geography of where you're manufacturing and how you're serving your customers. That hasn't really changed. What we continue to do as part of the transformation though is develop centers of excellence for power tools, certain types of hand tools, certain types of outdoor products that leverage the expertise we have in these geographies in Asia, in Mexico and in the United States and Eastern Europe. We will continue to build upon that, which gives -- eventually, will give us the ability to flex supply from different geographies if the geopolitical landscape changes radically. That will take time to do. That's not something that will necessarily occur in the next six to 12 months. But as we continue on this journey and finish this transformation in the next two to three years, that's an outcome that we're looking to achieve. And so, we believe that's the appropriate way to address what's happening in the dynamic geopolitical space, and we'll continue to evaluate that going forward as things shift in countries like the United States if they shift and make pivots as necessary. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Zelman & Associates. Your line is now open. Adam Baumgarten : Hey, guys. Good morning. Just on SKU rationalization, do you think that had any impact on the volumes in the fourth quarter or even the second half of '23? Don Allan : Go ahead, Pat. Pat Hallinan : Yeah. Adam, no, I mean, that program has been very thoughtful in weeding out complexity that's not creating value for end users or for our shareholders. And there's no major disruption by that, by any stretch of the means. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Don Allan : Good morning. Michael Rehaut : I had a question on the growth investments and just how to think about the cadence about longer term. I think you talked about it a little bit earlier in the call, but can you talk about in totality, I think alongside the 35%-plus gross margin and enabling $300 million to $500 million of growth investment, I was hoping just to get a sense of what those investments were in '23, what you expect it to be in '24 and '25, and how much of that is going to be kind of an ongoing level of investment, and if that would all be on the income statement in the tools and storage, or if there would be some in corporate? Thanks. Pat Hallinan : Yeah, Mike. I'll give you a few points. I'd say '23 was a bit over $100 million, will be around $100 million for '24. And as I referenced on our earlier question, it's about three quarters around innovation and then the marketing and field resources to activate that effectively. And the rest of it is around capability building. Some of it in our business segments, a relatively small amount of it in corporate. And I think if you're getting to the broader question of you're sitting there with a model and you're trying to figure out is SG&A permanently at 21% of sales or something else, if that's kind of behind the essence of your question, I'd say as we get back to share gains and as we jolt our brands and our innovation up for a few years, I expect in the medium-term, to be more in the back to the 20%-ish range, if that's kind of what you're trying to unpack. But I would expect us to be elevated in '24 and potentially in '25 and '26 depending on the macro and some of the things we're prioritizing in the medium-term around that 20%-ish level. And then, I think, beyond the medium term, to the extent we can be exceptional at driving gross margin improvement, the SG&A will move with the rate at which we can drive gross margin improvement. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. Eric Bosshard : Good morning. You talked about normalizing promotions and you talked about, I think, volumes relative to '19, just curious if you could give us a little bit of insight into promotional activity relative to '19, where we are now, and what is embedded in the guidance, and what you're seeing in the market in regards to an appetite for promotions either from consumers, professionals or retailers? Don Allan : Good morning, Eric. So, I would say that the level of promotional activities we're at now and we would expect in '24 is probably pretty consistent with what we experienced in 2019. And so, we're kind of back to where we were, which I think was a healthy balance of normal core operating selling activities and promotional activities. As we think about the year, our customers are not really talking to us about, what I would call, unusual levels of promotional activities. They're looking for the normal set of activities, and I think that's going to likely be the case throughout the year. And we tend to -- in demand markets like this that are somewhat stable in the sense where you don't have a lot of growth and you don't have a lot of retraction, it tends to be a more normal promotional environment in that setting. If demand retracts in a more significant way, then promotional activity does pull back a fair amount, because the impact of promotions is not as significant. If we see a back half of the year that gets better, which there's -- we talked about in our presentation that our guidance doesn't necessarily include that, but if the back-half demand environment is an improved environment, and you could potentially see a little bit of tick-up in promotional activity related to that. But at this stage, based on our guidance, I think it's probably balanced to say that our view is that promotional activity will be consistent with what we saw pre-pandemic. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for their time and participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2024 First Quarter Webcast. Here today, in addition to myself is Don Allan, President and CEO; and Chris Nelson, COO, EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan, EVP and CFO.  Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today.  This morning, Don, Chris and Pat will review our 2024 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risks and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing.  I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan. Donald Allan : Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter performance was the result of consistent, solid execution, and we are making progress against key operational objectives. We continue to see significant value creation opportunities tied to our strategic business transformation and the entire company is focused on the disciplined execution of this strategy.  We are encouraged by the momentum that is building across the organization. Two of our primary areas of emphasis are free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion. We are focused on what is within our control and are pleased with the momentum behind our gross margin. This is particularly notable considering a significantly worse negative macro environment and corresponding revenue performance in 2023 and '24 versus our initial expectations at the outset of our transformation in mid-2022. Our global cost reduction program remains on track for expected run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024. And $2 billion by the end of 2025. As we hit the halfway point of our journey, our decisive actions are delivering quantifiable results.  Specifically, we have captured $1.2 billion of run rate savings program to date. We remain confident this will support 30% gross margins in 2024, consistent with our guidance. We are encouraged that approximately 80% of the company's revenue is expected to carry 2024 adjusted gross margins in excess of 30% and exit this year at or ahead of initial expectations.  We believe these product lines will continue to improve upon their current adjusted gross margin profile over the next 18 to 24 months. As it relates to the rest of the portfolio or that 20%, which is predominantly our cyclically-depressed outdoor business and the rapidly-recovering aerospace fastener business.  We are actioning significant cost efficiencies to make necessary improvements to the profitability of outdoor in response to the current market demand and refining the aerospace fastener product line cost base to drive significant growth leverage as wide-body plane production continues to recover. Our long-term success will be driven by improved profitability, coupled with consistent market share gains. We believe our share position in tools is now stable to increasing. For example, our 2023 point-of-sale data in tools performed better than the category average across the North American home centers, which was led by our iconic DEWALT Professional brand. We are also serving our customers better by delivering improved fill rates, earning the right for more activity across our brands. Retailers are recognizing this performance. For 2023, Ace Hardware named CRAFTSMAN as Vendor of the Year and Grainger recognized Stanley Black & Decker with their partners and Performance Award.  Congratulations to our organization. This is a testament to the team's efforts and as we work to get closer to our partners. It's an early indication that we are on the right track. As we report our first quarter performance, we are energized by how our transformation efforts are taking root. I am confident that by executing our strategy, we are positioning the company to deliver high levels of organic revenue growth, profitability, and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder return.  Turning to the first quarter results. Our top line showed signs of stabilization with organic revenues down a point. Excluding the now divested infrastructure business, organic revenue was flat as Engineered Fastening and the DEWALT growth was offset by muted consumer and DIY demand. Adjusted gross margin was 29%, up 590 basis points versus the first quarter of last year and 30 basis points above the second half of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56. Adjusted gross margin expansion and EPS growth were both supported by lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs.  We are reiterating our 2024 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.50, up to $4.50 as well as our expected free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million. Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation.  On April 1, we completed the sale of Stanley Infrastructure Epiroc. We have already deployed net proceeds from the transaction to reduce short-term debt, demonstrating our commitment to further strengthening our balance sheet.  Looking forward in 2024, we expect mixed demand trends to persist across our businesses. and we are driving supply chain cost improvements to expand margins, deliver earnings growth and generate strong cash flow. At the same time, we are funding investments designed to fuel targeted long-term growth and market share gains across our businesses. I want to thank our team members around the world for their contributions to the progress that we have made on our transformation journey and for their energy and focus as we continue to charge forward. I will now pass it to Chris Nelson to review the business segment performance. Christopher Nelson : Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor, First quarter revenue was approximately $3.3 billion, down 1% organically versus prior year, as growth in DEWALT was more than offset by muted consumer and DIY demand, which pressured volume.  Pricing was relatively flat, consistent with our expectations. Adjusted segment margin was 8.5% in the first quarter, a 550 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2023. This was achieved through lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation savings and shipping cost reductions, which were partially offset with targeted investments designed to accelerate share gain in organic growth. Now turning to the product lines. Power Tools was up one point organically led by pro-driven growth into DEWALT and international sales. We are also seeing benefits from a return to historic promotional levels on high-margin DEWALT cordless, Organic revenue for hand tools declined 7% pressured by lower DIY demand.  Outdoor product line organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter, driven by strong demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment and incremental retail product listings. We are encouraged by U.S. retail point-of-sale data, which showed an early start to the season versus prior year.  We are cautiously optimistic that demand can be better than the last 2 years. Our visibility will improve as we move through the second quarter and hit key U.S. holidays. The independent dealer channel continues to work through significant on-hand inventory, which pressured shipments in the quarter. We are monitoring POS trends in this channel and currently expect that they can clear their inventory during the 2024 season to set up a stronger 2025. As Don alluded earlier, the outdoor market remains soft versus 2019 volume levels. We are not standing still and are moving with speed to improve profitability by continuing to optimize our cost structure. Consistent with our overall strategy, our intent is to focus resources towards capturing targeted share gain opportunities in the most profitable and attractive growth segments such as electric handheld outdoor power equipment. Turning to Tools & Outdoor performance by region. North America was down 2% organically, driven by factors consistent with the overall segment. In Europe, organic revenue was down 3% as declines in France and Germany were partially offset by growth in the Nordics and the U.K.  We are making targeted investments in the region to expand professional product offerings and activate these innovations in the market to capture share. In aggregate, all other regions were up 7% organically in the quarter, driven by mid-teens growth in Latin America, Brazil, Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean led this performance for the quarter. In summary, for Tools & Outdoor, we are acutely focused on successfully winning with our customers and winning with the Pro, while making profitability improvements. We are navigating mixed market conditions with the goal to capitalize on the areas of strength. We are making deliberate investments in our brands, market activation, and innovation to capture the growth and margin opportunities that will contribute to long-term shareholder returns.  I will now discuss our Industrial segment performance. First quarter industrial revenue declined 5% versus last year. Price realization of 1% across the segment and Engineered Fastening volume growth was more than offset by infrastructure volume declines and a point of currency pressure.  Within the Industrial segment, Engineered Fastening organic revenue growth of 5% includes aerospace growth of 30% and auto growth of 4%. We believe we are outpacing customer production levels as a result of targeted share gains, particularly in EV automotive. This growth was partially offset by market softness in general industrial fastening.  Industrials adjusted segment margin was 12.1%, an improvement of 110 basis points versus prior year, driven by price realization and cost actions taken to improve productivity. This was a strong performance considering the infrastructure volume decline that the team faced. The quarter was a result of focused execution by our Industrial business associates. On behalf of the entire leadership team, I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for delivering another solid quarter of results and a strong start to the year.  Now turning to the next slide. I would like to now highlight a few of our recent DEWALT product introductions, which are the results of our investments in innovation. The new DEWALT 20V MAX XR cordless framing nailer is engineered for enhanced productivity and performs applications that are traditionally served by pneumatic tools. It is designed to allow the end user to sync framing nails consistently sub flush into LVL material and when used in rapid sequential mode, ramp-up time is eliminated between shots.  DEWALT is also introducing the world's first 20V MAX cordless 2.25 peak horsepower dedicated plunge router. It provides power like a corded midsized router with the convenience of a cordless tool, a prime example of how we continue to help our Pro users transition to a cordless job site.  Additionally, our ToughSystem 2.0 DXL workstation is the industry's first portable storage solution with a 30-inch platform that helps pros maximize their productivity. This all-in-one workstation delivers customizable mobile storage and a functional work top that is unlike anything else currently available for commercial construction job sites. These are just a few examples of how we continue driving our innovation engine in a manner that is centered on the professional with the intent of making our users more productive. We believe these innovations, coupled with our investments in brand and market activation will stimulate share gains. As we celebrate the DEWALT 100-year anniversary, we also reflect on our responsibility and commitment to serving the trades people around the world with brands like DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN and Stanley.  Thank you, and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan. Patrick Hallinan : Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Turning to the next slide. I would like to highlight the progress we've made along our transformation journey in the first quarter. We achieved approximately $145 million pretax run rate cost savings in the period, bringing our aggregate savings to approximately $1.2 billion since program inception.  As we focus our portfolio, streamline our business structure and transform our operations, our teams are actively identifying and prioritizing opportunities to further optimize our cost structure. Given the dynamic macro environment, we continue to refine and mobilize plans to deliver targeted savings. We are confident in our ability to execute those plans. We continue to target $1.5 billion of pretax run rate savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion pretax run rate cost savings by the end of 2025. Strategic sourcing remains the largest contributor to our transformation savings to date. We are leveraging savings on the $5 billion of addressable spend across areas such as materials and components, finished goods and indirect expenditures. Our operations excellence program, which leverages lean manufacturing principles is driving productivity improvements. The scope of this work stream improves efficiency and effectiveness within our production and distribution facilities. A pipeline of projects is robust with initiatives lined up to deliver efficiency gains in 2024 and beyond. Footprint-related projects and product platforming, which are more event-driven, will become increasingly important throughout the remainder of our transformation.  We are optimizing our distribution footprint as well as redesigning our manufacturing network to leverage centers of excellence and to optimize our operations. This multiyear endeavor is accelerating in 2024 as we plan to exit or transform a number of facilities across the globe during 2024 and 2025.  The manufacturing sites we previously announced for closure have ceased production, and we expect to exit these sites in the near future. We continue to execute manufacturing footprint changes during the first quarter, which affected 5 sites with the goal to complete these site modifications this year regarding product platforming, this initiative will unlock value by reducing complexity across our value chain. This savings initiative identifies various parts and components that can be standardized across a product family, which eliminates complexity and improves procurement scale.  In aggregate, our supply chain transformation initiatives are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024, improving margins and generating resources for additional growth investments in our core business. we remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater, while enabling targeted growth investments. Moving to the next slide. We continue prioritizing free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion to support long-term growth and value creation. First quarter free cash outflow was in line with typical historical trends due to seasonal account receivable increases. This quarter, our inventory control contained the working capital build to approximately $360 million, where we've traditionally averaged a roughly $700 million increase in the first quarter of the year. Days of inventory is now approximately 150 days, an improvement of 10 days versus the prior year and moving toward our long-term target of approximately 120 to 130 days.  We used the net proceeds from the infrastructure sale to reduce our commercial paper balance in the beginning of the second quarter. Because this occurred subsequent to the first quarter close, it is not reflected in the first quarter balance sheet.  We remain focused on working capital optimization and profitability improvement to generate strong free cash flow in 2024. For the full year 2024, we plan to reduce inventory by $400 million to $500 million as we continue prioritizing working capital efficiency. CapEx is expected to range between $400 million to $500 million, which includes support for the footprint-related transformation initiatives. These items, combined with organic cash generation, support our full year free cash flow range of $600 million to $800 million, which is unchanged from our guidance communicated earlier in the year.  Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent. Investing in organic growth and our transformation, funding our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and further strengthening our balance sheet. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin of 29% in the first quarter improved 590 basis points versus prior year, driven by lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs.  We expect to increase adjusted gross margin sequentially in each half of 2024, and we are planning for total company adjusted gross margin to approximate 30% for the full year. We continue to expect to exit the year at an adjusted gross margin rate in the low 30s. We are off to a solid start in 2024 and the hard work we've done to make adjusted gross margin progress allows us to fund incremental investments to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth.  Now turning to the 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. In addition to the free cash flow guidance I just covered, we are reiterating GAAP earnings per share range of $1.60 to $2.85 and an adjusted earnings per share range of $3.50 to $4.50. We are maintaining the range of organic revenue assumptions to be plus or minus low single digits. We believe the most likely outcome for organic revenue is to be flat to down 1%. At this level, we expect to achieve the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range through cost controls.  Our view incorporates modest headwinds in aggregate for our markets, and we remain focused on gaining share in this environment. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and remain committed to funding investments for long-term organic growth. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to be plus or minus low single digits, most likely below flat consistent with the total company. The Industrial segment organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive.  Infrastructure's first quarter decline will impact the segment's full year organic growth. And now that the deal is closed, we will report the divestiture revenue impact quarterly. Our planning assumption for growth investments is approximately an incremental $100 million in 2024. These are designed to accelerate innovation, market activation and to support our powerful DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN and Stanley brands.  This should result in 2024 SG&A as a percentage of sales in the mid-21% zone for the full year. We will remain agile with the pace of investments should the demand outlook swing in or out of our favor. Turning to profitability. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to approximate 10% for the full year, supported by the benefits of the transformation program. Segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year, also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial segment margin is expected to be flat to slightly positive versus prior year as operating improvement in Engineered Fastening is offset by the dilution from the infrastructure business divestiture.  Our adjusted EPS range remains $1, with variability in market demand being the largest contributor, we will work to optimize adjusted gross margin and manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year to balance the macro uncertainty, while working hard to preserve investments to position the business for longer-term growth. Turning to other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pretax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $290 million to $340 million, largely relating to the supply chain transformation program, with approximately 25% of these expenses being noncash footprint rationalization costs.  Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be 10% for 2024, with the second and third quarters in the low 30s. Discrete tax planning items are expected to reduce the full year rate and primarily impact the fourth quarter.  Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 21% to 22% of the full year at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter as a percentage of the full year is expected to exceed 25%, with EPS contribution lower due to the quarterly tax profile.  In summary, we continue to make progress on our transformation journey with an unwavering focus on gross margin expansion, cash generation, balance sheet strength and share gains in a soft market. We are confident that successful execution of our strategy can position the company for long-term growth and value creation.  With that, I will now pass the call back to Don. Donald Allan : Thank you, Pat. As we report another quarter of progress, our consistent execution against our plan is building momentum and energizing our team. As our profitability continues to improve, we are focusing organic growth investments behind our most powerful brands. particularly DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN and Stanley. We believe these investments can enable organic growth to outpace the market by 2 to 3x. Stanley Black & Decker continues to become a more streamlined business built on the strength of our people and culture with an intensified emphasis on our core market leadership positions in Tools & Outdoor and Engineered Fastening. We are focused on consistent execution, while positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth, profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder returns. With that, we are now ready for Q&A, Dennis. Dennis Lange : Great. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start the Q&A, please. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just my question would be around the second quarter, just honing in on that a little bit. I guess, just to make sure, based on the seasonality comment and I think the low 30s tax rate, are we sort of thinking it's flattish sequential revenue in Q2 and then a kind of 9% operating margin? Just wanted to make sure that's the broad assumption and to check what you're assuming for Outdoor? And also for Q2, how we think about free cash. Is that sort of flattish year-on-year or still down year-on-year like in Q1? Patrick Hallinan : Yes. Julian, I'll try to unpack all of those, see if I can remember them. I think you starting with sales. I think sales will be flat to slightly down fractionally down. I don't think there'll be -- the first quarter was down about one point, it probably won't be that steep. And your OM margin of 9-ish percent, you're in the ZIP code. I think the first half of the year seems to be playing out in a manner that's consistent broadly with the consensus from our original guide. And so I think that's all in the ZIP code.  In terms of cash, yes, I think cash will be up -- flat to slightly up for the quarter. What I'd remind everybody about cash is this year, our cash output is going to be driven differently than last year. Last year, we took out $1 billion plus of inventory, and that was a massive driver of '23 cash flow. We'll still be using inventory to drive cash flow this year, but it will be more like $400 million to $500 million.  And then income expansion through margin expansion will drive the balance. And so we'll have the producers of cash this year be roughly the same order of magnitude, but disproportionately driven by operating profits this year. And so obviously, those operating profits are going to flow the way the quarterly revenue and the margin expansion flows. And so I think that's what's being observed here in the first quarter is we had a really nice organic cash flow in the first quarter, but we had, as expected, less inventory reduction, and that's the net delta year-over-year in the first quarter, but I think it will be more like flat to slightly up when we get the second quarter versus last year.  In terms of Outdoor, as Chris mentioned in his comments, we've seen a more traditional timing and order of magnitude start to the outdoor season, which is certainly welcome, and hope carries throughout, but it's early in the season, and we'll see where that plays out through the balance of the season, but coming off of two pretty tough seasons, we would welcome that. And so obviously, if that continued, that would put Outdoor on a growth trajectory. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Timothy Wojs : I was just hoping maybe you could expand a little bit on the DEWALT growth. Just maybe some color on the underlying drivers of growth there, just whether it's kind of organic user kind of growth and expansion or just inventory availability or Outdoor, just some color there and maybe the sustainability of the growth trajectory. And then maybe just as you think about SG&A reinvestment this year, just how much are you specifically looking at kind of reinvesting that into DEWALT specifically versus some of the other brands? Christopher Nelson : Well, thanks a lot, Tim. This is Chris. So first of all, I'd say that we're we are encouraged by what we're seeing from DEWALT on the growth side. And it was something that has been a continued bright spot in the portfolio, and we expect it to continue to gather momentum. If I would think about where the sources of growth are coming from, I would say that, first and foremost, the progress that we've made as a part of our supply chain transformation and allowing higher fill levels and service rates for our customers is certainly driving more momentum there.  Secondarily, I think if we think about the ongoing sustainability and trajectory of that growth, as we have been pivoting our dollars and investments into more of the pro-driven end user, not only product development but also engagement in the marketplace and really highlighting the DEWALT brand, I think that, that is something that we see as a long-term sustainable trend and actually something that we're going to continue to put a lot of those investments into.  And while I'll turn it over to the path of specifics, what I'd say as far as the investments and where they're going, really, if you think about it, we're -- the majority of it is going into development -- product development and activation, where we're saying we want to be making sure that we're developing the innovative products for our professional end users, specifically driving a lot of innovation in DEWALT.  And then also, having a significant amount of that investment going into activation resources that can work with our end users and our partners in the field to make sure that they are able to understand launch and drive the success of those products as well. So we feel very good about the sustainability and we're encouraged by the progress we're making with this -- with the way that we're prioritizing here. I don't know, Pat, if you wanted to add anything there? Patrick Hallinan : Yes. I mean I think in terms of SG&A for the year, Tim, I think it's 21% in kind of the middle fractions, 21.5-ish plus or minus 20 basis points is kind of where SG&A is for the year. And as our opening comments mentioned, that's about $100 million of incremental investment. I'd say $60 million to $70 million of that in the Tools & Outdoor business. And as Chris mentioned, A lot of that is on innovation. And therefore, a healthy portion of that goes to DEWALT. And a lot of it is on field activation and so again, because DEWALT is the biggest brand out in the field, a lot of that ends up going to DEWALT. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Big picture question for Don and then maybe just some loose ends for Pat. But first, just -- sorry if I missed it at the beginning, but the after-tax proceeds on infrastructure, and then Pat also, can you just address what that other was in cash outflow of $250 million-ish in the quarter. And Don, I'm just wondering if you could speak maybe to the portfolio now more broadly with infrastructure, Don, as kind of the portfolio simplification in your view, behind the company now, and we're focused on these operational elements that remain central to the margin improvement plan or are there other things that maybe could happen here as you chart the path forward? Donald Allan : Sure, Jeff. Pat, maybe you take those questions and I'll answer Jeff's second question. Patrick Hallinan : Jeff, the after-tax proceeds on the infrastructure deal, I'd say the pretax are in the our 730-ish range. 730, 729 a fraction. And the tax impact to that will be de minimis, probably in the 10% or less range when is all said and done. And that all went down to pay the commercial paper balance down. And that all happened in the front of the second quarter.  Therefore, it's in the second quarter financials that you'll see 90 days down the road. In terms of other cash outflows, that is driven by, let's say, 2 things predominantly. There's many things in that bucket. One is a return to normal MICP or annual compensation, variable compensation payments, which go out in the first quarter.  You can imagine 2022 was very, very low by traditional standards. And so the payout for '22 that happened in '23 was very low by traditional standards. And the payout that happened in the first quarter of this year for '23 was kind of back to normal standards and then cash taxes. Those are the 2 big drivers of that outflow in the other bucket. Donald Allan : Thanks, Pat. And so on the portfolio question, as we all know, we've done a fair amount of work of pruning the portfolio of businesses here at Stanley Black & Decker, in particular, the Security segment, which had 2 businesses. And then in Industrial, we've done some things related to not only infrastructure, but oil and gas a little while back as well. We will continue to evaluate other things to prune going forward based on value creation opportunities. I think we've gotten ourselves down to a place where we have some very high-quality assets in our portfolio. And there's not an urgent need to do anything at this stage. As we look at the portfolio going forward, there will be more opportunities likely in the next 18 to 24 months to do a little bit more pruning. Some of it could actually be in Tools & Outdoor as we put more and more emphasis on the 3 big brands that Chris has talked about in a couple of different settings over the last 6 months. And we'll look at some of the smaller assets we have and decide whether those make sense for it to be part of the portfolio over the long term.  And so we will continue to be active. I think we've demonstrated over the years that pruning the portfolio is something that is important to do. but you need to do it in a way that creates value for your shareholders. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Michael Rehaut : I wanted to just kind of dial in a little bit more on how you're thinking about the demand trends playing out for the rest of the year in Tools & Storage. You have 1Q organic revenue growth down 1%. You're talking about the full year flat to maybe down a little bit as the most likely scenario. So are we to assume kind of the current trend more or less persisting through 2Q and the back half? And I'm also curious about how in the first quarter, you had the 7% drop in hand tools and storage, if there was any inventory destocking or anything going on that drove that adjustment? Separately, if I can sneak in another one on the mid-21% SG&A, if that's something where just given the backdrop and your goals around share gains over the next couple of years, if we should think about that as a sustainable rate over the next 12, 18, 24 months? Patrick Hallinan : Mike, this is Pat. I'll take your kind of balance of the year revenue flows and SG&A, and then I'll let Chris expand on a few things. I think as you think of year-over-year revenue for the balance of the year, I think any given quarter is going to be in that down 50 to down 200 basis points across the quarter, probably averaging down 1-ish for the year, if I had to kind of point you in a direction for the balance of the year.  And any one of those quarters, the difference probably more to do with year-over-year comps and promotional activity or currency then some really noteworthy demand dynamic that we're expecting to change from one quarter to the next. I'd say in terms of the SG&A at kind of 21.5-ish percent, I think that's likely where we are in a year like this where we're being thoughtful to manage expenses across our enterprise, while preserving growth investments to still deliver profit and cash on our transformation journey. And I certainly think, as you look longer term, that could be a sustainable percentage as well. We have talked about in a number of forms over the last year or 2 that once we start seeing the market growth and we're a bit farther down the AGM journey, we may choose for a period of time to take that percentage to 22% or potentially even a little above 22% for a while as we invest for growth on the backs of a little more gross margin and macro demand. We're not quite there yet.  So I think kind of managing in that 21% and a fraction range for this year and for the long term is probably a decent modeling assumption. But like we've said, we may choose at periods of time to go to 22% plus when we feel that there's good returns for those growth investments. Christopher Nelson : Yes. So if I take a step back and talk a little bit about where we see the markets from a macro perspective for the year. I think that what we're talking about is within it's a very tight range, up a point, down a point, and we're kind of thinking that we're trending towards.  And there are specific areas that remain tepid, specifically, if we think about we've talked about the challenges in the outdoor market. We're encouraged by what we're seeing early. But we haven't hit the season yet for really any of our businesses. And specifically in outdoor.  And then as is widely understood, the DIY and in some areas, general construction remains a little bit muted as well. That being said, we do see some bright spots as we look at the professional markets and as the earlier conversation, as we hone in on where we're going to really look for driving share and investments, a lot of our opportunities are there. So we remain optimistic there.  I would just say, although there are certainly scenarios that you could see some level of back half acceleration, we think it's prudent to be looking at the outlook that we discussed earlier. Because really, if you think about it, a lot of our businesses are fairly interest-rate-sensitive and with the current environment and how we're thinking about what we see for residential, construction as well as renovation there certainly will be an unlock coming. I think it's just a matter of timing. And we think it's prudent to be looking at more of that flattish revenue environment for those reasons. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : So I just want to come back to the Jeff's question on the portfolio. I don't think that perhaps the industrial businesses -- with the remaining Industrial businesses, the fastening businesses were trending as more noncore. It doesn't sound like that's necessarily the case. So that's my primary question. But if I could just add on to that. Just want to confirm that the Infrastructure business have been the guide for 1Q. And then the stranded costs from that -- from the Infrastructure businesses is that impacting the margin progression with balance of the year? Is that material? Do you need to consider that? Patrick Hallinan : Nigel, this is Pat. I'll take the infrastructure and then pass it back to Don on portfolio.  The infrastructure sale in April was always in our guide. And so our original guide and our current guide account for a very early April sale of infrastructure, which we always assumed was going to be in our Q1 results as a continuing operation and then out of our results effectively from April 2 or thereabouts on.  And so there's nothing to adjust in the guide. The guide is the guide. And the -- we planned our cost structure this year to deal with the fact that there would be fixed cost in the Industrial business that had previously been supporting that business.  And the Industrial team has been doing a great job, both gaining share in the remaining businesses they have, especially in auto and aero and managing their cost structure proactively to deliver roughly flat margins on the year, maybe slight improvement even though they had a sizable business to part this year. Donald Allan : Yes. And the question on the portfolio, Nigel, and specifically around industrial. So what we're left with after the sale of Infrastructure is the Engineered Fastening business that we acquired with Black & Decker a few other fastening businesses we acquired since then. And then, of course, CAM, the Aerospace Fastener business is in there as well.  When we look at the different portions of that, One, there's pieces that certainly could be evaluated for the word I use pruning in the future in the next 18 to 24 months, and we will continue to look at that. The overall platform of Engineered Fastening is still a very substantial portion of Stanley Black & Decker. It contributes a significant amount to the EBITDA, to the cash flow of the company. And as the Tools & Outdoor portion of the business, the company continues to improve and EBITDA continues to grow as we improve our gross margins back up to 35% or more.  As we get back to gaining market share and organic growth in a much more substantial way, it will provide us more flexibility further down the road to decide ultimately what do we do with the entirety of the Engineered Fastening business.  But I think if you think about it in chunks of time in the next 18 to 24 months, there's probably opportunity to do a little pruning in industrial. And then beyond 24 months, it's a question of do you do something more substantial from a capital allocation point of view? Time will tell. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Zelman & Associates. Adam Baumgarten : Just a question on POS, what you saw throughout the quarter and into April at this point. Christopher Nelson : So POS was, I'd say, in Q1, it was negative, but in line with our plan or largely in line with our plan. And we remain fairly confident in supporting the outlook that we have for the balance of the year. As noted, we have seen some progress and pick up with a little bit earlier start to the season from the outdoor perspective that as of late has given a little bit more strength to POS and what we're trying to see now is how much of that carries through and how that continues to ramp up as we get further into the season.  But the highlight would be that we're fairly in line with projections from what we're seeing with POS, and we're encouraged with the areas of progress we're seeing from some nice movement on growth with some of our key brands. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Joseph O'Dea: Just wanted to ask on Outdoor and as you see a more traditional start to the season, just any context on how you're thinking about 2024 demand in outdoor relative to 2019, trying to understand whether this is a return to a more normal demand environment? And then also thinking about what a normal environment means for Outdoor margins relative to where we are today to appreciate how much margin upside there could be there on just volume coming back. Donald Allan : Yes. So there's a lot of good questions in there related to the Outdoor business. And as a commentary on the margin, the -- I would say that in my presentation, we talked about 80% of the company being above kind of line average right now, at or above. And the other 20%, which is really made up of Outdoor and CAM or Aerospace Fasteners.  The outdoor portion of the business, yes, it is below line average, but there's an opportunity to do a couple of things. One, right now, we're really adjusting the cost base for the new demand environment of what we've experienced over the last 12 to 15 months and dramatically lower demand in Outdoor, that's taking place over the next quarter or 2. The second phase of this will really be looking at some of the pruning activities that I described, what portions of the business do we want to be and which portion do we not want to be in. We think that the path to continue to improve the profitability of Outdoor. And that's something we'll continue to focus on over the coming quarters and into next year.  As far as the more detailed questions, I don't know if Pat or Chris, if you want to grab that? Patrick Hallinan : Yes. I'd say on the volume, this year is certainly still going to be down substantially versus 2019 even if the shape of the trend line starts and starts to look more like a normal trend line. The absolute volume in dollars will be down substantially from 2019. And I would still say that most likely next year would be below 2019 as well, but starting to recover.  And to Don's comment the big headwind in this business has been the volume retrenching more than we would have anticipated a year or 2 ago. And so a lot of our actions are both around the fixed cost base and then what we can do with product cost structure to drive profit improvement in that business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : Maybe just focusing on pricing a little bit. I think the original expectation was for a price to be kind of slightly negative in Tools & Outdoor in the first half, and it looks like maybe it came in a bit better than that in the quarter. So can you just talk about the expectation for price for the rest of the year as well as what you guys are seeing from a competitive perspective? Christopher Nelson : Yes. This is Chris. So Nicole, I'd say overall, what we're looking at for the year is price/cost neutral. And if we look at all the -- we try to sum up all the basket of goods and input costs we have, I'd say that we're -- we're looking at what would be a mildly inflationary environment, but we're going to be price/cost neutral in that environment. And as I take a little bit of a broader lens on that from a price cost perspective. I think it's important to remember that we had a pretty unique set of circumstances in 2022, where we were really hitting the peak of some historically high inflationary environments as -- and those input costs were going up significantly as our volume was peaking and starting to retrench.  So if I take a broader look and a longer duration, we've still kind of only recouped 85-ish percent of that overall cost that we've absorbed. So we're certainly working on making sure that we can improve our pricing processes to be more quickly reactive to inflationary environments as well as more importantly, driving innovation so that we can be putting products in there that earn because of their differentiation accretive margin rates. And then as I think about the competitive environment that we're seeing, thus far, we're seeing a stable environment. We're continuing to look at getting back to, and are more back to historical promotional levels, but that's healthy. And we're looking at those promotions in some important categories to us. And specifically, we've talked about the importance of being able to be promoting our cordless DEWALT products. So we feel comfortable where we are, and we think that the environment remains stable. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Robert Wertheimer : I have another question on the Outdoor side. I think you made positive comment on market share for DEWALT, I suppose more on the tool side. I wanted to hear how you think you're positioned on breadth of portfolio and status of innovation, et cetera, on Outdoor? Do you need more investment to kind of achieve the same share gain? What do you think the season hold? And then it may be very early for the second part of the question, but any split on big ticket versus small ticket in Outdoor? Just budget sensitivity among your customers? Donald Allan : So I think that we feel well positioned with our outdoor portfolio. And I think, as I've stated previously is what we're really wanting to do is make sure that we're driving the prioritization of our innovation dollars into the categories that we think that we have the biggest opportunity for share gain as well as that are margin accretive. And specifically, we've been really looking at growing our presence in the outdoor handheld electric market. And that's showing great lines of progress. And I would say that we're -- year-to-date, we're feeling good about where we are from a market perspective. And with some of the listings that we've picked up, we feel good about where we are trending from a share perspective as well.  As far as bigger ticket versus small ticket, certainly, in today's environment, we've seen that there are some levels of hesitation from the consumer and from any end user in the bigger ticket items. And we'll continue to monitor that.  But like I said earlier, we're cautiously optimistic with how the season is starting, and we're going to continue to make sure that we're driving innovation into those areas that we believe are going to be important and accretive for us in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David S. MacGregor: I guess I just wanted to ask a question relating to progress on supply chain transformation and specifically tariffs. And can you just talk about what's changed in your sourcing and procurement operations since the -- around on tariffs? And if hypothetically, I guess if all of the import tariffs that were imposed back and I don't know, 2017, 2018 when all that was going on, if they were all reimposed tomorrow, how much different would your total tariff expense be versus what you reported last time around? Donald Allan : Sure. So I'll probably have a little PTSD thinking about tariffs back in 2016. But if we go -- maybe do a little bit of history here. So we experienced about $300 million of tariffs back in that time frame and made substantial production moves in response to that, which mitigated it down probably to about $100 million, maybe a little less than $100 million. And that $100 million or so was offset by price increases in the marketplace. Those tariffs are still in place today and have not changed even in the new administration or Biden administration. As we think about potential changes in the future, that could occur if there's a change in the administration in early '25.  The landscape for us has changed. So back in that timeframe, things that came -- that were sold in the U.S. that were made in China was about 40% of the U.S. revenue. Today, it's closer to 20%, 25%. So it's substantially lower. And as we continue to drive our supply chain transformation, I mentioned on the call last quarter, that we continue to build out what we call centers of excellence for manufacturing that are in different geographies around the world. Some of them will be in Asia, not necessarily in China, but in other parts of Asia. Some are being built or have been built in the Americas and some in Eastern Europe. And we will continue to build upon that, to try to -- if something changes with tariffs in '25 or beyond, we will be able to mitigate that through supply chain moves or actions. At the same time, we likely -- if that occurs, we'd likely have to do some surgical price actions as well as another lever to address. So we continue to build on the plans of what we could do or would do as we head into '25. We've started that planning about 3 months ago, and we will continue to work on that. The good news is it's really embedded more into the supply chain transformation program than it is some separate activity that we're looking at. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Eric Bosshard : A follow-up, if I could. Hand Tools down 7%. I'm just curious, a little bit more color there. And then also as you think about where retail inventories are now and the path forward, what retailer's mindset is about inventories and what they're ordering relative to what they're selling. Christopher Nelson : So I'll start with the second question, first. As far as our inventories in the retail channel, we're at -- essentially at historical levels, if not in some areas, a little bit below. So we're seeing a pretty good direct read on the correlation between what we see in POS and what we see going in from sales. And I think that's a good position to be in. And we're like we said, we're on relatively on plan for what we're seeing from POS. As far as Hand Tools, I would say that there's nothing that's a tremendous outlier there. I would say that there are some parts that are in the Hand Tools and Storage business that are, to the earlier comments, some larger ticket buys. And those have been more sensitive in the short term to some of kind of the consumer environment. But overall, we feel good about where that business is tracking. Good about the POS as well, and as well the inventory levels are similar to what we've seen across the business. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Thanks, Shannon. We'd like to thank everyone again for their time and participation on the call. Obviously, just please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lang, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2024 second quarter webcast. Here today, in addition to myself, is Don Allan, President and CEO; Chris Nelson, COO, EVP, and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan, EVP and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 :00 A.M., today. This morning. Don, Chris and Pat will review our second quarter results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcasts, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's, therefore, possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and our most recent 34 Act filing. Additionally, we may also reference non-GAAP financial measures during the call. For applicable reconciliations to the related GAAP financial measure and additional information, please refer to the appendix of the supplemental presentation and the corresponding press release, which are available on our website under the IR section. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan. Donald Allan : Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in this morning's release, we extended our trajectory of solid execution on our operational priorities, which drove gross margin improvement versus the prior year and very strong cash generation in the second quarter. It is also extremely satisfying to report that we delivered organic growth this quarter. As you are aware there was a significant demand normalization post-pandemic that required a recalibration of inventory for us and our customers. We believe that we have stabilized our share position in the marketplace. And this quarter we capitalized on the strengths of the DEWALT plan and supportive pockets of end market demand to deliver positive organic revenue growth in the period. Our priorities remain consistent at this stage of our transformation. And this morning you will hear tangible progress in each of these key areas of focus. First, we continue to drive profitability improvement through the significant transformation of our supply chain to achieve our target of 35% plus gross margins. Next, we experienced strong free cash flow generation and significant balance sheet strength improvement. And finally, new investments to stimulate sustainable growth are increasing with the primary aim of reinvigorating share gain to achieve organic growth at two times to three times the market. We continue to be energized by the compelling long-term growth opportunities in our industry and believe in our ability to capture their value. Yet we remain clear eyed about the near-term environment and expect mixed demand trends to continue in 2024 across our markets. As we capture the savings from the cost structure improvements, which are broadly in our control, we will be measured and disciplined as we selectively invest in the parts of our business that offer the best prospects for growth. We are focused on how we outperform the market to gain share and are pleased by the green shoots emerging in various channels. So while our markets will be choppy for the short-term, we are building the processes and structure to create a sustainable growth operating model which will ensure we significantly benefit from the long-term growth opportunities in the industries we serve. I have asked Chris to describe how we are both thoughtfully and aggressively pursuing our growth agenda in Tools & Outdoor, which he will discuss in further detail this morning. Our global cost reduction program remains on track for expected run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025. Our teams continue to accelerate savings actions, which have successfully delivered $1.3 billion of run rate savings program to-date. These results reinforce our confidence in achieving our 35% plus adjusted gross margin goal. I am confident that by executing on our transform strategy, we are positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth, profitability and cash flow, which will drive strong long-term shareholder returns. Now, turning to second quarter results, we delivered $4 billion of revenue, down 3% versus the prior year. This includes 1% of organic growth, which was led by DEWALT, the outdoor product categories and Engineered Fastening. This was more than offset by a 3% drag from the infrastructure divestiture and 1% of currency. Adjusted gross margin was 29.2%, up 560 basis points versus the second quarter of last year. Our supply chain transformation was a major contributor to this improvement. It has strong momentum that we expect to carry through the back half and into 2025. Adjusted EBITDA margins returned to double-digits and were 10.7%, which is a five point improvement versus prior year. This was driven by our gross margin expansion, offset by deliberate increases in growth investments. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.09 for second quarter. Free cash flow in the quarter approached $0.5 billion, primarily due to accelerated working capital improvements, the strong cash generation, along with proceeds from the infrastructure divestiture, contributed $1.2 billion of debt reduction in the quarter. We continue to prioritize improving balance sheet health, and in a few moments, Pat will address our plans for more progress over the next 18 months. As we delever, we are also maintaining our commitment to returning value to our shareholders and to that end, our Board of Directors approved a modest increase to our quarterly cash dividend, which is now $0.82 per share. Finally, we are raising our 2024 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.10 at the midpoint to a range of $3.70 up to $4.50 and increasing our free cash flow guidance to $650 million up to $850 million. Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. I want to thank our team members for their collaboration and focus as we continue to make substantial progress on our transform plan and achieve our interim financial goals we established about two years ago. I will now pass it to Chris Nelson to review the business segment performance. Chris? Christopher Nelson : Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor, second quarter revenue was approximately $3.5 billion with 1% organic growth versus prior year. DEWALT delivered another strong quarter, generating its fifth consecutive quarter of organic growth. DEWALT's performance, combined with a stronger outdoor season drove 2% volume growth. We are particularly encouraged by this result, given the soft consumer backdrop. Total revenue was flat as volume benefits were offset by 1% of currency in addition to 1% of price, which was consistent with our plan to support DEWALT cordless promotions. We are now back in line with historical levels of seasonal promotions. Second quarter adjusted segment margin was 10.4%, a 590 basis point improvement compared to last year. We delivered year-over-year margin expansion through lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation savings and shipping cost reductions, which were partially offset by targeted investments designed to accelerate share gain and organic growth. Turning to product lines for the second quarter. Power tools declined 2% organically, driven by the consumer DIY category. Hand tools organic revenue was flat with new DEWALT product introductions driving increased product listings with our customers. Outdoor organic revenue grew 6% with strong retail volume growth, driven by handheld cordless outdoor power equipment and incremental retail product listings. Turning to Tools & Outdoor performance by region. North America generated 1% organic growth, driven by the same factors as the overall segment. Second quarter US retail point-of-sale demand was up modestly versus the prior year, led by outdoor and regain DEWALT cordless promotions. In Europe organic revenue was down 3% as declines in France and Italy were partially offset by growth in the UK, the Nordics and Iberia. We are prioritizing investments and new product listings to grow market share and overcome the macro softness that is affecting this region's economy. To round out geographic performance for the quarter all other regions in aggregate grew 5% organically. This was driven by double-digit growth in Latin America, led by Brazil, along with high single-digit growth in India. In summary, for Tools & Outdoor, the quarter was highlighted by a return to organic growth with a meaningful step-up to segment margin. Now moving to Industrial. Second quarter Industrial revenue declined 20% versus last year, which was nearly all due to the infrastructure divestiture. Price contributed positive 2% to growth, offset by a 2% currency headwind. The Engineered Fastening business grew 2% organically, driven by aerospace growth, which more than offset the market softness in automotive and customer destocking in general industrial. The Aerospace business grew 24% organically, supported by new business wins and a strong booking rate. The Industrial adjusted segment margin was 13.5%, an improvement of 50 basis points versus prior year, driven by price realization and cost control. I'd like to thank our teams around the world for their dedication to delivering another solid performance in the second quarter. Their focused efforts delivered organic growth and margin expansion across both business segments. Moving to the next slide. As I reflect on my first year here at Stanley Black & Decker, much of my time and energy has been directed towards learning about our end users' and channel partners' priorities and how to both efficiently and effectively accelerate the next phase of Tools & Outdoor organic growth and market share gains. It's clear to me that we have four essential attributes for success. One, an industry with strong long-term growth characteristics. Two, iconic brands. Three, a differentiated innovation engine. And four, deep customer relationships and loyal end users. I have strong conviction that we can create long-term value by capturing the commercial opportunities ahead of us, both now and into the future. To capture these opportunities, we are funding investments both by redirecting existing resources towards the most promising opportunities as well as investing incremental dollars consistent with the $300 million to $500 million range that Don and Pat have referenced on previous occasions. Along with market-facing priorities, I've also been focused on our team putting in place the right capabilities and skills to execute our strategy. I am pleased to have my new organization established with a leadership team consisting of seasoned Stanley Black & Decker veterans complemented by external talent who bring fresh perspectives. They are all in place in driving forward momentum. The valuable breadth and depth of knowledge across the leadership team and organization is allowing us to activate our strategy with urgency. We are prioritizing our resources on the highest impact opportunities which we believe are serving the professional end user within our most attractive market. Over the past 12 months, as we continue to streamline and focus our business, we've doubled down on being brand-led and are prioritizing DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN and STANLEY. These powerful brands have significant scale in the marketplace and strong brand equity with end users. By continuing to strengthen these brands and maximizing brand health, we can capitalize on their potential for long-term growth, share gain and margin improvement. Turning to innovation. We view our long-standing ability to listen to end users and to deliver purpose-built innovation as a core differentiating capability. We are laser-focused on driving innovation to help solve the most pressing challenges our professional end users face, namely finding ways to improve their safety and productivity on the job site while ensuring they have robust tools to help deliver the high-quality craftsmanship their customers expect. Our core brands have been synonymous with delivering this type of value to job sites for many years, and we will continue to push the boundaries of these solutions as enhancing safety and productivity on the job site has never been more relevant to the professional end user. For example, we announced the next evolution in battery technology this quarter, the DEWALT XR POWERPACK 8 AH Battery with tabless cell technology. This joins the reinvigorated XR line, which houses the best-performing 20-volt MAX batteries and power tools from DEWALT. This battery technology conducts more energy, delivers more power output and has a longer lifespan, which enhances end-user productivity. We also introduced the DEWALT TOUGHSERIES Construction Jack, a tool designed to increase productivity by giving one person, the confidence and security to lift, level and hold material without assistance. With up to 340 pounds of lift capacity and fine-tuning adjustment features, this tool is a must-have for any end user. Market activation is another investment priority and growth opportunity. We are more aggressively activating our core brands through amplified digital product marketing and additional field resources, both with the goal of extending the reach and impact of our brands and innovation. We expect our elevated marketing efforts behind DEWALT, coupled with support to grow the trades through grants, scholarships and tool donations will broaden user engagement and brand ambassadorship. These sales and marketing initiatives are funded with new investment dollars and reallocation of resources, which illustrates our prioritization efforts towards our best prospects for growth. In addition to delivering cost savings and driving margin improvement, which you have heard from Don, our supply chain transformation is also an enabler of growth, enhancing operational efficiency and achieving 35% plus adjusted gross margin unlocks incremental optionality to invest even more behind our brands and to accelerate the virtuous cycle of organic growth. We believe that our emphasis on operational excellence in combination with the structural changes we are making to our production and distribution network which are the crux of our supply chain transformation can become a sustainable growth enabler for the company as we serve our customers and end users with excellence and speed. In addition, the continuous improvement capabilities we are strengthening as a part of this transformation will serve as a sustainable engine to help generate recurring productivity to self-fund the business and our brands. In summary, while the near-term market demand environment remains mixed, we are optimistic about the long-term growth opportunities in our industry. We are aggressively moving forward to accelerate the growth of our powerful brands with our end users and customers around the globe. We have a talented team deployed that is moving with speed and a clear mandate, executing our transformation plan and accelerating share gain. This simple but powerful mandate energizes our team as we work to position ourselves to win in the marketplace. Thank you and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan. Patrick Hallinan : Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Turning to the next slide. We're two years into our transformation journey and are continuing to make meaningful progress each quarter. I would like to highlight our accomplishments during the second quarter and how we intend to meet our objectives with continued focus and intensity during the back half of 2024 and beyond. We achieved approximately $150 million of pre-tax run rate cost savings in the quarter, bringing our aggregate savings to approximately $1.3 billion since program inception. Our performance represents strong execution. On a year-to-date basis, we are tracking to plan, driven by strategic sourcing actions. We are diligently capturing cost efficiencies to counter the soft demand backdrop. I am pleased to say the savings we generated in the first half support the second half gross margin expansion included in our guidance. More on that later. We continue to target $1.5 billion of pre-tax run rate savings by the year-end of 2024 and $2 billion of pre-tax run rate savings by the end of 2025. We are on track to achieve both targets. As a reminder, the biggest areas where we see savings opportunities are strategic sourcing, operations excellence, footprint actions and complexity reduction. Strategic sourcing remains the largest contributor to our transformation savings to-date. We are actioning $5 billion of addressable spend across areas such as materials and components, finished goods and indirect expenditures. Operations excellence is the next area of opportunity. Our initiatives are driving productivity improvements that translate into tangible results. This initiative encompasses our manufacturing operating model and leverages lean principles. In 2024, this has been particularly effective in reducing downtime and improving labor efficiency. We have a robust pipeline of projects lined-up to deliver savings this year and beyond. Turning to footprint-related projects and product platforming. We are optimizing our distribution footprint as well as redesigning our manufacturing network to leverage scale and centers of excellence as we maximize operational efficiency. This multiyear endeavor continues to progress as planned and we expect to exit or transform a number of facilities across the globe over the next 18 months. We are well underway with our platforming strategy, which identifies methods to standardize parts and components across product families to eliminate complexity and to improve procurement scale. We are incorporating this strategy into our product development process across power tools and outdoor products with significant opportunities across DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN and zero-turn mowers. This exciting program is in the early innings and we believe it can be a source of material productivity well beyond 2025. In aggregate, our supply chain transformation initiatives are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024, achieve a full year gross margin of 30% and fund additional growth investments in our core business. I would like to commend the organization for diligently pursuing the goals of our transformation. This journey would not be possible without everyone's contributions. We are developing the sustainable cost structure and operational efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments. Moving to the next slide. Two main areas of focus this year are generating free cash flow and expanding gross margins to support long-term growth and value creation. We generated a historically strong $486 million of free cash flow in the second quarter of 2024. This brings our year-to-date free cash flow to approximately neutral. Our performance was supported by approximately $400 million of accelerated working capital improvements, which were realized earlier in 2024 versus our initial plan. We continued to make progress on our inventory levels and sequentially reduced our inventory balance by approximately $100 million this quarter. Inventory days remained below 150 and are moving toward our long-term target of approximately 120 to 130 days. The remainder of the working capital favorability was a result of improved accounts receivable and accounts payable balances versus our plan. Our strong free cash flow, along with the net proceeds from the infrastructure sale enabled $1.2 billion of commercial paper reduction during the second quarter. The strong momentum in the first half and a modest reduction to our capital spending expectations gives us the confidence to raise our full year free cash flow guidance range to $650 million to $850 million, up from our prior range of $600 million to $800 million. We expect second half free cash flow in excess of the dividend to support an additional $400 million to $500 million of short-term debt reduction by year-end, which will result in a total debt balance that is a little over $6 billion. In 2025, we are targeting further deleveraging through free cash flow generation, coupled with the funds generated by strategic portfolio pruning actions. Our goal for the year-end 2025 is total debt in the low $5 billion zone, inclusive of inorganic cash generation. This plan enables us to achieve our desired leverage metrics and is consistent with the discussions with our rating agencies. Another item of note, this past quarter, we proactively renegotiated the company's core credit facilities, securing access to significant liquidity to support the company's ongoing transformation. We prioritize maintaining investment-grade credit ratings and have access to $3.5 billion in credit facilities backed by a long-standing, well-capitalized and diversified bank group. Our capital allocation priorities remain investing in our organic growth and our transformation, funding our long-standing cash dividend to return value to shareholders and further strengthening our balance sheet. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin was 29.2% in the second quarter, a 560 basis point improvement versus prior year, driven by lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs. In the first half of 2024, we improved adjusted gross margin by 40 basis points sequentially versus second half 2023 consistent with our plan. We are planning for further sequential improvement in the second half of this year with adjusted gross margin expected to approximate 31%. Our second half step-up is supported by our supply chain transformation savings, which are and have been tracking to plan. This plan puts us on a path to deliver our long-held transformation goal of approximately 30% full year 2024 adjusted gross margin and exit the year in the low 30s. We continue to be on a solid trajectory of adjusted gross margin improvement against a challenging macro backdrop. Our momentum gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our gross margin objectives for 2024 and achieve 35% plus adjusted gross margin within the transformation time horizon. Now turning to our 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. In addition to the updated free cash flow guidance I just shared, we are revising GAAP earnings per share range to $0.90 to $2 and raising adjusted earnings per share range to $3.70 to $4.50. The GAAP earnings per share revision is primarily a result of incorporating the second quarter environmental reserve expense of approximately $155 million into the range. Adjusted earnings per share is being revised $0.10 higher at the midpoint. Our outlook factors in a soft macro environment in the second half. We are leveraging the cost savings within our control to offset this and generate second half adjusted EBITDA growth versus the prior year. The EPS improvement at the midpoint passes along a portion of the second quarter operating outperformance and includes lower back half interest expense due to accelerated deleveraging. Our midpoint assumption for full year organic revenue is expected to be down 0.5 percentage point. This contemplates the continuation of the stretched consumer in Tools & Outdoor along with a declining automotive production backdrop in Industrial. Our sales range contemplates plus or minus 130 basis points, which is the primary area of adjusted earnings per share variability. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor full year organic revenue is expected to decline 1% at the midpoint plus or minus low single-digits, with a range of variability similar to the total company. Pricing for Tools & Outdoor is expected to be relatively flat for the full year, which is consistent with what we are seeing in the market today. The Industrial segment organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive as aero fasteners growth is partially pressured by global automotive OEM light vehicle production headwind. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and remain committed to funding and reprioritizing investments for long-term organic growth. Our planning assumption for innovation, brand, marketing activation and technology growth investments remains an incremental $100 million in 2024. Our expectation for full year SG&A as a percentage of sales is to be in the mid-21% zone. Turning to profitability. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to approximate 10% for the full year, supported by savings from the transformation program. Adjusted segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year, also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial adjusted segment margin is expected to be flat to slightly positive versus the prior year as operating improvements and cost controls in Engineered Fastening are offset by the dilution from the Infrastructure business divestiture. Our adjusted earnings per share range is $0.80 with variability in market demand being the largest contributor. We will work to optimize adjusted gross margin and manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year to balance the macro uncertainty while working hard to preserve investments to position the business for long-term growth. Turning to other elements of our guidance. GAAP earnings include pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $445 million to $495 million largely related to the supply chain transformation program as well as the second quarter environmental expense. The adjusted tax rate is expected to be 10% for the full year with the third quarter approximating 20% and a benefit in the fourth quarter. Our 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the third quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 25% of the full year at the midpoint. In summary, looking forward, we remain focused on executing our supply chain improvements to further improve gross margin and earnings in the second half of 2024 and our progress to-date supports our improved full year adjusted earnings and free cash flow outlook. We remain confident that our actions to drive toward our target of 35% plus adjusted gross margin, while funding additional organic revenue growth investments will continue to generate positive results. Our top priorities remain delivering margin expansion, generating cash and further strengthening the balance sheet to position the company for long-term growth and value creation. With that I will now pass the call back to Don. Donald Allan : Thank you, Pat. As you heard this morning, the company is making meaningful progress across our key priorities of margin improvement, cash generation and balance sheet health, while also investing in future sustainable growth. We are moving with speed and delivering results in a macro environment that has not been supportive, but we are confident that it will turn from a headwind to a tailwind in the future. Until then, we are focused on consistent execution while positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth, improved profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder returns. We are now ready for Q&A, Dennis. Dennis Lange : Great. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start the Q&A, please. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Donald Allan : Good morning. Julian Mitchell : Good morning. Maybe just a question around the earnings trajectory. So it looks like sort of EPS is guided to be flattish sequentially in Q3 and then up, I think, $0.40 or so sequentially in the fourth quarter. So understand the sort of tax rate movement from 20% to negative tax in Q4, but maybe if you could flesh out any of the moving parts around sort of revenue and margin for the third and fourth quarter. And on that tax rate point, what's a good kind of placeholder for next year, please? Patrick Hallinan : Hey, Julian, it's Pat. Yes, you have it correct. That's the correct EPS flow. I'd say the fourth quarter seasonal revenue impact is what drives the revenue and OM in the fourth quarter. So you're slightly north of $3.5 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter. And you're probably in between $300 million and $330 million in the OM range in the quarter with the flow in the third quarter, obviously rounding out the back half of the year. The third quarter is seasonally strong as some of the holiday shipments start humming around the September time frame. In terms of the tax drivers, as we've said before, these were some of the things that were in motion and affecting tax last year in '23, a set of discrete planning items that were put in motion even early stages of COVID and before. And so it will play out through this year and a bit into next year. I'd say for next year, we're probably in the high teens, approaching 20% range would be my guidance for tax for next year. We're obviously not at '25 guidance yet, but that would be kind of the ZIP code I would expect to be in. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open. Timothy Wojs : Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning. Donald Allan : Good morning. Timothy Wojs : Nice to see volume growth in tools. Maybe on that kind of topic, Don, just maybe if you can give us a little bit of an update just on the operating environment. It doesn't seem like a lot has changed, but kind of curious on your opinion there and just how your retailers are kind of thinking about kind of the promotional period at the end of the year. And then you guys mentioned in your prepared remarks a few times product listing ads and product focused ads there. If you could maybe just talk about some of the investments and where some of the priorities are and just maybe where you're kind of focused on adding incremental shelf space. Christopher Nelson : All right. Hey, Tim, this is Chris. Nice hearing from you and good morning as well. As far as the first part of the question from an operating environment perspective, as the guidance would indicate, we're essentially expecting the back half to have a similar operating environment as the front half. And we are dialed in to be back up to our run rate level of promotional support in the back half of the year. We feel very excited about what we've got laid in with our retailers and especially with our ability to drive more promotion and demand in our accretive cordless power tool segment. So that's what we're kind of looking at for the back half. As far as in that environment, what is really important is, and that we're -- as you heard from Don, we are absolutely committed to is executing our strategy. So if you think about what's going to really drive our performance in the back half and beyond, it's going to be continuing that supply chain transformation that allows us to not only drive margin accretion, but as our service levels continue to improve, we're getting more opportunities to take share and shelf space in that environment as we fulfil better for our customers. And then if we think about the investments, what we are committed to do with the investments that we're -- and the incremental margins that we're generating is to make sure that we funnel those to our highest growth priorities. Specifically, we've been talking about how we want to make sure with STANLEY, CRAFTSMAN and DEWALT, we are focusing on those brands and specifically investing in both market activation from a digital marketing perspective as well as we've been working to add field resources to make sure that we can work with our end users and our customers to make sure that they are -- understand our story, understand our products, and we can continue to get feedback on where we need to drive innovation. So that combination of the transformation with targeted investment that we're committed to, we've started to see some encouraging performance, especially as you've heard for the past couple of quarters with DEWALT. So we're going to stay committed to that and understand that we're going to navigate a fairly flat macro environment. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Sprague : Hey. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, with perhaps fingers crossed, right, getting close to some kind of cyclical bottom here on the consumer, the economy, rates, the whole thing, really want to kind of step back and get maybe a refresh perspective, Don, maybe starting with you, but just on what really normalized could look like. And the spirit of the question kind of goes, right, $2 billion in cost reduction is something like $11 a share, right? Investments of $200 million to $300 million is $2 or $3. So there's a lot of \"gross savings\" in that construct. But where is the leakage on a net basis, right? And as revenues recover maybe in the construct of that 35% gross margin, what really is kind of a realistic EBITDA margin on a normalized basis? Sorry for the philosophical question on an earnings call, but interested in your thoughts. Donald Allan : Well, it's actually a very good question, Jeff, because it's something that we spend time actually thinking about as we go into our annual strap planning cycle, which is just beginning now and be part of a Board presentation in October as we think through where we are in the transformation journey, the financial goals that we've established, what's the earnings potential for Stanley Black & Decker over the next three years and beyond. And so when you step back and begin to think that through, we clearly feel very good about where we are in the journey around transformation. We think 35% plus is still very achievable in that time horizon. We do believe as the markets begin to get stronger or stabilize and start to grow and in some time frame, I think, we're all wondering exactly what that time frame is, but let's presume that happens in the next year or so then we really think we're building an operating model around organic growth. As we said, that can grow two times to three times in the market. And so how do you define the market? We've done a lot of different analysis on this, and there's different ways to look at it in the short-term. But over the long-term, if you just look at GDP and say, can we grow two times to three times GDP over the long-term, we definitely think that is achievable. And so that puts you in a mid to high single-digit growth mode depending on GDP over the long-term. And then what's the ultimate leverage you're going to get from that growth or benefit into margins. And I still think this is a 40-ish percent business as you grow and you leverage the effect of that. We will continue to invest. We're seeing the benefits of investing. We said $300 million to $500 million, and it probably is going to trend closer to that $500 million number in the time horizon we've talked about. So the earnings potential is strong. I'm not necessarily going to throw a number out there and say, what do we think we can get to. But to say we can get back to where we were from an earnings point of view as a company does not scare any of us. It's just a question of the time horizon of that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Zelman & Associates. Your line is now open. Adam Baumgarten : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just curious if you could give us some color on point-of-sale trends through the quarter and into July, would be helpful. Christopher Nelson : Yes. This is Chris and nice to hear from you, Adam. Throughout the quarter as I think was mentioned earlier, point-of-sale was modestly positive. It was driven really the positive aspects were driven by an outdoor season that was more normally patterned as that season would look as well as the overperformance that we saw in DEWALT. As we finished out the quarter and the outdoor season at peak, we kind of saw them coming back more to that flattish type of perspective. And if you look at our back half, that's kind of what we think the market is going to look like in the back half as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Nicole DeBlase : Yeah, thanks for the question. Good morning, guys. Donald Allan : Good morning. Nicole DeBlase : Just wanted to ask about free cash flow. So Don, can you -- or Pat, can you guys talk about the cadence that you expect in the second half, given the timing shift into the second quarter. So thoughts on net working capital and other variables in the back half? Thank you. Patrick Hallinan : Yes. We're proud of the progress we made in the front half of the year. That progress was driven both by year-over-year income improvement, but also working capital improvement. The back half of the year is traditionally the strong part of the year. So we expect the drivers in the back half to remain income and working capital, but also a bit of CapEx. And I'd say by the time we get to the end of the year, the drivers of the beat on our initial guidance are going to be a mix of working capital and CapEx. And those drivers are going to be pretty much even between those two, will be roughly on our inventory target for the year. And I would say it's going to be pretty traditionally weighted in that it's going to be pretty balanced across those two quarters with a little bit towards the fourth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I'd be curious if you could just maybe unpack the 2Q -- the 1Q to 2Q gross margin, just given the divestment of infrastructure. I'm not sure if that was gross margin above fleet average or where that was and maybe the mix between the outdoor tool, sorry, the outdoor products versus power tools given that mega mix. Then maybe just looking at the second half of the year. You said 31%, I think, Pat. How do you think that 31% divides between 3Q and 4Q? Patrick Hallinan : Yes. I'll start with the latter part of that, Nigel, and then I'll come back to the other first half dynamics. I'd say we're very confident in delivering our year in gross margin and taking that progression into 2025. And I think that's the most critical message we want to get across. We'll finish the year at 30%. The fourth quarter will finish in the low 30s. We would expect the fourth quarter even with some of the seasonal dynamics of the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter is going to be north of 31%. And the third quarter is probably going to be at to slightly below 31%. I'd say those are ZIP codes. But those are all being driven off of the portfolio we have right now with the bias of progress at the gross margin line in the T&O business, which has been the case throughout this year and is likely to be the case heading into next year. In terms of the dynamics across Q1 and Q2, I'd say, there's less of a dynamic that is driven by the divestiture or any other movements. I mean the divestiture was modestly dilutive in that regard, but we had anticipated that when we set up the plan and set up the guidance. And really it's been playing out across the front half of the year was the fact that we had some volume softness in the back half of 2023 that always puts a little bit of unabsorbed overhead onto our balance sheet, which is unfavorable. And against that, we were raising an acceleration of program savings, which is what we've been up against for a while now as the macro has been soft on our margin improvement journey. And we've been successful in driving savings despite the soft macro. We expect to continue doing that throughout this year and into next year. And I think the dynamics that unfolded across the quarters were really those things coming off the balance sheet, an acceleration of savings relative to some softness in the back half of '23. And I think the really -- the favorable news is even with a stronger-than-expected outdoor performance, which is welcome from a revenue standpoint, we still deliver gross margin with strength coming from a segment that has gross margins slightly below fleet average. So we feel confident with the trajectory we're on. And we expect to continue to making progress and get into the mid-30s by the end of next year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is now open. Rob Wertheimer : Yes, hi. My question is on the consumer behavior. I think we all see some of the macro back and forth in other reports and such. But I'm curious what you're seeing in your internal data just to illustrate the consumer variability or weakness or uncertainty or whatever. And how much if any risk or the upside or downside, does that kind of put into back half? What's the variability around the trends you're seeing? Thank you. Christopher Nelson : Thanks, Rob. This is Chris. I mean we certainly have seen a continuance of the trend that we've seen where the professional is relatively stronger than the consumer. And we would expect that to continue. We have certainly, as you would expect in this environment, seeing consumers respond much more favorably to promotions, and that's good for us because we're -- we have an opportunity as we get back up to our normal run rate on promotions to benefit from that and benefit with accretive business. So we feel good about that and what we see from the opportunity with our merchandising in the back half. As far as what we see looking forward, I mean, it's going to be an uneven environment as we go forward. And we're going to stay really focused on our mission to execute against the supply chain transformation as well as we know the things that we're investing in with our major brands and specifically targeting the professional provides us some upside to the market that we're going to continue to stay diligent as we pursue. So we're excited about where we're heading and do see that dynamic that you referenced with the consumer. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning and congrats on the results. Just wanted to dial in a couple of areas, if I could. First, just to get a better understanding of it looks like a slight reduction of the midpoint of organic sales growth for the full year to down 50 basis points from maybe flattish before. And it would appear, correct me if I'm wrong, that perhaps you're also looking for tools and storage to go slightly negative again in the back half. So I just wanted to understand the drivers of that and if I'm correct on the back half. And then secondly, you also mentioned SG&A, mid-21% and maybe going to the higher end of the $300 million to $500 million in reinvestment. I was wondering if you had any early view on what 2025 SG&A could be given those comments around higher reinvestment into the business. Patrick Hallinan : Hey, Mike, it's Pat. Yes, I think you're reading the year right. We had a growth quarter. We're very proud of driving a growth quarter in a very soft macro. The drivers of that were, I'd say, more traditional outdoor season, especially at retail and especially with electric products and outdoor. DEWALT posted its fifth consecutive quarter of growth. And then we had a strong aero through the -- we had strong aero performance throughout the quarter. And auto didn't really start trailing off until late in the quarter. Our expectation for the back half and we're just trying to be clear eyed about the back half. We're not here to break some big new macro news. It's just we expect DIY to stay soft. It's been soft and now we're heading into the holiday period where that's more consequential. Auto, we started trailing off in the second quarter, the latter parts of the second quarter. We expect that to remain soft. And so that's it's really driving the back half. But you would be correct in interpreting the fact that we expect the T&O business to be down slightly in the back half kind of roughly averaging down 100-ish basis points across the back half really on the backs of a soft consumer during a holiday period and the fact that the outdoor season has mostly run its course. And then in Industrial, we expect aero to remain strong, but we do have some auto headwinds baked into that which has that business to slight growth, but less robust than would have otherwise been the case had auto not trailed off. The SG&A for the year is going to be slightly above 21%, I would say, for the year. As far as next year, I mean, we're not here to kind of give '25 guidance. I don't expect SG&A as a percentage of sales next year to depart from this year in some meaningful way. All we were trying to signal is that we really believe this is a growth business and we're going to invest behind growth and we're going to protect growth investments. And so Chris and his team and the broader organization is working to put growth behind the most promising elements of our business and even in a soft macro to protect those investments, but we're not trying to telegraph some meaningful departure of SG&A as a percentage of net sales this year or next. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Patrick Hallinan : Good morning. Christopher Nelson : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : So I've got a near-term and a longer-term question. On the near-term side, the commentary around getting to gross margins of approximately 31% by the third quarter, can you maybe just parse that out a little bit. If I look at things historically, it tends to be a seasonally lighter quarter and you typically don't see that much improvement 2Q to 3Q. And so I'd love to hear a little bit more about that. And then just the longer-term question is really more around like getting comfort with the timing of an eventual like volume inflection. And specifically like is there a way that you guys are tracking a replacement cycle and ultimately when we could see the timing of an inflection? Thank you. Patrick Hallinan : Hey, Joe, it's Pat. I'll start with the first one. I think reading our gross margin progression across time during this transformation has been complex because there's been so many factors in motion and some of them are what I would call atypical factors of when does expensive inventory come off the balance sheet. I would say the read of gross margin across fiscal 2024 is more a factor of it took a bit more of our savings in the latter part of '23 and the early part of '24 relative to soft volume to generate the gross margin improvement that we saw. And we had to accelerate savings throughout the latter part of '23 and throughout this whole year in a soft macro environment to get to our originally stated gross margin objectives throughout this whole journey. So Don and team laid out a road map in the latter part of 2022 that had us ending 2024 at roughly 30% and the fourth quarter in the low 30 percentile. But that was on a much, much more robust market and volume assumption. We're probably almost $1.5 billion in revenue down from that original 2022 assumption. So we've been accelerating savings to drive gross margin improvement. So the tick up from the first half of this year to the back half of this year has more to do with the savings cadence relative to longer-term margin dynamics than any kind of traditional seasonal dynamic. Christopher Nelson : All right. And for the second one, I think what I -- this is Chris. What I would say is that, first and foremost, we really like the end markets that we serve and we like them in the long-term. And we think that there's, as Don referenced, some really nice long-term GDP plus growth potential in those markets. But whether -- especially when you're talking about the professional and it's linked to whether it's residential or commercial and industrial construction. But I think it's safe to say that whether it's professional or the consumer, which you could argue, partially driven by repair and remodel are all fairly interest rate sensitive businesses, and that would be the precursor to what we think would be -- start the inflection point. And while it wouldn't be instantaneous, we think that is kind of the first thing in the cycle we'd want to see change that would then start to unlock some of that longer-term potential that we do see for those end markets that we serve. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Thanks, Shannon. We'd like to thank everyone again for their time and participation on the call. Obviously please contact me if you have further questions. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2024 Third Quarter Webcast. Here today, in addition to myself is Don Allan, President and CEO; Chris Nelson, COO, EVP and President, Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan, EVP and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today. This morning, Don, Chris and Pat will review our 2024 third quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we'll be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. And as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. Additionally, we may also reference non-GAAP financial measures during the call. For applicable reconciliations to the related GAAP financial measure and additional information, please refer to the appendix of the supplemental presentation and corresponding press release, which are available on our website under the IR section. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan. Donald Allan : Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. This quarter, our team again delivered gross margin improvements, as well as robust cash generation, all as a result of continued solid execution against our operational priorities, and framework we created over two years ago. As you saw in this morning's release, we remain focused on executing against key areas within our control, our supply chain transformation and initiatives to accelerate share gain. By executing our strategy, we continue to reshape our cost structure to capture efficiencies across our value chain and fund new growth investments in a slow, choppy market to gain share. We expect these actions together will further strengthen our powerful brands, accelerate innovation and enhance our in-market activation to position us as a supplier of choice and capture the compelling long-term opportunities in our industries we serve. Our priorities remain consistent as we work towards completing our strategic transformation. On today's call, you will hear about progress in each of our key areas of focus : gross margin expansion; strong free cash flow generation; and prioritize investments to stimulate sustainable growth and share gain. First, gross margin. We continue to drive profitability through the significant transformation of our supply chain to achieve our target of 35-plus percent gross margin. Our global cost reduction program remains on track for expected run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025. Next, we experienced strong free cash flow generation behind profitability improvements, supporting further balance sheet strength. The progress on reducing our leverage has been significant in 2024. And finally, we have deployed new investments to stimulate sustainable growth with the primary goal of reinvigorating share gain to achieve organic growth at 2 times to 3 times the market over the long term. Through our transformation, we have stabilized the company and are setting a solid foundation for future growth and significant EBITDA expansion. We're also strengthening our organizational culture to be centered around organic growth with an operational excellence mindset, which we expect to carry forward into the future for the next decade. The entire Stanley Black & Decker team has persevered through challenges and with hard-earned self-generated momentum behind us, we have conviction that there are solid value creation opportunities in the short, medium and the long term. As we look at our markets in aggregate today, they remain relatively stable on the surface. That said, some continue to be pressured by the continuation of mixed consumer trends, especially related to housing, as well as weak automotive production backdrop. These factors are informing our current focus to refine and improve agility within our current cost structure. At the same time, we are funding new growth investments in the relatively healthy pockets of our business such as DEWALT professional tools, which gained share for the sixth consecutive quarter. We are optimistic that the markets will turn in our favor in the future as interest rate cuts in many geographies likely will prove to be an initial catalyst. There will be a lag between lower rates and the flow-through to demand for our categories, and we expect choppy markets will extend into the front half of next year until interest rate reductions have a greater effect and the U.S. election result is known and settled. As a short-cycle business, we will plan our production and inventory thoughtfully to ensure we are ready for stronger demand in the future, which could be as early as the second half of 2025. Before I get into the third quarter results, I'd like to mention our upcoming Capital Markets Day on November 20 at the New York Stock Exchange, which will also be available via live webcast. The leadership team and I are looking forward to hosting this event. We will use it as a forum for key leaders, many new to the company with fresh perspective, to share more about how the operational changes implemented over the last two years set us up for future success. We will discuss what is next as we continue to position the company to deliver higher levels of organic revenue growth, profitability and cash flow over the long term, which will drive strong long-term shareholder return via significant EBITDA expansion. If you are interested in attending, reach out to Dennis and the IR team for more information. Now shifting to the third quarter results. We delivered $3.8 billion of revenue, down 5% versus the prior year with organic revenue down 2 points. Volume was down 3 points on a weak consumer backdrop and mixed end market demand, which was partially offset by a point [indiscernible]. We capitalized on pockets of relatively healthy market demand and delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of DEWALT growth, as well as higher sales in aerospace fasteners. The infrastructure divestiture, which closed early in the second quarter was a 2 point drag. Currency had a negative 1 point impact to revenue. Adjusted gross margin was 30.5%, up 290 basis points versus the third quarter of last year, a step-up primarily attributed to the supply chain transformation. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.8%, which is up 140 basis points versus prior year. This was driven by our gross margin expansion partially offset by prioritized investments designed to deliver future market share gains. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.22 for the quarter. Free cash flow was approximately $200 million in the third quarter, which provided capacity to reduce debt by $100 million. Strong cash generation continues to support our ongoing capital allocation priorities, namely shareholder dividends, balance sheet strength and organic investments. Finally, we are narrowing our 2024 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range to $3.90, up to $4.30 and reiterating our free cash flow guidance of $650 million to $850 million. Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. I want to thank our team members for their persistence in staying focused and forging ahead despite a choppy macro environment. We continue to make substantial progress on our transformation plan and achieve the financial milestones we established over two years ago. We will remain committed to our investments for share gain and the margin expansion journey that is generally within our control. I will now pass it to Chris Nelson to review the business segment performance. Christopher Nelson : Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor, third quarter revenue was approximately $3.3 billion, down 2% organically versus prior year. DEWALT was a bright spot, delivering its sixth consecutive quarter of organic growth as the brand continues to attract demand across the tools and outdoor product line. Price was plus 1% in the quarter, a weak consumer and DIY backdrop contributed to volumes declining 3%, with currency impacting revenue by another 1%. Third quarter adjusted segment margin rate was 11.1%, a 180 basis point improvement compared to the third quarter last year. Our supply chain transformation continues to help us deliver year-over-year margin expansion, while also funding our deliberate increase in growth investments. Turning to the product line performance for the third quarter. Power Tools declined 1% organically due to softness in consumer and DIY brands. On the positive side, DEWALT cordless products grew in the quarter. Volume was also supported by the initial holiday season sell-in across our priority brands. We are excited by a great lineup of offerings that will be available to our end users in the fourth quarter. Hand tools face similar pressure from the consumer environment and organic revenue was down 3%. However, we saw a strong customer response to our recent product launches of the DEWALT TOUGHSYSTEM 2.0 DXL storage lineup, as well as our expansion in the material handling space with the construction jack. These innovative new products designed to enhance end user safety and productivity were meaningful contributors to the DEWALT sales growth in the quarter. Outdoor organic revenue declined 3%, pressured by what we believe to be the final innings of destocking within the independent dealer channel. Turning to performance by region. North America declined 4% organically driven by the same factors as the overall segment. European revenue grew 1% organically despite a soft market backdrop. This was driven by double-digit growth in both Central Europe and Iberia, which more than offset pressure in the U.K. We are prioritizing investments to advance our regional presence and accelerate new product listings. These investments are designed to support market share expansion and will serve us well as our customers become more optimistic on the prospects for market growth. Our remaining regions, outside North America and Europe, in aggregate, delivered solid performance generating 6% organic growth. This was driven by double-digit growth in Latin America, led by Brazil, along with high single-digit growth in India. In summary, for Tools & Outdoor, growth in DEWALT was once again to highlight, along with the strong segment margin performance. As we look ahead, we remain focused on our efforts to continue to improve our gross margins and further strengthen our growth culture. Focusing on these two core imperatives allows us to prioritize resources and make new investments behind our best prospects for share gain. Now moving to Industrial. Third quarter revenue declined 80% on a reported basis versus the prior year, which was nearly all attributable to the infrastructure business divestiture. Organic revenue was down 1% as market softness in automotive contributed to segment volumes declining 2%, which was offset by 1 point of price. Automotive was down double digits as OEMs reduced light vehicle production schedules and constrained CapEx spending. The aerospace business grew 22% organically, supported by new content wins and a strong booking rate. General industrial fasteners was up low single digits, and we were pleased to see this business return to growth after prolonged customer destocking. The Industrial adjusted segment margin rate was 13.9%, an improvement of 170 basis points versus prior year, driven predominantly by price realization and cost control. This performance is notable given the mixed market conditions. We are encouraged to see the enterprise-wide transformation efforts resulting in adjusted operating margin expansion across both segments. Moving to the next slide. I would like to highlight a couple of examples of how we are thoughtfully and aggressively prioritizing resources to accelerate growth in Tools & Outdoor. First, we have committed to investing $30 million by 2027 in initiatives to support trades people and their priorities, including skills development. There is a shortage of trades people today and they are both our core end users and in high demand. We've already invested more than $10 million in the program and related initiatives since its inception and will continue to fund this commitment. The program is designed to grow the number of skilled trades people, which means investing both in initiatives to support newer generations entering into the trades, as well as to upskill trades people that are already established in their careers. Helping to solve the gap in trade skills is important not only to support the communities we serve, but it is also key to unlocking future growth in our industry. These investments also advance our end-user focused business strategy. By investing more to promote the long-term vitality and success of our professional end users, we can support both newer generations and established trades people to help expand trades capacity building deeper connections with our end users, while amplifying DEWALT's strong brand loyalty. To highlight a couple of recent examples where we partnered with organizations that share our commitment. On September 20, in honor of National Trades Person today, we announced that DEWALT awarded nearly $4 million in Grow the Trades Grants to 166 organizations in the United States and Canada, focused on skilling, reskilling and upskilling tradespeople. DEWALT also sponsors trade scholarships to support education in fields, including the concrete, mechanical, finishing and pipe trades. We are also proud of our long-standing partnership with WorldSkills. This year, the competition in Lyon, France, DEWALT was the Platinum partner. Stanley and Facom were also featured as official tools partners. One final highlight I'll share is our recent participation at the Tradeswomen Build Nations Conference in New Orleans. At our booth and throughout the event, our DEWALT team members spent time getting to know the Tradeswomen better, their personal experiences, challenges and aspirations. You're accustomed to hearing from us about new product innovations, but these investment programs are just as important. They are creating a virtuous flywheel by supporting our end users today to create more sustainable demand in the future. And as I shared last quarter, our loyal end users are one of the top essential attributes for success. We continue to prioritize building deeper connections with these end users to deliver purpose-built innovation. Another key attribute for success is our differentiated innovation engine. As a leader in total job site solutions, we are focused on continuing to empower our trades people on the job site by optimizing user workflow, productivity and safety. The recent unveil of the 20-volt MAX Grabo Lifter is one of several new additions to DEWALT's ecosystem of tools and technology that provides end-to-end solutions designed for trade professionals. The Grabo utilizes a powerful electric vacuum pump to help maximize user control during lifting, carrying or installation applications for a wide range of heavy construction materials. This is just one example of how we are focused on driving robust innovation to help solve the most pressing challenges our professional end users face, particularly to enhance safety and productivity on the job site. Our talented team is moving with speed and a clear mandate, executing our transformation plan and accelerating share gain. We are focused and organized, and we believe we are well positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. Thank you very much, and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan. Patrick Hallinan : Thanks, Chris, and good morning. As Don shared, we continue to make meaningful progress on our transformation journey. I will now highlight our financial accomplishments during the third quarter and detail our focus on delivering our 2024 objective and our margin progression in 2025 and beyond. In the third quarter, we achieved approximately $105 million of pretax run rate cost savings, bringing our aggregate savings to approximately $1.4 billion since the program's inception. Our third quarter and program to date performance demonstrates strong execution by employees across our organization. We are tracking to plan, driven by consistent progress across our work streams. We are diligently capturing cost efficiencies amidst a backdrop of soft demand and freight inflation as we complete the transformation and pursue the actions needed to meet our gross margin objectives. Stepping back, we continue to target $1.5 billion of pretax run rate savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion of pretax run rate savings by the end of 2025. We are on track to achieve both targets as we work towards our 35% plus adjusted gross margin target. As a reminder, our core supply chain transformation savings initiatives are strategic sourcing, operations excellence, footprint actions and complexity reduction. Strategic sourcing remains the largest contributor to our transformation savings to date, driven by component-related savings captured in 2024. Sourcing activities are leveraging the advantages of a functional center of excellence, capturing economies of scale and rationalizing our supply base to focus spend on our critical strategic suppliers. Operations excellence is the next area of opportunity, which translates to productivity improvements across our system. This initiative leverages lean principles, which are being implemented at targeted sites throughout the globe. We are optimizing our distribution footprint, as well as redesigning our manufacturing network to leverage scale and centers of excellence as we maximize operational efficiency. Approximately one-third of our facilities are undergoing significant change during 2024. We expect this work to continue into 2025 and potentially beyond. We are well underway with our platforming strategy as we identify methods to standardize parts and components across product families. The aim is simplicity which we will achieve by reducing complexity, improving procurement scale and ultimately decreasing the cycle time of our innovation process. We are combining this with a fresh design-to-value approach to better serve our customers at a competitive cost advantage. This method takes a holistic approach to designing and bringing new products to market faster, while also doing so more efficiently, which can generate material productivity and cost savings well beyond 2025. As much as it's a method, it's a mindset that we are instilling across the company as we continue to look for productivity enhancements going forward. I would like to commend the organization for diligently pursuing the goals of our transformation, this journey would not be possible without everyone's contribution. The progress we've shared today, including developing a sustainable cost structure and generating operational efficiency gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our gross margin objectives for 2024 and to achieve 35-plus percent adjusted gross margin as we work to close out the transformation. With that said, we believe this is not the end goal, rather a way point on the journey. Moving to the next slide. During the third quarter, we continued to make progress on two main areas of focus : generating free cash flow; and expanding gross margins to support investment in long-term profitable growth and share gain. We generated nearly $200 million of free cash flow in the third quarter. This brings year-to-date free cash flow broadly in line with where it was in the prior year. That said, and importantly, the composition of free cash flow reflects a healthier mix. In the current fiscal year, free cash flow is weighted towards cash earnings and benefits from transformation cost efficiencies in addition to working capital reductions, the latter of which dominated 2023 free cash flow generation. This shift in makeup is a strong signal that our profitability and operating improvements are translating to sustainable free cash flow generation. We are reiterating our full year free cash flow guidance range of $650 million to $850 million. We expect fourth quarter cash generation to be supported by positive earnings, working capital reductions from a seasonal drawdown of receivables as well as a modest reduction in inventory. Our 2024 outlook for capital expenditures is $325 million to $375 million, which is approximately $75 million lower at the midpoint than our previous assumption. This benefit for 2024 is offset by an expectation that we will carry slightly higher levels of inventory at year-end versus our July guidance. With that in mind, we are taking a measured approach to inventory management in the back half of 2024 and into 2025 as we navigate potential changes to the external environment and our markets, including the possibility for an acceleration of demand. Looking forward, we are planning to allocate free cash flow in excess of the dividend to support debt reduction, which we expect will result in a total gross debt balance that is a little over $6 billion as of the end of 2024. Beyond 2024, we are planning for further deleveraging with the goal to achieve our targeted leverage metrics of approximately 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA by year-end 2025. We plan to achieve this objective by utilizing excess free cash flow beyond the dividend and modest portfolio pruning actions. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin was 30.5% in the third quarter, a 290 basis point improvement versus prior year, primarily driven by savings from the supply chain transformation net of normal wage and benefit inflation. We are planning for further sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, supported by our supply chain transformation initiatives. Our current plan puts us on a path to achieve our goal of approximately 30% full year 2024 adjusted gross margin. Now turning to 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. In addition to reiterating free cash flow guidance, we are guiding GAAP earnings per share range to $1.15 to $1.75 and adjusted earnings per share range to $3.90 to $4.30 with both ranges narrowed, but unchanged at the midpoint as compared to our prior guidance. Our outlook factors in the continuation of a relatively soft macro environment in the fourth quarter, one that is marginally weaker than that anticipated at the end of the second quarter, driven by continued consumer softness and global automotive production declines that appear to have yet bottomed. As we have done throughout the year, we are leveraging the cost savings primarily within our control, to offset these pressures and generate adjusted EBITDA growth versus the prior year. At the midpoint of our guidance, we are assuming full year organic revenue will be down 1 percentage point with fourth quarter organic revenue declining approximately 1.5%. Our full year total revenue guidance, at the third quarter ending foreign currency rates, is relatively similar to our prior revenue guidance as recent currency rates are less negative than previously forecast offsetting the moderate incremental weakness in organic revenue. Turning to the segments. Our outlook for Tools & Outdoor full year organic revenue is unchanged at down 1% at the midpoint, plus or minus 50 basis points, with relatively flat pricing for the full year. We have updated our expectation for the Industrial segment to be down 1% at the midpoint, plus or minus 50 basis points. This assumption now incorporates more pronounced global automotive production headwinds than our prior guidance and assumes that the fourth quarter organic revenue will be in a similar zone to that at the end of the third quarter. Broadly, we remain positive about our industry's long-term growth prospects. Near term, we expect markets to remain choppy and soft. Until interest rate reductions have greater effect, global automotive production fully corrects, and the U.S. election result is known. We remain committed to our investments for share gain and the margin expansion journey that is generally within our control. Turning to SG&A. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management given the near-term market softness, while prioritizing investments for long-term organic growth. Our planning assumption for innovation, brand, marketing activation and technology growth investments remains an incremental $100 million in 2024. We expect full year 2024 SG&A, as a percentage of sales to be in the low 21% zone. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to approximate 10% for the full year, supported by savings from the transformation program. Our adjusted segment margin assumptions for Tools & Outdoor and Industrial are relatively consistent with our prior plan and expected to be up year-over-year. Our adjusted earnings per share range is $0.40 with variability in market demand being the largest contributor between the high and low end. We remain focused on our goals for adjusted gross margin and expect to manage SG&A thoughtfully in this environment. while working hard to make the investments that position the business for long-term growth. Turning to other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pretax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $455 million to $485 million, unchanged at the midpoint versus prior guidance. These charges largely relate to the supply chain transformation program, the second quarter environmental reserve adjustment and the noncash brand impairment charge from the third quarter. The adjusted tax rate is expected to be 10% for the full year, which will imply a tax benefit in the fourth quarter. Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. In summary, we remain focused on executing our supply chain improvements to further improve gross margin and earnings. Our progress to date supports our narrowed full year earnings and free cash flow outlook. We remain confident that our actions to drive towards our target of 35% plus adjusted gross margin while funding additional organic revenue growth investments will continue to generate positive results. Our top priorities remain delivering margin expansion, generating cash and further strengthening the balance sheet to position the company for long-term growth and value creation. With that, I will now pass the call back to Don. Donald Allan : Thank you, Pat. As you heard this morning, the company is making meaningful progress across our key priorities of margin improvement, cash generation and balance sheet strength while also investing in future sustainable growth to drive share gains. We are moving decisively to continue to deliver results despite mixed end market demand, which likely will continue through the middle of 2025. We will stay focused on this consistent execution while positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth, profitability and cash flow, which will drive strong long-term shareholder return via significant EBITDA expansion. We are now ready for Q&A. Dennis? Dennis Lange : Great. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start the Q&A, please. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just wanted -- if you could flesh out a little bit how you're thinking about next year as sort of within touching distance? So just wondered sort of are you still confident of that kind of 35% plus gross margin exiting next year? And if we think about the sort of construct as it looks today, should we be thinking sort of first half of next year flat to down sales similar to how you're exiting 2024? And then the margin expansion, it looks like operating margins, via exiting this year, up about 100 bps year-on-year in Q4. Is that a sort of a good placeholder early next year? And so next year, it's really about the second half when you see a big revenue and margin jump? Thank you. Donald Allan : Thanks, Julian. So yes, we'll -- I'll let Pat give some color and thoughts of where we are related to 2025. And then I'll circle back at the end with some perspectives on progress in the transformation and how we close out the transformation in the next 12 to 18 months. Pat? Patrick Hallinan : Yes, Julian, a lot in there. If I start with sales, I would say, we're not here to give precise 2025 guidance, but certainly, we expect the macros we're facing now to be characterizing the front part of next year. So soft and choppy, tools' demand and probably still some auto headwinds into the front part of next year. So more likely than not, we're expecting a flat to down start to the year. Obviously, we'll update that when we give guidance in the early days of 2025, but I'd say flat to down, more likely down is probably where we'd start. And then on the gross margin, gross margin has been a key part of our journey and remains a key part of our journey. And certainly, we continue to work towards 35% in the fourth quarter of next year. But the transformation is about gross margin improvement. It's also about returning to share-driven growth and to getting the margin and the growth together to achieve $2-plus billion of EBITDA output from the business. And as a team, we remain very confident in getting to 35% plus and to getting to $2 billion plus EBITDA. The timing of that is going to depend on the headwinds. We really feel like those are the right targets. But we've had a lot of headwinds in this journey. We are right now identifying and accelerating incremental activities to drive that margin expansion. And to the extent to which those accelerated activities are timed up enough relative to the headwinds. Again, we'll update you when we give guidance in the early part of next year. But that is certainly our focus, and it's going to be just a balancing act of the acceleration of our activities relative to the headwinds. And then in terms of the margin in the early part of the year, I mean, I think we will be 31-ish in the fourth quarter of this year. And then it will be a little bit of a similar dynamic as we click into the first half of next year relative to the back half of this year, where you have some of the natural seasonal headwinds from the Outdoor business in the early part of the year plus some of the under absorption from the slow demand in the back part of this year. So I do expect the year-over-year dynamics, at least first half of 2025 to first half of 2024, to look a little bit in terms of incremental improvement, a bit like what you saw from 2024 to 2023. Donald Allan : If I just kind of circle back to the overall broader transformation framework that we established about 2.5 years ago roughly. And we went into this journey knowing that there were a handful of things that we needed to address. And obviously, the first thing was developing a muscle around organic growth and gaining share that had not been consistently in place at Stanley Black & Decker over the last several decades. We grew through a lot of other things such as acquisitions that created a significant amount of value. And so we continue to build that muscle, and that's an important part of this transformation. And both I and Chris made comments today and the progress in that journey, and we still have more progress to make. The other thing was the profitability of the business and the cash flow and getting ourselves to 35-plus percent. We still feel very strongly in our ability to get above 35% gross margin. The timing of it, as Pat said, could vary a little bit, but due to headwinds and other factors. But as we've gotten deeper and deeper into this in the last 18 months as we've worked together as a team, we see a lot of value drivers for the next three or four years that can continue to improve our margins and allow us to continue to invest more into the front end of the business so that we can develop the strength in the muscle. So we do gain share on a sustainable long-term basis in our industry, which is something that we think is the biggest value driver of all once we get our margins above that 35%. So more to come on that at Investor Day. We're excited to walk through more details in about three weeks from now. But we're very pleased with the progress, and we still are very committed to the overall objectives we established through the transformation 2.5 years ago. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with Morgan Stanley. Your line now open. Chris Snyder, your line now open. Please check your mute button. Chris Snyder : Oh. Sorry about that. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the gross margin commentary. So it seems like 2024, maybe you will exit the year up 150 basis points. And to get to that 35% at year-end 2025, you kind of need to then have 2025 be up 350 year-on-year basis points. So I guess, was the prior commentary basically saying that that's not a year-end 2025 target anymore, it's kind of more in the distance? And I know that it's macro dependent. So maybe if there's anything you can kind of say on the macro that's needed to get to that 35% to exit next year? That would be helpful. Thank you. Patrick Hallinan : Yes, Chris. I don't know that it's not the objective anymore. That's not what we said. We're still working towards it. It's really a question of given the headwind, the back part of this year, I'd say the back part of this year, our sales are about 1 point lower than we expected, and we still feel like auto hasn't fully corrected. That's a pretty profitable part of our industrial portfolio. And then while it's a smaller part of our portfolio, we'll probably see some blip next year from the Boeing strike. So it's just a question of will we tee up enough incremental and accelerated activities to offset that and any other headwinds that come our way. And we just don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We'll kind of update everybody on that when we get to guidance at the end of next year. It's still the working goal of our team. I'd say what's really going to affect it, probably as much or more than anything, is at what pace do interest rates start taking effect. And how quickly does auto correct because that's a very profitable part of that industrial business. And then how much fixed cost reduction activity will be able to both implement and complete in time for it to roll off the balance sheet next year. I think those will be the factors that affect that timing precisely. But like I said, that's still our working goal. And yes, along the way, the headwinds have certainly made the slope of next year a little bit steeper than we would have preferred. But we have every confidence we get to 35-plus percent. In fact, we see good opportunities of platforming to go beyond that. So I think the timing is just a match-up of headwinds versus accelerated activities. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open. Timothy Wojs : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the color. Just a follow-up to that last question and then my question. So I guess first, Pat, could you just talk about what the accelerated activity is and kind of what cost buckets you're kind of attacking because you guys are already kind of taking out a lot of costs. I'm just kind of curious where the incremental pieces are? And then second, just Don, as you kind of changed the mindset internally from maybe something that's more acquisition and kind of integration focus to organic focused. What are the biggest changes that you need to make to the organization internally to kind of get that algorithm right? Donald Allan : Why don't you start Pat? I'll answer that second. Patrick Hallinan : I'll start, Tim. I mean as you mentioned, yes, we have a lot of streams of work going. I think when we're talking about 2025, and 2025 specifically, I think you're going to see acceleration on three fronts : sourcing, footprint and platforming, but the key to unlocking next year is probably more the middle one, footprint. But again, that's something we're still working internally, but we'll be pulling all three of those levers greater than expected. But I'd say the key to unlocking next year some footprint action. Donald Allan : And thanks for the question, Tim, on the culture aspect of shifting from heavily weighted towards M&A to an intense focus on organic growth and market share gains. And it is something that we've been working very hard at for the last 2.5 years. But in particular, in the last 12 to 15 months, as Chris Nelson joined us, and he's made some changes to his team. And so I'm going to actually ask Chris to give some color on the things that we're doing within T&O. And then as we work through that, we'll begin to translate some of that over to industrial. So Chris, why don't you give us some more color on that? Christopher Nelson : Absolutely. So thanks a lot for the question, Tim. I mean, first of all, I'd say the most important thing that we have been changing and leaning into is really our focus and alignment around our core brands, understanding that, yes, we produce products, but what our customers and end users count on us for is to be able to provide them the solutions that they need with the brands that they respect and trust. And I think that as we've organized more around a brand-centric culture and how we can then provide those solutions, that has been a significant cultural change to the organization. Secondarily, really as well as the laser focus that we have on the brand building also making sure that we have a very clear focus on what end users we are serving and making sure that we are driving innovation that they need for their -- to make their lives easier. Particularly making sure that with the professional end user, we are driving more purpose-driven innovation to make sure that we can enhance the safety and productivity of our professional end users on their job site and making sure that all the innovation that's going into our pipeline really serves that end goal and serves the brands that we are focused on. From a third thing is, really then making sure that we are focused on our speed to market that as we identify which brands we want to grow and as we identify the key pain points we want to address of those professional end users that we can get those products to market quickly and effectively in an integrated manner and make sure that we get those tools in the hands of our end users to drive growth. And then finally is really making sure that we think in terms of driving investment into the front end of the business, meaning that we want to have our Stanley Black & Decker representatives meeting with our end users and our customers to make sure that we're supporting them and explaining our innovations and driving share gain in the field and then working integrated marketing programs so that they can understand sample passed and then ultimately purchase and utilize our tools going forward. I think that pivot to driving the preponderance of our investment towards the front end is kind of the final piece of the puzzle. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Sprague : Hi. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I guess just one follow-up on some of the outlook questions and comments and then something unrelated to that. But first, just on -- again, sort of on the outlook and the trajectory, you had been previously kind of pointing to that $2 billion-plus of EBITDA in 2026. Pat mentioned it again, but didn't say anything about the time frame. Just wonder if your confidence on that is sort of slipping given the slow start to 2025? And then my other question is just kind of help us think about what's going on with share in North America you pointed to DEWALT gains that look like they are continuing and compounding on each other? Just also as a little mathematically curious though that North America sales and tools underperform each of your three categories, right, North America, down 4%, but PT only down 1% hand tools and outdoor down 3%. So is there something else going on there, maybe speak to share on CRAFTSMAN and Stanley brand? Or any other perspective you just kind of add on that complexion of the North American sales? Patrick Hallinan : Hi, Jeff, it's Pat. I'll take the outlook question and then I'll let Chris comment on U.S. market share. So I would still say, no, our -- we'll be very much targeting $2-plus billion of EBITDA by 2026. In fact, I think kind of on a rolling four quarter basis, that's probably somewhere in the front half of 2026. So I don't think anything has changed there. As I mentioned in the gross margin comments, we're accelerating initiatives to offset the headwinds, but we're also going to manage our total income statement to drive the EBITDA. I mean, we recognize the value driving EBITDA growth as quickly as possible. And so I don't think there's anything that's changed in terms of a meaning time frame, a meaningful time frame on EBITDA expansion. Like I said, probably on a rolling basis sometime in the front part of 2026, we're at that $2 billion-ish threshold. Christopher Nelson : All right. Jeff, this is Chris. Nice hearing from you. Just to provide a little more color on the share in North America. What I'd say is that, first of all, we're confident that we are stable to slightly growing our share over the course of this year for sure. And as you pointed out, we've certainly been experiencing nice success in that share gain with the DEWALT brand. I think underlying that would be a little bit of the dynamic we have been talking about where that the Pro is relatively stronger than the DIYer due to the -- some of the underlying consumer trends. And as a result, we certainly have seen that play out and impact the CRAFTSMAN brand more than the DEWALT brand. So I think that as we see that not only the strength of that brand continuing to grow, but that as we see the consumer strengthen as well. As we talked about thinking about somewhere in the back half of next year, we should see some of that additional momentum kind of compound what we're seeing with DEWALT. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Nicole DeBlase : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Donald Allan : Good morning. Patrick Hallinan : Good morning. Nicole DeBlase : Can you guys talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the cost side? Totally appreciate the additional pressures with respect to top line, but steel costs are down. Obviously, your component costs and input costs are much broader than steel. But if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing there and how that's impacting gross margins? Donald Allan : Nicole, I'll would say, we kind of expected all year materials to be slightly down, freight to be slightly up. And I'd say, thematically, that's largely been the play that's been running. Where I would say is ground freight in the U.S. has been a bit higher and a bit more persistent than we would expect. And so you kind of put the two together, you have some net inflation from ground freight, which -- and the ground freight seems to be moving these days a bit more from labor cost and actual vehicle capital cost as opposed to fuel. And so neither have been at extremes, I'd say just slightly higher headwinds from freight offsetting, as you mentioned, some of the material tailwinds that we would see. And I'd say for next year, at this point, we're kind of expecting kind of neutral price cost and no extremes inflation or deflation. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Obviously, a lot of talk about the gradient of the gross margin improvement here. So is the message -- the $2 billion of exit rate for next year is still in place, but we've got some volume and mix factors at play here. I just want to make sure that's the case? And maybe just, Don, just talk about the election and some of the scenario plan you've got in place there, obviously, if Trump wins, tariffs are in play. Just maybe just address that. Thanks. Donald Allan : You want to take that first part, Chris? Christopher Nelson : I'll start with the first part, Nigel. Yes, I'd say we're focused on all three, returning to share gain driven growth, gross margin and EBITDA. And yes, the precise timing of 35% may alter slightly, but we still feel like on an exit run rate basis or a rolling a 12-month basis, we're hitting that $2 billion EBITDA threshold in the first part of 2026, and that's still our focus, and we'll manage the total income statement to get there. Donald Allan : Yes. And then the tariff front related to the election. If Trump wins the election, we are likely in a new tariff regime. It is a question of the magnitude at this point exactly how that will be rolled out and will it be specific to industries or more broad-based? How many countries will be covered in it? And so there's a lot of still unknowns associated with it. However, as we've mentioned in previous settings, we have been planning for this possibility since the spring and have gone through a variety of different scenarios to plan for. And obviously, coming out of the gate, there would be price increases associated with tariffs that we put into the market. And so we've worked through a lot of that. We'll continue to work through as if the scenario plays out and the tariffs become more concrete. We will work through getting those into the market in a reasonable time frame, knowing that there's usually some type of delay given the processes that our customers have around implementing price. The second thing is we've built a fairly robust plan of how we would mitigate over the next two years, these tariffs by moving production and aspects of the supply chain to different parts of the world. And some of that would be potentially moving things from China to other parts of Asia, maybe to Mexico, we'll see but likely to other parts of Asia. And so unlikely that we're moving a lot back to the U.S. because it's just not cost effective to do. And there's questions about whether we even have the labor to actually do that in this country. So we have a fairly robust plan. What we don't know is which scenario is going to play out and exactly how that would be. Is it going to be just China? Is it going to be every country? Is it going to be 60% China? Or is it going to be 25% China for everything? Those are all things that are to be determined. But I feel like we have a playbook on the shelf ready to go, depending if this scenario plays out. And then obviously, we've been working our government relations activities vary significantly over the summer into the fall to educate a variety of different politicians as to this industry and the dynamics of supply chain and how we serve our customers and how this would actually play out over the next two years. So that's an important part of the process as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Zelman & Associates. Your line is now open. Adam Baumgarten : Hi, guys. Just on the path of gross margins from here. Obviously, I know implied 4Q, should we expect gross margin to step down sequentially in 1Q and then move higher quarter-over-quarter from there next year, kind of like you saw this year? Patrick Hallinan : Yes, Adam, I don't know that I'd get that precise in the sense that we'll get into the early parts of next year, things that drive gross margin variability across the early months of the year are just the mix of outdoor relative to everything else. And in this case, as we head into 2025, it will be a little bit of how much of the auto correction in our industrials businesses, is starting to slow down or whether it's still in midstream. And so I would just say, I think it's going to -- broadly, if you look at half to half, you'll just see somewhere in the 31-ish percent, maybe 31%, plus or minus a few bps throughout the first half. Maybe we can accelerate a few things and get it above that. But I don't know that I'd start getting specific timing fourth quarter to first quarter because those types of things are going to get into very specific shipment flows. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is now open. Rob Wertheimer : Thanks. Good morning. I wonder if you could unpack just a little bit more of the North American Tools & Outdoor? Maybe some of that is your channel partners wanting a different inventory strategy? Maybe some of that is just weakness at retail? Maybe some of that is an expectation of a weaker holiday season? Just maybe give a sense of order of magnitude how the different factors are contributing to the [indiscernible]? Thank you. Patrick Hallinan : Yes. So I think there's a few things in there. One would be that first and foremost, our POS was modestly negative in the quarter. And that's what we expected, and we had talked about that probably being the case as we -- one of the dynamics is as we rolled off of what was an earlier start to the outdoor season, we kind of normalized in Q3. Secondarily, we do see there being much more momentum and strength on the professional than there would be on the DIY. And if you look at some of the underlying kind of metrics that we look at in the marketplace to explain that, there's obviously consumer sentiment, but then there's also the activity levels for R&R activity. which are notably down this year. And I think that, that's probably having a pretty significant effect on what we're seeing in the DIY as well. Moving forward, as we talked about, we don't see any real catalyst in the first quarter or first half that will change those dynamics, but we are optimistic on taking a look at the longer-term trends in our industry. And as we start to see some of the improvements in some of those longer-term construction spending, construction earnings, R&R activity, residential home starts, we'll see more progress and growth in the marketplace. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for their time and participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. Dennis Lange : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. 2024 fourth quarter and full year webcast. Here today, in addition to myself, is Don Allan, President and CEO, Christopher Nelson, COO, EVP, and President of Tools and Outdoor, and Patrick Hallinan, EVP and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. This morning, Don, Chris, and Pat will review our 2024 fourth quarter and full year results, and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcasts, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-Ks that we filed with our press release and our most recent 34 Act filing. Additionally, we may also reference non-GAAP financial measures during the call. For applicable reconciliations to the related GAAP financial measure and additional information, please refer to the appendix of the supplemental presentation and the corresponding press release, which are available on our website under the IR section. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan. Don Allan : Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. I know many of you are ready to dig into 2025. But it's important to first mark the significant progress we achieved in 2024. We successfully advanced each of our key focus areas during 2024, by delivering continued gross margin expansion, solid free cash flow generation, and a stronger balance sheet. All while making new investments aimed at driving sustainable market share growth. The progress we achieved was notable in the face of a mixed macroeconomic backdrop. And is a testament to our team's relentless pursuit of our vision created two and a half years ago. Together, the leadership team and I are revitalizing the organization to be centered around our brands, and end users. And we are reshaping the cost structure to be more efficient in the back office processes, while investing in areas close to our end users, and channel customers, to drive sustainable share gain. The positive impact on our performance thus far is clear. In 2024, we overcame a soft consumer and DIY environment. To deliver full year revenues of $15.4 billion which was flat on an organic basis versus many markets retracted. Especially in the back half of the year. We are encouraged by the growth and share gain progression in DEWALT. Which grew mid-single digits organically in 2024. A sign that our investments and focus are translating into positive top-line momentum. Additionally, standout organic growth of 22% in aerospace fastening also contributed to our overall revenue results. As we completed year two of our transformational journey, we are proud to have delivered on key financial milestones. Including adjusted gross margin greater than 31% in the fourth quarter, and 30% for the full year. The full year margin expansion of 400 basis points primarily driven by our reshaped supply chain and ongoing strategic initiatives. We see more opportunity ahead as we work to complete our transformational cost savings program in 2025. And push to our long-term target of greater than 35% adjusted gross margin. This significant progress related to stabilizing revenue and executing our cost transformational program while making ongoing growth investments, resulted in full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion with a margin of 10.1%. Which is an expansion of 290 basis points as compared to 2023. This EBITDA outcome translated into full year adjusted earnings per share, of $4.36 demonstrating significant growth over 2023 EPS. Earnings growth and working capital efficiency improvements both contributed to free cash flow of approximately $750 million. This strong free cash flow generation plus the proceeds from our infrastructure business divestiture supported $1.1 billion of debt reduction in 2024, and solid progress towards achieving our leverage target. Our strong execution in 2024 was the result of organizational alignment and focus. Which helped us meet or exceed our goals. I want to thank our organization for the relentless focus and dedication to world-class service of our end users and channel customers, while achieving these financial results. Our 2024 performance in combination with the activation of our growth culture across the company, is setting a strong foundation for the next chapter of growth for Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. We are targeting over the mid-term top-line organic growth of mid-single digits in a low single-digit market. With adjusted gross margin of 35% plus. We believe that by continuing to advance against these measures, it will contribute to successfully achieving the adjusted EBITDA target of $2.5 billion that we shared at our recent Capital Markets Day. Now turning to performance in the fourth quarter. We delivered $3.7 billion of revenue, flat versus prior year, comprised of a solid 3% organic revenue growth which was offset by a 2-point impact from the infrastructure business divestiture and a point of currency headwind. Our adjusted gross margin was 31.2%, up 140 basis points versus the fourth quarter of last year, mainly due to our global cost reduction program. These revenue and gross margin outcomes net of our continued funding of growth investments designed to deliver future sustainable market share gains, resulted in adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.2%. Which is up 80 basis points versus the prior year. This fourth quarter EBITDA result translated into adjusted earnings per share of $1.49 for the quarter. Our free cash flow was $565 million in the fourth quarter, an outstanding performance that continues to support our ongoing capital allocation priorities. Namely organic investments, shareholder dividends, and debt reduction. Due to this weekend's announcement and ongoing shifts over the last two days, we decided to provide you our base case view for 2025. Which excludes impacts of any tariffs, and demonstrates our underlying earnings power. In addition, to help you size what we may have to navigate related to tariffs, we will provide cost of goods sold information based on country of origin for our US businesses, which will allow all of you to correlate with the proposed policy the president announced over the weekend or how it evolves over the coming days or weeks. This is a dynamic environment. But as we shared with you last year, we have developed a plan that we are deploying with speed. We believe we can mitigate tariffs with supply chain repositioning and price. But do not believe it is something that will throw us off our long-term growth and EBITDA aspirations. We've successfully navigated this before. And have a new seasoned management team in place to enable success once again. Our goal is to ensure that as the president and his administration work to accelerate growth in the United States, and negotiate better trade deals, with our country's major trading partners we are positioned for success as the only significant US-based manufacturer in our industry. We continue to engage with the president and his new administration to support them in achieving their goals in these areas, while we navigate the next several months to minimize the impact to Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. As we exit 2025. The base case pre-tariff planning assumption for 2025 is adjusted EPS of $5.25 plus or minus $0.50. With $650 to $850 million of free cash flow. During our October earnings call, we were among the first to describe the demand environment as softer likely longer. With an expectation that the first half of 2025 would likely remain choppy or sluggish. Three months later, we have seen little evidence to change that view. And given the indicators that we do see, several end markets may not improve until 2026. Interest rate cuts in 2024 have had very little impact as mortgages continue to be well above 6%. Therefore, as we think about our base case operating environment, our current perspective on the market outlook assumes that aggregated market demand is stable and expected to be relatively flat year over year. We believe this is consistent with how we exited 2024, and this underpins the midpoint of our base case earnings per share range. In the back half of 2024, we delivered a 0.5 point of organic growth. Our plan in the first half of 2025 and the full year assumes modestly stronger organic growth. We expect price, and our company-specific opportunities such as our continued investment behind our core brands of DEWALT, Stanley, and Craftsman to serve our end users. Combined with targeted market activation initiatives to drive low single-digit organic growth. We believe there is potential for a market-driven positive inflection to occur later in 2025. But this is not reflected in our midpoint base case. Stepping back from the short-term horizon, the long-term market trends are very attractive and the outlook for our industries remains incredibly positive. There is a large and growing gap in the North American residential housing inventory. Which supports the need for increased in housing starts. In addition, existing home turnover remains at cyclically depressed levels. In fact, existing home sales in 2024 fell to their lowest level since 1995. Which just magnifies this point. And with the average age of a US house at roughly 40 years old, we believe homeowners will reengage in an increased level of repair and renovation once interest rates decline to lower levels. As construction activity accelerates over the long term, the tradespeople that we serve will benefit. And they will need our tools to help get the job done. We serve labor-constrained industries. And our innovations are designed to deliver enhanced productivity with significant safety features. We are prudently investing across our portfolio to fuel end-user inspired innovation, and differentiated market activation designed to capture the share gain opportunities we anticipate in the near term, and over the long-term horizon. We are funding new growth investments in the relatively healthy markets such as DEWALT Professional Tools, to build upon its seventh consecutive quarter of growth. And market share gain. While continuously striving for excellence, with how we serve our end users, and channel customers, In engineered fastening, we expect growth to again be led by aerospace. With OEM monthly build rates expected to step up year over year. 2025 projections for global industrial production are flat to positive and the automotive outlook continues to be pressured. In summary, we do believe we can deliver organic revenue growth in 2025 through price increases, and share gain in markets that will likely be relatively flat aggregate. We are committed to continued long-term margin expansion, driven by our supply chain transformation plan, Pat will share more detail on this in a moment, as well as contextualize our planning framework and tariffs. I want to thank our team members again for their dedication, a successful 2024. We remain committed to accelerating our growth culture with operational excellence at its core to position the company for sustainable success. I'm confident that we are equipped with the talent and experience to navigate whatever comes our way in 2025 and beyond. I will now pass it to Christopher Nelson, to review the business segment performance. Chris? Christopher Nelson : Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. First, turning to the tools and outdoor operating performance. Fourth quarter revenue was approximately $3.2 billion driven by 3% organic revenue growth versus prior year. DEWALT delivered its seventh consecutive quarter of organic growth which was complemented by a solid holiday season. These two positive drivers were partially offset by the weak consumer and DIY backdrop. Fourth quarter adjusted segment margin was 10.2%, a 20 basis point improvement versus the fourth quarter 2023. We continue to leverage the supply chain transformation savings to deliver margin expansion while funding incremental growth investments. Growth was broad-based across the segment, and all of our tools and outdoor product lines grew organically in the fourth quarter. Organic growth for power tools was 5% in the quarter, with new innovations, pro-driven momentum, and solid promotional activity offset by pressure from the soft DIY demand backdrop. Hand tools grew 2% organically. This performance was supported by new product listings, notably DEWALT TUFF System 2.0 DXC modular workstation. Which provides pros a solution that can be customized for optimal user productivity. Outdoor posted 3% organic growth in the quarter. Supported by positive performance from the independent dealer channel, as well as continued momentum with handheld battery offerings. We believe that our customers have right-sized inventory levels exiting 2024 which should set up shipments to match demand in 2025. Turning to Tools and Outdoor fourth quarter performance by region, North America was up 2% organically with a solid holiday season. Organic growth in Europe was 4%, with positive contributions from most regions supported by investments in growth initiatives. Including the expansion of our professional product offerings and local and focused marketing activation. Rest of world grew 8% organically. This was driven by high single-digit growth in Latin America, led by Brazil, along with mid-single-digit growth in India. Overall, we are pleased with the segment's fourth quarter top-line performance, a strong end to a back half that delivered a half a point of organic growth with markets that continue to show more signs of stability. On a full-year basis, we delivered slightly positive organic growth, DEWALT led the way and posted solid mid-single-digit growth for the year. Which we estimate to be ahead of the market representing share gain. Our success was underpinned by innovation with new product launches, such as power shift, the construction jack, and our new TUFF system. Additionally, with our supply chain improvements, we are focused on continuing to improve execution and service levels with our customers. This opens new opportunities for increased listings and placement for our powerful brands in stores. Full-year adjusted segment margin expanded by 350 basis points to 10.1%, which is a substantial improvement versus prior year primarily driven by the supply chain transformation initiative. Now moving to industrial. Fourth quarter revenue declined 15% on a reported basis versus the prior year. Which was nearly all attributable to the infrastructure business divestiture. Organic revenue was flat with two points of price offset by a two-point volume decline due to automotive market softness. The automotive business experienced a high single-digit organic decline. As OEMs reduced light vehicle production schedules and tightened capex spending. The aerospace business posted organic growth in the mid-teens, supported by new content wins and a strong booking rate. Industrial fasteners organic growth was up high single digits. The industrial adjusted segment margin rate was 10.7% in the quarter, a moderate contraction versus prior year, due to the impact of automotive market softness on volumes. For the full year, we delivered 2% organic growth in Engineered Fastening, Total industrial adjusted segment margin expanded 70 basis points to 12.5%. This margin expansion was driven by the price realization and cost productivity we generated throughout the year. I would like to acknowledge both the tools and outdoor and industrial teams for their focused efforts and solid execution in 2024. Against a mixed macroeconomic backdrop. And thank the teams for positioning us well as we work through the final innings of the transformation. Moving to the next slide. I'd like to share more about how we are operationalizing our strategy of thoughtfully and aggressively prioritizing resources to accelerate growth in tools and outdoor. Our brand-centered teams studied the category trends in the marketplace to prioritize investments in the fastest-growing user segment. We continue to cultivate deep connections with those end users to gain a well-informed understanding of unique trade and application-based needs. Which helps us to prioritize the most impactful innovations in our robust product and technology pipeline. At the same time, our centralized engineering organization is focused on standardizing innovation processes and implementing a platform approach to design. With the eye towards improving our speed, cost, and effectiveness. As we shared at our Capital Markets Day, we believe platforming can be a major unlock as we leverage the benefit of common components to reduce complex traditional strength of purpose-built innovation. The result is innovative new products developed with speed and at the best cost. Solutions that address specific challenges of the priority trade groups. We have multiple examples of this, but today, I'm going to highlight carpentry. For the last century, and still today, sweat equity has been at the core of our respect for the carpentry trade. Our DEWALT Carpentry Total Solutions offer tools that can keep pros productive in every phase of a job with confidence in every application. With that in mind, we are developing end-to-end solutions to deliver a best-in-class user experience with features to make carpenters as efficient and effective as possible. We provide tailored solutions for demanding applications. From framing to building and installing, custom cabinetry. To molding trim for baseboards, windows, and doors, A few new powerful additions to highlight from the expanded lineup of next-generation 20-volt MaxxR tools include the three-speed hammer drill, This is our most powerful 20-volt max hammer drill. Which is equipped with the anti-rotation system a Performant Protect safety feature that shuts the tool down if rotational motion is excessive. We've also highlighted our new quarter-inch quiet hydraulic impact driver. This is the industry's highest-rated max torque hydraulic impact driver. It features quieter operation for volume-sensitive environments and an advanced hydraulic mechanism for consistent performance in tight or tough conditions. We believe concentrating investments behind our core brands and priority trade groups will help us to deliver consistent profitable share gain in an attractive and growing market. We expect our efforts to again outperform the market this year. We have what it takes to win and are moving with a sense of urgency to accelerate our organic growth trajectory to step up and consistently deliver 200 to 300 basis points of growth above the market over the midterm. Thank you very much, and I'll now pass the call over to Patrick Hallinan. Patrick Hallinan : Thanks, Chris, and good morning. As you've heard from us throughout this past year, we made meaningful progress on our transformation journey in 2024. I will now highlight the financial accomplishments achieved during the fourth quarter and then detail how we plan to continue towards our cost savings and margin targets to complete our strategic transformation and pivot to accelerated growth, and continual margin expansion. In the fourth quarter, we achieved approximately $110 million of pre-tax run rate cost savings. For 2024 in total, we generated approximately $500 million of pretax run rate cost savings. This result is in line with the framework we set both at the outset of the transformation, and in the beginning of the year, despite continued volume headwinds. This brings our aggregate savings to approximately $1.5 billion since the program's inception. Of the $1.5 billion, approximately $1 billion has come from the supply chain transformation with material productivity, and operations excellence driving approximately 75% of these savings captured to date. Our 2024 and program to date performance demonstrates strong execution by our team. We've achieved sequential adjusted gross margin improvement over each half-year period for the last two years. I would like to commend my colleagues across the organization for diligently continuing to pursue the cost reduction goals of our transformation. We continue to target $2 billion of pretax run rate cost savings by the end of 2025, as we complete the transformation. Of the $2 billion, we expect $1.5 billion to be delivered through our four core supply chain transformation initiatives of material productivity, operations excellence, footprint action, and complexity reduction. We are activating a robust pipeline of savings initiatives to support our expected gross margin expansion momentum. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our target of 35% plus adjusted gross margin. Moving to the next slide. We had a strong finish to the year as we continue to make progress on two of our most important focus areas, cash generation and gross margin expansion. We generated $565 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, bringing 2024 free cash flow generation to just over $750 million which was near the top end of our initial 2024 guidance range of $600 to $800 million. Our solid operational performance along with the proceeds from the infrastructure divestiture helped fund our dividend and reduced debt by $1.1 billion. Drivers of 2024 free cash flow were year-over-year growth in cash earnings, driven by operational improvement along with over $300 million of working capital benefit. Before year-end, we made the strategic decision to invest in roughly $200 million of strategic inventory to buffer the potential impact of changes to the operating environment. Overall, it is encouraging to see higher earnings as a result of operational improvements become a predominant driver of free cash flow. As these profitability enhancements are sustainable to our future free cash flow. Regarding capital allocation, in the near and medium term, our priorities are to fund the transformation and our acceleration of organic growth to support our long-standing dividend and to reduce debt. We remain committed to maintaining a solid investment-grade credit rating. In 2025, we plan to further reduce debt working towards our target leverage metric of approximately at or below 2.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. We expect to achieve this objective over the next twelve to eighteen months depending on the timing of modest portfolio pruning actions which we expect to generate greater than $500 million of proceeds. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin was 31.2% in the fourth quarter, a 140 basis point improvement versus prior year, primarily driven by savings from the supply chain transformation net of freight inflation, as well as normal wage and benefit inflation. With our performance this quarter, we achieved our long-held interim transformation goal of 30% adjusted gross margin in 2024. Given the dynamic nature currently surrounding tariff policies, we believe it is prudent to provide our 2025 planning assumptions today. Excluding the impact of new tariffs. Additionally, we have provided a view of our enterprise-wide US cost of goods sold by country of origin. Regarding tariffs, ultimately, we expect to mitigate the impact of potential scenarios through a combination of supply chain and price adjustments. I will now walk you through the 2025 planning assumptions for our company which exclude the impact of potential tariffs, I will then conclude by sharing our general approach to potential tariff mitigation. The 2025 pre-tariff base case implies a full-year GAAP earnings per share midpoint of $4.05 plus or minus $0.65. As well as adjusted earnings per share midpoint of $5.25 plus or minus $0.50. Our pre-tariff, free cash flow base is $750 million plus or minus $100 million. With the midpoint in a similar zone to 2024 led by operational earnings expansion. We will continue to prioritize inventory effectiveness in 2025 with the plan to reduce total working capital by $250 to $350 million. This includes persisting roughly $150 million of targeted inventory investments to facilitate an acceleration of supply chain changes to reduce US exposure to China production. Our 2025 outlook for capital expenditures is $350 to $400 million approximately 2.5% on sale. We expect first-quarter free cash flow to be an outflow consistent with typical historic working capital trend. This base case called for earning expansion in 2025 through organic growth from modest share gains and price increases in response to currency headwinds combined with supply chain cost structure improvement, that are primarily in our control. We are planning for the first half of 2025 aggregate market demand to remain muted at relatively stable levels compared to the second half of 2024, with the potential for a positive inflection later in the year. At our midpoint, we are expecting approximately 1% to 2% organic growth in the front half compared to approximately half a point of growth in the second half of 2024. This assumes modest share gain and easier comps against 2024 channel inventory reduction. The back half is expected to be modestly stronger supported in part by the price increases we are implementing in response to currency. The underlying demand assumptions are for a continuation of relative strength for professional tools as well as aerospace and industrial fastening, This is accompanied by an expectation for the presently soft automotive consumer and DIY demand trends to persist with the potential to inflect positive in the middle of 2025. These assumptions underpin our full-year plan for total company reported revenue to be relatively flat year over year with organic revenue growth roughly offsetting headwinds from currency and the final quarter of the infrastructure divestiture. Organic revenue growth is planned to be up just over 2% at the midpoint. Outpacing the overall market supported by targeted share gains in our businesses and modest pricing to offset currency pressure. Our planning range contemplates plus or minus 150 basis points of volume growth with the variances driven by market demand. Tools and outdoor organic revenue growth is expected to be in the low single digits at the midpoint. Supported by the same organic factors as the total company. Volume growth will be fueled by strategic investments focused on our core brands and directed towards ProLED, and industry-leading innovation, as well as local and focused market activation with additional field resources and targeted marketing initiatives. Industrial organic revenue is expected to be in the low single digits primarily driven by an aerospace market recovery, as well as market outperformance in industrial fasteners, driven by investments in end-market penetration. The automotive outlook which is tied to light vehicle production, is muted and as such, we are planning for this business to be negative in 2025 while prioritizing regions with share gain opportunities. From a reporting perspective, in 2025, we are shifting a small storage business from industrial into the tools and outdoor segment. We will disclose the impact of this change on a quarterly basis and it will not be included in either segment's reported organic growth. Our transformation program will be a positive contributor to adjusted gross margin again in 2025. And we will invest a portion of those savings for long-term organic growth and share gain. This year, we plan to invest an incremental $100 million to further advance our robust innovation pipeline and fuel market activation aimed to improve brand health and accelerate organic growth. Our planning expectation is that SG and A as a percentage of sales and 2025 remains around 22%. We will manage SG and A thoughtfully with the intent to preserve the investments designed to position the business for long-term growth. Turning to profitability, we expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to improve for the full year supported by top-line expansion and the benefits of the supply chain transformation program, with a neutral input cost outlook for 2025. Currency represents a $100 million headwind to profit based on the midpoint of January rates. A subset of this, approximately $40 million, is a transactional headwind to gross margin and is expected to be fully covered by price this year. We are implementing price with speed, but expect a slight net headwind in the front half of 2025. Segment margin in Tools and Outdoor is planned to be up year over year also driven by low single-digit growth and continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The industrial segment is expected to decline versus prior year as volume growth and operating improvement are offset by the mix pressures from automotive. Turning to other 2025 pre-tariff assumptions. GAAP earnings include pretax non-GAAP adjustments, ranging from $195 to $260 million largely related to the supply chain transformation program. With approximately 25% expected to be noncash footprint rationalization call. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to step up in 2025 to 15% with the first two quarters consistent with the first half rate experienced last year, at around 30%. Other 2025 modeling assumptions are noted on the slide. We expect the first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 12% to 13% of the $5.25 planning assumption underpinned by total company organic sales growth, that is expected to be low single digits. The range around the quarter is likely greater than normal given potential tariffs might change first-quarter ordering behavior. The EPS in the quarter is impacted by the tax profile discussed earlier. Adjusted first-quarter EBITDA is expected to be roughly 20% of our full-year expectation in this planning assumption, relatively consistent with pre-pandemic history. Which brings me to the impacts that are possible if tariffs are enacted and persist. We previously disclosed tools and outdoor US manufacturing footprint details in late 2024. We have updated this disclosure to reference US COGS for the entire company and share the latest information based on US trade-defined country of origin. Our latest view of China is lower, at $900 million to $1 billion of imports into the United States. And we continue to work to reduce this exposure. Our approach to any tariff scenario will be to offset the impacts with a mix of supply chain and pricing action. Which might lag the formalization of tariffs by two to three months therefore limiting P and L headwinds in the near term and maintaining our long-term margin objective. If the current addition of 10% tariffs on China remains in place, we would expect an annualized unmitigated impact of approximately $90 to $100 million based on how we would react this would result in a 2025 net impact of $10 to $20 million accounting for the time needed to deploy countermeasures. We expect the current situation to remain dynamic. We expect to await greater clarity before enacting any new measures beyond the work of accelerating US COGS out of China, which was underway and was accelerated during the second half of 2024. In summary, 2025 represents the final step along our transformation journey. With a continued focus on gross margin and cash, as well as a return to organic growth. Our top priorities remain delivering margin expansion, cash generation, and balance sheet strength. To position the company for long-term growth and value creation. With that, I will now pass the call back to Don. Don Allan : Thank you, Pat. As you heard this morning, the company is committed to continuing to make meaningful cash generation, and restoring balance sheet strength. While also investing in future sustainable growth to drive share gain. Even as we draw closer to the end of our strategic transformation, we are keeping the pedal down and moving decisively to drive results. While we don't know the ultimate tariff policy environment at this time, we believe we can successfully manage through them. And achieve our long-term financial goals. By accelerating our growth culture with operational excellence at its core, we are positioning the company to deliver improved sustainable organic growth margins, and cash flow to support strong long-term shareholder return via significant EBITDA. We are now ready for Q&A, Dennis. Dennis Lange : Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start Q&A, please. Thank you. Operator : Star one one on your telephone. You will then hear an automated message advising your hand is raised. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe good morning. Maybe just a first question, please, around the margin outlook. So maybe just remind us sort of what exit gross margin rates we should assume from this year. And on the operating margin line, I think the guide implies maybe 150 bps or so of increase this year versus 2024. Just wanted to check if that's the right ballpark in any kind of cadence of that expansion. Through the year. Thank you. Patrick Hallinan : Hey, Julian. Yeah. Gross margin priority for us. And our full-year objectives in 2025 versus 2024, are approaching 250-ish basis points of full-year margin expansion. Some headwinds will temper the first half will be 100 plus basis points up year over year in the first half. Gross margin wise. Some of those headwinds are some of the carrying costs like logistics, and absorption costs from the back half of last year. The lower automotive mix and some FX. And then in the back half, we'll get the pricing we're gonna put in place due to FX. So, you know, you'll have 100 plus basis points of expansion year over year in the first half and, like, 300 plus in the back half to drive that full year. I'd say for the fourth quarter, we're expecting to exit somewhere right in that midpoint between 34 and 35%. On the quarter. And, certainly, I think your second question was around operating margin, which both operating and EBITDA margin you're in the ZIP code of being kinda 150 plus basis points. And, obviously, some of the same gross margin dynamics will color the op and EBITDA margin throughout the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the comments on the gross margin. I'm just wondering the, you know, what sort of SG and A investments are you planning for the year? And I'm just wondering, you know, you know, the step up we saw this quarter, is that in the run rate into 2025? Because it does feel like you're, you know, really sort of raising the ante on growth here. So I'm just wondering what sort of investments making support that growth. Christopher Nelson : Hi, Nigel. It's Chris. Hope you're doing well. I'll start out and then pass it over to Pat. But, you know, specifically where we're looking to invest and where we are continuing to invest is we've focused more on our core brands starting last year as first and foremost, in making sure that we really drive outsized investment towards the professional in making sure that we have our pipeline of innovations really targeted towards that end user and making sure that we're accelerating product launches to make that end user safer and more productive on the job site. That's kinda job number one. And then as we've talked about in the past couple of announced we really focusing on making sure that we're putting local market market activation resources in the field. You know, we're I think we've been roughly 400 incremental folks in the field over the past know, over the past twelve months or so. And, you know, that is making sure that we can obviously underpenetrated, we can look to drive the market share growth that we see. As an opportunity, not only in in in what our largest market in the US, but obviously, we're looking at some other developing markets, specifically in EMEA. And then lastly, we are we are Yo. As we focus on those core brands of DEWALT, STANLEY, and CRAFTSMAN, we are investing incremental dollars into driving that brand health through increased, you know, promotion as well as advertising dollars there to to to really help drive those as our core brands moving forward. As far as the actual math on the run rates, I'll turn that over for It's a pact. Patrick Hallinan : Yeah. Nigel, for the full year, we would expect SG and A as a percentage of net sales to be around 22%, maybe a little bit shy of exactly that amount. And, you know, any given quarter, you know, kinda bouncing around 22 to 21%. I think mostly around 22. You could just, with the normal seasonal sales surge in the second quarter, see it get closer to 21 in the second quarter, but that has more to do with the seasonality of sales than real meaningful change in investment cadence throughout the quarter. I kinda just you're gonna be closer to 22% quarter in, quarter out. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open. Timothy Wojs : Hey, everybody. Good good morning. Thanks for the time. I I guess as you think about share gains, you know, and kinda and kinda furthering share gains in 2025 and and targeting low single-digit organic growth in tools. Could you just maybe discuss the the puts and takes to that? And I guess, really, what I'm wondering is how much of it is really accelerating and investing in DEWALT growth and and maybe seeing acceleration from that mid-single-digit growth you posted in 2025. Versus maybe seeing some of the non-default businesses kinda getting back to to market growth rates. Christopher Nelson : Hey, Tim. This is Chris. I'll I'll I'll jump on that. One of your First, I would say that, absolutely, we, you know, we have seen nice progress in DEWALT over the past seven quarters as we as we noted earlier. And we are certainly, as we look at emphasizing professional, we are gonna continue to to build on that success and look for continued acceleration in the DEWALT brands. But the other two brands that we that we're making sure that we we invest in as our core brand being Stanley and Craftsman, we do expect to see stabilization and starting to see some some modest share gains as we move into this year as well. And we've been taking steps to starting to see the progress there. So it it's you know, certainly, we we're gonna continue to build on the momentum that we've established in DEWALT, and we wanna see and establish another couple areas of momentum with both Crafts it's Stanley. Patrick Hallinan : I'd say one other thing, Tim, Tim, to keep in mind is, you know, we're really about the growth we're seeing and the seven quarters of DEWALT growth, I would just kinda remind you and others, in the back half, we have about a percentage point of of FX related price in there. Just so you're kind of if you're trying to build a walk year over year, second half to second half, you got about a percentage point of FX price that's also in the mix of that sales growth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brett Lindsay with Mizuho. Your line is now open. Brett Lindsay : Hey, good morning all. Appreciate all the details on the tariffs I know it's a fluid situation. But as it relates to the $10 million to $20 million net impact for 2025, Can you just dimension how much of the offsetting actions are price mitigation, versus the supply chain reconfiguration, and then maybe any color on this, the pricing assumption embedded on a full-year basis? Patrick Hallinan : Yeah. Yeah. We we obviously shared that that full-year impact on mitigated is in that $90 to $100 million range. And, you know, our ultimate job is to keep our brands competitive and and to work with our channel partners to keep them competitive. And so we're gonna be working to accelerate as we already were US cog base out of China And in the interim, you know, we will have to use some price on that. And we'll be working that in as appropriate in the coming weeks or months. The, you know, the real net impact is just the lag of getting measures in place and in particular some of the LIFO effects of when that forces some expense into our income statement in this first half of the year ahead of ahead of some of those actions actually hitting the p and l in the front half of this part of the year. Now we're gonna try to work it to zero. We're just trying to give people a range to think about which, you know, I'd say $10 to $20 million is certainly a workable range. And, again, we'll try to work it to zero if we can throughout the year. And thank you, Pat. That's a good answer to the question. Since you brought up tariffs, it's an opportunity to actually talk a little bit about why we feel like we've we've built a really solid plan to help us navigate through this period of time. And as we talk through probably for the last three or four earnings calls, We've been working through a planning process, and and then subsequent to that, an execution process. And for many of you who have followed us for a long time, you know, we went through tariffs in the first president Trump administration. We figured out how to navigate it back then. And we've built some muscle. We also have a really strong team that we've built here over the last couple of years. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, feel like we are well prepared to communicate this again. It will create a modest disruption for periods of time in the short term, But a reminder to everybody is that we You know, back in seven, eight years ago, about 40% of what we sold in the US came from China. And now we're down to a number that's closer to the mid-teens. And around 15%. And so substantial progress has been made not only in the last six months, but in the last six to seven years. And as Pat said in his comments, and just mentioned again, we're gonna continue to migrate away from China as a source for the US market. China will continue to be a source for other markets for us because it is a very strong operation from a manufacturing point of view. But I'll let Chris talk a little bit about what the execution plans are as much as we can because this is very fluid. Okay. Yeah. And, Don, thanks. You mentioned that we've we've really been working on not only the plan, but the execution since since earlier last year, and it's really three a three-pronged plan where with the first one has been working with for direct engagement with the policymakers. And we we we certainly look forward to continuing to work with the new administration. And we have been meeting with many of the key constituents in or around the new Trump administration since late last August. And, you know, making sure that as the administration, navigates how and, you know, how they would or could implement new tariffs, We are there and a voice to be heard as that happens. And, I think that that has been we found that to be a very positive, you know, relationship and a positive interaction thus far. We we plan to continue. Secondly, and this is kind of a continuation, but certainly, we've accelerated over the past six to nine months, is continuing to mitigate specific with a specific eye to derisking China our supply chain. As Don mentioned, we've made significant progress since the last tariff, you know, policy was put in place. And we've been accelerating the back half and you can see the results of where we are now. Now are gonna continue to drive those those actions and we're gonna continue to accelerate those supply chain moves. And we know how to do it. We're we're in the process of doing it. And and candidly, we really have never stopped doing it. And it's it's right on strategy for us as an organization because we do have a very large US manufacturing footprint, which is unique from our competition that we will continue to leverage as we go forward. And then lastly, and kind of, you know, the the more shorter-term aspect is saying, how do we need to make sure that we while we are working those other angles and those other parts the plan, are able to offset the immediate impact working with our channel partners and our end users on pricing actions. Now as we look to, you know, as we look to continue to mitigate, that'll be a part of the of the of the mix. But and it'll certainly be the the nearest term impact on that, which is remaining that we have yet to mitigate. So we feel really good about the plan we have in place and more importantly, the team we have executing. And I think that, you know, I I would I would just underscore the comments that we made earlier that we have full confidence in our long-term financial targets and margin aspirations that we we talked about during the investor day. And as tariffs come into place, it may be a temporary headwind as we as we navigate the the implementation plan we talked about, but it's not gonna have any long-term impact on our on our ability to reach those targets we've laid out. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to maybe just circle back a little bit appreciating the the answer detailed answer you just gave before on tariffs. But maybe just to kind of if I missed a couple of elements of it and and just wanted to zero in on a a couple of areas of clarification. First off, I believe at the Investor Day and and previously, you talked about a potential $200 million headwind for from China, if tabs went from 25% to 60%. How does that reconcile with the 10% incremental on China tariffs being $90 to $100? So, you know, it feels like I'm missing something there on the on the prior math or the current math. And also just to confirm in terms of the plan to mitigate I I would think I appreciate the fact that maybe these components are a little fluid, but I would think that in 2025, it would be primarily done through price and, you know, at the same time, setting up action maybe for 2026 to have any benefits from supply chain changes, if that's the right way to think about it. And if if there's also any similar types of thoughts around your exposure to Mexico, if those tariffs do come down the line also, if there are any similar plans in place? Don Allan : Yeah. Well, I'll start. So think Chris did a very good job articulating our plan. Around tariffs. And, yes, as he said, the first steps will be around price. There will be obviously delays associated with that. Because we have to work with our customers to get these types of things in place. We also have to see if this situation settles down. It's still very fluid right now. And so those are all factors that we'll consider. In the meantime, as Chris said, we're continuing to move forward in our supply chain mitigation actions. Anything, we're accelerating them even faster than we were in the back half of last year. And so we will continue to move quickly make permanent fixes versus just, you know, pricing fixes. And so there's things that will continue to focus our energy on, and we feel like we have a very good plan to address this as both he and I mentioned. Mexico, you can see from the pie chart what the number is, and so it's a guess as to where that might go, but you can do the math yourself on that particular one. And I'll have Pat answer the question on the $200 million versus this current scenario. Patrick Hallinan : Yeah. Yeah. Thanks, Don. And I'd start just with echoing what Chris was communicating is you know, we're focused on our long-term margin objectives. And so everything we're doing in addressing the tariff situation is to keep ourselves on the appropriate margin trajectory so we can invest in innovation and brand building and field support. And so that's you know, what underpins all of this, Mike, The first question you had around the the difference between the China scenario, we communicated in the fall versus the present, is really the fall scenario was confined to List three zero one up through part four a. And so it was a narrower set of SKUs but a higher obvious increase, and this is a lower increase, but basically, as we understand the current executive order, it's not confined to any set of SKUs. So that's the difference between the two scenarios of $90 to $100 million today is an incremental 10% on everything, versus in the past, it was going from 25 to 60 on a narrower set of thanks. And that's really the difference. And then as Don mentioned, you know, about 20-ish percent of our global COGS base predominantly in the tools and outdoor business comes from Mexico, but just as we're doing right now with China you know, should anything materialize with Mexico, you know, we will we will wait some days or weeks to make sure the dust is settled. And or at least settled sufficiently so that any move we're making kind of reflects potential knock-on effects. And we're we're kinda making one set of moves with our channel partners instead of whipsawing day to day or week to week. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is now open. Rob Wertheimer : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. And and just to you guys have covered tariffs pretty well. And just to switch away for a minute, I wanted to ask about the composition of core growth and tools and of core growth, basically, where you had, you know, 2% North America, 8% rest, we're all 4% Europe. So it's kind of the apps, so what I would've guessed in some ways. Anything structural going on there with share gain, with, you know, presence, maybe you could just comment on that. Christopher Nelson : You. So I I think that, you know, we've we've I'll cover North America first and just say that we, you know, are strategy and the focus that we laid out over a year ago is is bearing fruit with the professional as we see a stronger professional market and stronger professional end user. And, specifically, you can see that progress with the wall. And, you know, that coupled with the fact that we have continued to make progress specifically in North America, on our ability to service our customers. And, you know, improving our fill rates that will allow us to continue to be able to entertain new opportunities for increased presence in in in their in their assortment is is made a nice difference that we see in North America. As far as if I go over to EMEA, I'd say that, you know, a part of what we laid out as well is that we were gonna look at making incremental investments in key markets that we saw not only a share gain opportunity, but we also saw k. Evolving in a in a in a in a in a better growth trajectory than some of the other more traditional markets. We've made those investments, and we're seeing tremendous payback on those, and we're seeing a lot of a lot of progress. And once again, specifically with with some of our our DEWALT offerings. So those are kind of, like, the key underpinnings that we see in in the share growth that we would as we pointed out, you know, in a in a market that we're thinking about for 2025 is being relatively flat, And then, you know, we we are reflecting the progress that we're seeing in those areas into our into our gut. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Zelman and Associates. Your line is now open. Adam Baumgarten : Hey. Good morning. Just on the promotional environment, you did mention a solid promotional season. Did that have any negative impact on gross margin in the quarter? And then maybe how you're thinking about 2025 from a from a promotional perspective. Don Allan : Yeah. Yeah. Adam. I wouldn't call it negative because, you know, we're quite satisfied with the promotional placement that we had in the fourth quarter and the way we executed with our channel partners and what it delivered in the terms of growth. It was a slight marginal headwind to the quarter, obviously, because of what a promotion is. But I would say that, you know, 2024 was a year where, you know, like, at the end of 2023, we were getting very much back towards our traditional promotional cadence. 2024 was probably the first full year where we had both the supply chain and the calendarization back at the level we would expect to persist. And so I think it played a great role in making for a strong fourth quarter for us. And on the margin, it was a bit of a gross margin headwind. But I would say that you know, things like automotive mix were a bit a bit more of a headwind in the quarter than promotion. But, Chris, anything you would add? Christopher Nelson : That's the only thing I promotional I would add to that as well, it does manifest itself with a a very modest Yo. Price impact in in the quarter that we we talked about. The placement that we received in getting back to the kind of where we see the healthy level of placement from a promotion that that the the space that we captured was to promote products that are accretive. So we feel good about our promotional positioning and feel good about coming back in capturing some of that that that share of that promotional space. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. Dennis Lange : Thanks, Shannon. We'd like to thank everyone again for their time and participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Operator : Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
