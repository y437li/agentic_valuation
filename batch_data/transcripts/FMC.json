Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the First Quarter 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call for FMC Corp. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Alisha Bellezza, Director of Investor Relations for FMC Corp. Ms. Bellezza, please, you may begin. Alisha Bellezza : Thank you, Keely. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FMC Corporation's first quarter earnings call. With me today are Pierre Brondeau, President Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, who will review our quarter performance, business segment results and provide an update on our 2014 outlook; and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will present select financial results. Pierre will conclude with an update on the plan to separate into 2 companies. Following his comments, we'll be joined by Mark Douglas, President FMC Agricultural Solutions; Ed Flynn, President FMC Minerals; and Mike Smith, Vice President and Global Business Director, FMC Health and Nutrition, to address your questions. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including, but not limited to, those factors identified in our release and in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based on these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms, as well as other non-GAAP financial terms that we may refer to during today's conference call, are provided on our website. Our 2014 outlook statement, which provides guidance for the full year and the second quarter of 2014, can also be found on our website. I will now turn the call over to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau: Thank you, Alisha, and good morning, everyone. In the release, you saw that we generated $942 million in revenues, an increase of 3% over the first quarter of last year. We delivered $0.95 in adjusted EPS, a decrease of 12% over last year, largely due to lower earnings in Agricultural Solutions. This was driven by the widely reported weather factors that impacted the entire industry. Combined with currency movements, the lower ag performance reduced EPS by approximately $0.30 compared to the guidance we gave just over 3 months ago. Offsetting this, were strong results in Health and Nutrition and Minerals, with both segments returning results in line with our guidance and well ahead of the same period last year. First quarter sales in Agricultural Solutions were $467 million, down 6%, and segment earnings were $120 million, down 26%. Segment operating margin was lower compared to the prior year primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, continued investments in sales, marketing and technical personnel and changes in product mix caused by difficult weather conditions. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we were encouraged by the prospects in North America and Brazil, and we had expected segment earnings to be up low-teens percent. We had seen strong early demand in North America for 2 emerging products : Capture LFR insecticides and Authority herbicides. The increasing concern over corn rootworm and glyphosate-resistance supported our expectation that these brands would continue to outpace market growth throughout the first and second quarters of 2014. However, as the actually cold weather persisted throughout the quarter and into April, farmers delayed their use of these products, and it became clear that product wasn't moving through the distributions channels. In Brazil, our results were impacted by the record-breaking drought in S\u00e3o Paulo state. This is the region that represents 61% of the country's sugarcane market, the market in which FMC holds over 20% share with a broad portfolio of insecticide and herbicide. Our herbicide products are important in sugarcane, as they control difficult weeds that can severely impact yields. The drought conditions reduced crop replanting that would have normally taken place during this growing season, resulting in fewer herbicide applications compared to the previous year. Compared to our initial guidance, the adverse weather conditions in North America and Brazil reduced adjusted earnings in the first quarter by approximately $0.25 per share, with unfavorable currency movement, reducing earnings by a further $0.04 per share. Looking across quarters, we had a very successful 2013-14 season in Latin America. We are extremely pleased with the advances that were made in expanding our Latin American soybean presence and our market position in these crops, such as tomatoes and potatoes, segments that leverage our portfolio of insecticide and fungicide. In Brazil, we successfully launched Locker, a new 3-way fungicide for soybeans, and we gained traction with Talisman, a broad-spectrum insecticide for use in both soybeans and cotton. We also grew in Southern Brazil by expanding our relationship with cooperatives and further strengthening our most important customer relationship with another successful year of customer events. As widely reported, planting in North America remains later than historical averages. We now believe that the combination of delayed planting and lower corn acres could result in fewer applications of Capture LFR to control corn rootworm. However, we remain confident that the change in crop mix toward additional soybean acres will be favorable to us and will drive increased demand for Authority brand in herbicide. These products provide superior control of glyphosate-resistant weeds from growers throughout the Midwest and South. We also continue to focus on our strong presence in these crops, such as sunflowers and rice, that contribute to growth opportunity in this region. In 2014, we are strengthening our portfolio with several new product introductions into key segments within both North and Latin America. We have developed 3 new herbicide products for corn, Anthem, Solstice and Marvel, which will complement our resistance management portfolio in North America. Additionally, in the second half of the year, we expect strong market reception in Brazil, as we introduce our new cotton fungicide, Eclipse, and expand our Rugby insecticide into soybeans. Our strong customer relationships, along with these new product introductions, would allow us to further benefit from the expected increases in soybean and cotton acres. With the second quarter earnings increasing high teens to low 20% and the second half up approximately 35% versus the previous year, we expect that 2014 will follow a different pattern from our original outlook. However, a second half year-on-year increase above 30% is not unprecedented and is actually in line with what we have seen in recent years. We will compensate for the potential loss of some Capture LFR sales in North America in multiple ways. There will be a recovery in Q2 and early Q3 of delayed first quarter sales. We are seeing a favorable change in crop mix toward additional soybean acres in Brazil and North America, combined with a strong cotton and soybean planting season in Latin America in the second half of the year. We continue to gain market share in corn, soybean and cotton, driven by the strong portfolio of new products. Given these factors, we are highly confident in achieving outlook of mid-teens percent year-on-year growth in 2014, leading to another record year of earnings. In conclusion, our existing portfolio continues to demonstrate its resilience. We continue to gain market share in soybean and corn, and we are successfully introducing new products, including the 7 major brands already mentioned today. In addition, we have a very rich pipeline of products in development, including our Biosolutions research. Our innovation engine will continue to make FMC the fastest-growing ag company for years to come. Now turning to Health and Nutrition. Segment revenues of $226 million increased 18%, and operating profit of $51 million was up 17% over last year. In the quarter, demand for colloidal MCC and carrageenan-based ingredients increased in Nutrition end markets. We continue to work closely with our customers to help develop new applications for protein delivery such as our non-milk in North America and cereal-based beverages in Asia. Our new Thailand MCC plant, which is expected to start at the beginning of 2015, will support our growth in Asia. In Health end markets, we saw robust demand for our pharmaceutical excipients, especially binders, which was consistent with our expected growth rate and confirmed our view that overall pharmaceutical demand has returned to historical growth patterns. Our Avicel platform continues to benefit from a strong brand recognition. As we expand our product portfolio to include new encapsulation solutions and Omega-3 offerings, we expect to leverage our resources and deliver higher growth rates from our Health portfolio than we have seen historically. In Omega-3, our new Seal Sands facility received the necessary regulatory approvals, and we delivered our first customer shipments of pharmaceutical-grade products. Seal Sands utilizes advanced technology to manufacture high-purity, high-concentration products that command a premium price over low-concentration Omega-3 and is essential for pharmaceutical-grade applications. We were pleased to see 3 new prescription formulations of Omega-3s approved by the FDA earlier this year. We see this as a positive development for near-term demand for our products. Our technology allows us to efficiently serve the pharmaceutical market and, over time, will enable cost-effective penetration into the high-concentration Nutraceutical end markets. The Health and Nutrition business faced some headwinds during the first quarter. Asian currency movements and continued increases in seaweed cost had a modest impact on business performance. We have been working closely with customers in successfully offsetting this higher cost through a combination of price increases, ingredient substitutions and reformulation that create new solutions to meet their market needs. Looking forward, in Health and Nutrition, we expect second quarter segment earnings to increase low-teens percent over the previous year. In light of the strong first quarter performance and trends in the Health and Nutrition end market, we continue to expect that full year segment earnings will increase mid-teens percent. Now let me review Minerals. In the quarter, revenues of $249 million increased 11%, and operating profit of $37 million increased 27%. The businesses performed as planned, with improved operations, resulting in additional production volume. In Alkali Chemicals, revenue of $185 million were 2% higher than last year. As anticipated pricing, excluding freight charges, was above the previous year, the most notable increase in Asian export prices. Higher products and volume in the quarter also contributed to the sales growth. Revenues increases were partially offset by higher energy cost. Prolonged cold weather contributed to a spike in natural gas prices that was unfavorable in the quarter. Additionally, our contract prices for coal were higher than last year. We are looking at alternatives to reduce this cost, including renegotiation of our coal contract and alternative supply sources. In Lithium, revenues of $64 million increased 45% over the previous year. Higher volumes out of Argentina allowed us to take advantage of increased demand for Lithium, particularly in energy storage application. Pricing remained stable during the quarter, with product mix more heavily weighted toward primaries, which account for most of the volume growth. The business achieved a low-teens operating margin in the quarter despite continued inflation headwinds in Argentina. We expect the operating margin to continue improving sequentially throughout 2014. Looking at the second quarter, segment earnings in Minerals are expected to be up low-teens percent over the second quarter of 2013, driven mainly by increases in volume. For the full year, we expect segment earnings to increase high-teens percent in 2014. As we described during our last earnings call, our outlook for Alkali Chemicals only includes price increases that are specified in existing short- and long-term contracts. We remain optimistic that the soda ash pricing environment is improving, and we continue to be very supportive of ANSAC's efforts to pursue additional price gains in export markets. We remain confident that we'll produce record volumes as we operate within normal geological conditions and continue to benefit from higher products and volumes as a result of the Manufacturing Excellence programs. In Lithium, higher production volumes supporting increased demand will be the largest driver of improved business performance. Increased sales in primaries are expected to significantly contribute to revenue and earnings growth in 2014. However, it is important to remember that more than half of our production is further processed into downstream products. We maintain leading-market position in these downstream segments, and we'll continue to manage our supply to maximize overall margin. We remain confident in our ability to continue delivering operating margin improvement sequentially throughout this year. Turning to our outlook. For the second quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $1.05 to $1.15 per diluted share, a 17% increase versus the second quarter of 2013, at the midpoint of the range. Although weather resulted in a slower-than-anticipated start in ag, we expect a strong second quarter performance, with segment earnings of high teens to 20% over the second quarter 2013. In Health and Nutrition, we expect to deliver a low-teens percentage increase in segment earnings, driven by strong demand across all product categories and in all major end markets. In Minerals, our outlook includes continued Lithium margin improvement and sequential pricing improvement in soda ash. This combination, along with higher production volume in both businesses, is expected to increase segment earnings by low-teens percent compared to the second quarter 2013. For the full year, our expectation of adjusted earnings continues to be $4.35 to $4.55 per diluted share, a 15% increase over 2013, at the midpoint of the range. We are maintaining our outlook for full year revenues in segment earnings in Agricultural Solutions to be at mid-teens percent over the previous year. The second half of the year is expected to show strong results, driven by increased soybean and cotton acreage in Latin America, improved sugarcane production in Brazil, new product introduction and our investment in market access channel around the world will continue to strengthen our customer relationship. We are confident 2014 would be another record year for ag, building on the 10 previous years of record performance. In Health and Nutrition, we anticipate full year revenue growth of mid- to high-teens percent, with segment earnings up mid-teens percent over 2013. We see strong market demand for our stability and texture solutions in Nutrition end markets, and we are extremely pleased with how our Health ingredients portfolio is performing in markets that exhibits solid underlying growth. In Minerals, both Alkali Chemicals and Lithium will deliver record annual volumes in 2014 as a result of our Operational Excellence programs. We see strong market demand in Lithium and favorable pricing trends in soda ash. We continue to expect segment revenues to increase in the mid- to high-single digits percentage and segment earnings to improve high-teens percent over 2013. I will now turn the call over to Paul to cover financial highlights. Paul W. Graves: Thanks, Pierre. Today, I'll focus on a few specific items that were notable in the quarter, including foreign exchange movements and cash generation. I will also touch on capital spending, the closing of the Peroxygens transaction and separation costs incurred to date. As Pierre mentioned, foreign exchange was a headwind in the quarter. Across all of the businesses, unfavorable currency movements impacted adjusted EPS by approximately $0.05. In particular, adverse movements in the Brazilian reais, a range of Asian currencies and the Argentine peso all hit our reported earnings despite a counteracting favorable movement in the euro. We continue to mitigate our exposures with appropriate hedges wherever practical. This quarter was an unusual one, with multiple factors contributing to lower-than-expected operating cash flow. In the quarter, cash required by operating activities was $85 million. The largest single factor was the lower EBIT performance in Agricultural Solutions, although some temporary working capital increases in Health and Nutrition and lower receipts from government receivables in Lithium also contributed to the lower performance. The second quarter is traditionally our strongest cash generation quarter, as a significant proportion of our Latin American season sales are collected. We expect this year to follow a similar pattern. Our actions to reduce our working capital remain on track, with significant progress made today on inventory levels in Agricultural Solutions. We're now rolling out similar programs in Health and Nutrition. We have initiated programs focused on our terms of sales in every business and have commenced the final step in implementing a global procurement system that will allow us to take a more dynamic approach to how we handle payment terms to our vendors. As we've said before, we remain very focused on increasing our operating cash flow, but we will tread very carefully around any major changes to our working capital policies, given the importance of the use of working capital to support our customers and our business model. We expect to see the benefits of our efforts to start to show later in 2014 and into 2015. As expected, capital additions were approximately $47 million in the quarter, compared to a total of $26 million in 2013. Increased spending in the quarter was primarily associated with construction of the Thailand MCC facility, which remains on track to begin commercial sales in early 2015. In the quarter, we completed the sale of Peroxygens, receiving net after-tax cash proceeds of $193 million. With regard to the separation process, we incurred approximately $3 million in separation cost in the quarter, largely a result of spending on external advisers. We expect that costs to increase in the next few quarters, as we start to execute on the complex process of separation. We are currently performing a thorough review of the expected additional costs, and we'll report an updated estimate with our second quarter results. Finally, in the quarter, we announced an 11% increase in our dividend rate, in line with the earnings growth we delivered in 2013. With that, I will now turn the call back to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau: Thank you, Paul. Before we turn to Q&A, let me brief you on the separation activities. We have made steady progress since announcing our plan to separate FMC into 2 publicly traded company. A dedicated program management office is in place to manage the separation-related activities. Work on this complex separation is well under way, and the P&L model ensures that our business teams can remain focused solely on their operations. We have named several internal leaders who will be aligned with each new company. And importantly, our search for a CEO for FMC Minerals is progressing well. We expect to make an announcement about this in the second quarter. The separation process is complex, but we are confident that we are on track to complete the transaction in the first half of 2015. We will continue to update you on our progress over the coming months. Now I will turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America. Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Can you discuss how the weather-related impacts might have broken out between North America and Latin America and, basically, the polar vortex versus the drought-related pressures that you referenced in S\u00e3o Paulo? Pierre R. Brondeau: Yes. I would say, as you know, the first quarter in Latin America is much smaller in size than our business in North America, where usually the first quarter is a much larger quarter. So if you'll look versus our expectation, by far, the biggest gap will reside in North America. That is where we were expecting to have the biggest sales because of the dedication. Now on top of that, which did not help, we had slower sales in Brazil than what we would be expecting. But once again, it doesn't help in a situation which is difficult from a weather standpoint, but the vast majority of the gap came from delay in pre-emergent planting, pre-emergent product. There was a delay also in Capture LFR for us for corn, so the vast majority of the problem came from North America. Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : So, Pierre, just a follow up on that. You obviously left your annual EPS range unchanged. Is it a case that these are entirely transitory and you'll make it up in future quarters? Or is some of it lost permanently just due to the vagaries of the season and you have other counterbalancing positives to get to the same place for the annual EPS? Pierre R. Brondeau: Yes. I think it is the latter. First, what we lost in Brazil, if you look at a quarter when the season is back end of the year, is lost. But it's not that critical in size. So the focus in terms of what did not happen in the first quarter should be on North America. A large part of what was not sold in North America will be sold -- will be recovered throughout Q2 and Q3. That, we know. But we believe, especially for corn and Capture LFR, we believe that there is some sales which are being lost, and that's why you don't see a complete transfer of what was lost in Q1 into Q2. We won't have a robust Q2, but you will not see a 100% transfer. But there is mitigating factors, which I see, if I look to the future, as overwhelmingly positive. First, there is, for multiple reasons, I'm sure you have heard, there is a transfer to more soybean crops, which for us, is important as our market share in soybean is much stronger than our market share in crops. There is, today, a strong planting season with solid acreage increase in Latin America, possibly beyond what we're expecting. Most importantly, we have introduced multiple new products. I mentioned in the script 7 new brands we've put on the market. And I have to say that those products are taking off very, very strongly and seeing a very strong demand. So if I look at where we are, the possible loss we could see in one specific product, which is for corn, will be more than compensated by what we see happening around that and a penetration of new technology. Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I appreciate the color, Pierre. Last question, if I may, maybe for Paul. Can you discuss your payment terms by region and/or product line and how they might change in the future, if at all, as you increase your focus on working capital? Paul W. Graves: I think if I was to go through payment terms for every product and every region, I might take up most of the rest of the call. I mean it certainly varies. If you mean in payment terms, you mean our terms of sales rather than our payment terms, it's certainly the case that, generally speaking, we have our shortest terms in the Americas, North America. We have probably our longest terms, particularly in ag, down in Latin America. Europe tends to be closer to the North American example. And Asia tends to be a bit further out. So generally speaking, as our mix of sale changes towards emerging markets, we tend to experience longer collection terms. Now, as we look forward, I think the question is open for others to how we want to think about going to market with some of our customers and with some of our products. It's early stages in most of our business to have that assessment, so I think it would be premature for me to try and predict what the impact would be. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse. John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : So with regard to your North American ag business, my understanding was, historically, it's always been a very large pre-emergents business. It sounds like that may be changing a little bit where it's more of an even mix. But can you walk us through how we should be thinking about the mix in North America? Or how much is -- what percent, say, is pre-emergents versus post-emergents? Pierre R. Brondeau: Yes. I'll get Mark to comment. But there is a change. I mean, there is change. Pre-emergent has always been big for us, but we are evolving. And I do say that we are strengthening, also, our position in corn and soybean and beyond pre-emergents. So there is an evolving product line, and we are gaining market share in crops where we've been, historically, claiming were not a target. But we have such a strong portfolio and we are at the size now that, clearly, we are evolving our portfolio with those crops. And I must say, very successfully, with a lot of runway. Mark, you want to add? Mark A. Douglas: No. I think, John, what I would say there is the pre's are very important to us. They have grown significantly over the last few years, as you know, both on soy for glyphosate resistance and the corn rootworm resistance. But now we're introducing some new suites of products, in particular, Anthem in North America, as a soy herbicide that can be used both as a pre and a post. But we see the post side growing. We're also expanding into corn on the post side. So I think you'll see it creep keep up over the next couple of years as we gain traction with those brands and market access. So definitely, pre's is not going to go away for us. We see resistance acres continuing to grow, especially on the soy side. So you'll see that as a major area, but expect the posts to start to grow and become more of a significant part of the portfolio, especially as we go into the '15, '16 seasons and the next couple of years. John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up. I know, historically, there's normally a pretty solid margin drop off from the first half of the year to the second half just because of geographic mix. And I guess I'm wondering how we should be thinking about that in 2014, just given that, again, some of this pre-emergent products is actually moving kind of later in the year on the North American side. So how should we be thinking about the margin progression? Pierre R. Brondeau: Yes. I think, John, what you're seeing is because there is a push, a transfer, from Q1 into Q2, Q3 so you will see lots of those North American high-margin product being pushed in the second half of the year. So you will have a more uniform or less of a differential in the margin this year because there is a delay in the North American season. So those high-margin product will be pushed into Q2 and into Q3, smoothing out the differential in term of margin. John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Maybe one last question, if I could. On the Health and Nutrition side, your outlook for low-teens growth in the second quarter, I guess, why is it, sequentially -- why is that growth moderating, especially when you've got the Omega-3 platform actually, it sounds like, up and running now and it should be a contributor to revenue and profits? Pierre R. Brondeau: Yes. It is -- that's actually a good question, John. It is just the fact that, today, because we are starting into the Omega-3 business, the orders are a bit more lumpy than for our other products. So we're going to have a pattern of order for Omega-3 as we are starting to sell to some large customers, and we have not yet reached a number of customers such that we'll see a very smooth ordering pattern for the year. We expect to see that much smoother in the '15 and '16. But this year, there will be some lumpiness in Health and Nutrition just because of the order pattern on Omega-3. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Robert Walker of Jefferies. Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : I guess, in ag, what is the difference in margins between North and South America? And how much was mix a factor in the Q1 margin decline? Pierre R. Brondeau: Yes. Go ahead, Mark. Mark A. Douglas: Yes. Robert, we don't actually disclose the margins between North and Latin America, but they are different. North America is the higher-margin area for us and Latin America tends to be a little lower. Obviously, it depends on mix. Mix is an impact, given where we saw North America come out and where we saw Latin America come out, given the weather conditions Pierre already talked about. But there is a difference between the 2. You can't look at the whole Americas and say that they are the same. And as North America was down versus our forecasts, given the weather conditions, we saw that mix change from a year-on-year. Pierre R. Brondeau: Without going in too much detail around regional, but to give you a sense for last year, if you take the first quarter, usually, which is very strongly driven by North America, we tend to have an operational margin for FMC ag business, which is north of 30%. Last year, it was 33%, where you usually see a fourth quarter, which is more in the 20s to mid-20s. So that give you a sense -- and the fourth quarter is usually very much driven by Latin America. So that gives you a sense of the difference in mix and product line we are selling in those 2 regions. Just the question John asked around the way our product line is evolving with a change in pre and post mix, we're going to see, potentially, over the years, not this year, this being different and changing, with maybe a smoother differential from a quarter to another. Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. And how much of your normal Q2 sales in ag slipped into Q3 because of the delayed planting? Pierre R. Brondeau: Well, if you look, we were initially forecasting in Q2 in the mid-teens growth. And now we are looking maybe in the low 20s, so that gives you a sense. About 1/3, 1/4 of the growth in the second quarter is coming from Q1 sales. And then we're going to have Q3, but Q3 is a bit more complicated because we're going to have a combination of some of the sales pushed up from Q1. We're going to have a very favorable mix around soybean. And we're going to have new technology. Maybe I can take the opportunity to talk a bit about the second half because I know a 35% increase in the second half of the year year-on-year seems to be like a big number. We are quite comfortable here with that number. First, if you look at historical pattern, look at your '12 versus '11. We had a 37% increase in the second half versus the first half, with a fourth quarter which was up 52%. Even last year, which was not the most spectacular growth, we still had a fourth quarter with a 24% growth year-on-year. So those numbers, from 24% to 52%, don't make this second half that different from historical data. If you look at the way we look at it, it's a fairly simple break. If you take our growth rate to get to the mid-teens, there is 3 big buckets. About 1/3 of our growth is going to come from what we see as acre change and a change in the mix between soybean and corn. There will be 1/3 which will be coming from the market share gain we have in soybean and corn, and most of that driven by new technology. I think it's a trend we see. We like it. Our strategy is evolving. We will be more of a player in larger row crops. And then 1/3 is really new technology for other crops. We've talked about the secondary type of crops. So those 3 1/3s are very well-defined and makes us quite comfortable around the numbers we are contemplating for the second half. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : I wanted to sort of kick the dead horse one more time on the ag discussion. In the first quarter, obviously, besides North America, you're looking at sort of Northern Hemisphere sales overall as being contributive to the quarter. So if you look at the European sales and Asian sales versus your North American sales, was the North American sales -- in other words, were the regions outside of North America, where the weather was more normal and hopefully you're benefiting just from share gains and new product introductions, were volumes or revenues up in Europe and Asia, even though it's a small business for you, offsetting the weakness in North America a little bit? Pierre R. Brondeau: If you look -- I'm going to ask Mark to comment in more detail. But if you look, at the end of the day, the first quarter for us is an Americas story and mostly a North American story. I mean, remember, I think Europe is about -- or EMEA is about 6% of our sales and Asia is about 16% of our sales. You put on top of that, that's usually because of our market share in pre product, in pre-emergent product, in North America, and we have the end of the Brazilian season, usually, it's mostly a North American story. So yes, we didn't suffer like other companies did. We didn't suffer. Europe was, overall, healthy, and Asia is in good shape. But Asia, for the rest of the year, we do have some great growth expectations. But in the first quarter, those are too small to influence the -- our numbers. Mark, you want to add? Mark A. Douglas: Wouldn't add a lot to what you said. I mean, Asia is doing well. We have, as you said, good growth expectations. We have good market access strategies in place in Indonesia, Philippines. We see good growth in China. Europe, as we said, is only 6% of the portfolio, so it doesn't really swing a lot in Q1. But we do expect a number of our activities in Europe to benefit on the herbicide side as we go through the year. So we do expect growth as we go through Q2, Q3 and possibly into Q4 for Europe. But Q1 was not a factor. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : And as a follow up and switching gears a little bit. On the Lithium business, you talked about expectations of sequential margin improvement there through the year. How should we think about where sort of the fourth quarter should end up in terms of margins and where we should -- what we should look for in 2015? Pierre R. Brondeau: Yes. I think we're going to go this year from a low-teens margin to mid-teens EBIT margin. That's the range we are expecting for the Lithium business. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. And then in 2015, hopefully, you'll start with low teens -- with mid-teens and go from there? Pierre R. Brondeau: Yes. Correct, correct. We've always said this business is simply north of 15% EBIT margin when it's operating. So we clearly are on the recovery part. We like what we see. We like our market position. We are able to renegotiate those contracts we've been away from. When I think I said with 45% increase in sales in Lithium, it's a lot of renegotiations to take place on contracts. So it's going to improve to the mid-teens and take off from mid-teens in 2015. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Pierre, I appreciate your confidence for the second half there for ag, but can you maybe share some of the risks that you might see in the second half? I mean, some of the North American business, as you noted, was pre-emergent, can some of your customers skip that potentially and just move on? I just want to understand what, maybe, things you need to watch out for potentially. Pierre R. Brondeau: Well it's the ag world, there is always risk. Let me talk about North America. We are in April. We know the second quarter was a slow start. But right now, I mean, products are moving, so there is no doubt that we are on a positive trend. So the numbers we are giving, at least for the North American part, are quite solid. The question always -- I mean, the question will always be, \"Should we suffer from a terrible weather condition, which is not predictable today in Brazil?\" You never know that, we don't see it. The demand is robust. The plan for acreage planting is robust. Our new product introduction is incredibly successful beyond our expectation. Listen, I would dare to say, Mike, that it would not -- we would not have had the weather we had in the first quarter, looking at the fact that we will close the year at 15% increase despite the first quarter, we would have had, in our ag business, an absolutely incredible year beyond what we're expecting. That's why we have a level of confidence, which is strong, assuming there is not anything -- we are not -- we could not predict in Latin America in the back end of the year. From the North American market, products are moving, we are following that on a daily basis. But so far, so good. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then you talked about 1/3 of the improvement coming from market share in soybean and corn. What is it in terms of the new technology that you're rolling out that is giving you the edge? And then when you talk about that, is that a business that customers have said, \"You won this, we'll just take it when we need it\"? Pierre R. Brondeau: I'll let the world ag expert answer this one. Mark A. Douglas: Thanks, Pierre. Yes, Mike, when you look at soybeans, as an example, and let's take the Latin America acreage, it's a big market. If you go back to 2011, we had about a 3% market share in what was over a $3 billion market. If you look at our business last year, we were at 6.5% market share in a $5 billion market, and that's all coming through our insecticide portfolio and now our new fungicide portfolio. So we're definitely increasing market share. Why are we doing that? We have some technologies that are broad-based. Pierre mentioned in the script a product called Talisman. That was a product we've had for cotton growers for many years, for the last few years, and certainly it's a broad-spectrum insecticide. It's now playing very well into the soy arena, where we see different types of pests coming and the growers want to utilize a broad-spectrum insecticide. We already have, as you know, and we talked about very strong relationships with cotton growers. We have a high market share that allows us to translate that market access to soy. So it's a combination of bringing new technologies like the Talisman, new fungicides like Locker, plus our strong market access and already exposure to current crops. We like that mix and we're going to push more new products down that pipeline as we go forward. I think we've said in the past that about 25% of our portfolio comes from new products introduced in the last 5 years. As we head through 2015, we expect that number to increase to 30%. So we're seeing that throughput of new technologies, and it'll continue at a rate. Pierre R. Brondeau: I think, Mike, we've talked a lot about R&D model, how we access actives, then do tax and formulations. This technology engine is giving us one of the fastest product invention that any ag firm might have. And we've been, right or wrong, because things have been good so far, but we've been careful on how aggressively we would penetrate the soybean or corn market. But when we see the possibilities we have to resolve some of our issues our customers are facing, and some of the technologies we have, I think we're not going to hold back and we're going to focus as much on crops like soybean and corn as we've been in the past on cotton and sugarcane or other smaller crops like potato or rice. So it's working. And those are new products, which are responding to a changing environment and customer needs. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with First Analysis. Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : On the Lithium side, can you comment a little bit on what you're seeing in organometallics, particularly as you get into the ag business, where there have been some changes there? Pierre R. Brondeau: Could you repeat that question, please? I couldn't understand what you said. Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : I was wondering about organometallics within the Lithium market, and if you're seeing any weakness in butyllithium, in particular. I know that you guys have exposure in polymerization, but was wondering if you were seeing weakness in ag or crop protection synthesis products. Pierre R. Brondeau: Yes. Ed can answer. I mean, there was a major change, where a customer, Bayer, moved away from a product which was using butyllithium. So I would say no weakness for us or our competitors, from a market standpoint, in butyllithium. But certainly, an impact we have been seeing because Bayer was such an important player in that space as a customer for us, that him walking away from a formulation, which was butyllithium-containing, has been creating a hole in this market. But the rest of the market growing fast, it has allowed to, little by little, compensate for that. Maybe, Ed, you want to give more color? Edward T. Flynn: Not much to add. It was just that the market that's affected is Europe, and we haven't seen any impact in Asia or in the U.S. And there are some rumors that there will be better butyllithium demand in Europe down the road from other products. Pierre R. Brondeau: So I think the weakness we see in numbers, for me, the way we look at them are more specific-case related than they are an across-the-board weakness. For us, it's been a pretty healthy business. Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : All right. And as I look at the Alkali business, it sounds like the pricing in Asia is improving, and you mentioned some higher costs that you encountered during the first quarter. So as we look into Q2 for margin there, should we expect a pretty meaningful step up there or are there other costs that we should keep in the consideration? You mentioned the coal contract as well, so a lot of moving pieces. Pierre R. Brondeau: I think there is a lot of -- lots of moving pieces for us in Alkali. Through the year, the trend is up in term of margin. I'm not going to say today it is dramatically up. I mean, it's -- in our forecast, we were looking at a stronger margin in Q2 than we would look in Q1. The positive for us, the 2 big positives are the volume and a better utilization of our assets, the plants are operating extremely well. I must say we had 4 tremendous months so far, including April, and pricing is going up. On the negative, we have coal, which is still a challenging situation for us. Now realize that when we forecast, and we're going to stick with that for a while until we have better clarity, we are not forecasting major changes in pricing. Today, the price, overall, for us in the first quarter year-on-year were up in the mid-single digits, around 5%, mostly driven by price in Asia. When we go forward into the rest of the year, we are forecasting not as much as a year-on-year increase because we are not speculating on any inflection points on Asia prices. So right now, despite the fact that we have a mid-single-digit price increase and double-digits year-on-year price increase in Asia, we are still forecasting pricing, overall, to be in the low-single digits for the year because we are not speculating on pricing until we understand better where the markets are going. The trend is positive. We've been burned before, so we're careful. So to answer your question, slightly up on volume and pricing, with adverse effect of coal price. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investment. Peter Butler : Pierre, considering all your contract obligations, et cetera, is there a rule of thumb on what would be the P&L impact on FMC if soda ash prices rose 10% in a year? Pierre R. Brondeau: If soda ash, on average, goes up 10%, overall. I mean, think about -- we are selling about 4 million tons -- call it, 4 million ton of soda ash in the world. The 10%, on average price would be something in between $10 and $15 per ton, so you're talking about a number around $60 million of EBIT impact, if I did the calculation right. So that's the kind of number we're talking about. That is the range. Peter Butler : If you have the opportunity to declare victory on your 2015 goals, when would you take the victory lap and perhaps set some goals for 2020? Pierre R. Brondeau: Actually, that gave me a good opportunity to tell you how we're going to be doing that. What we are planning to do is we are working today the Vision 2020. And we're going to have a series of session with our board. That will end by October or November to have a Vision 2020 for FMC Minerals and a Vision 2020 for FMC, the New FMC. What we will do is we will hold a Vision 2015 -- a Vision 2020 Investor Day in December. The way we look at it is we will first see where we are, because when you are at the end of 2014, you should be able to say if you will reach your 2015 goal. And we'll be in 2015, so we'll start the day by looking at FMC as it is today versus 2015, and if we should take a victory lap. And then we will present Vision 2020 for FMC Minerals and Vision 2020 for New FMC. Now I can't tell you versus Vision 2015 highly, highly confident that we will beat 2015 in ag. Very strong confidence around Health and Nutrition. Looking at the evolution of Lithium, I believe we will be able to declare victory. The only place where we have a question is on parts of the Alkali business, soda ash. We know, first, in Vision 2015 everything we wanted to do around plants, capacity, we will; around domestic market, we are online. The only question mark is Asia pricing and export pricing. So where we are today around Vision 2015, I think we're going to hit the mark everywhere, except in half of the sales of soda ash, which today we just don't know. I mean, it's still 1.75 years away. We are seeing positive trends but we don't have the answer. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli and Company. Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.: Pierre, on the Lithium, you said that you are processing about half of your production into downstream products. Those are higher-margin products, if I am not mistaken. Is it at all possible for you to move more than half of your production into downstream? Pierre R. Brondeau: No. It is difficult, Rosemarie, because, let's face it, our high-margin product -- and butyllithium is one of the products which is complex to do, too complex to move around, for which you do have higher pricing and higher margin. But there is a single-digit growth for this market. The growth is mostly coming from primaries : carbonate and hydroxide. So if you look over time, the business will continue to grow. We do expect to see a low-double-digit growth rate, but it will happen mostly because of growth in the primaries, which tend to have lower margin than a product like butyllithium. Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.: Okay. And I was wondering, as you are moving more into crops like corn and soybean, are you -- you are now going to go against a bigger player. So are you anticipating more volatility? Are you anticipating more pricing pressure? Or are your offerings totally different from what they are offering? Pierre R. Brondeau: Yes. I think the way we are evolving, I think, in this -- I don't want to sound arrogant, but I think we're looking at ourself as a big player now. And we believe we have the technology capabilities to compete with anybody on the chemicals front. So we do have unique offering, which differentiate ourselves. It doesn't mean that a company like a Monsanto or Syngenta, which clearly have a broader spectrum of product, we're going to go head-to-head against them with respect of their business. But we believe we have a technology portfolio which is such that we can make very interesting offering to our customers in highly technical places where we'll protect our margin. Don't confuse what I say with us deciding to grow very broadly into soy and corn with competitive products, lowering our margin. We're going to stay very technical, very specific. But yes, we believe we have the size today and the reach, which allows us to compete in most markets. Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.: That is very helpful. If I may ask one last question. Looking at the complexity of the separation, could you give us some idea as to the elements which are making it take so long to achieve? Pierre R. Brondeau: Our timing, and I'll ask Paul to jump in. But our timing for separation, if you look at any of the other companies which have done separation in the past or which have -- which are in the process of separating, the timing, we are still targeting the end of the first quarter. So it's about 1 year from the vote of the board to the actual separation is about standard. There is lots of complexity. Think about the number of legal entities a company will have which will have to be changed. Think about system like IT and being able to replicate that. So we are very much in the norm. Paul, do you want to add? Paul W. Graves: Yes. No, look, I think there's nothing particularly unusual about what we're going through. It's logistical [ph] legal tax and regulatory transfers and approvals that take by far the most time. They just take time going through various authorities to get the sign-offs that you need. We obviously have to perform separation of some functions, whether that's the finance functions, computer systems, et cetera, which also take some time. And we also have to have one eye on the complexity around SEC reporting around 2 different entities and how that might factor in. So cutting through all of that complexity, it's sort of a 12-month process. No matter which way you cut it, driven largely by factors outside our control. Pierre R. Brondeau: I think what we really want to do is, I mean, of course, when you do a separation, you want to happen -- that to happen as quickly as possible. But we are building 2 great companies for the long run. It would not be appropriate for us to take any risks to shorten this process by a couple of months that would not make a difference in the long run. And we do not want to take any risk. We want to have a flawless process in 2 companies ready to go from day 1. So the timing is appropriate. We believe we are on track, but we will not rush the process. The other thing we are doing is isolating our business organization from this process. We need to make sure they keep on focusing on technology and customers and running their plants. So it's also something we have to take into account during the process. Alisha Bellezza : I want to thank everyone for joining us today. That's all the time we have for the call. I'm available for additional questions that you may have. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the FMC Corp. First Quarter 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call.

Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call for FMC Corporation. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Alisha Bellezza, Director of Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Ms. Bellezza, you may begin. Alisha Bellezza : Thank you, Moses. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FMC Corporation's second quarter earnings call. With me today are : Pierre Brondeau, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, who will review our quarter performance, business segment results and provide an update on our 2014 outlook; and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will present select financial results. Pierre will conclude the call with an update on our separation activities and on our Vision 2015 goal. Following his comments, we will be joined by Mark Douglas, President, FMC Agricultural Solutions; Ed Flynn, President, FMC Minerals; and Mike Smith, Vice President and Global Business Director, FMC Health and Nutrition, to address your question. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including, but not limited to, those factors identified in our release and in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary, based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms, as well as other non-GAAP financial terms that we may refer to during today's conference call are provided on our website. Our 2014 outlook statement, which provides guidance for the full year and the third quarter of 2014 can also be found on our website. I will now turn the call over to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau: Thank you, Alisha, and good morning, everyone. In our release, you saw that we generated $988 million in revenue, an increase of 13% over the second quarter of last year. Adjusted operating profit increased to $203 million, a 10% increase compared to last year, and we delivered $1.01 in adjusted EPS, an increase of 9% over last year. The Health and Nutrition and Minerals segments performed largely as expected. Results were strongly ahead of the second quarter last year. As you already know, compared to the original expectation, the effects of poor weather conditions negatively impacted our Agricultural Solutions segment in the first half of the year. Dry conditions in part of Brazil reduced sales to the sugarcane segment, and prolonged cold in North America led to different patterns of crop protection use. Despite this, the business delivered above-industry growth, with segment earnings and revenues higher than the second quarter of 2013. Second quarter sales in Agricultural Solutions were $531 million, a 20% increase over the second quarter of 2013. Segment earnings were $131 million, up 5% over last year. Segment margin was impacted by changes in product mix, unfavorable foreign exchange and a planned increase in business spending. We chose to continue to increase our sales and technology investment, despite these temporary pressures on our earnings growth. Within Agricultural Solutions, all regions show year-on-year growth in revenue. In North America, the unusually cold and prolonged winter led to later than usual plantings. This was followed by a very strong early growing period, with lower than normal pest pressures, which is leading to forecast a very strong yield in both corn and soybean. All of these factors combined have created unusual market condition and some challenges for the crop protection industry. For example, the delayed planting of corn this spring led to later and faster planting cycle, with farmers choosing to use fewer applications of our plant insecticide, including our Capture LFR product. Initial market indications suggest that the broader market for this product was down low to mid-teens percent, compared to last year's planting season. Despite this, we were able to increase both our market share and our average realized prices of Capture LFR. Countering these challenges were some better-than-expected opportunities. Higher planted soybean acres resulted increased sales of preemergent herbicides, an important segment for us, with our Authority brands. Early market data is showing that sales growth of our products in this segment outpaced market growth, which itself was significant. We believe the share gains in some of our most important segments demonstrate the strength of our North American portfolio, particularly in high technology areas, such as corn rootworm resistance and in the growing area of treating glyphosate-resistant feeds. In Europe, favorable growing condition increased demand for herbicide used in spring crops, while increased demand for fungicide in China, and various products in Pakistan, Korea and Australia, also drove additional sales versus the same quarter last year. In Latin America, sales increased in all countries as we began to see additional benefits of expanded market access in the region. However, the poor conditions faced by Brazilian sugarcane growers continued to significantly reduce herbicide and insecticide demand from this segment. Offsetting this, we saw stronger than expected sales of some secondary products, including third-party products. This mix shift had a negative impact on margin in Latin America this quarter. Our sales efforts remain focused on maintaining a premium on the high-value technology and services that we provide to our customers. We are launching some important new product in the second half of 2014, such as our Rugby nematicide for soybeans. This product already has strong brand awareness among soybean growers in Brazil, given its historical application pattern, and we are seeing a favorable market reception for this new product application. We also expect to take advantage of a strong market position in Brazilian cotton, with our launch of Gamit Star [ph] insecticide into the segment this year. This product is a novel broad spectrum insecticide that controls the boll weevil, a pest that's increasingly impacting yield and quality in the cotton crop. Additionally, we are expanding our market access in many of the Latin American countries and expect significant growth to take place outside of Brazil. For example, we are seeing a sharp increase in demand for preemergent soybean herbicide in Argentina, a market that is experiencing increasing pressure from glyphosate-resistant weeds. We have been able to use our formulation science and experience in addressing this issue in North America to quickly register and bring our technology to growers in Latin America. As we look toward the second half, we expect that Latin America will once again drive most of the year-over-year growth. In the third quarter, we expect that our focus on higher-margin differentiated products will increase segment earnings by low to mid-teens percent over 2013. For the full year, we expect revenues to grow mid to high single-digits percent, while earnings are expected to increase mid single-digit percent, compared to 2013. Our segment operating margin expectations remain between 24% and 26% for the full year. Now turning to Health and Nutrition. Segment revenues of $207 million increased 9%, and operating profit of $49 million was up 11% over last year. In the quarter, we saw increased demand for pharmacy cold tablet excipients in Asia. Most of this growth to date has been with a multinational pharmaceutical customers who produce generic prescription products for sale in North America and Europe. We also saw increased demand for alginate used in pharmaceutical applications. We continue to see relatively stable demand patterns in the health markets that we serve. Our omega-3 product line also contributed to sales growth in the quarter. Most of the omega-3 sales in this quarter were sold into high concentration nutraceutical markets. These markets have experienced steady demand in 2014, and we expect to launch a number of new products in the second half to target this market segment. Pharmaceutical application will also remain a focus of our new product development efforts in omega-3. Our nutrition markets experienced mixed result in the second quarter compared to last year. In North America, we saw higher demand for fixture and stability solutions used in beverages. Offsetting this, demand for similar beverage product across Asia has slowed, showing little year-over-year growth. Although we believe these are temporary slowdown, we are watching this change carefully. Additionally, we have launched a healthy project pipeline that we believe will continue to generate stable growth across global nutrition markets. Looking forward, we expect third quarter segment earnings in Health and Nutrition to increase in the mid to high single-digit percent over the previous year. For the full year, we continue to expect segment revenue to increase low to mid-teens percent, with earnings increasing mid-teens percent over last year. Now let me review Minerals. Both businesses performed in line with our expectations, with higher pricing in Alkali and improved operations in both Alkali and Lithium, resulting in stronger profitability. In the quarter, revenue of $215 million increased 2%, and operating profits of $43 million increased 21% versus the same period last year. In Alkali Chemicals, revenue of $193 million was flat to the previous year quarter. Higher realized pricing was offset by the impact of the timing of shipments and lower freight due to different geographic mix. During the quarter, earnings improved over the previous year, as improved planned performance, manufacturing efficiencies and higher average pricing offset higher energy costs. In Lithium, sales of $57 million were up 11% than the previous year. Improved operations produced additional volumes and allowed for higher sales and profitability in the quarter. The environment in Argentina was relatively benign, with inflation and exchange rates largely in line with our expectations. For the third quarter, we expect segment earnings to increase by about 30% over the same period in 2013. Improved profitability will be delivered through higher soda ash pricing and increased volumes in both Alkali and Lithium. For the full year, we have assumed stable pricing for the remainder of the year in both businesses. We continue to expect segment revenue to increase in the mid to high single-digit percent, with segment earnings up high-teens over 2013. Turning now to our outlook. For the third quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $0.90 to $1 per diluted share, a 16% increase versus the third quarter of 2013, at the midpoint of the range. In Ag, we expect segment earnings to be at mid-teens percent over third quarter 2013. We are anticipating a solid start to the southern hemisphere season, with market access initiatives and new product launches providing opportunities for continued strong growth. In Health and Nutrition, we expect segment earnings to increase mid to high single-digit percent over 2013, driven by increased demand in all major end markets. In Minerals, continued operational excellence is expected to provide additional volume in both businesses. This performance is expected to deliver about 30% earnings growth year-on-year. For the full year, our expectation of adjusted earnings continue to be between $4.10 and $4.30 per diluted share, an 8% increase over 2013, at the midpoint of the range. In Agricultural Solutions, we expect full year revenue to increase mid to high single-digit percent, and segment earnings to increase mid single-digits percent over 2013. Second half growth will be driven primarily by new product introductions, expanded market access positions and market share gain in Latin America. We are confident that our focus on new technologies and high-value segments will demonstrate the stability and sustainability of our margin profile. In Health and Nutrition, we anticipate full year revenue and segment earnings growth in the mid-teens percent over 2013. We are pleased with how our portfolio is performing in markets that continue to exhibit solid underlying growth. In Minerals, operational excellence programs will result in record annual volumes in 2014 for both Alkali Chemicals and Lithium. We continue to see stable to positive pricing trends in soda ash and strong market demand in Lithium. As a result, we reaffirm our expectation of revenues growth in the mid to high single-digit percent and segment earnings improvements in the high-teens percent over 2013. I will now turn the call over to Paul to cover financial highlights. Paul W. Graves: Thanks, Pierre. Today, I'll focus on a few notable items in the quarter, including foreign exchange impacts and cash generation. I'll also update you on our capital deployment plans for the rest of the year. Movements in the Brazilian real and multiple Asian currencies adversely impacted adjusted earnings on a year-over-year basis. In addition, the greater volatility within currencies has led to higher hedging costs versus last year. Our consolidated businesses, these unfavorable currency movements and related costs reduced adjusted EPS compared to last year by approximately $0.05 in the quarter and $0.10 in the first half. For the first half of 2014, cash provided by operating activities was $149 million versus $248 million in the prior year. Much of the lower cash generator was due to lower EBIT from Ag Solutions in the first quarter and higher receivables balances, again, due to our Agricultural Solutions. As we previously highlighted, later timing of sales in North America and a changing crop mix, especially in Brazil, is resulting in a different receivables collection pattern than prior years. So as a result, we expect a greater waiting of cash flow generation to the second half of the year compared to last year. We remain focused on increasing our operating cash flow, and we continue to roll out working capital improvement projects across the businesses. We believe we're on track to generate approximately $400 million of cash from operations, before separation costs. Capital additions in the quarter were approximately $46 million. Spending continues to be primarily associated with construction of the Thailand MCC facility, which is progressing well and remains on track to begin commercial sales in early 2015. We've also focused capital resources on the construction of a new gas pipeline in Argentina. This pipeline will provide a more economical and safer transport of natural gas, up the mountain to our processing facility. We anticipate completion by the end of the year, with benefits increasing our earnings starting in 2015. Finally, while Pierre will provide more details on the separation, let me note that, in the quarter, we incurred approximately $14 million in separation costs. And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau: Let me now update you on the status of the separation. We have completed the initial organizational design for both companies and are working on project planning and legal entity's credit [ph]. Regarding the costs to complete the separation, we expect approximately $100 million to $130 million of onetime costs. These costs are in line with costs seen in another companies undergoing similar separation processes. Once the separation is complete, we expect additional ongoing corporate expenses to total approximately $25 million across the 2 entities. These are mainly associated with supporting an additional publicly traded company. I will now update you on progress towards meeting the goals of our Vision 2015 plan. As you recall, the Vision 2015 strategic plan set a number of goals that reflected our objective of delivering to shareholder returns that we believe reflected the quality of the FMC portfolio. Also a combination of lost -- by the middle of 2014, we can demonstrate tremendous progress against these goals. We have met or exceeded our original targets for return on capital and capital return to shareholders. We remain on track to achieve our organic revenue targets. Our target for EBIT and EPS offer the greatest challenge to this. Despite our Ag business significantly outperforming against the plan and our core Health and Nutrition segment performing in line with the targets set forth, there is currently a gap to our 2015 EBIT target. The reason for this can be explained by a few factors that are largely outside of our control. First, related to Minerals. Soda ash pricing is not as high as we had forecasted, and the Argentinian peso to U.S. dollar exchange rates is not in line with where our fundamental projection should be. These 2 factors alone account for a large portion of the GAAP to our targets. Also a combination of lost EBIT contribution from businesses that we have sold or closed, which were part of the portfolio when we first drafted the Vision 2015 plan and lower contribution that we had targeted from acquisitions, explain another portion of the differential. Given that this year have seen some business patterns that are different from recent years, there is less predictability that we have seen during the plan so far. At this point in the year, it is certainly true that forecasting is more challenging in this environment. Agricultural markets are coming off a year of abnormally low growth, but signs continue to suggest acreage expansion in crops where we have strong portfolios. We have seen good traction in soda ash price increase. That could continue to strengthen. Our new businesses, Asipacs [ph] and Karros [ph], are demonstrating additional growth opportunities. In this changing environment, we'll refine, in the coming month, our 2015 expectation. As a result, we believe that Vision 2015 have highlighted the strength and quality of our asset portfolio and will continue to deliver premium shareholder returns. To conclude, like others in the ag space, we are airing concern about the slowdown in agricultural market. The industry is facing uncertainty, and we're monitoring the situation closely and are in constant dialogue with our customers. We are also closely watching order patterns and inventory levels. Like many other industry participants, we believe there is greater uncertainty than in previous years, but we still see a strong second half of the year, driven by the strength of our Brazil business and the expansion of our presence throughout Latin America. As we look ahead for the next few seasons, we are keeping a close eye on our market but we remain very confident that our technology pipeline will deliver strong long-term sales growth, while maintaining our industry-leading margins. Health and Nutrition has also a strong pipeline of new products that will drive continued growth through broader product offerings and organizational leverage. In Minerals, we believe that our constant focus on operational excellence will result in record volume for both Alkali and Lithium. This increased volume, combined with price improvement for soda ash, position us for solid earnings improvement in 2014, with continued momentum in the next few years. We remain focused on strengthening our portfolio and executing on the evolution of FMC. We also look forward to sharing with you our vision for the future of our companies at our Investor Day. Now I will turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Okay. We do have a -- your first question comes from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : So when I look at the guidance for the back half of the year, and in particular, look at the weighting at how it kind of sequences, the fourth quarter, obviously, is going to be having to carry a lot more weight than it normally does. And I guess, I'm wondering, how much of that kind of back end-loaded guidance is really tied to stuff that you have complete control over versus the markets moving in maybe a direction you anticipate or hope, but you don't necessarily control. Pierre R. Brondeau: Yes, I would say that, today, and I would ask Mark to give more color to it, with a specific product discussion. I would say that a large part of the forecast we are making for the quarter depends upon things we are controlling. So we are looking at a normal fourth quarter from a weather standpoint. And most of the growth is coming -- and I could pretty much put 3 buckets into the growth. First, the first bucket would be mix. Our forecast is, today, with products which are much more differentiated, less third-party project than we did last year. So we have a much stronger mix in the fourth quarter. The other bucket would be, as we have proven, we've been able to grow our market share in soybean. And this soybean market share is forecasted to -- market share gains forecasted to continue for us. Together with a significant, as mentioned in the script, significant new product launch that we are seeing -- are getting very good reception right now in Latin America and in Brazil. And the third bucket will be we are very much seeing the benefit from our newly structured market access, for example, in Argentina. There is also one element, which we do not control, but we're just expecting no major change. If you remember, last year, we got very negatively impacted in the fourth quarter in our ag business by FX. We are not planning any major swing in the fourth quarter of this year around FX, which would create a significant year-on-year benefit. Mark, if you want to add anything around the specificity? Mark A. Douglas: Yes, Pierre, I think, the -- and John, I know you know the market pretty well down there. I think, the piece I would add is the focus we've had in not only Brazil in terms of expanding market access through co-ops in distribution where, traditionally, we've had a lower share. We've put commercial people down on the ground, especially in the South of Brazil, where we're starting to see traction now with the products that we sell to a lot of the mega growers going through distribution. That really wasn't in place last year at this time, so there's a push there that you'll see. I would also that add that the market access outside of Brazil is paying off. Pierre just mentioned Argentina. I think, you know that we had a very good season in North America with our pre-emergent herbicides for glyphosate resistance. We're seeing exactly the same sort of acceleration in Argentina. We have the same brand name, the Authority brand. A lot of the technology used in North America is now being used in Argentina, so that's an accelerated market that we have, which should give confidence that we continue to grow in the soy area. And then, a lot of the smaller countries in Latin America that are extremely high value with specialty crops. We now have new market access in Ecuador, where we didn't have it this time last year, and we've expanded our presence in Chile and Peru. So all in all, when I look at Latin America, there are a number of things that are in our control and we feel very confident about putting those new technologies into the marketplace. John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Great. And then, just as the follow-up question. With regard to the pipeline that you're putting through, it sounds like, in your Lithium platform, can you walk us through how that changed the profitability and how we should be thinking about the margin progression, from ex pipeline to with pipeline? Pierre R. Brondeau: Yes, first. We are expecting the pipeline to be in place toward the back end of the year, the back end of the fourth quarter. So we will see a yield impact this year. I would qualify the benefit in EBIT about the mid single-digit million dollar benefit over a year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I was wondering if you could speak to your contribution margins in the Ag business. It looks like you did have a nice sales growth of $89 million on a year-over-year basis, but about $6 million on the profit side, so maybe 7% incremental margin there. You mentioned FX. Perhaps, you can kind of walk us through some of the math there? Pierre R. Brondeau: Yes. Same thing. I'll give you a view. And then, I'll get Mark to get into the specific. Let's put, first, the 2 things which are very concrete. First, FX went against us in the business in the second quarter. And the second aspect is the fact that we decided not to slow down, we have faith in this business, in our product development access, so we have decided to continue to invest in technology and selling. So we had a negative FX impact and increased investments into the business. But really, the main story is a mix story. First of all, as you know, we do have a very strong position in sugarcane in Brazil. Those are very differentiated product, high-margin products. And with the drought, we saw much less of these products than we were expecting. Second of all, in North America, as I just told in the script before, it was very different pattern from what we were expecting from the mix of product and the mix of pre-emergent versus post-emergent product. This also, within those high-margin products, there is some product with much higher margin than others, even all of those are differentiated. It went against us. So even in our high-margin products, we saw a lower sales of the very differentiated high-margin product. Now there is also a phenomenon which happened, and I unfortunately have to admit against what we would have liked. As you know, we have very sales-driven organization. And when they recognized that we were losing ground on the EBIT, they very aggressively went at selling products, where customers, because of our strong relationship, all things would be equal, would be willing buying from us rather than competition. But those quick sales are mostly of low differentiation or third-party product, which do not carry at all the same margins as our regular products. So we had a very strong push in Latin America, to some extent in North America, of products. I would not or we would not have pushed that hard to get those products in the market if we would have a full understanding of what was going on. So it was a way from -- we have a very strong, very sales-driven organization, and they were committed to an EBIT and they went for it. Maybe the way we were hit was with the mix, which would not be the one we would have chosen. So when you put those together, it created a very strong top line growth. There is places where we gain market share. We talked about it. I think, Authority is one of the brands where we have strong market share, so there is some very good reasons for the top line growth. But the big story behind -- beyond FX and investment in the business is a big mix shift, which we will control much better in the next couple of quarters. Mark, do you want to add something? Mark A. Douglas: Yes. The only thing I would add, Kevin, is -- well, Pierre just touched on the business spending. I think, it's important to recognize that, that business spending is primarily based around research. I think, a lot of people know that we're investing in research for the new active ingredients that we're bringing through that will come through to the end of the decade. It's important to recognize that once we start that work and we get into the chronic talks work and we get into the regulatory side, we can't slow that down. So that's been the major investment when it comes to the business spend side. Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : It's really helpful color from both of you. As a second follow-up question maybe for Paul. Your DSO declined about 11 days sequentially. Can you update us on some of the initiatives on trade working capital. How much lower do you think you can take that metric? And what would be an appropriate equilibrium target for you? Paul W. Graves: Sure. Clearly, the business is really driven by, under the working capital targets, really driven by ag. And some of the moving pieces that we have going on Ag at the moment, we touched upon the North American sales patterns being a little different. The sales being made later in the quarter changes the year end receivables balances that we would normally have. And in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, we sell on crop terms, and so when you get a different mix of crop terms, and particularly when you move from the very short payment periods of sugarcane to the much longer payment periods of soybean and cotton, you start to get a very different pattern emerging. And what I would say is we look at a few key metrics, as well as DSO. We do look at industry terms and to make sure that we are not selling on any different terms to the rest of the industry. And we also look at collection rates and past due and default rates. And all of those things are back in line with where they've always been historically. So we're not seeing any major shifts. I think, to Pierre's point around some of the mix challenges that we had in the second quarter, I think, what we believe is that there is an opportunity around the DSO to be somewhat more differentiated about the terms we offer for different products that we're selling to our customers. We also think there are opportunities in some of our other businesses. In Health and Nutrition, we have some opportunities, for sure, around inventory levels in that business and we have some aggressive programs in place. So you put all those pieces together, we're still working through all this. As you can imagine, particularly in ag, moving the needle in working capital, when you have very long-dated terms and you're kind of cross growing seasons in different regions, you don't move things quickly, but we're pretty comfortable with the progress we're making so far. We recognize we need to start showing that in the cash flow numbers, but we're pretty confident that we're on the right track. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : A couple of questions. If you -- I'm just trying to understand your outlook statement for, particularly in the ag business versus where you thought it would be 3 months ago. It looks like, at least revenues in the second quarter, you did a little bit better, but if you sort of can contrast and compare your view about the ag market in the second half of the year now, versus what it was 3 months ago? Pierre R. Brondeau: I don't think that we have a major change in the view, Dmitry, while looking at the market. I think, the first quarter, we -- the year, the year is very much tainted by the first and second quarter. First quarter, sales were down 6%, EBIT was down 26%. In the second quarter sales were up 20%, and EBIT was only up 5%. So when you have such a start of the year, when you get a penalty and it's all weather-driven, and I would tend to admit, at the end of the first quarter, we misread the impacts of the weather on the second quarter. We thought we had a good handle on it and it was much more -- I mean, a couple of the other [ph] companies fell into the same trap as we did. So we had a changing view of the second quarter as we were going through the second quarter. But now, getting into the second quarter and -- sorry, the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we have kept pretty much the same view. The fourth quarter, we are believing will be very strong from a mix standpoint. We are looking at top line growth but very strong from a mix and point, where we are targeting sales and where we are forecasting sales with these good product. And the third quarter also we're showing improvements. So mid single-digit growth rate for the third quarter and high-teens for the fourth quarter, all driven by Latin America with a very strong mix, related to the kind of numbers we are showing. But we are forecasting just a normal back end of the year, nothing special around acreage or nothing particularly changed, or nothing special around the weather. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Got it. Okay. Switching gears to the Minerals part of the business. Can you talk about the sort of the pricing trends in the ANSAC business in Latin America and Asia. And also, there's been, as I'm sure you're aware, a couple of announcements of capacity expansions in soda ash or at least plants in Wyoming area from your competitors. So I was wondering how sort of how you look at the market now, with after several years of no capacity additions of any size, just de-bottlenecking. You actually do have some CapEx project starting up. And how does that impact your decision on bringing the rest of Granger online, in terms of timing on cost or whatever you can share with us? Pierre R. Brondeau: Sure. So pricing, we had pricing stability in the low single-digit percent in domestic in North America. And pricing, I would say, stability in Latin America and good pricing traction, with double-digit percent increase in Asia. Now we didn't get the full benefit of this double-digit pricing increase in Asia, because the mix was a bit unfavorable. Pricing in Asia remains still lower than Latin America. And true, in fact, we had more sales in Asia than we had in Latin America. So the mix was not as good. But certainly, we've seen some firming of the pricing in Asia. Now still, for next another couple of quarters, until we understand better, we're not going to keep on forecasting a continuation of this price, but the quarter was robust at -- and stable. And Asia is the place where we saw the highest increase. We believe, the pricing situation, if we look at the next couple of years, is firming up in Asia because there is no major capital spending which are forecasted in Asia. And we start to see the demand and supply balance getting better. The capital spending, I think, you're mentioning about other announcements from my colleagues at Solvay. I suppose, that's the one you mentioned, which we see more as a de-bottlenecking than truly a capacity increase. As you know, when you produce de-bottleneck plants in Wyoming, with natural soda ash, you are at a very low pricing. So usually, it's not a very big issue to place those volumes. And the amounts are not such that they are changing the supply-demand pattern. Ed, you want to add something? Edward T. Flynn: Yes. I would add, if you recall, Solvay also had announced that they shut down operations in Portugal, and that is actually more of a decrease than the roughly 150,000 tons they're going to bring on in Green River. In terms of that additional capacity, as it relates to the overall market, it's about 0.5% of global market demand, so we don't think it will have much of an impact. And there has been, in the last year or so, about 1.5 million tons of shutdowns that actually have occurred across the globe. So net-net, supply has actually been decreasing of capacity, that has currently been on line. And I think, the second part of your question Dmitry, was related to Granger, and we have experienced great success in the Manufacturing Excellence arena. And so while we've done pre-engineering work for the Granger facility, I can't go to Pierre and ask to make an investment until I can assure him that I've really been able to get everything I can out of the assets that I currently have in place. Pierre R. Brondeau: Thanks, Ed. So in summary, we are, I would say, very cautiously optimistic around pricing, with stability in Latin America and North America, and strengthening in Asia. As Ed said, we are focusing capacity expansion through de-bottlenecking and we are seeing our Manufacturing Excellence is still giving us opportunities. I didn't share, I don't think I would be comfortable making the decision around a very large investment at this stage of the corporation. We are still looking at a separation. And I think it's a decision which will be better made by the business when acting as a standalone business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Pierre, that almost begs the question as to who will Ed be asking about that capital allocation project, or when might we find out when the CEO comes. And actually, more broadly, regarding this $130 million -- I'm sorry, $100 million to $130 million spending target for the cost of the separation, which you indicated was in line with other sort of separations out there. How should we think about the timing of that? Very little has been spent -- well, not very little, 15% has been spent so far. But how should we think about the timing of that? And what are the big buckets that accounts for that $100 million to $130 million? Pierre R. Brondeau: Certainly. So about who will be making the decision, we are still in interview process and interviewing candidates, and I would like to say that I have been meeting with very high-quality candidates today. So have a -- we are down to a handful of high-quality candidates today. And as soon as we've crossed the bridge of deciding who it is, you will be -- you guys will be the first to know. We'll put an announcement out. From the timing, I think, we still believe, it's a very complex process. The timing for a separation is always hard to predict, but we have no reason to believe that we will not stay within the timeframe we've announced, which was the first half of 2015. The spending for a separation, I would say, if you think about in between now and the separation, I would say the bulk of the spending will be happening in the next 6 months. That's really where we will have a large part of the spending. Spendings, if I look at the big bucket, I'm going to ask Paul to help me, but certainly, IT is definitely one of the big buckets we do have today. Tax is another parts of the -- those are the big hitters across the corporation. Paul W. Graves: And they're the 2 big ones, and there's obviously the external consultant costs, which is all around managing the project, and legal costs, consultant costs, bankers' fees. All the wonderful third parties that are willing to come and help us do this, they don't do it for free unfortunately. They're the big bucket. Pierre R. Brondeau: Yes. So external help, we would call that IT and taxes would represent maybe 80% of your costs. Paul W. Graves: In that range, yes. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : All right. Great. And that's over the next 6 months. And one of the things that you mentioned with respect to Vision 2015, and coming short was on the M&A side. I guess, it's been about a year since you did the Epax transaction. Can you update us on how that's going in the integration and the accretion that you're seeing there? Pierre R. Brondeau: Yes. The integration is going well. The plant is operating, where they even have customers. I think, the -- so we are very pleased with where we are. It's accretive this year. The key question for us, and when I talk about Vision '15 and ramp up is, there is a base business, which we got with Epax, but there is all of the creation of this new business with the new manufacturing process and the new plant for the high-concentration, high-purity, either for pharmaceutical or for the high-concentration nutraceutical. That is really for us what will differentiate a decent acquisition from a great acquisition. So really, if I want to think about, today, very pleased, nothing wrong with we've done, good results. I'm feeling quite good with our new product line, but what will make it a great acquisition is how much progress we're going to make with the new Seal Sands plant and the high-concentration hydrology product. That's to be seen in the next, I would say, 12 months. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. George D'Angelo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : This is George D'Angelo sitting in for Lawrence this morning. Can you give some color on the comments around glyphosate resistance. What regions are you guys seeing the most interest in those types of products? Mark A. Douglas: Yes, George, this is Mark. First and foremost, North America is the market where we're seeing the most spread of glyphosate resistance, not only in terms of acreage but in terms of types of weeds. So that's a market where our sort of venture is on base products, the Authority brands are taking share and doing very well. Secondary to that, we're seeing the resistance in Argentina, as I talked about earlier. That's another large soy market and a market that we're focused on. Also outside of glyphosate, we do see resistance, insect resistance in Brazil growing, so we'll have opportunities there with our range of insecticides. Overall, it's been an important market for us. It will continue to be as we go into the next few seasons. Resistance is continuing to grow, not only in North America, but down in Latin America as well. And not only in Brazil, but Argentina, so an important market. George D'Angelo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. And any update on the JV with Chr. Hansen. What kind of products that might be yielding? Mark A. Douglas: Yes, thanks for asking about that. The biologicals platform for us is, as you know, something we're focusing heavily on. I have to say that we put the alliance in place back in October. We have, right now, 5 new products that are in field testing in North America. A suite of products is expected to go into Latin America for field testing, as we hit their season in the second half of this year. The collaboration is working very, very well. As you know, we also put into that a company we bought, which is a research-based company for screening and identifying of microbial agents for use in biologicals. They're doing a tremendous job. And we have a very strong pipeline of opportunities both in fungicides and in plant growth regulators. So we're very hopeful that, that project will come to fruition. We expect the first products to be out in the marketplace in 2015, predominantly in North America. But I have to say, as an alliance, given the short space of time we've been working with them, we are very impressed with Chr. Hansen, in terms of their ability to scale up the products we're feeding into that alliance, so it's going well. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison from First Analysis. Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : If I'm looking at the ag business, you commented that you're going to keep an eye on customer inventory levels. Is there any concern that some of the aggressive selling tactics, that came about in Q2, led to some inventory build and maybe you pulled some of your top line from Q3 back into Q2? Mark A. Douglas: Mike, it's Mark. No. What Pierre was referring to in terms of the aggressiveness of the sales group was predominantly down in Latin America. And as you know, Q2 is a pretty quiet period in Latin America, rolling off one season and starting to get ready to gear up for the second season in Q3 and Q4. There may well be pockets of increased inventory throughout that enormous market down there. But fundamentally, it's not going to slow down the growth for FMC, with our active ingredients and our proprietary products. I would say, North America, given the conditions that we saw with weather, it would not surprise me that in some segments, that as the numbers come in, that we see elevated levels of channel inventory. I'm particularly thinking of the corn market. That was particularly affected in terms of insecticides. We may well see elevated levels there. However to offset that, we did extremely well with pre-emergent products, and I would expect, when the numbers come in, that those inventory levels are extremely low. Pierre R. Brondeau: So I mean, just to support what Mark said, the aggressiveness in terms of selling, those were not on product we are focusing on in Q3 and Q4. Those are products we sold. I believe, we gained market share. But it's market share gained on low margin product based on relationship with customers and certainly not places which are critical to our sales projections for Q3 and Q4. Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : And then, Mark, maybe you can give a little bit more detail to help us understand the issues around the Brazil sugarcane market and maybe what the drought means to the long-term trajectory of growth in acreage there? Mark A. Douglas: Yes, sure. We talked about it a lot in the various calls over the last few quarters. The droughts had a significant impact on productivity, from the sugar mills themselves in terms of how much sugar is produced out of the actual acreage. But combined with that is the economic impact of what's been going on with ethanol and with sugar pricing in the world markets. That's also been a significant impact. We expect longer term. And certainly, as we go through the rest of this decade, as we think about the next phase of our growth, that sugarcane will continue to be a major growth area for us. This business has gone through these cycles in the past where you've seen significant consolidation on the back of weaker economics for the smaller players. That is also playing out as well. But for us, with our suite of herbicides and insecticides, new products coming to the marketplace, we continue to see it strong. Ethanol mandate will change in Brazil at some point. Prices will change. Sugar prices have been coming back over the last few months and continue to look more healthy. So we do expect the fundamentals to continue to look good. But in the short term, it's been a rough ride. Alisha Bellezza : Okay. Well, I think, with that, that's about all the time we have for the call today. I want to thank everyone for joining us. I am available for additional questions that you might have, and I hope you have a great day. Operator : Thank you.

Our 2014 outlook statement, which provides guidance for the full year and the fourth quarter of 2014, can also be found on our website. I will now turn the call over to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau: Thank you, Alisha, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, let me start by providing some comments on the market dynamics that are affecting our businesses today. Starting with Ag Solutions. 2014 has been an unusual year, with weather having a particular impact on our results. As you recall, the prolonged cold winter in North America impacted planting decisions and ultimately, sales at -- of our plant insecticides in the first half. Additionally, the first half of the year was characterized by dry conditions in Brazil. This also negatively impacted our sales to sugarcane growers. Unfortunately, Brazil is still experiencing drought conditions. Not only has the dry weather in S\u00e3o Paulo state reduced demand in sugarcane, we have also seen it in the Mato Grosso region. There, it has led some growers to delay soybean planting into October as they wait for more favorable weather. Europe has had a good season with favorable growing conditions for the major crops, such as wheat and oilseed rape, and good demand for certain crop protection product, especially fungicides. Asia is a more complex region with multiple markets and crops, each with its own dynamics. For example, India is currently experiencing drought conditions. And in Thailand, the removal of rice subsidies is affecting a major rice-growing region. China is itself a fragmented market, but it is expected to continue to increase the use of crop protection products in the near term. Overall, we expect Asia to continue to demonstrate growth for industry in the next few years. North America quickly shifted from extreme cold to very favorable growing conditions, with lower-than-normal pest pressures in the growing areas creating fewer opportunities for full year applications. Today, these favorable conditions are leading to potential record yields in both soybean and corn, creating downward pressure on commodity prices. We see some consequences of these lower prices in the near term. First, in Brazil, we expect more soybean acres to be planted, given the more attractive economics relative to other crops. Planted acreage in cotton is likely to be stable, given the government programs to reimburse growers for low prices. However, it is clear that growers are making their final planting decisions and the related crop-protection buying selections later than usual this year. In North America, the pattern of increased purchasing at the end of the year, which growers typically do in anticipation of their next season needs, may be more muted in the second half of 2014. As growers plan for the 2015 planting season, corn and cotton acreage are both likely to be reduced in favor of soybeans, although final planting decisions will likely be taken later than usual. In Health and Nutrition, our diverse business and its end markets are showing similar growth patterns as in previous years. The pharmaceutical end markets remain robust, with our Avicel product line continuing to maintain its leading position. Demand for our texturant products serving nutrition markets is also strong, with the exception of certain beverage applications in China. We have started to see the slowdown in overall economic growth in China impact consumer behavior, which when combined with tighter inventory management by certain customers, is leading to lower demand for some of our product. We expect demand in these applications to remain relatively weak for the remainder of 2014. However, we are seeing stronger demand for food ingredients in North America, which is providing a favorable product mix. In omega-3 markets, the number of FDA approvals for omega-3-based product reinforces our confidence in increased omega-3 pharmaceutical-grade demand in the coming years. The lithium market has been following a consistent growth trend in the recent years. Demand in industrial polymer and pharmaceutical end markets is growing steadily, while demand in energy applications is growing more quickly, led by increased electric vehicle penetration. For our business, Argentina remains the biggest challenge to operations. The challenges of operating in a high-inflationary environment are not new, but we are now starting to see the impact of import restrictions on their operations. For example, it was difficult to import certain critical engineering components into Argentina. This resulted in increased operational costs in the third quarter. Despite these challenges and market dynamics, FMC had a record third quarter in 2014. We generated $1 billion in revenue, an increase of 6% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted operating profit increased to $184 million, a 13% increase compared to last year. And adjusted EPS was $0.95, an increase of 16% over last year, despite volatile conditions in the quarter. Let me now turn to segment results. Third quarter sales in Agricultural Solutions were $549 million, a 4% increase over the third quarter of 2013. Segment earnings were $117 million, up 2% over last year. Within Agricultural Solutions, the year-over-year growth in revenue was driven by Latin American business. The 9% growth in that region demonstrates the strength of our business model within a highly competitive marketplace and with challenging external conditions. Increased weed resistance in Argentina resulted in higher sales of our Authority herbicides. And in Mexico, a focus in fruits and vegetables resulted in sales increase for our recently introduced Marceda [ph] insecticide and Rovral fungicide products. We expect demand in both of these countries to continue to be strong into the fourth quarter. In Brazil, as I mentioned earlier, the drought conditions reduced demand for our sugarcane product, as growers cut back on all inputs and continued to replant at a lower rate than typical. Offsetting this, we saw solid demand for our cotton and soybean products. Margins in Latin America improved versus the second quarter and versus last year, as we benefited from a mix of higher-value product. This benefit was partially offset by increased spending on logistics, currency hedging, and research and development costs in the region. In North America, additional demand for cotton products was offset by weaker-than-normal pest pressures in the Midwest that reduced demand for the full year insecticide versus the previous year. As we look toward the fourth quarter, Latin America will be the largest contributor to our results. We expect to continue gaining market share in Brazilian soybean as we expand our market presence with a broadening portfolio. We also expect to benefit from the strength in cotton as the planting season gets underway in November. We expect growing demand for our soybean pre-emergent herbicide in North America, following an increase in market share in the 2014 season and supported by expectations of increased soybean acres and expansion of weed resistance in 2015. We expect these factors to offset an otherwise weak overall market and lead to fourth quarter segment earnings to be flat to up single-digits percent over the previous year, which was particularly strong for us. Now turning to Health and Nutrition. Segment revenues of $203 million increased 7%, and operating profit of $44 million was 6% higher than last year. In the quarter, demand in the pharmaceutical end markets that we serve was solid. There was particularly strong demand for our tablet excipients in Asia and Europe, especially for the global pharma customers who produce generic prescription products. We also saw increased demand for alginates used in pharmaceutical applications. Overall, Nutrition profitability benefited from changes to the mix of food ingredients sold. In North America, higher volume of texture and stability solution offset weaker-than-expected demand for similar products in China. For the remainder of the year, increased demand in health markets, particularly in Europe and Asia, along with higher demand for nutritional markets in North America, is expected to offset continued weakness in demand for beverage applications in China. We expect omega-3 sales to be lower as certain customers shift orders into the first half of 2015. As a result, we expect fourth quarter segment earnings to be flat to the previous year. Let me now review Minerals. Revenue of $264 million increased 11%, and operating profit of $39 million increased 42% versus the same period last year. Both Minerals businesses performed as expected, as our Manufacturing Excellence initiatives continue to deliver volume and efficiency gains. Higher soda ash pricing and improved operations in both Alkali and Lithium resulted in a significant increase in profitability over the third quarter of 2013. In Alkali Chemicals, revenue of $197 million increased by 9% over the previous year quarter. Higher realized pricing and additional manufacturing volumes generated higher sales and profitability and offset the headwinds of higher energy costs. With regard to manufacturing operations. We are now operating at or above record production levels despite encountering higher-than-average level of insolubles materials. We will move the longwall in the fourth quarter again this year, but we expect the higher year-over-year pricing and improved production will contribute to stronger Alkali profitability versus the fourth quarter of 2013. In Lithium, sales of $67 million were 19% higher than the previous year. Improved operations produced additional volumes and allowed for higher sales in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, conditions in Argentina remained a headwind to profitability and had a negative impact on our cost structure. This headwind is expected to remain in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, we still expect that improved operations in Lithium will deliver low-teens profitability for the full year. In Minerals, our Lithium operations will achieve 12 consecutive months of improved operation in Argentina in the fourth quarter, and we expect near-record production in Alkali operation. This strong performance is expected to be partially offset by the current challenges of operating in Argentina. Segment earnings are expected to grow mid-single-digits percent year-over-year. I will now turn the call over to Paul to cover financial highlights. Paul W. Graves: Thanks, Pierre. Let me start with cash flow. For the year-to-date, net cash provided by operating activities was $235 million compared to $381 million at the same point last year. The biggest factor driving this lower performance is the Agricultural Solutions business, where we've seen different quarterly patterns of sales and collections all year. This was especially the case in the third quarter this year, where growers in Brazil elected to retain possession of their harvested crops rather than sell at the lower prices. And they were aggressively managing the payments to their own suppliers accordingly. We expect to generate approximately $350 million of cash from operations for the full year, slightly below last year, again, due to different patterns of business in Agricultural Solutions. The outcome of the full year will largely be driven by our receivables collection performance in Brazil, as well as the pattern of ordering, including prepayments we receive and rebates we pay in North America. We are in very close and frequent dialogue with all of our customers, and we manage our exposure to each one very carefully. Despite the increased accounts receivable balance, we do not believe that there's been any meaningful deterioration of credit quality of our customer base. Currency movements had very little impact on our revenue or earnings in the quarter. Although we continue to see some swings in exchange rates, movements in individual currencies largely offset each other or our exposures were hedged. However, we did see currency movements impact our tax rate in the quarter. Our underlying tax rate remains in the 25% to 26% range. However, the revaluation of certain monetary assets in Brazil and Norway created a buck [ph] credit of $5 million to our tax charge, leading to a reported rate closer to 22.5%. This did not impact our cash tax liability. We continue to expect that our underlying tax rate will remain in the 25% to 26% range for adjusted earnings for the full year, excluding the impact from these discrete items. Starting in this quarter, we will provide additional disclosures to our adjusted tax rate in our 10-Q, showing these discrete items separately. We funded approximately $53 million in capital additions during the quarter, which was primarily associated with the ongoing construction of the Thailand MCC facility and the gas pipeline in Argentina. We anticipate full year capital additions will be between $240 million and $270 million. This is lower than we previously forecast due to a combination of timing, with some projects being deferred until 2015 or later, and increased discipline around our capital spending in the current environment. In the quarter, we incurred approximately $15 million of legal and professional fees associated with the acquisition of Cheminova and the divestiture of Alkali. We also took out a series of forward currency contracts to hedge our exposure to Danish kroner as a result of the Cheminova acquisition. Finally, let me note that just after the quarter closed, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 6.25% interest in FMC Wyoming. We made total payments of approximately $95 million to acquire this interest. Also after the quarter closed, in connection with the acquisition of Cheminova, we entered into a commitment for a term loan up to $2 billion and extended our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility out to October 2019. With that, I will now turn the call back to Pierre to summarize and to give an update on both the Cheminova acquisition and the Alkali Chemicals sale process. Pierre R. Brondeau: For the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $0.95 to $1.05 per diluted share. For the full year, we expect adjusted earnings to be between $3.85 and $3.95 per diluted share. The challenging environment in the agricultural markets we are seeing today does not diminish our excitement about the mid- and long-term prospects for our business. Agricultural Solutions, with its focus on innovation and technology and its ongoing investment in market access initiative, continues to outperform the crop protection industry. The acquisition of Cheminova further strengthened our business, providing greater balance to our portfolio, a broader geographic reach and increased scale in areas such as research and development. We remain on track to close the acquisition in the early part of 2015. As we previously said, we are targeting delivering synergies of approximately $100 million to $130 million by the third year, and we expect that the majority of the actions needed to deliver these synergies will be completed in the first 2 years. With regard to Alkali Chemicals, as you can see, the business continues to perform well. We are on track to launch the sale process in the coming days, and based upon feedback so far, we expect a lot of interest. It remains our intention to announce the results of the sale process in the first half of 2015. Now I will turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Pierre, when you think about 2015 for the Ag Solution -- your base Ag Solution business, given the puts and takes with where commodity prices are, can you maybe give us some help on what type of profitability you think this business can produce in this type of an environment? Pierre R. Brondeau: Yes. Let me maybe take that opportunity to give you at least the FMC view of the market going into 2015 and what we are seeing, then I will tell you the -- what kind of growth rate we could expect when we talk about profitability. So first, let me talk with our biggest region, Latin America, and mostly Brazil. If we look at Brazil from an overall acreage and crop protection chemicals, I would say, for us, it's a market which will be overall flat to flat to slightly up. We see soybean flat to slightly up, the same for corn and the same for sugarcane, and maybe the place where we see the biggest challenge could be cotton getting into next year. So overall, that would be for us the region which will be the fastest growing, even if it's a bit sluggish compared to some other year. North America, as an overall region, whether it's acreage or crop protection chemical, we see a market overall which is down single digit. We see soybean being quite good with the shift from corn into soybean. And soybean acreage and crop protection chemicals being up in the low- to mid-single-digit percent. Corn being down in acreage and down to flattish for the crop chemical market. Cotton, as in Brazil, we see cotton being a down market next year. So overall, a slightly down single-digit market for North America. Europe, we also see a flattish type of a market, maybe oilseed rape will be flat to up. It's a very important -- to start the year. It's a very important crop over there, but overall, a flattish market. Where we see Asia, up in the single digit. It's a fragmented region. It's always a more difficult region to forecast. But we could see Asia providing growth. So if you look at the overall market, acreage and crop protection chemicals, following the acreage, 2 regions will bring a flat to low single-digit growth, that would be Brazil, Latin America and Asia; and 2 regions will be flat to down single digit, that would be North America and Europe. That results in -- would be in 2015 being a flattish market for -- flattish market, very low single digit overall worldwide. Now if I look at FMC and how can we perform in a market like this, I strongly believe that we will continue to outperform like we've done in previous years. And I would say, like we have done this year, I think if you look quarter-to-quarter, the performance of our business is still very far from our expectation. But if you forget about our expectation and put the performance of our business against other crop chemical competitors, we are doing quite well. So if I look into next year, 2015, what kind of growth could we expect? I think there is 4 very significant drivers for us of growth above market. First, we still believe that our business model, speed of product development, formulation technology, decentralized model and very flexible model, will allow us to keep on growing above the market like we've done in the previous year. We're also going to see the start of the revenue synergies with the Cheminova acquisition, I would say most likely in the second half of the year, and Latin America, Brazil will be the first place where we will see those synergies. I believe our new product, new technology and low market share, we will continue, as we have done this year, to gain market share in soybean and -- soybeans and corn. And last, very importantly, even if it is not at the level of what we've seen in the past, we still believe that Brazil and Latin America will be the fastest-growing region. And remember, this is where we have more than half of our business. So you put those 4 factors together in an overall market worldwide, which will be flat to up low single digit, I think we could outperform the market somewhere between 300 basis points to 500 basis points. That would be the forecast that we'll do. From a margin, I think this year, we've seen a dilution of margin, mostly due to the first half of the year, where you remember we had sales of a third-party product beyond what we were expecting. But today, we are looking at margin for the fourth quarter, which will be very much in line with what we had in previous quarter. For the third quarter, we are very slightly under last year performance, but it's mostly a balance, North America and Brazil, which is not the same as we had in previous year. Remember, North America is our highest-margin region. So nothing here which is fundamental problem with the business. So we should be able to see the margin growing at the same speed as our top line, plus cost synergies we will be generating from the acquisition of Cheminova. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Great. And then just one quick one on Cheminova. You've talked about improving that business from high single digits to high teens with the synergies over the next several years. How do you feel about the starting point, the high single digits, given that we're -- given the environment? Is that really the place to start? Or have you rethought of the starting base for Cheminova as you enter '15 and '16? Pierre R. Brondeau: No, I mean, as -- all of the information we have at this stage -- and remember, it's not closed, so we are still competing with Cheminova. But all of the information we have from the due diligence process, everything is telling us that the expectation to start in the high single digit is here. They have been maintaining and they are very highly focused on protecting their margin. And then we do have, as I've outlined before, multiple actions we are expecting to take place to bring their margin to the high single digits. Just to repeat myself, I think the first situation, the first opportunity we have are on cost synergies. Just on cost, not talking about revenue synergies, we're going to able to see the margin growing from the high single digit to the mid-double digit, around the 15%, and that is just by acting on the cost synergies. Then there is pricing for right technology. I think they do have some very interesting technology, which blended with ours, is going to allow us to put on the market some very interesting product, which will allow us to have new technology. And the mix is always favorable to us, and then revenue synergies in the right applications. So we've got all of those numbers outlined. And I believe we're going to get, in the next 2 to 3 years, we're going to bring the high single digit to the 17%, 18%, 19% range. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : But switching the gears a little bit to Health and Nutrition. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on with the omega-3 FDA approvals and sort of why the change in timing? Also, can you provide a little bit more detail on the Chinese beverage market that seems to be causing you a little bit of a headwind, both on top line and margin? And just talk about sort of the outlook for the business for the fourth quarter in terms of fundamentals, probably more so than any specific guidance, which you already provided. Pierre R. Brondeau: Let me give you an overview, and then I'll ask Mike to give some more color. First, omega-3, it is not completely surprising what we are facing. As you know, we bought a new business, a new technology, and we're going to have to grow that business. So we know and we knew from the beginning that we're going to have a dependence at the beginning on some large pharmaceutical customers who are placing orders, which are the bulk part of our -- the biggest parts of our business. Those customers are themselves new players or companies growing in omega-3. So we have a new product we are selling to customers. We are pushing in the market a new product. All of this is working well. But we know until we have more pharmaceutical customers and we have developed the right nutraceutical product, which will give a broader base to our business, it is going to be lumpy. We -- right now, we rely on too few customers, which are very large, to have a regular demand. So we had a couple of them. The biggest one, which are -- their market penetration is a bit slower than what they were expecting. They are bringing new product to the market. So they have asked us to take the order in the first quarter, if we wouldn't mind. It was in the fourth quarter. And of course, being a partner as we are, we agreed to move those orders to the first quarter. So this one is -- I have to say, this one around omega-3 is not a surprise, is not concerning. It's going to take a good year for us to have the new nutraceutical product, have our customers establish their market. We knew it from day 1. It's always the uncertainty when you penetrate a new market with a new technology. I think the one where we are having a closer eye is the situation -- the MCC situation in China. The second quarter was slower than expected. The third quarter was slower than expected. I think there is some impact of the economy and the growth of the economy in China, which is maybe seeing less penetration in term of growth rate of those high-end beverage in China than we were expecting, which has led some of the very large suppliers to control their stock and their inventory. Now if it is -- if the slowdown versus what we're expecting is mostly the result of our customers controlling their inventory better because the growth rate is in the, call it, high single digit, low double digit instead of the 20%, then it's not a big problem. If it is because there is a more intrinsic slowdown of the penetration of those products in the beverage industry, then it is a more serious question. And that's what we are trying to sort through. It's 2 quarters of slower growth. And even this quarter, I think, Mike, there was no growth for the MCC business. So we have to understand what are the very key drivers behind that performance. As I say one -- in one case, inventory correction, I'm less worried. More fundamental demand, then I would be a bit more concerned around what we need to do next to still continue to grow in this market. Mike, do you want to give some more colors? Michael P. Smith: I think the one thing that I would add to Pierre's comments is that starting the end of last year and into the beginning of this year, there have been some significant increases in dairy protein, and that has also reduced some of the demand for dairy protein beverages. So that, combined with some of the lower growth in consumer demand in China for dairy protein beverages, and also a significant slowdown in peanuts-based beverages, has really caused a reduction in the demand. And also, as Pierre mentioned, as those significant customers had continued to grow last year and produced a lot of product into the beginning of this year, we have seen a few of our very large customers start to reduce their inventory throughout a very extensive retail system throughout China during the last few quarters, and we expect that to continue into the fourth quarter. And of course, as Pierre mentioned, really, we're really focusing on the underlying demand for some of these important segments and trying to determine more specifically when, and to the extent that demand in China will regain its growth pattern. Pierre R. Brondeau: So in summary, omega, not a big problem, expected, new market, new technology. MCC, we really want to stay very close to the action to understand the fundamental reasons for the slowdown. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay, that's helpful. And as a follow-up, can I ask a quick question about the Minerals business and the guidance for 2014 -- 2015 fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, 2014 fourth quarter? The flattish guidance on the EBIT line, is that largely the function of the Argentinian issues with Lithium? Or -- because I mean, the longwall move falls basically in the same quarter, so that shouldn't be incrementally different unless you expect to experience higher costs in moving the longwall versus last year. So is this -- is the Lithium problems, in terms of Argentinian extra costs, severe enough to kind of offset the growth that you would expect with Alkali, which you had a pretty good 9 months year-to-date? Pierre R. Brondeau: Yes. So let me give to you a little bit the dynamic, and, Ed, please jump in. But I think if you look at overall Minerals, it is going to be a quarter which will be flat year-on-year. And if you exclude the shutdown of the plant we have, it will be about the same profitability sequentially from the third quarter. So we believe, year-on-year, we're going to be up mid-single digits versus a year ago, and we are very strong here in the second quarter. But the second quarter, I must say, was -- the business has been operating very, very well. It was almost flawless operation, pricing was good. Plant operation was good in both businesses. But it was a fairly easy comp, if you look from a year ago when we had multiple issues. So the 30-plus-percent growth in earnings for the business in Q3 is not completely representative of what we're expecting as being a regular growth in earnings for that business. I think the business continues to operate well. We believe it's going to be operating the same way in the fourth quarter as it did in the third quarter, but I think we're going to be against a much stronger quarter last year. But there is no fundamental change around pricing, operation of the plant. We have the turnaround in the middle, but there is no fundamental changes going into Q4 from Q3, it's about the same performance. The comp was easier in Q3 than it is in Q4. And if you look at our numbers last year, Q3 was by far the weakest quarter we had in Minerals. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison from First Analysis. Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : Paul, I wanted to ask you a little -- to dive a little bit deeper on the cash conversion. If I look at kind of where this year is probably going to shake out, it looks like you're guiding to 8% or 9% cash from operations as a percent of sales. If I look at where your EBITDA margin is going to shake out, probably 21% or 22%. Does the receivables issue and maybe other working capital stuff explain that gap fully? Or can you maybe walk us through why there's such a big gap between the cash conversion and the EBITDA margin? Paul W. Graves: The biggest factor is, by a distance, working capital, and it's largely driven by -- if you look back historically, we've grown our receivables in the major market in Brazil, double digit each year, in line with how the sales in some -- in that market has grown. And what we've seen this year, that's being compounded a little by slower collection rates. You can take a glance at that balance sheet and see how the accounts receivables have expanded, certainly, in advance and greater than the revenue has. So that, by far, is the single biggest factor that drives that delta between the EBITDA number and the cash conversion number. Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : Great. And then on the Ag side, you noted in North America that pest pressure was lower than expected. And I was just hoping to understand whether that means there's a lot of inventory built up in the channel, either at farms or maybe at distributors' warehouses, that could negatively impact next year's sales. Is that how it works? Or do you guys end up buying the products back when they go unused, so you have a better sense of where the inventory levels are? And then maybe address the same issue, whether that's taking place in South America. Mark A. Douglas: Yes, Mike, it's Mark here. I'll take that one. From a North America perspective, I would say it's a mixed bag in terms of what we see for channel inventories. Given the conditions we saw earlier in the year, given the extreme cold and what happened with soil insecticides for the corn space, I would say we're going into next year with elevated channel inventories in that space. So that's something that we're watching very carefully. I would say on the opposite end of the spectrum, we had a very good year with our pre-herbicides on soy, our Authority brands. I would say we're going into next year with normal or even low inventories in certain parts of the country in the channel, so that bodes well for 2015 on our soy herbicides business. Looking down in Brazil, clearly, what we saw going through the third quarter was grower intentions changing in terms of timing, given what they saw with commodity prices and certainly, the weather aspects in Mato Grosso and in S\u00e3o Paulo state. I would say, going into the season now, channel inventories are high. Obviously, we're waiting for the rains to come. They're supposed to come in the next week or so. Once that happens, things will start to free up, but it's definitely delayed. And I would say, yes, channel inventories are elevated in Brazil. Not necessarily so in Argentina, by the way, probably the opposite there, where we're seeing good need for our pre-herbicides once again. Problem is -- there is getting the import materials through the borders. Operator : You're next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America. Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I guess a two-part question on soda ash. First, I think you indicated you paid $95 million for the 6.25% interest in your Wyoming operations that you didn't already own. I was wondering how you arrived at that value. And then the second part, since the last earnings call, I think you quantified the expected dilution from the future divestiture of the business at $0.55. And if I look at the new EPS range for 2014, it's roughly 14% of that range, a fairly large number there. And so I'm wondering how committed you are to divesting the business and whether the changing market conditions are something that you're watching in that context. Paul W. Graves: Let me take a stab at those questions. I think, first of all, in terms of the purchase of the FMC Wyoming stake, we had a long-term relationship with the holder of that stake, Sumitomo, and various contractual rights and commitments on both parties' side, which shaped, in some regard, the way we structured the buyout and the valuation of that buyout. It was a negotiated deal, as you can imagine. Removing a 6.25% minority holder so that we could actually have full control and pursue what we needed to with regard to ownership of that asset was valuable to us. There was a bunch of, without getting into the details, payments that were historical dividend catch-up, and there were some payments that were to take them out. But it was a base valuation that we negotiated with the other side rather than anything mechanical I can necessarily share with you. In terms of 2015 and the dilution impact we've talked about, our assumption and our method has always been to assume -- to forecast 2015 as broadly being in line with 2014. We don't have anything particularly large and major that we can point to today that would suggest 2015 is going to be significantly different based on contracted prices or anything else. And so it remains our best estimate as to the likely performance for 2015. And I think we remain committed to a sale of that business. We think it's going to be a very attractive business to a number of buyers. We think it's a business that certainly doesn't form a long-term part of FMC into the future as we close on Cheminova. And we think it's the prudent thing to do with regard to our balance sheet. We've talked many times about the importance of having a strong and flexible balance sheet as we operate in the Ag business. As Pierre pointed out, over half of our Ag business is in Latin America, and they have very different working capital terms down there. We think a strong balance sheet is really important to our business, and so we remain very committed to selling it. Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, that's clear enough. The second question, if I may, on the Ag business. What percentage of your herbicide sales would you say are sold to address glyphosate-resistant weeds? Mark A. Douglas: Yes, good question, Kevin. I would say, with the pre-herbicides for us, Sulfentrazone is our big molecule both in Argentina, growing in Brazil and in North America. It's probably in the 65% to 70% range in terms of selective herbicides. So it's a big market for us, a big molecule, continue to see that weed resistance grow in North America. As I said, we're starting to see it in Brazil now. We're ideally placed to see that suite of products grow. And we're adding to both the pre- and the post-herbicides as we continue our innovation development. Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Just to be clear, Mark, if I look at that 65% to 70% that is selective herbicides, would all of those address glyphosate-resistant weeds or just a subset? What would the next cut on it be? Mark A. Douglas: Yes. I'd have to get -- I'll get with Alisha and come back to you on that exact cut, Kevin. It is the majority, but the exact percentage, I don't have right now in front of me. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : A couple of clarifications here. In terms of -- Paul, you mentioned that the expectation on soda ash 2015 was essentially flat with '14. I know we're coming up on contract time for the 2015 contract in a month or so here. So is the general thinking that soda ash pricing 2015 might be flat then? Pierre R. Brondeau: We are looking -- it's still very early in the process. We close those contracts throughout November, December. But I would say, today, there is not, looking at the growth, a lot of room. So it is a low single-digit potential increase in pricing. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : All right, terrific. And then, Pierre, on the movement of the longwall, that's about a $4 million impact, is that correct? Pierre R. Brondeau: That's correct. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : All right, great. And then I was struck by the comment talking about Ag, and thank you so much for the detailed look at 2015, that you're expecting sugarcane in Brazil to essentially be flat in 2015. And obviously, you suffered through the drought here in 2014. I know commodity pricing is running against you. But why would do think that, that would just be flat for you guys and not potentially higher? Mark A. Douglas: Yes, Frank, it's Mark. You're right, we've suffered through a couple of years of pretty major declines in terms of that industry's profitability and then hence, the inputs. I think we're just taking a prudent course of action here. We've been hit not only by commodity prices in terms of the world sugar price, but also ethanol caps in Brazil, they've impacted the industry. And not to forget that perhaps even bigger than that is the weather impacts, and predicting weather, as you know, is not easy. So I think we're just taking a cautious approach to sugarcane. We've had 2 years of very, very difficult conditions, and we're forecasting that to roll into early part of next year. Of course, that could change, but I think this is just the best course of action. Pierre R. Brondeau: And one additional thing, Frank. You are correct, I mean, the sugarcane situation in Brazil is complicated because on one side, there is low production, which is due to the drought situation, but there is also because of the cap on oil pricing and -- which creates a limitation on the ethanol pricing. There is, actually despite the low production, it's one of the product -- we are following very closely what is called the stock-to-use, which is a very important ratio in terms of understanding how much inventory is building up. And today, if you look in Brazil, sugarcane is one of the place where there is the highest stock-to-use ratio. So despite the low production, because of the issue on the ethanol side, there is a very high stock-to-use. Now as Mark said, so we are taking the approach that in the short term, because there was not a change in regime, the government is the same, same president, same government, we are not forecasting a change in term of freeing the pricing at the pump. If such an action would take, it could definitely change that picture, but we cannot anticipate that. So assuming price of ethanol keep the same limitation, because of the size of the stock-to-use, right now, we are forecasting a flattish market in Brazil. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Sandy Klugman from Vertical Research. Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: So a two-part question on Ag. Soy has obviously become a bigger part of your portfolio. This should position you well in the acreage outlook going forward. But I was hoping you could comment on how the margins for soy sales compare to other key end markets, such as fruits and vegetables, cotton and sugarcane. And then the other question is, just in North America, we're getting closer to the commercialization of dicamba-tolerant and 2,4-D-tolerant traits. How do you expect this to impact demand for your Authority product line going forward? Mark A. Douglas: Yes, Sandy, let me take the first one. On the soy complex for us, free herbicides are very important, but we also have a mix of both fungicides down in Brazil, as well as insecticides. I would say, when you look at our overall EBIT margins, soy is right at the average of all of our product range. So it doesn't skew it up or down. It puts us basically in our 20% range. So it's a key contributor to the portfolio, but it's not just any one product, there is a whole suite there. To answer your second question on the new traits that are coming through, yes, obviously, we're watching this very closely in terms of the EPA authorization and what a lot of people are looking at in terms of how that will impact the soy market. Like a lot of genetics, when they come in, you do see a decrease in terms of chemistry. But then depending on how resistance builds, the chemistry comes back. So yes, I think there will be an impact. But I think one thing that's very important for people to remember is, we still have market share to gain in many parts of the world. So for us, the soy complex is something we're still focused on with new technology we're bringing to market. So despite genetics coming in with different traits, we believe it's still a very attractive space to us as we develop new alternatives. Pierre R. Brondeau: All right. So just to conclude, let me give a few words to conclude the call. We understand that the performance of the company is not at the level of our expectation because we're operating under difficult market conditions in our core segment. Nevertheless, within the context of the market we have today, we believe we continue, especially in our Ag business, and to some extent, in our Health and Nutrition business, to perform above competition. From a transformation standpoint, we feel now we are at the right place. The Alkali business is generating a lot of interest, so we should have a pretty smooth and competitive process. Cheminova, we have no concern. We are still feeling very strong that it was the appropriate move for us in our journey to building a very strong Ag, Health and Nutrition company. The company next year will be larger, simpler, more focused. We do expect to continue to deliver strong results with a highly predictable Health and Nutrition business. And definitely, as I said before, we are definitely expecting, for all the reasons I've been stating, to outperform the Ag market. So we are in the process of a transformation. We know that first quarter, we'll see a lot of movement. We do expect to have much more clarity as soon as the acquisition is closed and the sale of the Alkali business is done. And that should lead us to a very solid year for 2015, within the context, once again, of the markets we're operating in. But I certainly expect a strong year, above market condition for our company. As soon as we have clarity, which mean we have signed on Alkali and we have closed on Cheminova, we will bring investors and analysts together with us and give you a full picture. We will go through our regular Vision 2020 exercise. We will do it a bit differently this year, I think, because of all the moving parts. We'll give you a much more granular view on '15, '16 and '17, and then a strategic direction for 2020. But I think it will be important for us to state the shorter term, '15, '16 and '17 in a much more precise way because of all the moving parts. So thank you very much for your attention, and we'll be in touch. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the FMC Corporation Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call.",

[Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the conference over to Ms. Alisha Bellezza, Director, Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Ms. Bellezza, you may begin. Alisha Bellezza : Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to FMC Corporation's fourth quarter earnings call. With me today are Pierre Brondeau, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, who will review our quarter performance and business segment results and provide insights into our 2015 outlook; and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will present select financial results. Following his comments, we will be joined by Mark Douglas, President, FMC Agricultural Solutions; Ed Flynn, President, FMC Minerals; Eric Norris, Vice President and Business Director, FMC Health and Nutrition; and Thomas Schneberger, Vice President and Global Business Director of FMC Lithium, to address your questions. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific risk factors, including but not limited to those factors identified in our release and in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms, as well as other non-GAAP financial terms that we may refer to during today's conference call, are provided on our website. I will now turn the call over to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau: Thank you, Alisha, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to introduce Eric Norris and Tom Schneberger, both named to their positions recently. Each has held leadership positions across multiple businesses within FMC and bring a wealth of experience to these roles. We are confident, given their successful track record, that they will provide the right leadership for the Health and Nutrition and Lithium businesses. Now I would like to start with some comments on market conditions in the fourth quarter. In Agricultural markets, we saw difficult market conditions in Brazil during the fourth quarter, including weak demand in sugarcane and cotton and high channel inventories in all areas. Acres were planted much later than normal during the season and resulted in lower-than-expected demand for crop protection products, particularly for cotton. Together, this led to weaker performance in Brazil than the previous-year quarter. In other parts of Latin America, markets remained strong, especially in Mexico and Argentina. Mexico is currently benefiting from increasing demand for vegetable export and a government program to invest in agriculture. Argentina now grows the third largest soybean crop globally, and glad to say resistance continues to spread. This is leading to continuing demand growth for FMC's pre-emergent herbicide. In North America, we saw stronger demand for herbicides that address weed-resistance issues in soybeans and rice, and reduced demand for corn-focused products. This is consistent with third-party expectation that soy acres will be larger than corn acres in 2015. We expect to get more information on the extent of this trend when the USDA Prospective Planting report is issued later this month. Most Asian markets were stronger, but results were reduced by the impact of currency translation, as most regional currencies weakened against the dollar. We saw underlying demand growth in China, Indonesia and India, although Australia continued to be affected by drought conditions. Crop protection markets in Europe remained solid, with stable acreage in oilseed rape and cereals. Coming off a strong growing season and supported by moderate winter condition, demand for herbicides remained steady in the fourth quarter. In Health and Nutrition, we saw demand in Asia, and especially in India, driving increased pharmaceutical excipients volumes. Demand for texture and stability solutions in North America was greater than the previous year. However, the Chinese beverage market continued to be soft. Market conditions for Lithium products were mixed. Demand for butylithium softened during 2014 with the decision by a large European customer to change its process and no longer use butylithium. However, demand for this product in other applications is increasing. Lithium demand for energy storage applications continues to grow at double-digit rates. This has led to a tightening in some segments and created for a more favorable pricing environment, especially for lithium hydroxide. We also saw some tightening in carbonate supply and demand, which we expect will also lead to favorable year-over-year pricing. Currency volatility was a factor in the fourth quarter. Paul will provide more details on this later, but it was a net headwind in the quarter, mostly in ag business. In light of these factors and market conditions, in the fourth quarter, FMC generated $1.1 billion in revenue, a 3% decrease over the same quarter last year. Adjusted operating profit increased to $203 million, a 6% increase compared to last year, and adjusted EPS was $1.12, an increase of 7% over last year. This includes an $0.08 benefit from tax adjustments that Paul will explain further. Today, as we review the segment performance for the fourth quarter 2014, I will provide a view into each segment's earnings outlook for the full year 2015. I will also comment on some of the factors that will influence first quarter performance. With that, I will now turn to segment results. Fourth quarter sales in Agricultural Solutions were $627 million, a 7% decrease over last year's record fourth quarter. Segment earnings were $130 million, down 5% over last year. As I already mentioned, this performance was primarily due to slower demand in Brazil, specifically, delayed planting and lower cotton acreage reduced insecticide and herbicide volumes. In sugarcane, conditions remained weak despite improvement from earlier in the year. The rapid industry-wide slowdown highlighted the elevated levels of inventory in multiple channels in Brazil, and these contributed to increased pricing pressure and softer volume across all segments. We continued to see positive momentum with increased penetration in soybean. Importantly, we reduced our sales in low-margin, third-party product, contributing to an improved EBIT margin in the quarter. During the quarter, we saw higher demand for our products in Argentina, Mexico and North America. Similar to what we saw in the third quarter, our joint venture in Argentina successfully gained share in key markets. This was especially the case in soybeans, as the need for residual herbicides, such as our Authority brands, continue to expand. In Mexico, as I mentioned, the increase of vegetable export has led to higher demand for insecticide and fungicide products. The peso devaluation has stimulated demand for growers to produce more for U.S. exports. As you are aware, fourth quarter sales in North America are mainly in anticipation of the next growing season. In the quarter, as expected, we sold a higher volume of pre-emergent herbicides for soybeans, which was offset by lower year-over-year demand for corn insecticides. Earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of a new active ingredient originally discovered by Kumiai Chemical. For the year, we collaborated with Kumiai developing this important molecule. It is one of our platform chemistries, and we are very excited by its potential. We look forward to providing additional insight as part of our R&D review at our Investor Day. As we look at the market for 2015, current data suggests that growers in both North America and Latin America, will favor planting soybeans over corn to de-risk their field. At current grain prices and with stocking use [ph] at high levels, we are likely to see pricing pressures global for some crop protection products. In light of this, we believe that global ag chem markets are likely to be flat to slightly lower in 2015. Without a catalyst to change the currency pricing environment, markets could remain flat into 2016. For FMC, this is a significant opportunity to outperform the market and our competitors as we take advantage of the Cheminova integration to reduce operating costs, accelerate innovation and develop and deliver new revenue synergies. Now looking at the 2015 ag market by region. In Brazil, drier-than-normal condition delayed the past planting season for soy and cotton growers, leading to high inventory throughout the distribution channel. These elevated levels will certainly be a factor in the first half of the year as growers work through excess stocks. There was an increase in soybean planted area, and we expect this trend to continue this year. However, cotton area was reduced by nearly 10%, and we anticipate the area to remain flat. Weather conditions for sugarcane, while better, have not yet returned to optimal conditions and the competitive environment remains high. Government action on ethanol and gasoline prices will play an important role in improving sugarcane economics, serving as a potential demand stimulus. As a result, a slow recovery is expected to take place over the year in this market. Continuing pest pressures and resistance, along with previously mentioned additional soybean acres, will offset some of the slower demand. Overall, the Brazil crop protection chemicals market is expected to be broadly flat versus last year, with a slow first half as the industry works down channel inventory levels. Planting intention in the United States suggest additional acres of soybean will be planted at the expense of corn and cotton acres. Weed resistance remains a growing concern across both soy and corn acres and will drive additional demand for selective residual herbicide. As in other regions, we expect fungicide and insecticide to see the most pressure during 2015 growing season. Taking these together, the market in North America is expected to be down mid-single digits. In EMEA, acreage is expected to remain stable in cereals and oilseed rape markets. Conditions in 2014 were exceptional and led to a record year for the crop protection market. In light of last year's performance, the industry expects normal mode [ph] condition in 2015, and excluding the impact of currency, this market is expected to be down low-single-digit percent compared to a very strong 2014. In Asia, we expect increased demand for crop protection products in most markets. The potential for a better monsoon season is providing optimism for 2015 performance. Rice acres in the region are expected to remain stable to last year, but are expected to use additional crop protection products to maintain yields. Cereal acreage is also expected to be consistent with last year. Across the region, crop protection is expected to be up low-single-digit percent, excluding the impact of currency. Let me now comment on how these market characteristics will affect FMC. First, we are on track to close the Cheminova acquisition within this quarter. Our integration plans are ready, and we will aggressively begin implementation as soon as we close. However, we will have no more than 1 month of combined operations during the first quarter. Our revenue and cost synergies will be a top priority as we accelerate integration efforts. As such, we expect a strong progression of earnings contribution as the year advances. For the first quarter, we expect a slow start to the year. North America is expected to be flat to last year, with higher herbicide demand offset by reduced insecticide sales. EMEA and Asia are also expected to be flat to last year, with some growth coming later in the year. And as I said, we do not expect the acquisition to provide meaningful benefits until second quarter. As a result, we expect a challenging first quarter in the Ag Solutions segment. For the full year, continued spread of weed resistance in North America and Latin America, and market share gains in Asia and EMEA, will offset pricing pressures and provide earnings growth to our core business. We will supplement that with a disciplined approach to discretionary spending. In addition, as we target and aggressively realize the cost and revenue synergies, along with earnings contribution for Cheminova, we expect to deliver full year segment earnings 15% to 30% higher than 2014. Now turning to Health and Nutrition. Fourth quarter segment revenues of $192 million increased 1%, and operating profit of $44 million was 9% higher than last year. Revenue growth was partially offset by the depreciating euro. Earnings growth was driven by a favorable product mix and benefits for restructuring programs initiated earlier in the year. These were partially offset by increased raw materials, mainly seaweed. In the quarter, demand in pharmaceutical end market remained solid. Specifically, demand for our Avicel brand was steady to last quarter and well above last year. This demand continues to be centered in India, the market that supports generic tablets production for Western use. Similar to last quarter, our nutrition profitability benefit from changes to the original mix of food ingredients sold. In North America, higher volume of texture and stability solutions partially offset a slower demand for beverage producers in China. Underlying demand for pharmaceutical-grade omega-3 is demonstrating favorable trends, while demand for nutraceutical products remained weak. We continue to focus our strategy toward the high-concentration application. In the quarter, we launched a new restructuring initiative to improve operational efficiencies and streamline the footprint we acquired over the past few years. We anticipate that implementation will be spread over the first 3 quarters of 2015. Our previous Manufacturing Excellence programs have delivered benefit that we expect to replicate in Health and Nutrition. Additionally, as part of this program, we have decided to delay the Thailand MCC plant opening and add flexibility to the facility. Recognizing the increased demand for pharma excipients in India and weaker beverage market conditions in China, we believe adding pharmaceutical processing capabilities to our Thailand plant provides greater long-term flexibly to serve our customer base. We will update you on these restructuring plans at our Investor Day and throughout the year. For 2015, we expect demand to have similar patterns as in 2014, including increased demand in health markets, particularly in India; and higher demand for nutrition products in North America. In the Chinese beverage market, we expect some recovery will lead to increased colloidal MCC volumes, although we do not expect a rapid return to demand levels seen prior to the slowdown. As a result, we expect segment earnings for the year to be up mid-single-digit percent over 2014. First half performance will be impacted by recent condition in the North Sea, which prevented seaweed harvesting and led to an unplanned outage of alginate production. This has resulted in sales delays due to lack of available product. Combined with the softness of colloidal MCC in China that we have mentioned already, we're expecting Health and Nutrition first half performance to be flat versus the same period last year. And now, let me review Minerals. Fourth quarter segment revenue of $274 million increased 4%, and operating profit of $48 million increased 32% versus the same period last year. Record production due to Manufacturing Excellence initiatives delivered volume and efficiency gains in alkali. Higher soda ash pricing and improved operations in both alkali and lithium led to increased profitability over the first -- fourth quarter of 2013. In Alkali Chemicals, revenue of $204 million increased by 7% over the previous-year quarter. Higher realized pricing, favorable freight and logistic adjustments, and additional manufacturing volume generated higher sales and profitability. In Lithium, sales of $69 million were 3% lower than the previous-year quarter, mainly related to product mix, including the previously mentioned loss of a European butylithium customer. Pricing for lithium hydroxide, largely used in electric-vehicle batteries, was higher than the fourth quarter of 2013. And we were pleased that the business generated an operating margin in the low-teens percent in 2014. However, during the second half of 2014, the business became more difficult to operate in Argentina, as we're unable to counteract increasing cost trends. In 2015, we expect supply and demand for energy storage application will continue to support a favorable pricing environment for lithium hydroxide and carbonate. However, adverse currency conditions and escalating operating costs in Argentina are expected to be a significant headwind to earnings. As such, Lithium segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million for the full year. We are taking all actions in our control to reduce cost as much as possible, but Argentina remains a difficult place to operate. Before I turn the call to Paul, let me comment briefly on the status of the Cheminova transaction. We have received all required regulatory approvals except 2 countries. We believe those approvals will be prompt and will allow us to close before the end of the first quarter. We were very pleased to announce the sale of Alkali to Tronox earlier this week for $1.64 billion, a multiple of 9.4x 2014 EBITDA. We launched the sale process in November and were extremely pleased with the level of interest. It was a very competitive process reflecting the high quality of the Alkali business, and we know that Tronox will be a great owner. I will now turn the call over to Paul to cover financial highlights. Paul W. Graves: Thanks, Pierre. Let me start with a review of cash flow. We finished the year with cash from operations, before all separation and M&A-related spending, of approximately $470 million, an increase of 24% compared to 2013. With CapEx and spending on discontinued operations both lower than 2013, our free cash flow, before the separation and M&A-related spending, was more than double that of 2013 at approximately $200 million. After accounting for all other demands on cash, including net M&A spending, dividends and separation and transaction-related expenses, our net debt at December 31 was $160 million lower than a year earlier. While we're pleased to have increased our cash flow in 2014, we believe we can do much better, and we continue to focus on trade working capital and capital spending as near-term drivers to improve free cash flow. Working capital consumed approximately $200 million of cash in 2014, which was about $50 million less than in 2013. This was largely due to a higher collection of prepayments for our North American Ag Solutions business compared to 2013, a good signal of 2015 demand. Despite this, our Agricultural Solutions business, and Brazil in particular, remains the primary consumer of working capital. We continue to focus on the Brazil credit environment, and we're pleased with our collections during the fourth quarter. The balance remains higher in Brazil than recent years, and we continue to take a very disciplined approach to credit extension and collections. We expect working capital to remain broadly flat across all businesses in 2015. And moving on to capital spending. Our total cash outflow on CapEx was $225 million, essentially flat to 2013, as we completed certain projects under budget and reduced our spending for other projects. For 2015, after removing the spending for Alkali, but including estimates for Cheminova, we expect total operating CapEx to be within the range of $150 million to $175 million for the year. And in the next couple of months, we expect to receive just over $1.1 billion in proceeds from the sale of Alkali, net of all taxes and fees. A brief comment on our tax rate. Our underlying adjusted tax rate in 2014 was approximately 24.5%, basically flat to last year and slightly better than we forecasted. This was due largely to benefits from geographic mix of earnings, with a larger proportion of our earnings taking place outside the high-tax countries of the U.S. and Brazil than forecast, as well as the renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit for 2014 late in December. The full year rate also benefited from one-off discrete items that were primarily a result of year-end revaluations of various tax balances using actual year-end exchange rates. These items reduced the full year rate by 160 basis points and the full benefits of this was seen in the fourth quarter, as we completed our year-end true up. The effect amounted to approximately $0.08 per share benefit for the quarter versus our expectations. We have again provided a full reconciliation of our tax rate in a separate note in our earnings release schedules. In 2015, our underlying adjusted tax rate is expected to be between 25% and 27%. The loss of certain tax deductions we were able to take as part of the Alkali operations, combined with the lack of an R&D tax credit being passed for 2015, are the primary drivers of this increase in our underlying tax rate. However, the higher foreign exchange volatility that we foresee will mean that our reported tax rate in any quarter is likely to become more volatile in 2015. Now moving on to the impact of foreign exchange rate movements. In 2014, the net impact of foreign currency movements on our reported EBIT was approximately $20 million or $0.11 per diluted share. This consisted of a mix of transaction, translation and hedging cost impacts. Agricultural Solutions carried most of these costs in its segment results. The largest currencies which we carry exposure to are the euro, the Brazilian reais, the Chinese renminbi, followed by the Argentine peso and various Asian currencies. And we expect most of these to continue to exhibit greater volatility relative to the dollar in 2015. In 2015, the impact of the strengthening dollar will be mixed for FMC. At the most basic level, sales we make in currencies that devalue will be lower in U.S. dollar terms, putting pressure on sales growth when reported in U.S. dollars. This is especially the case in our Health and Nutrition and Cheminova businesses, given their relatively large euro exposures. However, we also have a significant cost base in Europe, meaning the impact on our earnings will be far more limited than the impact on revenue. Equally important, we expect those products we manufacture in Europe for export to the U.S. will have a lower cost in U.S. dollar terms. In Brazil, a devaluing reais is generally a positive to our business, although there is no doubt it is likely to influence some of the dynamics of our operations there. We price and invoice largely in U.S. dollars and our customers receive the vast majority of their revenues in U.S. dollars. However, growers typically incur half or more of their total expenses in reais. This clearly improves the profitability of growers in reais terms, partially shielding them from the depreciation in global agricultural crop prices and creating an incentive to incur more costs locally, where possible. With increased volatility in exchange rates, we expect to see higher cost of hedging in 2015 for all major currencies. Unlike in prior years, we are not providing a formal full-year EPS guidance with our earnings today. However, based upon the best judgment we have right now, we expect 2015 earnings to be in the range of $3.50 and $3.90 per share. To place this in the context of 2014 earnings, let me provide a bridge between the 2014 EPS and the midpoint of this range. First of all, the addition of 10 months of Cheminova earnings, including synergies; growth in the earnings contribution from our current ag, Health and Nutrition and Lithium businesses; and the loss of the Alkali earnings, will collectively reduce EPS by $0.10. Increases in corporate costs, primarily due to higher expected incentive payments, will be a headwind of a further $0.07; and higher interest expense will reduce EPS by $0.06. Finally, a tax rate higher than the unusually low rate we saw in '14 will reduce EPS by an additional $0.12 per share. This bridge is centered on the midpoint of a range, which itself is much wider than we would typically provide. This is largely due to the impact that the timing of the Cheminova close has upon our ability to accurately forecast our Ag business today, especially in respect to the calendarization of Cheminova earnings and the timing of synergy realization. In addition, the delay in the closing has prevented us from spending time with Cheminova management to understand their latest expectations for 2015, a process that is critical for us to complete before we can provide detailed full year and quarterly guidance. With that, I will pass the call back to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau: The conditions we are seeing in the agricultural markets today do not change our excitement about the prospects for our business. Agricultural Solutions will continue its focus on innovation and technology and its ongoing investment in market access initiatives. The acquisition of Cheminova enhances our business, provides greater balance to our portfolio, broadens our geographic reach and accelerates our innovation efforts. Our Health and Nutrition business continues to demonstrate the strength of our franchise with high margin and predictable growth. We expect our manufacturing excellence programs will deliver additional upside, reinforcing our confidence in the prospects for this business. In Lithium, underlying demand patterns remain attractive, and market dynamics suggest we will see increased pricing opportunities in the coming years. We will continue to manage our assets in order to maximize returns from the downstream market, where we have a leading position, and we will continue to drive operational excellence as a tool to help offset cost inflation in our Argentina operations. Today, we are demonstrating progress toward a portfolio focused on agricultural, health and nutrition end markets. The attractive price we achieved in the Alkali sale will allow us to pay down Cheminova acquisition debt more quickly. And the benefits we will deliver from revenue and cost synergies from Cheminova will ensure our earnings growth outperforms the broad ag market. Across all of our businesses, 2015 will be an important year for FMC. Although we recognize that near-term visibility is muted, we remain very excited about our prospects through 2015 and beyond. I look forward to seeing you in April to provide more detail on the plans that we are putting in place and to provide more guidance on both near-term performance and the long-range vision we have for FMC. Now I will turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question's from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Robert Betz : This is Rob Betz in for John. So on your ag earnings guidance for 2015, can you parse out what you expect earnings growth to be from your core business versus the growth from acquisitions, assuming 10 months of Cheminova that you guys are expecting currently? Pierre R. Brondeau: Yes. So for the -- if you look at for the overall business, including the acquisition, we gave a pretty broad range of 15% to 30%. And as Paul said in his message, it is mostly due to the timing of closing and also due to the calendarization. And what we mean by calendarization, you know that Cheminova is much larger in Europe than FMC is. And Europe is a first-quarter, beginning-of-second-quarter, market. So you could have a very large amount of sales shifting in between February, March and April. And today, we don't really know where they are. Antitrust rules forbid us to look at what Cheminova is doing. So we have no visibility how their sales are unfolding within those 3 months. And if they are big in February, they will most likely be lower in March, or they could all be in March and April. So that creates a very large range for us. The underlying business, as we see it today, if we think about operating within a flattish or low-single-digit market globally, we would see our business in the low-single-digit positive growth. That's where we would be seeing the core underlying business. The 2%, 3% range will be something which we would expect to see. Robert Betz : Okay, great. And then just following up, what are the major swing factors in the ag business that would cause you to come in on the low end of the range versus the high end? Is it all the timing of Cheminova, or is there a possibility that the core business could do better than what you guys have laid out for this year? Pierre R. Brondeau: For us, I would say the highest uncertainty and what is an additional swing factor to the timing for Cheminova is Brazil. We are quite confident right now in the way things are shaping in Europe, quite confident around the market share gain and position in Asia. North America looks pretty good, and we start to have a good sense on the fourth quarter. Latin America, South and North, Argentina, Brazil -- Argentina and Mexico are looking pretty good right now. We have the right products for the right type of resistance. The question mark is Brazil and the level of stock in the channel. That is the big question mark for us. Together also with questions around how much sugarcane, for example, will be recovering depending upon weather and government stimulus. So if I put a place of uncertainty, that will be Brazil. Operator : Your next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : My question relates to your capital budget. If we look back about 6 months ago, I think you were planning to spend $270 million to $300 million. If I heard you right, you came in at $225 million and expect a further decrease to $150 million to $175 million for 2015, so quite a dramatic change there. And I was wondering if you could talk through how you're thinking about capital deployment, what the key decrements might be in those changes. And if possible, what do you think the future would look like over the medium to long term on capital spend? Does it go flat from these levels or trend otherwise? Pierre R. Brondeau: Yes. First, if you look at the reduction from $220 million to $150 million, $170 million, so reduction '15 and going forward versus '14, there is a few reasons for that. First of all, Alkali tend to be a business which is slightly more capital intensive than the other businesses. So it will not be part of the portfolio, where you know we tend to operate ag on an asset-light business. So there is a capital intensity which is different between those 2 businesses. Also with the completion of the MCC plant, we have way less capital to spend even if we make it more flexible with the pharmaceutical line than the $100 million we've spent over the last 2 years. So you're going to have a -- at this point, the way we look at Health and Nutrition, we have capacity. It's a matter of rationalization and optimization of our footprint, but we have capacity. So you bring together the fact that we have -- we are -- we have the capacity that we need in Health and Nutrition; we have an asset-light business model, even with the acquisition of Cheminova; and we have less of an intensity with Alkali leading the portfolio, that will reduce the capital utilization for the next -- for the years to come. So I would say the number you have in front of us for 2015 is going to be a pretty typical number we're going to be facing for the years to come. The reduction versus where we were in term of forecast and where we are today, it's purely controlling capital spending in light of our -- in light of the economical situation in the ag business. I think we -- like any company in that space, when you face a slowdown in the business, you just control your capital. We are certainly seeing way less growth in 2015 and '16 in that business than we saw 2 or 3 years ago. So certainly, a reduction in capital spending. So we've just been managing very, very carefully capital over the last 4, 5 months, when it became clear that 2015 would be a challenging year for companies in the ag world. Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : The second question, maybe also related to cash flow. On the trade working capital side, I know you've been increasingly focused on this area. And yet, if we look at the December 31 balance sheet, it looks like receivables were up about 18% year-over-year versus sales growth of 4%. So I'm wondering what your view is on the trend on receivables, specifically for 2015. And are you today restricting more credit to your customers in Brazil? And is that in any way related to your outlook? Paul W. Graves: Let me answer that in reverse order. We certainly are as disciplined as we've ever been with regard to extending credit in Brazil. And it's certainly factored into our outlook. Our views on what the credit environment is and where we extend credit is absolutely factored in there. When I look at our receivables balance today, as we say, it really is almost entirely driven by Brazil. There is no doubt that the comments Pierre made with regard to inventory levels being elevated in Brazil will have an impact on collection rates through 2015. And so while we don't expect the working capital balance to increase during the year, we'll ultimately expect the receivables balance to make a shift back down to historical levels within the space of a single season. It's likely to take a little bit more than just 2015 to take it back down to historical levels. Pierre R. Brondeau: And then just to add something on balance sheet. We -- additionally, to be stable, we are working very, very hard on the inventory side of the balance sheet. We've made some significant progress in ag. I think we are conscious of the situation. We are conscious also that even if there is not a lot of risk, it's going to be very hard to decrease the receivable piece. So if you can look at the balance sheet we've made, we made and will continue to make strong progress on the inventory side of the balance sheet. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Harrison from First Analysis. Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : On the ag side, can you talk a little bit about your marketing and development initiatives? Were they higher or lower -- the spending there, higher or lower year-on-year in Q4? And then for 2015, it sounds like you expect to accelerate some of that spending in order to take advantage of some opportunities that you see in this challenging market. Can you give a little bit more color on why that strategy makes sense rather than pulling back in a challenging market? Mark A. Douglas: Yes, Mike, it's Mark. Yes, you're right. In 2014, our expenses for R&D certainly were up on prior year. Part of that is given the fact that we've invested in a long-term pipeline, as well as our short-term developments. And you saw some of that with the announcement of the new herbicide we're looking at from Kumiai over the last couple weeks. In 2015, we see that continuing in terms of spend on R&D. We considered a central platform, and I'll be talking more about that in April when we're together. We are offsetting that, though, by controls in other areas in our business in terms of SG&A spend. Obviously, we're seeing a challenging environment just like everybody else in the space, and we're taking the prudent steps to make sure that we can afford to spend -- expense on R&D appropriately, yet pull back in other areas that in times that are more difficult, makes sense for us. So yes, overall, R&D will be up again in 2015, but it is core to where we're taking the business. Pierre R. Brondeau: And Mike, in terms of cost control in ag, I would say today, if I look starting in, hopefully, in March, we have tremendous opportunities to reduce our cost through the Cheminova integration. So that will be our first focus. When you run an R&D portfolio, and we think we have a very strong R&D portfolio, a big part of the spending is external to your organization. It's all of the regulatory aspect and toxicology aspect of R&D. It is very dangerous to start that spending in the middle of a project for cost control. So we're going to be careful on how we do it. But I would rather -- if I have to take any actions which would be on the -- on pushing cost saving, I will try to do it more on the SG&A and more on the overall cost synergies than today on R&D, which is the future of this business. Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : All right. And then on the Lithium side, the numbers for the Volt, the Leaf and even Tesla, are not very encouraging right now in terms of electric vehicle adoption. Have you guys moderated your outlook for battery demand given the dynamics with lower gasoline prices? Pierre R. Brondeau: No. We've always been among the -- if you take the range of what people are expecting from an adoption rate, we've always been on the lowest end of the range. And we believe our range is still valid. I think we've always said there is a little bit too much exuberance in this market. But I have to say that we are a critical supplier of lithium hydroxide to that industry, and that part of the product line has a very healthy growth right now. So we are staying with the same forecast we've been having, knowing that we've been on the lower end at some of our competitors, and we feel our numbers are still looking pretty good. But I must say it's -- the business, the lithium hydroxide business today is a very bright spot in our Lithium business. There is not -- I mean, you can have some short-term reaction of people to gas price, but gas price is not the driver when you decide to buy a Tesla. So it is part of the decision, but it's not the main driver. And lots of people who are interested in this kind of cars have other reason to make the decision, and very often, look beyond 1 year gas price. Operator : Your next question is from the Sandy Klugman with Vertical Research Partners. Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: I was hoping you could provide an update on your strategic alliance with Christian Hansen. How meaningful do you expect biologicals to be, and over what time frame? And in particular, how do you see the European market for biologicals evolving? Do you expect greater acceptance than what has been seen for GMO? Because it would seem that Cheminova's direct market access would help to accelerate FMC's penetration in the region. Mark A. Douglas: Yes, Sandy, this is Mark. Talking about the alliance. The alliance has been in place just over a year now. It is actually producing extremely good results. We have about 7 products that we have been testing around the world in various trials, ranging from bio stimulants, the first of which will be launched later this year in North America; and then we're looking at high-value fungicides and seed treatment applications for biologicals. So as far as we're concerned, the alliance is working very well. We've got both products coming from the Christian Hansen library and products coming from the acquisition that we made of CAEB. We expect -- I think you made a comment about Christian Hansen's market access, it's actually FMC's market access that drives the markets and the sales application. Christian Hansen bring true value to the alliance through their manufacturing scale and species analysis. You'll get a lot more detail of this when we get together in April for the Investor Day. It is a major part of what we're doing in terms of R&D. It's very different. We believe we have a world-class library, some very special skills with what we call smart selection, and we will certainly update you. But we're very much on track with our initial plans. First product to be launched later this year, and then other products following in '16, '17 and '18. Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: What I was actually asking as it regards Europe and whether or not these products see greater traction than what's been seen for GMO, is whether or not the Cheminova acquisition will accelerate your penetration in the region, because I know they have a direct sales force in Europe. Mark A. Douglas: Yes, okay. Sorry about that. Yes. Yes, it will. I mean, obviously, as you just said, one of the reasons we're buying Cheminova is to get direct market access in Europe. Europe is a very challenging regulatory environment. Everybody knows that in the ag space. Having a suite of products that are different, have different modes of action, tend to be softer chemistries, will certainly help. And for sure, we will be training and building the biological space in Europe through Cheminova. Operator : Your next question is from Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Pierre, back in September, you talked about Cheminova EBIT for '15 around $145 million, synergies at $35 million and sort of $180 million in '15. I know it's difficult, given you haven't been able to peek into '15. But given your guidance, how does that compare to what you're thinking now in terms of timing and such? Pierre R. Brondeau: So Mike, yes, we haven't -- I mean, the numbers we looked at and when we discussed the information we had when we did the due diligence is still around the numbers you are talking about. I feel today fairly comfortable with the numbers they should be producing for 2015, knowing that if they have the same dynamic as we have, the biggest uncertainty should be Brazil, and Brazil is not as big of an exposure to them than it is to us. And Europe is looking pretty stable, as well as does India, which are very big regions for them. So I would tend to believe that the numbers we discussed for Cheminova should still be very valid. But once again, we are not entitled to look at them. So no reason to discount those numbers, but I don't have more proof than the already existing [ph]. Which will mean, even if those numbers are still valid, the calendarization is something which could vary very much year-on-year. If you look at historical data for Cheminova, they would make their numbers for Europe some time from early February to April, May, but it could happen any time, any month, you could have a big sale. So that is the question we have today. We could be very much in line overall for 12 months, but remember, maximum we'll get 10 months. And those 10 months could vary very much depending upon where those numbers fall in Europe between February, March and April. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then, given the slight delay in closing, is there any risk in the $35 million in synergy? Or is that something you still can get within this timeframe? Pierre R. Brondeau: So if you look at the delay, we are still in the range, going to push some -- it's going to push some. I think, as you can guess, the most difficult synergies are always the revenue synergies for which you need all of the time. It's always easier to accelerate cost synergies than revenue synergies, where you need to convince customers, understand better the product line. So it puts a little bit of a stress on those numbers. Now, if we close end of February, early March, we are okay. If it gets pushed, the more it gets pushed, the more difficult it is. So if -- as we have all the reasons in the world to expect a close in the first quarter, we'll be within the $35-million range. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then last one, when you think about '16, a lot more synergy pops in for Cheminova. And in terms of the growth for that business, in this current environment that you described this morning, is the growth that you hoped for back in September still doable in Cheminova x the synergies? Pierre R. Brondeau: Once again, I'm really sorry to talk like that. That's why I'm pretty anxious to get to the mid-April discussion, where we can really talk with knowledge about Cheminova. Once again, the way that we're looking at their growth rate until we close by September might be slightly impacted by some of the market trends, which seems to be a bit more muted than what we were thinking at that time. But by September, we really started to have a good idea. So I don't see much of a change from what their plans were and their growth. I think we have -- I can tell you the thing which is the most exciting for me is the growth synergy opportunities. I think we've only scratched the surface of that. So I'm still exactly in the same place around Cheminova. But frankly, I'm going to give you the full story, and Mark will tell you exactly where we are at the mid-April. It will be much more -- talking in a much more intelligent way once we've seen the data. But right now, I have no reason to change. Operator : Your next question is from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Look, I just wanted to say, congratulations on the big price tag for soda ash. Pierre R. Brondeau: Thank you. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : You made Ed's job a lot more difficult because he's stepping into a situation where he's got to deliver on much higher expectations now. Pierre R. Brondeau: Yes. Ed is very, very good, so he's afraid of nothing. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : I know that to be true. With that higher price tag, at least as expected, you guys had initially laid out back in September a $0.52 negative interest cost from Cheminova and -- but a $0.26 offset, so a negative $0.26 on the interest line. And Paul just mentioned that you're anticipating 2015 negative interest to be about $0.06. So materially better than the expectations back then. Can you talk about some of the factors behind that? Paul W. Graves: The numbers you just threw out don't sound familiar to me in terms of historical statement. But just to back into where we are today. Clearly, we have -- we were typically using net proceeds in most of our analysis. It was a couple of $100 million at least lower than what we actually achieved, so that's clearly a benefit to us. And in terms of the cost of incremental debt, we -- I think we talked about this in the last quarter as well. We put a facility in place that is in the region of just below 1.5% to 2% cost of debt. So we have a delta between the net proceeds for alkali and the proceeds that we'll be paying at the door of Cheminova of something in the region of about $600 million to $700 million, and that increment is going to be financed in that 1.5% to 2% range. So the math's actually pretty simple. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Great. And then, Pierre, you mentioned that a European customer is moving away from butylithium. Can you talk about that application and how concerned folks should be that perhaps that could be more widespread? Pierre R. Brondeau: No. It's a single customer who had a very specific formulation in the agricultural industry, which was not required to deal with new formulations. So it was -- I mean, it was good for us. It was a very large product. But frankly, that product has been reformulated without lithium. It was a unique product. No other competitors would be using it to that extent. So it's not a market trend. It's a single event. Unfortunate, but not completely surprising. Operator : Your next question is from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Three quick ones. In your outlook, are you including any drag to earnings for the reduction of working capital or the working capital discipline you flagged? And just to confirm that the FX is included in that range. And secondly, with the Roundup Plus extend program, is there a -- your Authority herbicides are being benchmarked as about a $3-per-acre discount or incentive. Are you paying that incentive, or does that get paid by Monsanto? Paul W. Graves: Let me do the first part and then Mark can do the second one. The impact of working capital credit extension, et cetera, as well as all FX assumptions, are all included in the segment guidance that we've given for you. So our assumptions are all included in that guidance. Mark A. Douglas: Laurence, it's Mark. For any of the programs that go with Monsanto in North America, we're obviously accountable for all the financial affairs. So if there are any discounts that are paid as part of the promotional programs, we're accountable for those. Operator : Your next question is from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : I'd like to switch gears a little bit and talk about the Health and Nutrition business. You mentioned a couple of items. The issues with the alginates as far as a shortage of seaweed in the product and higher price of raw material. Typically, you've been able to pass those higher pricing through fairly quickly. So why is in the first half of the year expectations for Health and Nutrition so much weaker on that issue? Pierre R. Brondeau: I think I'll ask Eric to complement the discussion. But one of the key issue we are facing in Health and Nutrition, which would reduce earnings in the first half or first quarter, is must be the lack availability of seaweed for our North Sea seaweed for our plant in Norway. We just had terrible weather, which has been preventing the collection and the full utilization of our assets. So we are ramping up right now. We are able now to get the product. But the biggest -- one of the biggest issue we've been facing is our ability to supply the market because of a lack of product. Eric, do you want to add some color to that? Eric W. Norris: No. I would say that in terms of alginate, there's not much more to add there. I mean, the high seas prevent ships from being on the water in a safe manner. So that has resulted in, from the latter part of December through a good part of January, the inability to harvest seaweed. And it is a short supply chain from the North Sea to our site in Norway. And as a result, there's an immediate impact on the availability of the product. We believe in the balance of the year, we'll be able to make that up. We've had a lot of productivity-based improvements in that plant that we expect going forward. But the caution is being able to make it up quickly in the first half of the year, Dmitry. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Okay, that's helpful. So it's a shortfall of supply, not so much the pressure on the cost from the higher pricing? Pierre R. Brondeau: That's correct. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Secondly, you mentioned that the dairy market in China or dairy beverage market in China is getting a little bit better versus the issues you've had earlier in the year, but still not expected to be back to the same levels it was prior to the issues. Have you be able to identify what those issues were? Why the demand dropped all of a sudden and why is it coming back? And what gives you some level of confidence to expect or not to expect improvements as the year unfolds over 2015 or '16? Pierre R. Brondeau: Yes. I think we understand better and better the situation. There is multiple factors which are coming at play, and it's why the recovery is on the slower side. First, there was all of this issue we talked about before on protein prices, which have been really decreasing the overall consumption in Asia, China or Indonesia for the peanut milk or some of the dairy-based product. So it has been, first, a slowdown in the market, which led many of our customers to have too much inventory and not needing to buy from us. That was one aspect, and we believe it was more of the main reason for the slowdown. But there is another market dynamic which is taking place and forcing us to look to adjust our portfolio. It's always the same. It's always a challenge, but it's also an opportunity. What we are seeing is there is different type of protein milk now, which are growing in this market following the success of peanut milk. So the usage of MCC, which was for us -- we are one of the pioneer in this application with our MCC product line to develop this market with our customers. The success has created now a new product, which are requiring different formulation, different applications for us. So there is an adjustment on the type of product, and we are in the middle of developing the product to participate in the growth of those new beverage. Those new product will also be supplied -- they are the same chemistry as the one we have for peanut milk. They will also be supplied from our current plant, and in the future, from a plant in Asia. But there is a shift in the market which could lead to new opportunities and new challenges. So all of that, the shifting elements, are creating a slow recovery for us, but it's not like we are back to a single beverage with the inventory down at the customers and we are growing back. So a bit more complex from a consumer standpoint. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the Q&A session. Mr. Brondeau, I'll turn it back to you for closing comments. Pierre R. Brondeau: Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody, for your time. We feel here, with our team, that this quarter are the final steps of our transformation. I want to recognize the value of and the strength of our management team for Alkali, and wish great luck to each of them and to Tronox, which really has acquired a tremendous business. But for us looking forward, those are the final steps in becoming a company with a more focused portfolio. 2015 will be a very important year to shape the new FMC, and I really look forward to tell you our story at our Investor Day in April. So thank you for your time. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the FMC Corporation Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

Phone lines will be placed on listen-only mode throughout the conference. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer period. I will now turn the conference call to Mr. Brian Angeli \u2013 excuse me, Vice President, Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Mr. Angeli, please go ahead. Brian P. Angeli - Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's second quarter earnings call. With me today is Pierre Brondeau, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, who will review our second quarter performance and business segment results, including an update on the integration of Cheminova, and discuss our outlook for the second half of 2015. Also, with me is Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will give an overview of select financial results. After the prepared remarks, we will be joined by Mark Douglas, President, FMC Agricultural Solutions; Eric Norris, Vice President and Global Business Director, FMC Health & Nutrition; and Tom Schneberger, Vice President and Global Business Director , FMC Lithium, to address your questions. Before we begin, let me remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including, but not limited to, those factors identified in our release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references and pro forma, revenue and segment earnings for FMC Agricultural Solutions. A reconciliation and definition of these terms, as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call, are provided on our website. Our 2015 Outlook Statement, which provides guidance for the full year and third quarter of 2015, can also be found on our website. I will now turn the call over to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. In my comments, I will refer to the Q2 2015 earnings presentation posted on the FMC Investor Relations website. We have not used slides for previous earnings calls, but we have taken this approach today in order to help explain our results more clearly as we transition through 2015. I will refer to each slide by slide number as I go. The second quarter of 2015 was perhaps the most significant quarter in the long history of FMC Corporation. We completed the sale of the Alkali business with Tronox and closed the acquisition of Cheminova. These transactions marked the completion of the transformation of FMC's portfolio to one focused on the Ag, Health and Nutrition markets. Following the close of the Cheminova transaction, we moved quickly to integrate Cheminova into FMC Ag Solutions. During this quarter, we took multiple actions that will drive strong future performance of FMC and allow us to deliver target synergies of $120 million ahead of 2015 (sic) [2017] (3:51). In particular, we successfully combined commercial organizations in key regions earlier than we had originally expected, which means we are well positioned to deliver the benefit of the acquisition more quickly than initially forecasted. These recent changes, however, make it more difficult to compare the reported performance of Ag Solutions and Cheminova to their prior year's performance as standalone businesses, even just a few months after closing. Consequently, we will focus on comparing performance of Ag Solutions including Cheminova to the pro forma results for prior period. The full year 2014 pro forma results were filed with the SEC on June 5. Pro forma results for the second quarter are included in the schedules of the quarterly earnings release issued yesterday. Before discussing FMC's earnings for the quarter, I will make a few general comments on two of the factors that have had a significant impact on FMC's reported results : the state of the global crop protection market and the impact of foreign exchange movements. The global crop protection market continues to face multiple headwinds that have created one of the most challenging operating environment of the past decade. Demand for crop protections products remains weak, due to the high channel inventories, poor planting conditions, low pest pressures and soft agricultural commodity prices. Through the first six months of 2015, on a U.S. dollar basis, we estimate the global crop protection market was down by double digit percent compared to the same period of 2014. Market conditions in Brazil are the most difficult. We estimate that through June the crop protection market in Brazil was down approximately 25% compared to last year, when measured in U.S. dollars. Declines in demand reflected in lower volume are compounded by the rapid depreciation of the Brazilian real, which makes it harder for local currency price lists to keep pace with exchange rate movements, resulting in lower revenues when converted into U.S. dollars. In addition to the real, all of our major currency exposures have weakened against the U.S. dollar, creating a significant headwind to reported revenue and earnings across each of our businesses. The negative impact of foreign exchange and the challenging crop protection market, particularly in Brazil, overshadowed otherwise strong operating performance across the FMC portfolio. During the call, I will highlight where unfavorable currency exchange fluctuations most impacted FMC's financial results. Turning to slide one, FMC reported $887 million in second quarter revenue, an increase of 12% over the same period last year. Adjusted operating profit was $159 million for the second quarter, a 5% decrease compared to last year, and we reported $0.70 in adjusted EPS, a decrease of 15% over the second quarter last year. The benefit of ongoing cost reduction programs and synergies related to the integration of Cheminova largely offset the impact of lower sales volume, higher interest expense and a higher tax rate in the quarter. However, price increases in local currencies were not enough to offset negative foreign currency fluctuation, which I will discuss in more detail in each segment. Turning to slide two and Ag Solutions. In order to provide greater clarity as well as to be consistent with how FMC is currently operating the combined businesses, I will discuss segment performance on a pro forma basis; that is, as though we owned Cheminova for the full quarter of 2014 and 2015. On this basis, revenue in the quarter was $684 million and segment earnings were $117 million, a decline of 23% and 30% respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2014. Foreign exchange had a significant negative impact on segment revenue and earnings in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange pro forma revenues declined 14%, while segment earnings increased 5% compared to the second quarter of 2014. Multiple factors contributed to this performance. First, let me focus on the regional crop protection markets; and in particular Brazil, the primary driver in the decline in sales volume compared to the second quarter of 2014. As I noted earlier, we believe the crop protection market in Brazil was down almost 25% through the first half of 2015. It is important to understand that this decline was not evenly spread across all product or crop segments. With respect to product segments, the volume decline was concentrated in insecticides. We estimate that insecticides, which we would typically expect to account for more than 40% of the market, through the first six months of the year were down 50% over this period, reflecting weak insect pressures and high channel inventories. Offsetting this decline was a 16% increase in the fungicide market, making fungicide the largest crop protection category in the first six months of the year. This mix shift was dramatic and unlikely to persist through the remainder of 2015. However it demonstrates how unusual the crop protection market in Brazil has been so far this year. Historically, insecticides have contributed the largest part of FMC's revenue in Brazil for the first half of the year, while fungicide is a segment where FMC was historically under-represented. The addition of Cheminova gives FMC a broader and more balanced product portfolio, and enhances our future fungicide offerings. In other countries in Latin America, we observed encouraging demand growth, particularly for selective herbicides in Argentina and niche crops in Colombia and Mexico. North America delivered another solid quarter. Demand for FMC's Authority brand herbicide was strong compared to the second quarter of 2014, driven by the continued increase in glyphosate-resistant acreage. In Europe, volumes were stable compared to last year, driven mainly by Cheminova sales in the region. We are very excited by the opportunities we see in Europe, as we move to sell through Cheminova's direct access model in most of Europe for the 2016 season. In Asia, we saw good results from newly launched product in China, specifically herbicides for wheat, and we saw further growth in Pakistan across the portfolio. Higher sales in these countries were partially offset by lower sales in Australia and Indonesia. Sales were also weaker in India, largely due to weak early monsoon season. Contributing to the decline in sales volume in the quarter, where specific actions FMC took related to the way the new Ag Solutions segment will operate. First, we initiated a process to sell our Brazilian subsidiary, Consagro. This subsidiary is primarily a distributor of third-party product to smaller customers in Brazil. Given the opportunities the Cheminova portfolio brings, Consagro and its business model no longer fits with FMC. Second, we reduced our investments in certain FMC fungicide in Brazil, electing instead to shift our commercial focus to the fungicides portfolio acquired with Cheminova, which we believe will be better suited to the crops and areas (14:06) that FMC targets. Third, we continue to reduce the level of third-party sales across all regions, in particular, reducing sales of lower margin products that are less valued by our customer. Lastly, and very importantly, given the underlying market conditions in Brazil, we have remained disciplined in our willingness to extend credit into the Brazilian market. We recognize this would reduce our revenue in the period, but the rising cost of hedging our local currency exposures given the ongoing rapid depreciation of the Brazilian real and the preference of growers to delay their purchasing decision led us to the conclusion that this is the right business decision for FMC. All these factors taken together had a significant impact on FMC's revenues and segment earnings in the second quarter, but leave FMC in a position to deliver stronger earnings growth and cash generation through the second half of 2015 and beyond. Given the environment in which we are operating today, we are intensely focused on the cost structure of Ag Solutions. In late 2014, we initiated a series of program intended to reduce costs across the segment. This program, combined with early cost synergies from Cheminova integration, helped to partially offset lower volume in the quarter. We will continue to implement these cost reduction programs while also driving the cost saving benefits of the Cheminova transaction as quickly as possible. We believe these actions will deliver increasing cost saving over the second half of 2015. Let me now provide you with an update on the Cheminova integration. On slide three, we have provided additional detail regarding the synergies we discussed during our May 11 Investor Day. To remind you, we are targeting $120 million in synergies by the end of 2017; $90 million in synergies will come from cost reduction, principally headcounts, with $30 million in synergies coming from various commercial opportunities. Immediately following the close of the Cheminova acquisition, we moved to begin integrating Cheminova and FMC. The integration is progressing well and gaining momentum, and the results achieved over the first 100 days reinforced our confidence in the ability of FMC Ag Solutions to deliver the targeted synergies of $120 million ahead of 2017. Our first priority was to combine and integrate the commercial organization across key regions. In North America and Brazil, and in other key countries in Latin America, we have already made changes to our sales organization and internal systems that allow us to approach the market as a single company. This was critical to deliver targeted synergies in the coming quarters, and I'm very pleased with the speed in which it was achieved. We also initiated our plan to sell FMC products through Cheminova, which for the first time will provide us with the direct market access across the majority of Europe for the 2016 season. As we integrate the commercial organization, we're also focused on reducing cost by streamlining the business and removing overlapping or redundant functions and capabilities. The majority of the near term cost savings are driven by head count reduction, and we expect more than 75% of all head count actions to be taken by the end of this year. Further cost synergies are expected from a number of different non-head programs, including supply chain efficiencies, procurement savings and closing surplus facilities. These specific synergies will begin to impact the result in 2016 and throughout 2017. On slide four, we have summarized our progress to-date to achieve the synergy targets. We are targeting net head count reductions of 500 to 550 position. Through the end of June, we had achieved approximately 65% of that target. As it relates to the other cost reduction synergies, we have so far identified over 150 procurement project, and by the end of June we had completed a quarter of them. We expect to identify and target additional procurement project in the future. Turning next to commercial synergies, sales and marketing organization has so far identified approximately 50 targeted growth programs; 60% of these programs have already been launched. Cost savings from our actions are coming in faster than initially planned, and we are pleased to see a number of recently launched commercial initiatives already gaining traction. As a result, we now expect 2015 earnings to benefit from synergies of $30 million to $40 million, up from our prior guidance of $25 million to $30 million. The impact of these actions will be seen in the second half of 2015 and will serve as a catalyst for future earnings growth for FMC Ag Solutions. As you might expect, we are finding many opportunities to realize additional synergies that we have not yet quantified. In the coming quarters, we will provide further updates on the progress to achieve our synergy targets and, to the extent possible, quantify the additional synergy opportunities. Moving on to Health and Nutrition on slide 5, the segment's underlying performance in the quarter was good; although, adverse currency movements led to flat revenue and segment earnings up by just 3% compared to last year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased 6% and segment earnings increased 8% compared to the second quarter of 2014. Prices remained stable across the portfolio. Sales were driven by continued volume growth in MCC-based product for the pharmaceutical and food end markets. Demand growth was strongest in the pharmaceutical industry, especially from multinational companies in Europe and generic producers in India. During the quarter, we were encouraged by increased demand for colloidal MCC product in both Asia and North America. In China, demand for colloidal MCC beverage application remains below peak level. However, volumes are now consistent with historical averages prior to the steep pullback in demand for colloidal MCC product in Asia that we saw in the latter part of 2014. Slightly offsetting these positive trends is continued weakness in nutraceutical product, specifically omega-3. While sales volume trends have improved, we have yet to see a meaningful rebound in what would bring omega-3 growth rate back to historical levels. We believe excess production capacity in the omega-3 market will continue to be a headwind for prices, at least for the foreseeable future. The operating performance of the Health and Nutrition segment continues to improve. We returned to normal level of seaweed supply in our alginate operations during the quarter, and manufacturing excellence programs are delivering higher yields in our Norway facility. As a result, we remain confident that by the end of the year we will be able to recover the earnings impact of the seaweed shortage through the first four months of 2015. Now turning to Lithium on slide six, reported revenue of $55 million decreased by 3% compared to last year and segment earnings of $5 million were 39% lower than the same quarter in 2014. Foreign currency, specifically the Argentine peso and the euro, continued to have a significant negative impact on Lithium reported results. Excluding impact of foreign currency, revenue increased 2% while segment earnings increased 17% compared to the prior quarter. The Lithium business continues to operate extremely well. During the second quarter, the business achieved record production rates at our carbonate operation in Argentina and at our hydroxide plant in U.S. We continue to see improved pricing for both products on the back of strong demand growth. The Lithium organization continues to focus on the specialty segments in the market, in particular, hydroxide, high purity metals and butyl (24:55). Given our technology strength and product expertise, as well as the market conditions for these segments, these are the areas with the greatest opportunities for growth for FMC. Turning to the outlook for Q3 and full year 2015, as we discussed, we remain cautious about the strength of the crop protection market compared to last year. The third quarter represents the start of the growing season in the southern hemisphere and, as a result, market condition in Brazil and Latin America will be the primary drivers of our performance in the third quarter and fourth quarter. Given the difficult market conditions currently seen in Brazil, there are higher than normal levels of uncertainly as to when growers will make purchasing decision, which could impact the timing of sales between the third quarter and fourth quarter. While this will not change our expectations for the second half of the year, it does make it difficult to estimate the balance between Q3 and Q4. Despite this environment and continued unfavorable foreign currency moves, we expect very strong earnings performance over the next six months driven by ongoing cost saving initiatives, acceleration of cost and revenue synergies from Cheminova and targeted growth programs. Once again, excellent progress to date on the integration underscores the strategic and operational benefit of the Cheminova acquisition to FMC and increases our confidence in Ag Solutions' ability to deliver strong earnings growth during the second half 2015. We expect full year Ag Solutions segment revenue to be within the range of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and full year segment earnings in the range of $510 million to $550 million. Over the next six months, we expect segment earnings of between $315 million to $340 million, an increase of approximately 40% compared to pro forma segment earnings in the second half of 2014. For the third quarter, we expect segment earnings to be in the range of $105 million to $125 million. Third quarter guidance is a wider range than previous year, reflecting the higher than normal uncertainty in the crop protection market; however, this does not impact our outlook for the future. In Health and Nutrition, we expect third quarter segment earnings to increase in the mid-single-digit percent over 2014, driven by continued demand for MCC in both pharma and nutrition end markets. For the full year, we are anticipating segment revenue down low single-digit percent, but segment earnings growth in the mid-single-digit percent over 2014 supported by ongoing operational improvements and targeted restructuring program within the segment. In Lithium, we continue to see strong demand and positive pricing trends for key product. As a result, we reiterate our expectation for third quarter segment earnings of $2 million to $4 million, and full year segment earnings of $15 million to $25 million. On a consolidated basis, we expect adjusted earnings to be between $3.00 and $3.30 per diluted share, a 3% decrease at the midpoint of the range compared to adjusted earnings per share for 2014. I will now turn the call over to Paul to cover financial highlights. Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Pierre, and good morning, everyone. So today, I'm going to focus on two main items : first, the impact of recent currency movements on FMC; and second, an update on how we're doing on our stated objective of increasing cash generated from operations. Starting with FX, Ag Solutions was hardest hit by currency movements, and the two currencies that drove most of this impact were the Brazilian real, which depreciated against the dollar by more than 40% compared to Q2 last year, and the euro, which depreciated by almost 20%. We were able to pass a proportion of this impact onto customers through higher prices, but the earnings impact of the shortfall between the price increases and the FX movements was still approximately $35 million. This was largely due to the rate at which the currencies moved, as the local currency price lists could not be amended quickly enough to keep pace with the exchange rate movements. In Health and Nutrition, the movement in the euro was the largest single impact; although this reduced revenues more than operating earnings, given our relatively large euro or euro-linked cost base. For Lithium, failure of the Argentine peso to depreciate at the same rate as local cost inflation was again the main driver, although the depreciation of the euro also contributed. Included in these numbers are the hedging costs we incur in our businesses, driven almost entirely by the cost of hedging Ag receivables in Brazil. As the base interest rate in Brazil has climbed in recent quarters, the cost to hedge a dollar of exposure has increased accordingly. Today the cost of hedging has increased by 30% per $1.00 of exposure generating almost $4 million of additional costs in Brazil alone for the second quarter, and an expected full year increase of over $10 million. This hedging cost is included in our segment earnings as an operating expense. Given the extreme volatility we see in the real, and indeed in other currencies, we will continue to hedge our exposures in order to reduce the potential for large swings in our earnings. However, we will seek to decrease our total hedging cost by reducing wherever possible our real-denominated sales, therefore reducing the need to hedge. We have undertaken a program to identify products or customers which at today's all-in costs don't make economic sense to continue to serve on the same terms. We do not expect this to result in a significant change to the way we conduct business in Brazil, but we will continue to exercise tighter discipline on what products we sell, to whom, and on what terms. In fact, this is one of the factors that contributed to our decision to reduce sales of third-party products to our customers. This brings me on to the second topic in cash generation. Slide seven highlights some of the underlying contributors to our cash flow. As you can see, for the first half of the year our adjusted cash from operations, which excludes all Cheminova, one-off M&A, and integration costs, was more than double last year at $189 million. Perhaps most importantly, our segment operating cash flow, which we define as EBITDA less or plus movements in working capital and before unallocated corporate costs, increased by 44% in the first half of the year despite a year-on-year decrease in EBITDA over this period. The driver of this improved cash generation is a decrease in the level of working capital in our businesses as a direct result of multiple programs initiated across FMC. Ag Solutions has focused on both inventory and receivables balances this year, with programs designed to ensure we are not making or buying products for resale before they're needed and that we are not selling product sooner than we need to, or to customers that carry an unacceptable credit risk. Health and Nutrition has also focused on its inventory, reducing levels by over 10% in the year as it uses ongoing manufacturing excellence programs to bring greater reliability to manufacturing operations, reducing the need to carry excess inventory to meet customer needs. Overall, we remain cautiously optimistic regarding our cash flow performance. We're seeing traction in all of our major focus areas, and we will continue to focus on improving our cash flow performance in the coming quarters. We've also continued to be disciplined in overall capital spending, which in the first-half of 2015 was 30% below the same period last year at $71 million. We expect total capital spending for this year to be in the range of $150 million to $175 million. Finally, a comment on our quarter ending net debt balance at just over $1.8 billion. I don't want anyone to get too excited by this number as we have a significant tax payment related to the alkali sale, which has not yet been made. This payment will be approximately $300 million over and above our ongoing tax payments and will be paid across the third and fourth quarters. The higher than normal cash balance we are carrying at quarter end is a function of these anticipated payments. Adjusting for this timing difference implies a net debt balance closer to $2.1 billion. Before I hand the call back to Pierre, just a clarification of the increase in interest expense for Q2 and the rest of the year. We saw a temporary increase of approximately $5 million in the quarter, which was caused by certain local debt facilities of Cheminova in India, Brazil and Argentina, which were incurring average annual interest rates in the mid-teens percent. Although these facilities were relatively small, they had a disproportionate impact on our interest expense in the quarter. The terms of those facilities, which reflect the non-investment grade status of Cheminova, did not allow us to immediately replace them with much lower cost to FMC borrowings. However, we have now replaced most of these facilities and we'll replace the remainder through the rest of 2015, bringing our interest expenses closer to more normal levels by the fourth quarter. With that, I will pass the call back to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Paul. To conclude, we are very pleased with the performance how the remainder of the year is shaping up. Our results from the second quarter were in line with our expectation. But for the unexpected temporary increase in interest expense in the quarter, our results would have been at the top of our guidance range. As for Ag Solutions business, we are highly focused on controlling what we can control. We are in a down cycle with currency challenges. We are actually more concerned about currency fluctuations than we are with the market, which is still in line with our views as stated at our Investor Day in May. The cycle will turn around, as it always does, and FMC will be ready with a strong portfolio and a proven business model. In the meantime, we are very confident that our strategy is staring to pay off. Our focus is to deliver earnings growth via the synergies from Cheminova, including revenue synergies and stringent cost control, regardless of where we are in the Ag cycle; and this starting in the second half of 2015. The integration of Cheminova is progressing faster than expected. Combined with our FMC portfolio and operated under the FMC business model, we will demonstrate in the coming quarters the potential of the new Ag Solutions business. We're also very confident that our earnings growth will accelerate rapidly into 2016. Our Health and Nutrition portfolio continues to demonstrate its qualities, specifically, its resilient earnings profile. The cost control and manufacturing excellence programs undertaken in 2015, combined with our technical strength and strong portfolio, will also see higher earnings growth as we enter 2016. The Lithium business strategy, to focus on downstream specialty product, is now in place and the business continues to operate well. I am very pleased with the progress we're making in our efforts to reduce capital invested in the business through tighter control of capital spending, multiple efforts focused on reducing our working capital and very tight cost control. With the business environment that we are operating in today, it is extremely important that we continue to prioritize cash flow and capital discipline in all areas. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : And we'll go to the line of John McNulty from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Matthew Freedman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. This is Matt Freedman on for John McNulty. I was wondering if you could please provide us some color on Ag Chem inventories in Brazil. What are the biggest overruns either by crop or type? Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions : Hi, this is Mark. The inventory situation in Brazil is pretty significant, as we've talked about since the end of last year. The inventory balances that we see in the channels are pretty much spread across nearly all segments. In Pierre's comments, he talked about the impact on insecticides with channel inventories. We see, also, significant channel inventories in herbicides and fungicides. Obviously, cotton is one area that we're exposed to and we see channel inventories there; we also see in soy and in corn. So in summary, for us, channel inventories are pretty widespread. Obviously, we're entering into the growing season and those channel inventories are weighing on growers' decisions of when to buy, which we've commented already, but it's pretty widespread right now. Matthew Freedman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. That's helpful. How big was the rationalization of third-party sales on the top-line? You indicated it was $15 million of earnings. Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions : Yeah, obviously, through third-party sales we make less margin. So it's less than you would normally see in terms of revenue, but in the $50 million \u2013 $30 million to $50 million range overall. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. I think it's a much higher number. Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions : That's the third-party, but that does not include Consagro \u2013 the Consagro entity. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Oh, yeah. Not including Consagro. Correct, Mark. Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions : Yeah. Matthew Freedman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got you. And then, lastly, if there was consolidation in the Ag market, would you say FMC is more likely a buyer or a seller of assets? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : In term of \u2013 you know, if you look at M&A, we've made our move. We have acquired Cheminova. We are integrating Cheminova. We believe that with that strategic move we now have a very solid geographical balance and very solid portfolio. So we are not a seller and we are not a buyer. We are very pleased with where we are right now and this is the way we intend to operate our business. Matthew Freedman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : My assumption is that if you were a seller of Ag, you're basically a seller of the company because that's what you guys are. You've done a great job of focusing the company there. Of course, we are \u2013 we've hit a little bit of an air pocket here on the Ag side, given the commentary. But, Pierre, I wanted to just take a moment and \u2013 the guidance for 2015 of $510 million to $550 million, at Investor Day you outlined, I think it was, $635 million to $685 million, which would be a 25% increase for 2016. Is it still feasible that you'd be able to increase your Ag earnings by 25% at the midpoint for next year? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, Frank. If you look at \u2013 first to your comment, yes, selling Ag would mean selling FMC, and we are not selling FMC. That's a true comment. Regarding the earnings for 2016, if you look at the speed at which we are increasing our synergies and the way they will impact 2016 with a full year benefit, I think the targets we have ahead of us for 2016, at this stage, are unchanged. We are not banking on any change in the Ag cycle for next year. We believe and we are still at the same place, our vision for \u2013 our view for the Ag market has not changed since Investor Day, which is it's going to be a rough second half of 2015. And 2016, we'll look at it as a bit similar as 2015 : no down, no up, about the same. Within those condition, targeted growth on key technologies plus revenue synergies plus cost synergies should still bring us to the same level we had forecasted for 2016. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right, terrific. That's very helpful. And clearly, with the acceleration of the synergies or the benefits on the Cheminova integration, that would be a positive now that you've owned the property for several months here. What about on the other side of the ledger? Have there been any \u2013 what other sort of positive surprises have you found in \u2013 or perhaps negative surprises have you found with the transaction? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think Cheminova is all we expected. It's really the company we wanted to buy. What I would say is that the biggest surprise is the easiness in which we are capable of integrating the two companies. And that's why we are seeing the revenue synergies and cost synergies coming that fast. The culture are matching, and there is no pushback from one company to the other. So when you look at places, Latin America, Brazil, Europe, we are operating truly as a single company, and that's why we are seeing this acceleration of synergies. There is no big issue we've uncovered. Actually there is none. So far it's as good, if not better, than what we were expecting. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. That's helpful (44:13). Thanks. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Frank. Operator : And your next question is from Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hi, guys. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Mike. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: When you think about the second half, just curious if you can \u2013 third quarter is going to be difficult for Ag, and then you have a big fourth quarter. I know Brazil tends to be stronger, but just could you frame up maybe what needs to happen to sort of hit that really strong fourth quarter for Ag Solutions? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Yes. Thanks for the question, because it's really an important second half for us because we've \u2013 the way we've been preparing the second half with the acceleration of synergies in the second quarter, I think it's when things start to come together. I know the numbers look big, but there is a solid logic behind those numbers. So if you think about year-on-year, what we've said is second half of 2015 will be about 40% up versus second half of 2014. Think about it that way. It's about $100 million of EBIT increase. Two big buckets : the $100 million EBIT increase in the second half of 2015 versus 2014 is about $70 million of cost control and cost synergies. And then, there is another bucket, I would call, of about $30 million of commercial benefit net of FX. So if I look at the commercial benefit, it's in a few categories. First, as you know \u2013 and we've been relying on it for many years now. We have a very strong herbicides portfolio and we are seeing growth and market share gain in the herbicide portfolio. We are seeing, as I said in my script, quick synergies, specifically in Brazil and Latin America, on fungicide. There is some specific pest pressure on cotton we are seeing in Brazil, which \u2013 from which we will benefit. So, all of those three, we believe, will be bringing the growth. Now we believe that would be less a \u2013 the impact of the lower insecticide demand for Latin America, mostly Brazil, and as I said before, less impact of FX. So think about that $17 million cost control, cost synergies, $30 million commercial benefit net of FX impact. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then, 2015 obviously a difficult year. What are your initial thoughts on \u2013 obviously, you're going to get a lot of integration and savings in 2016, but how would you help us think about how Ag Solutions could do in 2016; maybe is there a couple of scenarios, depending on what crop protection globally could potentially do as a market? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. It's \u2013 as I said in my closing comments, we are very, very highly focused on controlling what we can control. So our assumption today and the plans as we have defined \u2013 actually, if you look at the way we are looking at the market today, we are still exactly at the same place as we were at Investor Day in May. We see a very tough back end of 2015, and we see no improvement in 2016. Now, looking at what is in the channels, all indication we have is we should start to see products being flushed out of the channel by the beginning of 2017. That's what we're expecting to see the cycle ending. Under that, the focus will be on revenue synergies, cost synergies and cost control. And the numbers, the one Frank mentioned are the one we still believe we could achieve. Today, where we are, we believe our view of the markets is correct. That's what we're expecting. I can tell you that where we have the highest level of uncertainty, and there isn't much we can do about it, is around currency. I mean, the real is depreciating at incredible speed. We believe the euro has stabilized. Still very hard to know what's going to happen with the \u2013 in Argentina and what will happen with their currency. It could be positive. So, that's where we have the highest uncertainty. So right now, the scenario we have is about the same as the one we were outlining in Investor Day, potentially with harder currency situation which could be balanced by faster synergies coming into 2016. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. So in short, that sort of the range of the growth that you thought in 2016 you can get versus 2015 is still generally in the cards? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Correct. We have no reason to change. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Good morning, guys. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Dmitry. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Most of my questions have been answered, but \u2013 excuse me, just a couple of follow-ups, if I can. Can you repeat your CapEx guidance for the year? I'm sorry, I missed it. Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure; and it's in the outlook sheet. It's $150 million to $175 million for the full year. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. That's a significant reduction off of the rates you've been running at. Is that a sustainable level going forward or is this just one year, given that Cheminova is bringing a lot of capacity that you can do something with? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think it's very sustainable. That's our target. That is the number we are looking at going forward. Remember, today one of the big CapEx user was Health and Nutrition, and that business is very well capitalized for the years to come. So it will be Ag growth, and I can't wait to have to increased capacity for the Ag business, and Lithium, if we decide to increase capacity in lithium hydroxide; so much more focused capital spending. So $150 million to $170 (sic) [$175] (50:46) million is about the number we have to look forward for the years to come. Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Just bear in mind as well, Dmitry, that if you think about historical numbers, you're probably remembering numbers that had Alkali in there, too. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Yeah, you're right. So, then, you got about $100 million a year relief of CapEx from selling the Alkali business. Okay. The decline in Lithium operating profit sequentially, what \u2013 I mean, looking back, it doesn't seem to be a seasonal pattern to it. So what drove the sequential decline in operating profitability of Lithium? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You know, it's always \u2013 and I hate to get into those discussions because I hate when a leader of this business explained to me that way, but it's just the way accounting works. When you have \u2013 when you operate in Argentina, there is always operational difficulties and permits, and the way you focus your standard cost is very hard to do because you don't always have the permit or the surprise you have on the cost endpoint. The problem is you always get those negative impact in the time when the products are sold. So you capitalize your variances. So some of the earnings decrease you see are mostly linked to issues operating in Argentina which are due to previous quarters. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Got you. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It's just the way the GAAP accounting works. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you, Pierre. That's all the questions I had. Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thank you, Dmitry. Operator : And next, we go to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Good morning. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : I guess, two quick ones. First, can you \u2013 as you look at the market environment in Brazil, how severe would things need to get to change your working capital strategy? Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'm sorry. How 'what' would things need to get? Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : I guess, what flexibility do you have to change your working capital strategy if conditions \u2013 assuming that the tough conditions do spill over into 2016, what is your thinking about managing working capital days down there? Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's a great question. We've done, as you can imagine, an enormous amount of work and spend a lot of time focused on this. We \u2013 the whole industry operates on exactly the same terms. It is extremely difficult for any one of us down there, in my view, to individually change the terms on which we do business without having a significant and serious impact on the commercial operations down there. The most important factor that we're really focused on today is ensuring that we think very carefully about who we extend credit to, which products economically make sense to be sold on those terms. And that does change rapidly when you have interest rates of 15% and a real depreciating rapidly. And also thinking about credit risk, we think very carefully about credit risk, as you can imagine. And so, I don't think you will see a fundamental change in the terms of business, but I think discipline around who we sell to and when we sell to them is really the biggest tool that we have, and we've been very disciplined around that in the first half of the year. I think we'll continue to be disciplined, and our outlook assumes that discipline continues through the rest of the year. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : And then, secondly, can you give an update on your thinking around the biologicals partnership with Chr. Hansen, field trial data, what sort of products testing you're going to be doing next year? Any sort of updates that you have there? Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions : Yeah, Laurence, this is Mark. The alliance is going very well indeed. As we talked about at our Investor Day in May, we have seven really large projects that we're working on. The first of those projects is due to be launched at the end of this year and it's for North America, and it is a bio-stimulant that we will be using with some of our synthetic in-soil insecticides. Trials have gone very well. And that product will be coming to market on target. Following that, we have some seed treatments coming in in the 2016 timeframe, and then high value bio-fungicides, mainly for the fruit and veg and specialty niche crop markets. And then, following that are the more difficult areas, the bio-nematicides and the bio-insecticides, and they'll come through in the 2018 timeframe. But the collaboration goes very well; it's exactly what we thought it would be. We have a pipeline of products and, obviously, that pipeline is growing. So right now, we feel very confident about our BioSolutions platform. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investments. Please go ahead. Peter E. Butler - Glen Hill Investments : Hi. Good morning, good morning. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Peter. Peter E. Butler - Glen Hill Investments : Regarding your very important Ag program, there is a company called Origin Agritech in China who is talking about starting to sell corn seed technology, GMO technology, globally, outside of China, and it claims to have better and cheaper technology than Monsanto. Would something like this be of interest as a way to get into the GMO business, say, in a country like Brazil? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Peter, I think we are an Ag chemical company. That's what we do and that's what we do best. We believe it would be highly distractive for us and, truthfully, very expensive to try to be a competitor in the seed business. There is formidable companies in the seed business, like a Monsanto. We are very good at what we do and they are very good at what they do. So I think we're going to stay where we belong, which is really the Ag chemical segment. Peter E. Butler - Glen Hill Investments : How are you feeling about you're research productivity? Have there been any new developments? Are there any vibes coming from the laboratory on new stuff that you haven't talked about? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I'm going ask Mark to give you more detail, but from where I sit we are confirming everything we talked about in term of platforms at Investor Day. Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions : Yeah, Peter, this is Mark. Peter, I just talked about the BioSolutions platform that continues to grow, and you know at Investor Day I talked about the nine active ingredients we have in the pipeline. They are all on track. They're due \u2013 the first ones come in in 2015 and it goes all the way through into the early part of the next decade. We're not stopping there. We have a number of leads that we're following up in areas where we think we have gaps that we'll need to fill as we go into the next decade. But right now I can tell you that I really believe that the platform and the pipeline we have in Ag right now is probably the best we've had in a number of decades, and it will bear fruit as we go through into the end of this decade, early next decade. Peter E. Butler - Glen Hill Investments : Sounds good, thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian P. Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning and thanks for taking my questions today. Thanks again, also, for the slides. I think that helps separate out what was a pretty noisy quarter. But I was struck on slide two by the amount of the FX hit to the Ag segment and I can't recall FX being a major driver of the earnings, one way or the other, in the past. So just wondering if there has been a \u2013 and I realize currencies have moved a lot in the last year, but just wondering if there's been a change in the hedging policy or if there is some impact of hedges in here? And maybe on the flipside, would the impact have been any worse if you hadn't done some hedging activity or \u2013 I guess just trying to disaggregate the number there from what it would have been without any hedging activity? Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, no, if you think about it, Brian, there's two factors to bear in mind. We can only hedge at the prevailing rate, and the prevailing rate itself has moved year-on-year. And so, ultimately, without price movements on our real price list, we're always going to have that headwind simply because the forward rates as well as the spot rates are significantly different. So our hedging policy has not changed; the extent to which we hedge has not changed. The cost of that hedging has increased. So a significant portion in the quarter, I think it's about $4 million, increased year-on-year of hedging costs as a result of the real. A second factor is bringing in Cheminova. Cheminova has a big European business, and so we have a big euro exposure compared to last year that we historically would not have had. So we wouldn't have suffered in quite the same way, because our European business was so much smaller. They also have a sensible sized Brazilian business, so it's magnified the impact of those two. So, it's really those factors. It is really, though, the extent of the exposure to those two major currencies has increased and those two currencies have depreciated significantly, as you know. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Brian, the \u2013 it's unprecedented. I mean, it had an impact in the past, but, as Paul said, with hedging we're able to be more predictable. But when you have a 40% change over the real during a period of 12 month, and I think 20% for the euro, the speed at which it was impacting our results is never happened in the last five or 10 years. And then, consequently, the hedging cost is also becoming much higher. So it's just the magnitude of the problem which has changed with us being bigger and bigger in Latin America and Brazil. Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And just to give you just another data point, when we had our Investor Day in May, the forward rate for the real against the dollar was sort of 3.30-ish, and the most estimates about a 3.30, 3.35 end of year rate. We hit 3.47 yesterday. So it's moving in a way that's incredibly rapid and incredibly unpredictable. Brian P. Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, I think that explains it very well. Paul, I was wondering if you could also comment on any change in collection behavior you are seeing from your customers in Brazil as they come under some pressure either from the currency or weak Ag markets. Do you see any change in your ability to collect on receivables down there? Thanks. Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's an interesting dynamic down there. One of the beneficiaries of the depreciation of the real is essentially the Brazilian farmer because as the real depreciates, his real profitability is going up significantly. Unfortunately, he is getting paid too wait. He is getting paid to wait with selling his dollar currency commodities, and he is also getting paid to wait because of the pace of the depreciation. So, we are not having any real meaningful change in credit profile of our customer base. It remains an important core competence of ours to get out there and collect what is owed to us. Those conversations are no more easy today largely because of the inherent preference of a Brazilian farmer to not pay until he absolutely has to. So it's difficult. It's difficult to collect, but not because of credit reasons, but largely because it's just a battle to get out there and persuade the growers to pay us what they owe us. And that's true for everybody. Brian P. Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Our last question will be from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead. Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Pierre, I was wondering if you could talk to us about the omega-3. You have this new plant in the UK. The game plan was to go after pharma application as opposed to food application, but it doesn't look as though anything much is happening. Could you give us a feel for what is going on and what you expect in 2016, for example? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. I think omega-3 \u2013 I have to admit that our acquisition we did faced two significant problem. There was a slowdown in the market, whether it's pharmaceutical or nutraceutical, mostly nutraceutical, because of some comments \u2013 article which are public even if they were based on junk science, but it had a very big impact on the market; and the fact that it is a market when we came in there were three suppliers, and by now we have about 11 suppliers of omega-3; so a very strong over-capacity. So we are fighting two fronts right now. One front is price, as any market facing over-capacity would face; and a market where demand, even if it's coming back a bit, is still not back to historical level. Our focus for us, as you said, has never been the food industry, but I would say the big difference, even what you're seeing, it's more in pharma. I mean, our real focus is to penetrate strongly the high-end nutraceutical market. So the two markets where we should be playing are pharmaceutical and high-end nutraceutical. We are making some progress, but needless to say that it is not at the level that we were expecting when we made that acquisition. So right now we're focusing on multiple front : increasing our product offering in the nutraceutical, still participating in the pharmaceutical, and our team in Health and Nutrition is looking very, very strongly on cost and what are options to be even more competitive than we are today. Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Is that an area in which you need to be in order to gain customers, for example, by offering omega-3 as well as your other products, or you can dispose of it? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We could dispose of it without impacting \u2013 it's more like \u2013 if you think about it, we believe that we could penetrate the omega-3 market faster than others by using our relationship with nutraceutical companies and pharmaceutical \u2013 it is the case. I have to say that the larger product offering to a customer base we have is \u2013 our customers are happy we're in omega-3. We aren't as happy because the price is not where we would like it to be and the opportunities are not as strong as what we would like to be. So from a strategic standpoint, could we be out? Yes, we could be out. Is it time for us to get out? No, it is not time. I think we still have opportunities to participate in this market and see a return on our investment, but more challenging than what we were expecting. So we're going to keep on driving that business as well as we can through 2016. Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: That's very helpful. Thank you. And I was wondering if you could bring us up to date on the new MCC plant in Asia, and is it ready to offer products to your pharmaceutical customers or not, yet? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So MCC, as you heard in the script, it is becoming very tight. The growth has been strong. Health and Nutrition is looking at a strong back end of the year and on both side, which is the pharmaceutical part and the beverage food application for colloidal MCC. So we are at a place now that we have made \u2013 actually, we made that decision yesterday to go ahead. We're starting the plant. We are expecting the plant to open up in 2016 and we also have confirmed the decision we're very well advanced on the engineering side to do the pharmaceutical lines. So the plant will start up in 2016; if not, we're going to be too tight in capacity. I think we're going to get close next year to 95% capacity utilization. So, we're going to start up the plants in both MCC food and pharmaceutical. Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Thank you very much. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, I think I'll close the session. Thank you very much to all of you for joining and, as I said before, very critical second half for us where things are going to come together. So, talk to you again very soon. Thanks a lot. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the FMC Corporation second quarter 2015 earnings release conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Butler - Glen Hill Investment Research Brian P. Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Release Conference Call for FMC Corporation. Phone lines will be placed on listen-only mode throughout the conference. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer period. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Brian Angeli, Vice President-Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Mr. Angeli, you may begin. Brian P. Angeli - Vice President, Strategic Planning & Development, Investor Relations : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's third quarter earnings call. With me today is Pierre Brondeau, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Pierre will begin the call with a review of FMC's third quarter performance and business segment results and then discuss the outlook for Q4 2015 and comment on earnings drivers as we begin to look forward to 2016. Paul will provide an overview of select financial results. The slides accompanying today's call are available on our website and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available at the conclusion of the call. After the prepared remarks, we will be joined by Mark Douglas, President, FMC Agricultural Solutions; Eric Norris, President, FMC Health and Nutrition; and Tom Schneberger, Vice President and Global Business Director, FMC Lithium, to address your questions. Before we begin, let me remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including but not limited to those factors identified in our release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based on these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references, and pro forma revenue and segment earnings for FMC Agricultural Solutions. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call, are provided on our website. I will now turn the call over to Pierre to begin the presentation. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As with the last quarter, we have published a slide presentation that accompanies our results and I will refer to these slides as I discuss our results and the outlook for the rest of the year. The third quarter of 2015 was marked by significant foreign exchange headwinds, the effect of which were most pronounced in the result for Agricultural Solutions. However, excluding the impact for foreign currencies, the Ag Solution business performed in line with expectation, confirming the strength of FMC's portfolio and technology in a weak global ag market. Health and Nutrition delivered another solid quarter, continuing to benefit from commercial and operating initiatives implemented over the past 12 months. Lithium continued to see strong demand for its specialty products, including lithium hydroxide, butyllithium and high purity metals. You will see from our comment today that despite difficult market condition, each of our businesses is performing well with a notable exception of our Brazil Ag business. As I will discuss during the call, we are executing a comprehensive program to protect the profitability of our business in Brazil in the current market environment, and position the business to deliver earnings growth and higher returns in 2016 and 2017. Turning now to slide one, FMC reported $831 million in revenue in the third quarter, an increase of approximately 1.5% compared to the same period last year. Adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $95 million, a 37% decrease compared to last year. Adjusted EPS was $0.42 which was $0.42 (sic) [42%] (04:59) below the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted EPS for the third quarter was higher than our earlier guidance due to lower tax rate, which Paul will discuss in more detail shortly. The significant movement in foreign exchange rates compared to last year, especially in the real and the euro, was the main driver of the decline in FMC's earnings compared to the third quarter of 2014, as price increases in local currency were not enough to offset the impact of foreign currency devaluation on our reported results. In the third quarter alone, foreign exchange reduced FMC's reported adjusted operating profit by over $110 million. I will review the impact of FX in more detail when discussing the performance of each business. First, Ag Solutions, on slide two. Ag Solutions delivered revenue of $578 million and segment earnings of $59 million in the quarter, a decline of 32% and 49% respectively from the pro forma results in the same period of 2014. Price increases and cost reductions only partially offset the negative impact of foreign exchange and lower sales volumes. As noted in our October 12 press release, the rapid devaluation of the Brazilian real created significant headwinds for our business. During the third quarter of 2015 alone, the Brazilian real depreciated over 25% versus the U.S. dollar, reducing segment earnings by over $100 million compared to the third quarter of 2013. While we were successful in implementing significant price increases during the quarter in Brazil, this price increases only offset about half of the currency impact. Following the acquisition of Cheminova, FMC initiated a program to rationalize our global product offering and increase our focus on proprietary technology platforms and differentiated products. This portfolio rationalization, which was accelerated during the third quarter, reduced revenue in Brazil by approximately $120 million compared to the third quarter of 2014. Excluding these actions, sale volumes in Brazil declined only modestly compared to the third quarter of 2014 as demand in Brazil for FMC's differentiated products remains strong. We saw continued volume growth in FMC proprietary product offerings including sales of insecticides for cotton, fungicides for soybean and herbicides for sugarcane. In other countries in Latin America, we continue to see strong demand for FMC's product including selective herbicides in Argentina and products for non-row crop in Columbia and Mexico. Argentina remains an attractive market for FMC. However, obtaining import licenses for formulated products remain a challenge in the short term, reducing our ability to fully take advantage of strong demand for our product in the country. Outside Latin America, revenues declined mainly as a result of unfavorable currency effect, particularly the euro and lower volumes, largely as a result of weather, weak pest pressure or excess channel inventories. Due to our focus on cost control globally, earnings outside of Latin America were essentially flat with the same period in 2014. In the face of continued difficult market conditions, FMC aggressively reduced operating cost in the quarter. The cost savings achieved to-date will continue to increase throughout Q4 as we accelerate the integration of Cheminova and execute the restructuring of our Ag Solutions operations in Brazil, which I will now discuss on slide three. Through September, we estimate sales of crop protection chemicals in Brazil are down approximately 18% in U.S. dollar terms. For the full year, we estimate the market for crop protection chemicals in Brazil will be down mid-to-high-teens percent compared to 2014. Despite the significant decline in sales across the industry in Brazil, there is healthy demand from growers for technically differentiated higher value in use product to address specific pest and weed pressures. The acquisition of Cheminova has allowed FMC to rationalize its products offering and refocus the combined business in Brazil on FMC's and Cheminova's proprietary technology platform. We firmly believe these actions will position FMC to deliver higher growth and higher returns in Latin America in 2016 and beyond. Let me quantify for you the impact of these actions on our 2015 revenue. Pro forma for Cheminova, Ag Solution revenue in Brazil was approximately $1.2 billion in 2014. In 2015, FMC will eliminate some $250 million of low-margin third-party product sales. This includes action taken through the first six month of the year such as the previously announced sale of our generic subsidiary, Consagro as well as action taken in the second half of this year. Excluding this portfolio rationalization, FMC's sales volume in Brazil are expected to be down slightly compared to 2014, reflecting current market conditions. As I discussed earlier, foreign exchange will have a significant negative impact on the reported results for the year. Assuming stability in the current U.S. dollar / Brazilian real exchange rate through the end of the year, we expect price increases to recover about 40% of full year impact of foreign currency. Taking this impact into account, revenue in Brazil is expected be about $750 million in 2015. The successful execution of the ongoing portfolio rationalization will have three very important implications for FMC. First, it will enable the business to eliminate additional operating cost, which will protect the profitability of the business, during this downturn and position FMC to take advantage of a future market recovery. As I will discuss shortly, based on these actions currently underway, we expect to realize the meaningful reduction in operating cost in both 2016 and 2017. Second, these actions will allow us to generate higher operating margins and return in Brazil. We will eliminate sales of our lowest margin product and further enhance our focus on FMC's core technical portfolio in Brazil, including higher margin sulfentrazone, clomazone and malathion proprietary formulation. We will take this opportunity to reduce the capital employed in the business, leading to higher returns on capital, lower hedging and financing costs and stronger cash generation. Third, the step we have taken to reduce FMC's revenue base in Brazil, combined with a larger revenue base in all other region pro forma for Cheminova, will result in greater geographic balance over Ag Solutions business. As you can see in the chart on the right side of the slide, Latin America accounted for more than 50% of Ag Solution sales in 2014. In 2015, on a pro forma basis and including the actions I just described, sales in Latin America will account for just over (sic) [under] (14:55) 40% of Ag Solutions revenue. Brazil itself will account for less than 30% of Ag Solutions pro forma in 2015 compared to over 40% in 2014. Equally important, revenue distribution from North America, EMEA and Asia-Pacific is much more balanced. The mix shift in a regional mix will also contribute to higher overall segment earnings moving into 2016 as our two highest margin regions, North America and Europe, will contribute over 40% of Ag Solutions revenue. As you can see on slide four, the original cost reduction target announced as part of Cheminova synergies was $90 million. As a result of the actions we are taking in Brazil and with the reduction in certain corporate function, we expect global run rate cost savings of $140 million to $160 million. To be clear, this target is inclusive of $90 million in synergies related to integration of Cheminova, which we have discussed at length before today. Headcount reductions will be the single largest contributor to the incremental cost savings. FMC is now targeting total reduction of 800 positions to 850 positions. This compares to the 500 positions to 550 positions announced previously. The majority of the additional head count reduction will be in our Brazil operations. We are moving quickly to realize this cost savings and the majority of these actions needed to deliver these savings will be implemented in the next six months. We expect to realize approximately $35 million to $40 million in cost savings in 2015. These savings principally related to previously announced actions to integrate Cheminova into FMC. The additional benefit from the further cost reduction program will realized through 2016 and the first half of 2017 and we expect to deliver additional cost savings of between $50 million to $70 million in 2016. The success we have achieved to-date in delivering the prior synergy target and the pace at which we have commenced the most recent cost reduction program, give us a high degree of confidence that will deliver the $140 million to $160 million in run rate cost saving by the middle of 2017. Let me now turn to Health and Nutrition on slide five. Q3 was another strong quarter for FMC Health and Nutrition. Reported revenue declined 3% compared to the third quarter of 2014 as foreign exchange headwinds offset favorable volume and improved mix in the quarter. Excluding currency, revenue increased by 2% compared to Q3 2014. Segment earnings increased 7% compared to the third quarter of 2014 to $47 million in the quarter. The business saw continued strong volumes and realized improved mix in the quarter. The increase in sales volume was due to continued demand for growth for FMC's MCC-based products for the pharmaceutical market, especially for multinational companies in Europe and generic producers in India, and for food applications in both Asia and North America. The operating performance of the Health and Nutrition segment continue to benefit from ongoing manufacturing excellence program. Segment operating margins in the quarter increased 250 basis points over last year to 24%. We are pleased with the performance of the business to date and believe Health and Nutrition is well positioned to deliver continued earnings growth and higher returns going forward. Turning to Lithium, next on slide six. Reported revenue of $57 million decreased by 15% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Segment earnings of $1.8 million were $3.5 million lower than the same quarter last year. We continue to see increased demand for FMC's downstream specialty product. However, sales volume were down 13% compared to third quarter of 2014 due to lower third-party carbonate supply and the timing of a scheduled maintenance outage at our lithium hydroxide unit in Bessemer City. In 2015, we entered into a new agreement for a third-party to supply lithium carbonate to FMC. Volumes under this agreement will increase as we move through Q4 and will help feed our specialty businesses. Operating performance continues to improve. Our facility in Argentina continues to operate at record production rate. However, continued strong operating performance was not sufficient to offset the impact of lower sales volume and foreign currency. Last night, we published our outlook statement for the fourth quarter of 2015. I will take a few minutes now to briefly discuss the outlook for each of FMC's business segments on slide seven. We expect most of the headwinds that impacted Q3 results for Ag Solutions to persist through the end of the year. However, as we discussed on our second quarter call, a significant portion of the 2015 cost savings associated with integration of Cheminova will be realized in the fourth quarter. These cost savings, combined with additional price increases and ongoing portfolio rationalization, will largely offset the FX headwinds we are facing in Latin America. Outside of Latin America, we expect the business to be flat to 2014. As a result, we estimate Ag Solutions segment earnings to be in the range of $110 million to $130 million for Q4. For Health and Nutrition, fourth quarter segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $45 million to $47 million driven by continued demand for Health and Nutrition's MCC product line and lower operating costs as a result of ongoing manufacturing excellence program. For Lithium, fourth quarter segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $4 million to $6 million. We continue to see strong demand for our specialty products and expect sequentially higher carbonate and hydroxide volumes as well as higher selling prices. As we previously announced, price increases begin to take effect. While inflationary headwinds in Argentina are likely to continue, we expect they will be offset by lower manufacturing costs in the fourth quarter. After corporate costs, which we estimate to be around $20 million in Q4, adjusted EBIT will be between $140 and $160 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, a decline of approximately 8% from the fourth quarter 2014 at the midpoint of the range. Before I turn the call over to Paul, let me spend a few minutes discussing the outlook for 2016. While it is premature to give full year guidance, I do want to highlight some of the factors that will impact our 2016 performance. In Ag Solutions, there are a number of factors, which are largely in our control that will favorably impact 2016 segment earnings. These include the previously described incremental cost savings, a full year of earnings contribution from Cheminova, and lower operating costs in Brazil due to the benefit of a weaker real. We have a high degree of confidence in the impact of these three items which combined are expected to contribute north of $75 million to segment earnings in 2016. However, external factors, most notably market demand and currency, will have an impact on the reported results. We do not expect any improvement in market condition in 2016. In fact, based on what we see today, we expect global market demand for crop protection chemicals to be down next year. The extent of the decline will essentially depend on the level of channel inventory, not only in Brazil, but also in North America and Europe, assuming normal weather and pest pressures. While foreign currency headwinds appear to have moderated so far in Q4, macroeconomic and geopolitical event impacting foreign exchange rates in each of our key geographic regions continue to evolve. Assuming stability in foreign exchange rate in Brazil, we believe there will be opportunities to continue to recover pricing in that market. However, it will be difficult to quantify the benefit of any future price increases until we are well into 2016 and the next selling season in Brazil. We expect Health and Nutrition to deliver another year of solid earnings growth driven by higher volume and an improved cost position. In particular, we see continued strong demand for FMC's MCC and alginate product portfolio across both the pharmaceutical and nutrition market. As we have discussed throughout the year Health and Nutrition has successfully reduced its operating cost as a result of the ongoing implementation of manufacturing excellence initiatives across the business. These efforts will continue into next year and deliver incremental cost savings in 2016. Foreign currency, principally the euro, has negatively impacted reported results in the recent quarters. However, the potential impact of foreign exchange aside, we currently expect Health and Nutrition to deliver segment earnings growth of $10 million to $15 million in 2016. In our Lithium business, we expect to realize higher selling prices and continued mix improvement from our focus on specialty product, as well as the full year benefit of lower operating costs in 2016, which we estimate could increase segment earnings by approximately $10 million. We will enter 2016 with a strong pricing environment for lithium products. In September, our Lithium business announced price increases on all product lines. The majority of these price increases will be realized throughout 2016. Product mix will benefit from the third-party supply of lithium carbonate. The supply will supplement our own lithium carbonate production and feed our specialty businesses. In addition, we will realize the full year benefit from ongoing process improvement programs as well as the new natural gas pipeline, which began operation late in the third quarter this year. Inflation in Argentina has been a significant drag on Lithium earnings over the past few years. While the election of a new President in Argentina may bring a change in monetary policy and an eventual devaluation of the Argentine peso such actions are difficult to predict and may take time to unfold. Unallocated corporate costs are expected to decline by $15 million to $20 million, reflecting the benefit of the cost reduction actions discussed earlier. As you can see, there are a number of factors within our control that we believe will deliver earnings growth in each of our business in 2016. During FMC's Q4 2015 earnings call in February, we will provide more detailed guidance for the coming year. I will now turn the call over to Paul. Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Pierre. Before I discuss cash flow on slide nine, let me start by explaining the changes we made to the tax report in this quarter. As the schedules to our press release clearly explain, our adjusted tax rate is intended to reflect the underlying tax rate related to business operations. We have always looked to remove those items that are unrelated to the businesses in presenting our tax rate. However, one item that has been causing increased unpredictability in our reported rate is related to currency movements. For us, historically, that has meant the Argentine peso, the Norwegian krone and of course the Brazilian real. Simply put, we finance and operate our businesses in these countries in a currency that is different than the local currency, but are forced to re-measure certain financial assets and liabilities into local currencies for U.S. GAAP tax purposes. This re-measurement creates adjustments to our U.S. GAAP tax rate without any corresponding impact on our profits before tax. Historically, these items have been small and have not had a material impact on our reported tax rate. However, movements in the euro last year and the Brazilian real this year have created larger distortions to our tax rate than we have ever seen previously. To put this into context, if we had not made this change in presentation, our effective adjusted tax rate in the third quarter of 2015 would have been negative. Clearly, this would not have been a reflection of our true adjusted tax rate associated with our underlying business and would not have helped any of you understand our business performance any better. Looking forward, and with expectations of larger movements in the Argentine peso and continued volatility in the Brazilian reis, we do not expect this issue to go away. Consequently, we've decided to present our tax rate, such that it excludes these discrete re-measurement items. We have recalculated our tax rate under this method for each of the last six quarters and included the revised adjusted net income in our press release schedules. Let me now move to cash flow performance on slide nine. As you know, in the current environment, we have placed a significant focus on cash generation. We appreciate that the combined effects of the acquisition of Cheminova, the sale of Alkali and foreign currency movements make it more difficult to extract underlying cash flow performance from our financial statements this year. So I'll now walk you through the major components. Through the first nine months of 2015, our EBITDA is almost $100 million less than the same period last year. Despite this, when you look at operating cash flow generated from continuing operations, you can see that FMC generated double the cash flow in 2015 compared to the same period of 2014. Part of this improvement can be attributed to lower cash outlays in areas such as capital expenditure and taxes, allowing us to fully offset the temporarily higher interest expense and pension payments. We will continue to be very disciplined in capital spending and look to further optimize our tax position as we take advantage of the opportunities presented to us by Cheminova's footprint. However, the bulk of the improved operating cash flow performance has come from working capital. So far this year, total cash released from working capital across all three segments is approximately $75 million, the majority of which has been from Ag Solutions. While still well below what we're looking to achieve, it represents an improvement over the same period last year of over $300 million, a period when working capital continued to consume cash. This improvement can be largely tracked to lower levels of receivables and inventory. Ag Solutions has generated cash from receivables in all three quarters of 2015, something it only achieved in one quarter last year. And in two of the three quarters so far this year, that has seen a reduction in inventory compared to last year, when inventory actually increased in each of the first three quarters. We continue to focus on these two largest drivers of working capital and expect to see the year-on-year improvement in performance continue into the fourth quarter. We expect Ag Solutions to generate a modest positive cash flow from working capital, as higher receivables are largely offset by reduced inventory levels. Taken together, we forecast that our cash generated from working capital in 2015 will be almost $350 million better than 2014, which will more than offset the decline in EBITDA over the same period. This focus on cash flow is reflected in a strengthening balance sheet. Our quarter-end net debt was just under $2 billion, slightly better than our prior forecast. Our debt consists almost entirely of medium and long-term maturities with our only short-term maturities, namely our commercial paper balances, largely covered by cash on hand. Approximately 50% of our outstanding debt is fixed rate debt. We are expecting net debt to remain broadly flat at year-end. Out net debt to EBITDA ratio currently sits at just above 3 times, largely due to the lower than expected EBITDA. As our EBITDA improves and we continue to generate cash from working capital and exercise discipline in all areas of spending, we expect this ratio to improve rapidly as we progress through 2016. With that, I will hand the call back to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Paul. As you have heard, our Ag Solutions business faces a challenging market environment, but on the positive side, the issues we face are largely in Brazil and the impact of its currency. Ag Solutions performance in the current market environment reinforce the strength of FMC proprietary portfolio and technologies. We will continue to invest in our technology pipeline and in the value we bring to growers. Our Health and Nutrition and Lithium business will deliver solid performance this year and are positioned for a strong 2016. We are taking aggressive actions to protect our 2015 financial performance and position FMC to deliver earnings growth next year, in what we expect will continue to be a challenging ag market. We are very confident that the lower cost of operating post restructuring, our focus on the technical differentiated parts of FMC portfolio, the improved regional balance and our unique asset-light manufacturing model will position FMC Ag Solutions for a strong growth as soon as the market starts to turn. I want to thank you for your attention. And with this, I am going to turn the call back to the operator for questions. Operator, please. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura Securities. Please go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Could you discuss the credit terms that you extend to farmers in Brazil currently and how do they \u2013 how are they different from what you had earlier this year? Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions : Hi, Aleksey, this is Mark. The credit terms are not fundamentally different this year to any other year. You know very well, all the people that follow the ag space, that a lot of the terms are on crop terms and we currently have the same terms this year that we've had in the past. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you. And as a follow-up, can I ask a question on pricing? How do you see the opportunity in raising local prices in Brazil to offset the remaining 50%, 60% of FX headwinds? Could you do some of that in the fourth quarter or early in 2016? Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Price increase in Brazil is very much a factor of weather diary. So what we are saying is, if the real versus dollar is in a stable situation, we will, over time, recover a very large part of what we have lost in currency. Now, our ability to do it will go anywhere from six months to a year-and-a-half, two years, depending upon the market channel and the demand. What we have visibility for right now is the fourth quarter. So we believe in a stable currency environment, what we just said is, we'll recover about 40% of the currency impact in the fourth quarter. That's what we have put into the fourth quarter forecast and we believe it's highly achievable. The question mark for us and the most interesting conversation we will have in February, when we announce our Q4 results and forecast for 2016, is, is the real showing sign of stability where it is today and what is the market demand, because that's when the opportunity comes to increase price without suffering the negative impact of currency. So right now, focused on fourth quarter, we will recover about 40% and then filling up the gap will depend upon the stability we'll see in the real. Operator : And your next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yes. You've expressed some caution about the outlook for next year in crop chemicals globally because of channel inventories. Can you specifically discuss the level of channel inventories in Brazil as well as in the U.S.? Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions : Hi. Yeah. Don, it's Mark. I'll start with Brazil first. You've seen a lot in the press recently about channel inventories predominantly around insecticides and herbicides in Brazil. Insecticides due to weather and low pest pressure, so we see elevated channel there. In North America, it really depends on the types of products. Certainly, insecticides, we see higher channel inventories both for foliar and soil insecticides. We've had basically three years of very low pest pressure and so you could imagine, the channel inventories builds up there. For us, we had a very good year in North America with our pre herbicides, the Authority brands and we see normal to slightly higher channel inventories there. And then on fungicides, fungicides are pretty normal in North America. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : And as a follow-up, does the expansion of Intacta acreage this fall in Brazil have any impact on your soy insecticide business down there? Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions : Intacta has been in the market now \u2013 this is, I think, its third year. Obviously, the acreage is growing. It does impact the number of sprays for certain types of pests, and yes, we along with others are impacted there. But we have other products that take out the secondary pests. For instance, our TALISMAN insecticide is very good on stink bugs, which is a growing pest in soy area in Brazil. So we expect to see increase in usage of those types of products. So there are always pluses and minuses when you see these new traits introduced. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John McNulty from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John P. McNulty - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So we saw a pretty solid \u2013 or you guys saw a pretty solid jump that you articulated in the cash flow for 2015. I guess, do you have \u2013 can you give us some granularity if the Ag markets play out the way that right now you're expecting them to, what can we see in terms of further cash improvements in 2016? Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's Paul. Let me try and tackle that one. Most of the opportunities I'm sure you're aware are comes through our Brazil receivables balance and as we looked into next year and obviously we're not forecasting a rapid recovery in demand in Brazil, we would expect to see the trend that we've seen in the first three quarters of this year of releasing cash out of working capital continue. We've I think been pretty consistent when we've said that to unwind the positions that we have as the market slows down will take at least a full season, which takes you into sort of second quarter and third quarter of next year before we'll start to see the benefits. As I said, we've generated from working capital across the business something in the region of about $75 million of cash out of our working capital. I would expect that we could do much better than that, if the market continues as it is, because we will start to see an acceleration of the release in the Brazilian receivables balances. John P. McNulty - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, with regard to the head count reductions in Brazil, I mean Brazil has been one of the crown jewels and obviously it's a tough market right now, but it may not always be. I guess, how do you gauge or how do you set up a system where you don't end up kind of tarnishing permanently the crown jewel by cutting too deeply into the heads? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. It is a very important question. The work we did was really to preserve the ability of Brazil to grow and to grow earnings. So the way we did it, we didn't go at it by cutting costs and that's it. As you can see, our Brazil organization has evolved over the last two years into an organization which has used maybe a bit too much its position of strength with customers to increase sales in more generic product. Now, in normal times, with the real at that time pretty strong, it made more sense. We were making some profit out of it, but I can tell you, in a situation like the one we have today, the terms which are given to farmers, the weakness in the real do not allow us to have those kind of sales because they do not bring any profit to the company once all of the costs are removed, including the cost of hedging. So what we did? The first step we did was to remove sales, and we say, this year it's going to be about $250 million, to remove sales we had which were not profitable. Once you adjust to a size, where you pretty much have a country reaching sales about 60% of what it was before, then you can adjust your technical sales and, most importantly, support functions to serve a business, which is smaller but having the same type of profit and much higher margin. So that's the way we did it. We believe, we protected through this process our technology group, our research group, our technical sales but really eliminated all of the non-profitable sales and used that to reduce organization. We believe that we will be at least as capable of organization to benefit from growth in Brazil than we were before, if not better. Operator : Your next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, gentlemen. Hey, Paul, I really appreciated the discussion on working capital savings and noticed that inventory is down $100 million sequentially to a level of $900 million. A couple of questions. Where can you get that to? And then also on the discussion on the cost reductions, the increase to $140 million to $160 million. What is the expense associated and the pace of those expenses necessary to achieve those cost reduction targets? Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Let me pass over to Mark first to talk about inventory, because most of the opportunities in inventory are going to be in the Ag business. Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions : Yeah. As you could see, we have reduced inventories. And what we are doing is we're taking advantage of the Cheminova acquisition to look at the combined businesses and understand the flow of materials. We are essentially reducing the channel inventories within our own supply chain. So we're not putting customer supply at risk and we're tending to shift products away from formulating ahead of the season to formulating at the latest possible time. So we're carrying less formulated inventory, but we're carrying active ingredient inventory, which allows us to reduce the total amount but still have flexibility at the customer level. So it's been successful so far. We have more programs in place. I can't actually, Frank, give you a number for the reduction, but you will see it go down as we head into 2016 and probably through the first half of the year. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right, Frank, let me take your question on the cost to realize the synergy. The cost to realize the total $140 million to $160 million of synergy, which of course, includes all of the costs for the integration of Cheminova consulting costs. So it's not the cost which is only associated to the incremental part. The total costs for the $140 million to $160 million will be in the range of $120 million to $130 million. We have, of that cost, about $65 million were spent so far in the process. And most of the rest of the spending will take place in 2016 and a very large part in the first half of 2016. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Terrific. And coming back, Mark, on the Ag side, Pierre mentioned that there was a holdup in Argentina to receive some approvals. And I was wondering if you guys could give a little more color on that and what the order of magnitude opportunity that could present for you if and when you do get those approvals? Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions : Yeah. We have \u2013 Frank, we have ongoing business in Argentina and essentially what we do is, we currently import fully formulated materials into the country. The Argentine government has changed some of the rules where it's a little more difficult to get fully formulated products in. So we are looking at a strategy in Argentina where we will import the active ingredients and then formulate in Argentina itself. That should allow us more flexibility in terms of taking advantage of the market down there. For us, that market is pre herbicides for soy, a big market for us. We use our Authority brands based upon sulfentrazone. Currently, today, we are in the $80 million to $100 million of revenue range. We see that growing despite a difficult market. So it's significant for us. Getting the import licenses has been frankly a bit of a pain over the last year or so, but eventually, that will free up because the growers down there do need the technology to get the highest yields for especially the raw crops of soybeans. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Good morning. So two questions. One, as you look at the corporate cost reduction, what happens once you resume, you get back on a growth trajectory in 2017, 2018? Do you see that being a flat run rate or should it start growing in line with sales? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So the change we are making really is a very sustainable change. So \u2013 of course, there is always inflationary cost, but those are not cost reduction, which are temporary holding back on hiring people. Those are fundamental change in our processes, the way we operate, benefiting from the synergies of Cheminova, so those are permanent change which are to remain. The spending has to remain at the same level when we go back on a top line growth. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then just putting together all the factors you called out, it seems as if \u2013 just to be clear on the message \u2013 that there is a tailwind of about $150 million to $175 million for your EBITDA in 2016, but then you have your FX and the contraction in the crop section chemicals to offset, is there anything else in terms of possible tailwinds that you sort of see as a possible swing factor? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : The big tailwind \u2013 as you say, we released all of the numbers we see which we control and we feel very comfortable to deliver. Then, there is the question of growth synergies with Syngenta, we are very careful with \u2013 sorry, is it Syngenta \u2013 with Cheminova. We have a difficulty to really quantify that. We know it's happening, we know it's in line with our expectation. But the problem is when you are in a down market, to requantify growth synergies is always difficult. So there is growth synergies which we have not factored here. There is growth for a specific product where we have very strong market demand. And the last one which could be significant is price increase depending upon FX, but that's a difficult one to forecast, because if FX stays where it is today and there is a decent fourth quarter this year, which mean, even in the slightly down market, we will have opportunities to increase price in Brazil to recover the gap we have today. But if we continue to have a volatile real next year, we're going to be back in the situation which will be challenging. So, hopefully, by the time we get to the February call, we will know if we have full month or not of real stability and then we should be able to make a little bit better of a prediction around price. So it's a specific growth on the technical product, specific growth synergies with Cheminova and price would be a tailwind you could have in addition to what you see here. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : And then, probably, can you give any granularity around taking the Cheminova products and relaunching them in the U.S. progress estimate or when that should become a material call-out? Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions : Yeah, Lawrence. This is Mark. We are obviously in negotiations now for the 2016 season in North America and this will be the first time we've had the portfolio of Cheminova to sell to the major distributors and co-ops. We are focusing on the fungicide portfolio that Cheminova brought to us. They have some excellent products there that we've not had access to. So they will be put into our programs and then there are some other herbicides that Cheminova brought that we will also be putting into the program. So early stages as we are today but as we've always said, we believe that one of the reasons for the acquisition to be strategic in North America was our access to the major co-ops and distribution. We are taking advantage of that and we will be selling those fungicides and herbicides through that channel. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Peter Butler from Glen Hill Investments. Peter E. Butler - Glen Hill Investment Research : Good morning. Good morning. Pierre, if this was the third quarter 2016 conference call, obviously in late next year, what would you guys be hoping for to see in a relatively good case entering 2017? The odds on having a surprisingly good rebound in earnings in 2017? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, Peter, the way we are looking at where we are today \u2013 and I have to say that it feels like we are right now at a position of stability going forward for the company. I think we have infrastructure in place, the integration is well advanced, the cost savings are coming as we are expecting. So the first step for us, beside delivering on Q4, is really to position FMC for earning growth regarding of the market demand in 2016. That's why we started to try to give a sense for the earnings driver we control, which we expect to participate in the earnings growth for the company next year. Your question is the right one in terms of the market demand. In the third quarter or when we are talking about the third quarter results, if we see a situation which starts to unlock in Brazil and Latin America, it will be the definitive signal that the turn of the market is going to take place in 2017. If it is the case, then we are in a strong position because, by that time, integration will be finished and our cost structure will be very, very solid, will be lean. Without losing potential for growth, our portfolio technically will be strong and we have new product coming from technology in 2017, 2018, and 2019. So \u2013 but that's when you are going to get your first signal. If we see a Q3-Q4 very challenging in Brazil and Latin America, then we'll have to understand where is the channel in other countries because then you've to have to worry that's going to be slow recovery in 2017. We are still thinking right now all the indicators are pointing toward a 2017 recovery, but you are correct that third quarter call next year will be \u2013 we should have a better indication. Peter E. Butler - Glen Hill Investment Research : Okay. Thanks for the help, Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs. Brian P. Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. Pierre, there's been a lot of increasing chatter about the need for consolidation in the agricultural chemical space. And one of the larger companies in that space, last week, mentioned that every company is talking to each other in this environment. Just wondered if you could comment on that, if you're kind of having any discussions with folks and I guess given your balance sheet probably not in a position to do any acquiring, but do you see yourself as a target and would you entertain anyone in those discussions? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, there is no questions that there is lots of talk which are going on in the industry, which will most likely lead to some sort of consolidation. I think everybody is talking to everybody and everybody is watching what everybody else is doing. So right now it's like playing chess, everybody is making a move and waiting. Lots of discussion are taking place. How this is going to unfold? I don't think many people know it. I don't even know if anybody know, but certainly there is discussion which will lead to some consolidation. Where FMC stands in such a situation? First of all, we believe we are a strong company which can strive no matter what is the results for the company, but we will be doing good for our shareholders. So, what is right for shareholders, what is right for employees and what is right for our customer is what we will do, but we know we have a strong responsibility to all the shareholders. All I can tell you is the only thing I can tell you for sure is we are not an active buyer of a large company. I don't think today it would be reasonable. We made our move, we've acquired Cheminova. We believe we have a strong geographical footprint and we don't have the balance sheet to make a major acquisition. So, for us, we are in the execution phase. Now, if two companies get together and there is antitrust issues and they have to drop, sell some product or technology which are of interest to us, absolutely, we will look into buying those technologies, if they fit our portfolio, but that's about the limit of our productivity in term of being on the acquiring side. Brian P. Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Just one last one, if I could, on the \u2013 I appreciate the increased disclosure on the slides, with the Ag volumes showing them down 25% there, just wondered if you could break that out. How much of that was impacted by divestments? And then maybe if you could give some color regionally, if there are any pockets of strength within that number. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think if you look at the 20%, 25% reduction, it's a reduction about $215 million of sales for the business. There is two buckets to it \u2013 there is about \u2013 there is the third-party sales, which we walked away from in Brazil and that's about $120 million. And the rest are just volume we lost about $95 million across the world, which are much more linked to the market. If you look at the $44 million, I would say three quarters of that number is earnings loss, which are coming from the $95 million, more the market-driven losses, where maybe one fourth of the $10 million is linked to the $120 million of third-party sales we voluntarily walked away from. In general, most of the loss of sales took place in Latin America and mostly Brazil, overall, and especially because that's a place we've walked away from third-party. We also saw reduction of sales in other regions of the world. Channel inventories are pretty high in North America and in Europe. Remember, we also had the situation where we are going to direct model in Europe, so we're going to go. We have sales which are being moved from this year into next year. So overall, it's across the board. The big difference I'd say, which is very important is the sales loss outside of Brazil and Latin America are generating very little earnings loss. We believe our earnings are essentially flat outside of Brazil around the world. And then, for some reasons, we have much more leverage around large facilities, cost control in North America, in London, or in other places in Asia. So that's the overall picture. Brian P. Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the FMC Corporation third quarter 2015 earnings release conference call.",

[Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Brian Angeli, Vice President, Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Mr. Angeli, you may begin. Brian Angeli : Thank you. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today is Pierre Brondeau, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Pierre will begin the call with a review of FMC's fourth quarter and full-year performance and then discuss the outlook for 2016. Paul will provide an overview of select financial results. As we have done for each of the past two quarters, we have published a slide presentation that accompanies our results. This slide presentation, along with our earnings release and 2016 outlook statement, is available on our website. The prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available at the conclusion of the call. After the prepared remarks, we will be joined by Mark Douglas, President FMC Agricultural Solutions; Eric Norris, President FMC Health and Nutrition; and Tom Schneberger, Vice President and Global Business Director, FMC Lithium, to address your questions. Before we begin, let me remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including, but not limited to, those factors identified in our release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based on these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references and pro forma revenue and segment earnings for FMC Agricultural Solutions. A reconciliation and definition of these terms, as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call, are provided on our website. I will now turn the call over to Pierre. Pierre Brondeau : Thank you, Brian. Good morning, everyone. 2015 marked the completion of FMC's transformation to a technology-driven specialty company with leading market positions across agriculture, nutrition, pharmaceutical and specialty Lithium applications. In Ag Solutions, the acquisition of Cheminova strengthened our technology pipeline, brought great regional balance, broadened our market access and expanded our portfolio. The integration of Cheminova continues to go well. Our success to date reinforces our confidence in achieving the run rate cost savings of $140 million to $160 million by the middle of 2017. The acquisition and integration of Cheminova, combined with the actions we have taken to restructure ag solutions operations in Brazil, have positioned FMC to better address current market conditions. In Health and Nutrition, we focused on driving higher margins by capturing high-value commercial opportunities across our portfolio and by implementation of manufacturing excellence program and process technology improvements. And in Lithium, we continued to execute on a strategy of growing FMC's differentiated downstream specialty business to take advantage of favorable and market demand. 2015, however, was also a year marked by significant foreign exchange headwinds and difficult conditions across the global agricultural market. We took decisive actions throughout the year to address these challenges, accelerating the integration of Cheminova, restructuring our Ag Solutions operations in Brazil, exercising discipline on pricing and aggressively controlling costs across the Company. As we enter 2016, we remain focused on the continued execution of a strategy to drive improved performance. Despite challenging macroeconomic and ag market conditions, we believe the actions we have taken will enable FMC to deliver higher earnings growth across each of our business in 2016. I will provide further details regarding our 2016 outlook shortly. But, first, I will review our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 performance. Starting with FMC's full-year results on slide 1. FMC reported revenue of approximately $3.3 billion in 2015, roughly flat to reported revenue for 2014 and adjusted EPS of $2.47, a decline of 22% compared to last year. For the fourth quarter, FMC reported revenue of $899 million, an increase of approximately 1% compared to the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per share for Q4 were $0.77, 9% below the fourth quarter of 2014. Turning to Ag Solutions on slide 2. For the fourth quarter, Ag Solutions delivered revenue of $657 million and segment earnings of $101 million, a decline of 23% and 8% respectively from the pro forma results for the same period of 2014. The negative impact of foreign exchange and lower sales volume more than offset price increase and lower operating costs in the quarter. About 75% of the decline in sales volume during the fourth quarter was the result of actions to eliminate lower margin third-party product sales. Excluding these sales, volume declined by less than 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 as we continue to see demand for FMC's proprietary product across all regions. In Europe, we saw healthy demand as mild weather conditions allowed for late application of serial herbicides. During the fourth quarter, we were pleased to record our first direct sales of FMC product into Western Europe as we transitioned to direct market access provided by the Cheminov acquisition. Across the Americas, however, market conditions were significantly more challenging. In North America, consecutive years with low pest pressure have resulted in elevated channel inventory levels. Compounding the channel inventory issues is the deterioration in farmer income levels in the U.S. resulting in a more cautious mindset of distributors and growers. While we continue to see strong support for customers for appropriatery products, we expect challenging market conditions to proceed through 2016. In Brazil, we saw improving conditions in certain crop markets, including sugar cane and cotton as well as niche crops such as coffee and citrus. However, channel inventories, especially in insecticide and unfavorable weather conditions negatively impacted sales volume. As we have discussed previously, we expect channel inventory to remain elevated through 2016. In the rest of Latin America, we continued to see strong demand for FMC's product, including three emergent herbicides in Argentina and products for niche crops in Colombia and Mexico. Sales in Argentina, however, continues to be impacted by delay in receiving import licenses for formulated products. In Asia, weather conditions in India, Pakistan, Australia and parts of Southeast Asia related to reduced demand in higher channel inventories. The negative impact of foreign exchange was the single-largest driver of the 2015 performance. In the quarter, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar reduced Ag Solutions' segment earnings by about $60 million compared to last year. However, the combination of price increases and cost reductions more than offset the negative impact of foreign change. In Brazil, we continued to implement significant price increases [indiscernible] U.S. dollar-based pricing in that country. These price increases recovered more than 70% of the currency impact on segment earnings in the fourth quarter. In addition, FMC continued to aggressively reduce operating costs through the faster integration of Cheminova and further restructuring of Ag Solutions' operations in Brazil. Other results. And despite the challenging demand environment, segment earnings margin improved by 250 basis points to 15.4% in the quarter. I will provide further details regarding cost savings activities shortly. But first I will comment on the full-year performance for Ag Solutions. As shown on slide 3, Ag Solutions reported revenue of $2.6 billion for 2015 compared to pro forma revenue of $3.4 billion for 2014, a decline of 23% as lower sales volume and foreign exchange headwinds more than offset price increases during the year. Lower sales volumes accounted for about 16% of the decline in revenue. However, more than half of this volume decline is the result of actions we took throughout the year to eliminate lower margin, third-party product sales. Excluding these, sales volumes declined about 7% compared to 2014. In 2015, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar resulted in FX headwind of about $300 million, erasing over 50% of Ag Solutions' pro forma 2014 segment earnings. To be clear, this reduced reported sales by about $380 million and lowered our reported costs by about $80 million. We offset about 60% of the currency impact on sales in Brazil by raising prices throughout the year and we expect to continue to offset future FX impacts in Brazil through price increases. Early in the year we began to aggressively reduce operating costs. For the full year, operating costs were lowered by about $100 million. This include savings from the Cheminova integration, lower spending on discretionary items and lower energy and raw material costs. Despite the challenging market conditions in 2015, we continued to invest in innovation and the [indiscernible] technology pipeline of new synthetic and biological active ingredients. Products introduced in 2015 were well-received by the market and we expect further traction from new product introductions in 2016. I will now turn to the 2016 cost savings we expect to realize from the Cheminova integration and related actions. As you can see on slide 4, in 2015 FMC realized about $40 million in cost savings as a direct result of the Cheminova integration and the restructuring of operations in Brazil. For 2016 we expect to deliver additional cost savings over 2015 between $60 million and $70 million, reflecting the full-year benefit of previously announced head count reduction and savings associated with various procurements and SAR cost reduction programs. As discussed during our third quarter earnings call, FMC targeted total headcount reductions of 800 to 850 positions. As of December 31st, 2015, over 700 positions have been eliminated and we expect to implement the remaining reductions during the second half of 2016. The success we have achieved to date in delivering the head count reduction plus the further cost reduction initiatives currently underway gives us a high degree of confidence that we will deliver the 2016 cost savings target and achieve the $140 million to $160 million in run rate cost saving by the middle of 2017. Turning now to Health and Nutrition on slide 5. Q4 represented another quarter of solid earnings performance. As a result, the business delivered its 11th consecutive year of report earnings in 2015. Health and Nutrition reported revenue of $172 million, a decline of 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, mainly due to lower sales volume and the weaker euro. We sold over NCC banner in [indiscernible] and sales in the quarter, partially offset by higher sales of NCC-based product for food application and increased sales of omega-3 for the neutrasurgical market. Segment earnings for Health and Nutrition increased 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 to $46 million. Lower operating costs more than offset the negative impact of lower sales volume. The benefits of ongoing manufacturing excellence and process technology improvements increased segments earnings margin in the quarter to 26.9%, an increase of almost 400 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. As a result of the actions taken over the past year, Health and Nutrition is well-positioned to deliver continued earnings growth in 2016. Turning next to Lithium on slide 6. Lithium delivered a strong quarter. Revenue of $17 million was up slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 as higher prices were partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The fourth quarter of 2015 represents the fourth consecutive quarter in which FMC realized higher pricing in the Lithium business as demand growth across end markets application coupled with tight supply, supported price increases, especially for FMC's carbamate and hydroxide products. Sales volumes were essentially flat to last year as higher volumes for FMC's butyllithium and specialty organics were offset by lower volumes resulting from scheduled maintenance downtime in our hydroxide unit and less third-party supply of carbamate. Demand for FMC's downstream specialty Lithium products remained strong. Hydroxide sales volume were up significantly on a full-year basis as demand for energy storage applications continued to grow at double-digit rates and as we continued to increase through foods from our existing assets. Segment earnings increased 42% to $11 million in the quarter. The combination of higher pricing, improved sales mix and lower operating costs more than offset the impact of FX on FMC's reported results, pushing segment earnings margin to 15.9%, an increase of 450 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Now moving on to our 2016 outlook on slide 7. Last night we published our outlook statement for the first quarter and full year 2016. I will take a few minutes now to briefly discuss the outlook for each of FMC's business segments. In Ag Solutions, full-year segment revenue is expected to be approximately $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion and full-year segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $380 million to $420 million with first quarter segment earnings in the range of $70 million to $90 million. I will discuss ag in more detail in a moment. In Health and Nutrition, we're anticipating full-year segment revenue of $775 million to $825 million. We continue to see stable low to mid-single digits given growth in the majority of our end markets. Segment revenue growth is expected to be slightly below these levels, as we do not expect certain omega-3 sales to the pharmaceutical API market made during the first quarter of 2015 to happen in 2016. Excluding these sales, we expect underlying sales growth in the mid-single-digit range, driven by increased demand for health accidience and nutriceutical ingredients across emerging markets. Health and Nutrition segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $198 million to $280 million in 2016. The business made significant strides to improve its cost structure and operating efficiency over the past 12 months. We expect to drive further margin expansion in 2016 which would allow Health and Nutrition to grow earnings accordingly. We expect these efforts to drive further margin expansion in 2016 which will allow Health and Nutrition to grow earnings accordingly. We expect first quarter earnings for Health and Nutrition to be in the range of $46 million to $51 million. We have little senarity in these segment earnings for Health and Nutrition. However, as I mentioned previously, we do not expect certain omega-3 sales from the first quarter of 2015 to recur this year. As a result, reported first quarter segment earnings will be lower compared to 2015. In Lithium, we see strong demand and a favorable pricing environment. We will continue to accumulize our sales mix to drive higher volume of FMC's downstream specialty products. As we enter 2016, FMC is sold out across most products. Higher pricing, improved mix and lower operating costs will drive earning growth in 2016. In addition, the reduction in operating costs as a result of the devaluation of the Argentine peso will provide a tailwind for segment earnings over the next 12 to 18 months. For the full year, we expect Lithium segment revenue to be between $240 million and $260 million and segment earnings to be in the range of $33 million and $43 million. We expect first quarter segment earnings of $8 million to $12 million. On a consolidated basis, we expect FMC's 2016 adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.50 and $2.80. We expect first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings to be in between $0.48 and $0.60 per share. I will now discuss the outlook for Ag Solutions business in more detail, starting with a few comments regarding the market on slide 8. In Europe, we expect our key markets to be broadly flat compared to last year, although we expect to see higher growth across Eastern Europe. In North America, we expect the challenging market conditions will continue in 2016, given elevated channel inventory levels and projected lower farm incomes. As a result, we expect the market in North America to be down in 2016. Across Asia, we expect the market to be mixed depending on the countries. However, overall, we expect the region to be up slightly in 2016, assuming more normal past pressures and weather conditions. Turning to Latin America, market conditions in Argentina, Mexico and Colombia are expected to remain favorable with growth in weed-resistant acres and increasing acreage for these crops. We expect the market in Brazil to be down again in 2016. Channel inventory levels are expected to remain elevated in 2016. However, we expect to see an improvement in market fundamentals for sugar cane and cotton. While the factors impacting market growth vary across growing regions, we're broadly seeing a more crucial approach to processing decision throughout the value chain as a result of the protracted downturn in the ag cycle. Based on the factors I just described, we expect the global crop protection chemical market to decline by a mid to high single-digit percentage in 2016 on a U.S. dollar basis. However, it is important to remember that its factors are [indiscernible] unique and will change through the year. In particular, changes in planting this season and past pressures and, of course, weather conditions will significantly impact demand over the course of a growing season. We will get more clarity on these external factors as the year progresses and we will update our views on market condition as some of these uncertainties become clear. Turning next to slide 9 where we summarize the critical earnings driver for 2016. The number of factors will contribute to the year-over-year increasing Ag Solutions segment earnings. First we expect a positive $20 million impact from the full year of Cheminova. Next we're targeting incremental cost saving of $90 million, including $60 million to $70 million from Cheminova-related synergies. Third, we expect that our pricing actions in Brazil and overall mix improvement will contribute approximately $90 million. New product introductions scheduled for 2016 and revenue synergies in Europe and North America from the Cheminova acquisition will positively impact our mix and volumes for the year. Continued FX headwinds, the broader market decline and our decision to exit certain low-margin, third-party product sales will partially offset the incremental earnings from the items I just described. In Health and Nutrition, higher sales of excipient and nutritional products in emerging market and the full-year benefit of continued operational improvement are expected to deliver approximately $8 million in earnings growth. Lithium is expected to contribute about $15 million to growth in earnings in 2016, driven primarily from higher pricing, improved mix and lower operating costs. I will now turn the call over to Paul who will discuss corporate expenses, the impact of foreign currencies and cash flow. Paul Graves : Thanks, Pierre. Let me start with the income statement. Our corporate expense line represents those centrally-held expenses that are not charged back to the businesses. 2015 came in lower than 2014 for the full year, as we saw various items such as insurance expenses, pension charges, year-end LIFO adjustments to inventory and those incidental FX-related expenses all coming in below last year. We do not expect these to repeat in 2016 leading to our guidance for the corporate expense line of $70 million to $80 million. Looking at the tax rate, our full-year rate benefited from two drivers, relative to our previous expectations. First, various legislative items passed at the end of the year primarily related to R&D deductions, resulted in a reduction in our overall rate. Second, the geographic mix of our earnings changed away from the U.S. and Brazil and towards Europe and Asia. Since the latter regions typically have lower tax rates than the U.S. and Brazil, our overall tax rate benefited. Together these two items lowered our full-year 2015 tax rate by approximately 300 basis points. Looking forward, we expect our adjusted tax rates to be in the 24% to 26% range. I would like to spend a few moments on slide 10 revisiting the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our business during the year. As Pierre has already described, our 2015 performance faced a significant challenge from the impact of the strengthening dollar in our earnings. Across all of FMC and before any pricing actions, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar would have reduced our 2014 operating earnings by approximately $310 million. Of this reduction, approximately $293 million would have directly impacted agricultural solutions. On slide 10 you can see the drivers of this hit to the Ag Solutions segment earnings. The cumulative effect of weakening lower currencies on revenue was approximately $380 million, of which the Brazilian real was easily the largest, followed by the euro. Offsetting this revenue impact was the positive affect on our local cost base, again, mainly the real and euro or euro-linked currencies which reduced our costs in U.S. dollar terms by $85 million. Our response to this was to raise prices. Pierre has already noted that for the full year in 2015 these price increases offset approximately 60% of the currency impact in Brazil. This was possible in large part because market practice in Brazil is to price in real but to do so relative to U.S. dollar impacts. In the rest of the world pricing is generally not dollar indexed, creating a bigger challenge to raising prices, especially when market conditions are soft. In aggregate, globally, we recovered more than half of the $293 million earnings headwind through raising prices. Looking into 2016, we expect the FX headwind to be more modest than in 2015. The forecast countermoves in major currency such as the euro are far smaller in 2016 than we saw a year ago and while there remains uncertainty around both Asian and Eastern European currencies, movements in these currencies have a far smaller impact on our profitability. The key region that drives the guidance regarding both currency and pricing, as Pierre just described on slide 9, is Brazil. First of all, our guidance assumes that there will be a less volatile depreciation of the real with no rapid devaluation right in the middle of the key selling period as we saw in Q32015. Although we're not expecting stronger market conditions in Brazil, our guidance also assumes that local price actions already in place plus additional price increases which will be introduced later in the year to reflect the actual depreciation of the real would largely offset the forecast year-over-year impact of currency depreciation Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow on slide 11, our year-end net debt was approximately $2.1 billion with a small increase over the Q3 net debt being entirely to the final tax payment related to the alkali sale. The fourth quarter is typically a flat to negative operating cash flow quarter for us, given the seasonality of sales in Brazil. However, strong performance in Health and Nutrition and Lithium as well as continued cost and capital spending controls ensured that we kept our net cash outflows to a minimum. For the full year, our adjusted cash from operations, adjusted to remove the one-up impact of Cheminova and alkali-related items, saw a 16% increase over 2014, despite a declining EBITDA of around $100 million. We benefited from a positive year-on-year swing from working capital as all businesses improved their working capital performance compared to 2014. Our cost control programs included cash spending discipline. We saw lower cash outflows for capital expenditures which was one-third lower than in 2014, offset by slightly higher restructure in spending. In addition, our cash taxes related to ongoing operations were significantly lower than 2014, reflecting lower profitability in both the U.S. and Brazil. Looking into 2016, we expect a continued improvement in cash generation performance. In aggregate, we expect adjusted cash from operations to increase by approximately 25% in 2016, driven by higher earnings, continued working capital improvements and lower restructuring spending offset by higher cash taxes. With that, I will turn the call back to Pierre. Pierre Brondeau : Thank you, Paul. Despite the ag industry uncertainty, we believe that our 2016 plan is very achievable. It relies more on things we control than on expectations of positive external events. We expect to deliver earnings growth in all businesses in 2016 and will continue to position FMC firmly on the path of growth by leveraging the Company's unique business model that has defined our success. FMC remains a technology-driven Company with low-cost asset life operation, a unique high return on the model for active ingredients innovation and strong regional formulation capabilities. I want to thank you for your attention and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities. Frank Mitsch : Your view, stepping back a second, obviously you guys working hard on the ag side, but we're dealing with these macro pressures that we continue to hear more and more about and obviously the inventory situation is a bit worse. So if you think about over the next couple of years, how ultimately do you think the cycle plays out and what needs to happen for things to really start to improve from a macro standpoint? Pierre Brondeau : Yes. From a cycle standpoint, I have to say that we're highly focused right now on 2016. And the way we look at it today, as I said in my prepared remarks, is that we have a situation which is a little bit easier and more balanced in Europe and Asia and for that matter in Latin America outside of Brazil, but we have certainly still significant inventory level in Brazil and in North America. Actually, North America for us is as much of a concern as Brazil is. So we're highly focused on executing our strategy in a market we believe will be down mid single to high single digits in 2016. There is still the possibility of a cycle turn in 2017, but you have to see how 2016 will go. It is highly dependent upon how the industry behave, making sure that we don't oversell, don't push sell and there is a normal weather and pest pressure. That is going to be very critical. Any additional negative weather from an ag industry standpoint or no pest pressure would lead to resulting less [indiscernible] inventory. So 2016 will be a difficult year and as we go into 2016, we should be able to see if 2017 remain the year where you will have a turn of the cycle. Mark, I don't know if you have any additional comments? Mark Douglas : No. I think the only thing I would add is we're keeping a close watch on stock-to-use ratios which shows very clearly where supply and demand is. We're seeing some change in key crops for us such as sugar cane, as sugar prices go up, as supply is reduced in the last few years. Those are the type of things we look for to sense any changes in our key markets, but I think everything else you said, Pierre, is very valid. Frank Mitsch : Okay. From an FMC standpoint, obviously dealing with this, you guys have done a great job with the price increases and getting ahead of offsetting the pressures you're feeling. You alluded to more this year. Could you help me understand the timing of it? And ultimately is 70% of our recovery the right number to think about or does it go higher or lower from here? Pierre Brondeau : Well, I think when we look at 2016, as we said, we're going to pretty much cover with price increase the FX impact for two reasons. First of all, because we expect the FX impact to be less than in 2016 than it was in 2015. Remember, the biggest problem in 2015 was the high volatility and rapid devaluation of the real in the third quarter. That was unprecedented, more than actually the overall devaluation of the real. So we're not expecting that situation. In a less impact situation from currency, the price increase we need going into 2016 is less than the last year because a big part is a recovery of currency issues from price increase which are already in place. So I would say we're entering 2016 with about 60% of the price actions already in place to recover the currency impact and the rest is to happen during the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Mike Sison : Pierre, I was wondering if you could -- there was a time when you thought, for 2016, maybe [indiscernible] earnings for ag could be in the mid-$600 million and clearly a lot has changed since then. Foreign currency has taken a big hit. But if you could bridge the gap or maybe talk about $400 million 2016 and where the opportunity is, what's the earnings power of Ag Solutions over time? Pierre Brondeau : See, I don't think from a business strength standpoint anything has changed for FMC. I believe we remain one of the lowest cost manufacturer of active ingredients and maybe the most flexible one with our asset-like model. We believe our technology strategy is even better today than it used to be and our formulation strength has not changed. So it is right now the earnings potential of FMC Ag Solutions has not changed. The problem is we're in a situation where demand is very low, decisions from the growers are pushed to the last minute and in currency situation which has been, as you can see, the biggest problem. So 2016 is going to be focused for us on earnings growth. There isn't much we can do around volume demand. We're also going to be highly, highly disciplined. We're not -- I can tell you one thing, we have not done that in 2015 and we're going to stick with that strategy in 2016, we're not going to run after market share. We're working our way from low-profit sales and we're increasing price to recover the currency impact. That should position us, as soon as the cycle turn, to a very strong performance. So to expect the business going into the mid- to high-teens growth as soon as the market turn around, I have no doubt about it. The model is still intact. Right now it is inventory and I would say our worries are mostly placed in North America and Brazil. Mike Sison : And then your forecast for 2016 looks for volumes to be down, a couple percent, the minus 50 there in terms of the impact for earnings -- oh, maybe that's an earnings impact. But it does sound like if the markets are down mid to high single digits, you're going to do better than that. And just wanted to get a better understanding why or why you feel that your volumes will be better than the market being down as it is? Pierre Brondeau : No. I think if you look at our overall performance from the business from a revenue standpoint, we're going to be about in line with the market if you remove the impact of third-party sales. So really, think about our business from a volume standpoint, we're going to be in line with the markets. So if it's a mid to high single-digit, call it a 7%, pure volume driven by market demand, that's where we're forecasting a\\our performance. Now, our decline in sales are going to be higher because we're -- and I'm talking volume here, okay -- because we're working away still from third party -- the run rate at which we close 2015 is leading to a number which is higher than 2015 because we started this process during the year. And I think it's about an incremental $100 million of third-party sales. We're working our way in 2016 which make our performance from a revenue standpoint a bit worse than market. So two things, we market from a demand standpoint. For us third-party sales, $100 million, work our way. Where we're going to outperform the market, as we show in one of the slide, I think it's slide 9, the one where we have the earnings driver, is because of the work we've done around integration, around the cost and also two drivers of growth which are synergies from Cheminova and also the new product introduction. Let me finish. Let me maybe be more precise in the quantification. If you think about our sales, we're going to be declining, just look at about three big buckets. Sales driven by market decline about $150 million to $200 million. That's the market demand. Think about third party, we're working our way with no profit implication about $100 million and think about growth which would be coming from synergies and new technology, from $50 million to $100 million. Those are the three big bucket of our revenue drivers in 2016. Operator : We'll now go to your next question which is from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Chris Parkinson : Can you give us a quick update on anything incremental on your potential across Europe, specifically on the back of Cheminova? You mentioned some nice data points in fungicides, but how are you thinking about your now integrated aggregated portfolio? And then also, just in the near term, quick question, do you believe the mild winter will benefit insecticide sales during the first half? Thank you. Mark Douglas : Talking about Europe, we talked a lot about the direct market access and where the growth is going to come from. We're already seeing that, as Pierre alluded to in the earlier part of this call. We're seeing now our -- primarily our herbicides from FMC getting pushed through the Cheminova pipeline. So we've gone direct in the UK now and we're also expanding into Spain. So we're seeing that geographic growth for herbicides that we wanted. Obviously we're introduced new fungicides across the region. So everything we thought of in Europe is coming true. The country managers, the sales force from Cheminova have embraced the portfolio from FMC and are now gearing up to put those products into the marketplace. So from my perspective, Europe is exactly where we thought it would be and, obviously, is going to be growth for us going forward. To the second part of your question on the insecticides, obviously we've had, especially in North America, probably three years of extremely low pest pressures across the U.S.. One could say that a warm winter would allow the pests to come back, but, frankly, we don't know. We're not forecasting a strong pest season. We tend to forecast an average season and see where that takes us, but we'll know more about that as we get into the end of Q1 and Q2, we'll get a better feel for that. Chris Parkinson : And then just also very quickly in Argentina, is most of the potential here for your herbicide portfolio? And do you have any kind of new or preliminary plans or initiatives for southern [indiscernible] in particular? And if so, how are you balancing that long term potential with FX credit volatility, length of terms, et cetera? Thank you. Mark Douglas : Argentina has been a good market for us despite some difficult conditions in getting import licenses. Our predominant market down there is preherbicides for soy. We're a market leader. With the Cheminova acquisition, we bring along more fungicides and insecticides that we can put through the channel. We're actually doing a couple of things to expand our presence in Argentina at the moment. First of all, is the consolidation of our market access with Cheminova. And then secondly, we're looking at expanding our supply chain in Argentina to more reflect what we do around the rest of the world in terms of toll manufacturing. We're actually going to be importing more active ingredients and formulating in country. That helps us two ways. First of all, it allows us to formulate products for Argentina on the ground, gives us more flexibility. And, secondly, it helps with our cost base which is in local currency. So we do see Argentina growing. It has been a good market for us over the last couple of years and we think our portfolio is ideally suited to where they're going. We're seeing weed-resistant acres continue to increase just like we do in the U.S.. So I'm very bullish on Argentina. Operator : Your next question comes from Daniel Jester with Citi. Daniel Jester : Maybe just another one on pricing in Ag Solutions. I think you talked about the linkage between the real and the U.S. dollar in Brazil and your ability to get pricing. But can you talk about how that is evolving in other parts of the world which has had other FX challenges? And, specifically, are you seeing the competition also raise prices as aggressively as you or do you think there's a risk that you're getting maybe a little ahead of the market, given how challenging the macro conditions are? Pierre Brondeau : I think the ability to increase price is very different in places like Brazil where the local pricing in real is indexed to a dollar currency and there is a mechanism, usually which is in place now. It always ends up being a negotiation. And I believe, yes, we have been the most aggressive at increasing price because we believe our portfolio can afford that and also believe that today predicting the profitability of the business is critical, especially when the cycle will turn because the cycle will turn and we believe we will be in a much stronger position that time. It is more difficult to increase pricing in location like Europe or even Asia where there is no indexation on the currency on the dollar because there is purely a supply/demand and negotiations. So I would say most of our pricing recovery comes from Brazil rather than other region. And, yes, you are correct, I don't think we're ahead of the market because, as you can see, we only partially recovered the currency negative impact with price increase, but, yes, we were -- and we believe it's the right strategy -- the most aggressive on that front. Daniel Jester : And then maybe just quickly on Lithium, you talked about $15 million of incremental growth in profit next year from price mix, lower manufacturing. There's a lot of moving parts in the Lithium story today and certainly given the environment in Argentina, so maybe just a little bit more color on what's driving that profit outlook? And then also any change in your willingness to do incremental investments in your Lithium capabilities in Argentina, given what's happened politically over the last couple of months? Thanks. Pierre Brondeau : Sure. So the $15 million of earnings increase we're forecasting is driven by multiple factors. First of all, you know that we've been working very hard at fixing our operational issues and I think we're there. Most of our plant -- there are issue somewhere, but most of our plant are operating much better than they used to. And also the currency, the peso in Argentina, has been helping us from a cost standpoint and is going to be a tailwind in 2016. Additionally, there is the price and mix. We have a very strong product line and technology for ethiomydroxide. We're one of the critical and leading supplier and that market is increased in a tight supply situation which allow us to right price the product. So all in all, pricing, mix, better operation and currency will be the driver in 2016. Around capacity, I think capacity decisions will be in line with our strategy. First of all, we're working very hard at debottle making our plants, especially lithiumhydroxide, to make sure we can supply our customers with the growth they need. From a capital investment standpoint, we believe our key competitors today have made decisions to increase lithium carbonates in a significant way, so we do not believe volume of lithium carbonate from FMC will be required to serve the market. There will be plenty of products and we will be able to have supply agreements on lithium carbonate from other companies. So we do not believe -- even with an improving situation in Argentina, we do not believe we need, going into 2017, to increase capacity in lithium carbonate -- keep [indiscernible] the plant. Where we're looking at capital spending to improve our sales is in the downstream specialty business in mosten [ph] lithium hydroxide. This is where most of the capital spending will go in the next two or three years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire : Pierre, I was hoping you could comment on some of the consolidation that's been happening in the space lately. We've seen two pretty large deals announced in the last, call it, three or four months. Just kind of wondering competitively, if you see that having any positive or negative impact on you or if consolidation could support a better pricing or competitively do you see the guys around you getting a little bit stronger? Pierre Brondeau : Sure. Let me talk about the two deals. First of all, the one is Dow and DuPont. The consolidation of these two companies together will certainly create a very strong company with a very solid seed and chemicals portfolio, but honestly, this is two years away. You first need to have the time to get the approval from Dow and DuPont to merge as a single company. And once that is done, they need to do integration and then from integration they need to break up the company as they said into three companies and merge together the two ag business. So I believe it's an interesting decision which creates a very good company, but their impact on the market or the competitive landscape is still a couple of years away, so not a short term concern for us. The SYNGENTA Cheminova -- [indiscernible] ChemChina, sorry, the SYNGENTA ChemChina, my view is that it doesn't change much to the competitive landscape because if I understand well, through what I've read and what I've heard, SYNGENTA will be operating as a stand-alone company and instead of being a publicly-traded company, they will have a single shareowner which is ChemChina. So earnest ChemChina has a very fundamental push, a very fundamentally different strategy which, I don't think so, into SYNGENTA, we would be facing the same type of competition that we've been facing in the past. So my point of view at this stage, it's pretty much no change to the landscape for the next couple of years and we'll see what will happen two years down the road. Brian Maguire : One more if I could, just on the cadence of the ag guidance through the year. I think, historically, 1Q has been the strongest quarter for per segment earnings and I know Cheminova changes the profile a little bit, but the outlook for 2016 looks like it'll be one of the -- or at least a below-average quarter if not the weakest quarter through the year. Just kind of wondering if you could help us understand why things will pick up sequentially from kind of a weaker 1Q and what needs to happen for that to play out? Pierre Brondeau : Our belief is this year is going to be a bit different from what we've seen in the past for a very specific reason. As I said in the prepared remarks, we believe that North America market has maybe a higher level of inventory than it used to have in the previous years and consequently the decisions to purchase or fear the growers or distributory inventory, are going to be made at the last minute. So we're going to have sales in North America much more spread over a Q1, Q2 and Q3 period than we used to have where people would really buy very strongly in advance in the fourth quarter. So the fact that we have a different profile in the first half of the year is purely due to North America and North America being an important region for us from an earnings standpoint. That's why it's spread in a more balanced way the earnings over the year. It is more that than the Cheminova impact. I remind you that Cheminova is very small. It's very small in North America. Operator : Your next question is from Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray. Brett Wong : Just wondering, you talked about this elevated inventory that you're expecting through 2016. Can you just talk about what's going to improve that as we look out over the next couple of years? Pierre Brondeau : Yes. I think what we're looking at is the demand, the demand does not vary in our field in an enormous way. I think what will be resolving the issue is there is growth in demand, 2% or 3% every year, usually to resolve the end-market demand. And then start to use ratio should be decreasing in the next two years. We should start to show an increase in the commodity prices, together with the fact that today all of the ag chem companies, as you've seen in their performance, are selling less. So if you look, there is much more product on the ground, product which are put on the ground and product which are sold by the chemical industry into the market and that differential is what is decreasing the level of inventory. You just need strong weather or strong pest pressure combined with more product on the ground than the industry is selling and you could see a turn in 2017. But we're not operating under the assumption that it will be any turn in 2016. I think that's where we're focused and we're not assuming anything. Brett Wong : Just a quick one, in Brazil, wondering if the early dry conditions impacted any fungicide application in the early part of the season? Mark Douglas : Yes, obviously dry conditions do not help fungicide use. We've seen a lot of variable conditions in Brazil. Fungicides for us is a smaller part of our portfolio, so we've not really been impacted that much. But you've got to balance that with other parts of Brazil have been very wet. So you're going to get good pressure there. So I'm not so sure that fungicides will be off a significant amount in Brazil. Operator : Your next question is from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Unidentified Analyst : This is [indiscernible] on for Don. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about your outlook of the impact of the extended approval on authority volumes? And as a follow-5up, the impact of Intacta on Brazilian soil insecticide volumes in 2015 and your outlook in 2016 as Intacta acreage doubles. Thank you. Mark Douglas : Taking the first one, obviously extent is an important platform. We don't expect much impact in 2016, obviously given where we're, but we do see that as a growth aspect for us in 2017 and 2018 and going into 2019. So it's something we've invested a lot of time and effort in. We're a market leader in the preherbicide section in North America, so, yes, we do see that as a positive for us going forward. With Intacta, Intacta has had a lot of success in Brazil, obviously affects certain types of insecticides and not others. I think we've all been affected by lower spray amounts in Brazil. I expect that to continue. But we're seeing different types of pest pressure coming into Brazil. Certainly the piercing pests such as stink bugs, we're seeing much more activity in that area. So you've got a different mix going on in insecticides, but overall Intacta has definitely reduced the amount of sprays. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Unidentified Analyst : This is Ian for Steve Byrne. Thanks for taking my question. Just following up on some of the inventory issues, how much did FMC sell into North America in this fourth quarter? And what is the logic behind that if inventory levels are high? Pierre Brondeau : We don't break up the sales by quarter by region, but the inventory, we believe, North America actually has been less talked about from an inventory level compared to Brazil because Brazil was -- had an overwhelming impact because it was combining high inventory level and currencies. So when you put those two together, you have the dramatic situation from a business performance we've heard about. Obviously North America doesn't have the piece which is the currency impact, so we've thought less about it, but we've come quickly to realize that purely from an inventory standpoint, about the same phenomenon we have seen in Brazil is happening in North America. Commodity prices being low, growers were very cautious in term of planting decisions and purchasing decision, as their colleague were in Brazil. The crop protection industry kept on selling product and there was a point where there was more product going into the channel than product going on the ground and that creates, as in Brazil, a very elevated situation. Additionally insect pressure was not great in the previous year which has been creating even more of a problem. So all of that has been compiling the situation which, for us from an inventory and supply-chain standpoint, is very close to what we see in Brazil less the currency effect. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then just one follow-up on the Cheminova synergies from sales, moving some of that FMC product through Cheminova's distribution, is that because FMC already has existing registrations in all these countries? And what is the outlook for further growth as we move forward in time either from active ingredients or for the registrations? Mark Douglas : Yes. I mean, a lot of the countries where Cheminova have market access that we didn't, predominantly in Europe and parts of Asia, we actually had registrations already, so it allows us to move forward pretty quickly. That's the reason we got synergies in 2015 to be pretty quickly off the bat. And in 2016 as well. So from a registration standpoint we think we're well-placed. And then you ally that to the fact that our innovation platform is still obviously delivering on our formulation capabilities, we probably have somewhere close to 60 products we're launching around the world in 2016. Obviously you don't get a tremendous amount of revenue in the first year of a launch of a formulated product, but it goes to show that what we're doing on a formulation standpoint is continuing through these times in the ag space. We believe that innovation is going to be super critical for us as we go forward, so you see the growth not only from the synergies of FMC and Cheminova coming together, but the launch of new products as well into the marketplace. Operator : Your next question is from Dimitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Dmitry Silversteyn : Most of my questions have been answered, but I have just a couple of follow-ups. First of all, what sort of debt level do you expect to have by the end of 2016? In other words, you talked about cash generation, how much of that is going to be deployed toward debt reduction? Paul Graves : I think we've been pretty clear where we want to get our leverage down to which is the mid 2 to 3 times range. We're not there right now. So until we get to that point, whether that's through expansion EBITDA or pay down in debt, you should assume surplus cash is going to be deployed in that direction. Dmitry Silversteyn : Okay. So what about the free cash that calculates for you for the year, I'm safe in assuming that it's going to go towards debt paid out? Paul Graves : Today that's the safest assumption to make, yes. Dmitry Silversteyn : And then looking at the first quarter guidance for the ag business, it looks like at the midpoint it's basically flat year over year versus last year, despite the fact that you're going to have Cheminova profitability that you didn't have last year. So is the offset to the acquisition benefit and the cost savings you are realizing from that, the deterioration of North America market, is that going to be really that bad in the first quarter? Is that basically the takeaway? Pierre Brondeau : Yes. I think it's the right way to look at it. I might not call that a deterioration, but the lack of improvement of the ag market in North America and maybe a pushing of the decision to [indiscernible] in the third quarter. But that's the right way to look at it which is the overall spread of business over three quarters and the lack of growth -- not growth, we believe the business will be down in North America year on year are raising the benefit from the Cheminova first quarter. Dmitry Silversteyn : Okay, Pierre. Maybe I can say this differently and see if it still makes sense. The sales that you typically get over the first couple of quarters of the year in North America and the European markets, you would expect those sales to basically occur over a three quarter period, but in terms of aggregate, you're not looking for a significantly down demand year in 2016 versus 2015? It's just that it's -- demand is going to be spread over three quarters versus two? Pierre Brondeau : If you look at -- yes, part of your statement is correct, there is more of a spread over three quarters, that is correct. There is also, as I said, a market we expect to be down in North America. So we're expecting the market in North America to be down 5% to 10%, that would be a range. The two biggest down markets, that will be Brazil and North America. So you combine a spread of disune in [indiscernible] over three quarters together with a down market in North America, not in Europe, in North America of mid-single digit, that is what create the situation. Dmitry Silversteyn : Okay. And if I can look forward to the second quarter, I know you guys can't provide guidance for it, but if I remember correctly, most of Cheminova's European sales are set up to take place in April and maybe early May which you sort of missed when you completed the acquisition later in May in 2015, so we would expect to see more of a step-up, if you will, in profitability of the business in a year-over-year basis in the second quarter than we've seen in the first? Pierre Brondeau : I think about the North America European business more balanced over three quarters than it is over the second quarter. So right now we don't want to go into starting to guide through 2Q Q3 because it start to be a very difficult exercise, especially when you're in the ag business. But I think we'll have more of the [indiscernible] of the sales over three quarters than we had in the past. Operator : Your next question is from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Dan Rizzo : This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Just a question on omega 3s. Are you seeing any signs of pricing in 2016 as part of the turn or is it going to be somewhat until 2015 where you're subject to overcapacity and just some pricing pressures? Eric Norris : What we're seeing in Omega 3 is a mix effect. We do expect to see in our mix in the nutraceutical market and improvement in products we're launching that are launched at a higher price. If you look at the core of the market, though, the middle part of -- when we talk about concentrations, the middle to low part of the concentration, we don't expect to see improvement and that market still remains an oversupplied market where demand is not growing rapidly. And so we see a similar set of pricing competitive dynamics in that part of the market in 2016 as we did in 2015. Dan Rizzo : I think on the last call, maybe I'm wrong, but you said that potentially you could see strategically exiting the omega-3 market, but it wasn't the right time. Is that kind of still the same outlook or same thought process? Pierre Brondeau : Here is what we believe. Our market strategy of participating into the pharmacy goal and nutraceutical market, has not changed. We're still going after all of these market high concentration and mid concentration product. What we're doing today is focusing more on supplying those market from one of the asset we have, rather than the high concentration [indiscernible] asset which we do not believe is an asset which is necessary today for us to participate in the pharmacical market. So it is not a change in the market we intend to participate in, but it's a change in our manufacturing strategy to serve those markets. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli and Company. Rosemarie Morbelli : I have a couple of small ones. First of all, do you anticipate that the announcement of the addition capacity on the lithium carbonate will have a negative impact on overall pricing as those big plants come on stream? Pierre Brondeau : Not in 2016. I think pricing will be [indiscernible] for lithium carbonate in 2016 as most of the capacity increase already called for from a demand standpoint. Will there be some pricing pressure in 2017? We'll have to see what the demand is. But if it is a question -- and I cannot answer that right now, but if it is a question on pricing, it's a 2017 question. Rosemarie Morbelli : And then are you successful in getting your receivables in Brazil? Are the farmers paying you in a timely -- well, not a timely fashion, they don't, but in the way you would expect or the fact that you have done so much restructuring is creating the opportunity for someone to just not pay? Paul Graves : Rosemarie, it's Paul. I would answer as follows, the restructuring is not a factor in this. The way we restructure and what we restructured was done very carefully, so it does not at all impact on our ability to collect. The factors that are driving our ability to collect are really driven more by market conditions and I don't necessarily just mean ag market conditions, but as much the financing market conditions down in Brazil where we're seeing a continued cautiousness on the part of the Brazilian grower to hold on to his liquid resources. A lack of confidence that financing will be there for them as they head into the next growing season is essentially across the board creating challenges to collection. Compounding on top of that, of course, as we've discussed, is the fact that the most leverage you have is when the grower has to buy new product. When you have pest pressures down and when you have excess inventory in the channel, it just makes that collection process even more difficult for us. I would say 2015 unfolded very much in the way we described. I think we talked at length about it being a multi-year program to reduce the receivables balance in Brazil and 2015 played out really exactly as we had expected. The next couple of quarters will be the next key benchmarks for it as we look at a collection in the first half of the year and for us, at least, heading through the back end of 2016 is the first time we'll be able to show real measurable progress down there in Brazil. Rosemarie Morbelli : How much do you think you can reduce your receivables from Brazil in 2016 versus how much did you reduce it in 2015? Paul Graves : We will certainly reduce it more in 2016 than we did in 2015. We did reduce it in Brazil in 2015, but not by a huge amount. So we definitely expect to make more progress on that in 2016. Rosemarie Morbelli : And one last one, if I may. Could you talk about the protein demand in China? Are you seeing that improving or the decline when the price of milk and whey was really high has not recovered yet. Eric Norris : We continue to see in China a dairy market that's fairly on a demand -- on a growth basis flat to down. We saw a big swing in our sales last year due to a correction in inventories for our colloidal products into that market and to some of the plant-based beverages such as peanut milk. That's worked its way off and the underlying demand is coming through, but that demand is fairly flat. We saw a modest growth ourselves. The overall market, however, is flat to down. Brian Angeli : That's all the time we have for the call today. I want to thank everyone for joining us. I'll be available to address any additional questions you may have. Thank you. Have a good day.",

(Broker) Operator : Good morning and welcome to the First Quarter 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call for FMC Corporation. Phone lines will be placed on listen-only mode throughout the conference. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer period. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Brian Angeli, Vice President-Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Mr. Angeli, you may begin. Brian P. Angeli - Vice President, Corporate Strategy and Development : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's first quarter 2016 earnings call. Joining me this morning is Pierre Brondeau, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Pierre will begin the call with a review of FMC's first quarter performance and discuss the outlook for Q2 and the full year 2016. Paul will provide an overview of select financial results. The slide presentation that accompanies our results along with our earnings release and 2016 outlook statement are currently available on our website. The prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available at the conclusion of the call. Following the prepared remarks, we will be joined by Mark Douglas, President, FMC Agricultural Solutions; Eric Norris, President, FMC Health and Nutrition; and Tom Schneberger, Vice President and Global Business Director, FMC Lithium, to address your questions. Before I turn the call over to Pierre, let me remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including, but not limited to, those factors identified in our earnings release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based on upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references, and pro forma revenue and segment earnings for FMC Agricultural Solutions. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. 2016 marks the beginning of the new era for FMC. Today's FMC is a more focused and streamlined company. Our businesses operate in attractive end-markets namely agriculture, nutrition, pharmaceuticals and lithium. The actions we have taken over the past 18 months have aligned operation with regional market demand and position each of our businesses to better capitalize on market opportunities. With our transformation complete, we are now solely focused on the execution of our strategy to drive performance in 2016 and beyond. In Agricultural Solutions, we continue to see the benefits of the Cheminova acquisition. Prior to the acquisition, Ag Solutions was very much an American business. In 2014, more than three quarters of its revenues were generated in North and South America. Cheminova significantly increased the size of Ag Solutions operations in Europe and Asia, bringing greater scale and market access to Ag Solutions operations across our regions. The increased global scale of operations combined with actions, we have taken in North and South America will bring greater regional balance to Ag Solutions, align operations with a global crop protection chemical market and limit Ag Solutions reliance on any one region or market to drive performance. For example, in 2014 almost 40% of Ag Solutions revenue was generated in Brazil alone. In 2016, we expect Brazil to account for less than 20% of segment revenue and only 15% of total company revenue. Across the global Ag market, conditions in the Americas remains the most challenging. With greater scales and regional balance, FMC is able to better manage our business in the Americas to address market conditions. Specifically, we restructured operations in Brazil to align the size of our business with market conditions and rationalize our product offering to increase our focus on higher margin proprietary technology platforms and differentiated products. While these actions reduced our revenues in Brazil, they improved the quality of operations and enhanced the potential to deliver higher earnings and return on capital. In North America, we are supporting customer inventory drawdowns to more closely match our sales with underlying global demand and important step to further strengthen FMC's position from which to protect price and terms. Cheminova also extended our product portfolio and technology pipeline and provided new opportunities to realize meaningful cost savings. We are already seeing the benefits of our expanded product portfolio in North America and Europe and the integration of Cheminova is progressing well. We remain on track to deliver the full run rate cost savings of $140 million to $160 million by the middle of 2017. In Health and Nutrition, global demand for FMC's naturally derived ingredients product lines continue to be robust and we remain focused on maintaining the business's high margins through the implementation of manufacturing excellence program, process technology improvements and product differentiation. In Lithium, we are seeing the benefits of our strategy to focus and grow FMC's business in the technology driven specialty end markets, where demand continues to climb and pricing trends across FMC's portfolio remain favorable. I will discuss the performance of each of our businesses shortly and provide an update on our outlook for Q2 and the full year. First, I will start with a brief review of FMC's consolidated reported results on slide two. FMC reported first-quarter revenue of approximately $799 million. Adjusted EPS of $0.58 for the quarter was flat compared to the first-quarter of 2015 but was towards the top end of our guidance range as a solid performance in Ag Solutions and a very strong quarter from Lithium drove the results. Turning now to Ag Solutions on slide 3. Ag Solutions reported revenue of $546 million, a decline of 22% compared to pro forma results for the first quarter of 2015 as lower sales volume in North America and Brazil, due to high channel inventories, planned product rationalization and currency headwinds more than offset the impact of price increases, revenue synergies and new product introductions in the quarter. As I mentioned previously, we are focused on executing our strategy to drive improved performance. This includes completing the process of rationalizing the Ag Solutions product portfolio that began in 2014. The actions we took to eliminate certain products from our portfolio reduced revenue by approximately $30 million or 4% compared to pro forma revenue for Q1 2015. However, as discussed in prior quarters, this product rationalization has a limited impact on segment earnings. We also remain focused on pricing discipline. At the operating earnings level price increases implemented in Brazil more that offset the year-over-year impact of the weaker real. However, the broad-based strength of the U.S. dollar resulted in headwinds in Europe and Asia that were only partially offset by price increases. Despite challenging market conditions, the Ag Solutions business delivered segment earnings of $82 million, ahead of the midpoint of our guidance, and maintained operating margins year-over-year on a pro forma basis. I will make a few additional comments regarding regional market condition in Ag Solutions performance now on slide four. Overall market conditions and our performance in the quarter were very much as expected. In North America, as we discussed on our Q4 earnings call back in February, the deterioration in farm incomes over the past year combined with elevated channel inventory levels led distributors and growers to delay purchases of agriculture inputs including crop protection chemicals. We determined it was critical to maintain price and payment terms in North America this season. And as part of our strategy to achieve this, we believe it was important to allow the level of FMC product inventory in the sale channel to reduce. Our decision to allow FMC product inventory in the sales channel to be drawn down was the main factor behind the 35% decline in revenue in North America in the quarter compared to pro forma revenue from the first quarter 2015. However, we anticipate full year revenue performance for Ag Solutions in North America will be largely in line with the broader North America crop protection market, as the actions we are taking today will facilitate increased sales in the second half of the year. In fact, the data we are seeing give us increased confidence that our approach to managing Ag Solutions business in North America will help protect price and terms in 2016. Despite lower sales into the channel, FMC continues to gain market share when looking at growers' use of product. Based on independent data, application of FMC products, or products on the ground, rose 7% in the quarter compared to Q1 2015. In particular, we continue to see strength in FMC's Authority brand pre-emergent herbicides, which address the growing number of soybean acres which exhibit glyphosate resistance. As a result, we are confident the reduction in revenue in Q1 is due more to our decision as when to sell than it is to any change in underlying demand for FMC products. And it is the strong grower demand for FMC's portfolio of technical products, which will ultimately provide the support for pricing and terms as we are \u2013 that we are focused on. In addition, we continue to see demand by growers for new innovative and differentiated products that provide high value in use. Recent product launches by FMC in core herbicides and the introduction of our expanded fungicides product offering as a result of the Cheminova acquisition received strong support from growers and distributors in the quarter. We also saw strong acceptance of our new biological and synthetic product combinations, including brand such as Capture VGR and Ethos XB. In Latin America, revenue declined approximately 25% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Lower demand and planned product rationalizations in Brazil more than offset increased sales volume in the rest of Latin America. Excluding this portfolio rationalization, sales in Latin America declined approximately 15% in line with the overall market. Market conditions in Brazil were little changed from the fourth quarter of 2015. Channel inventory levels have improved but remain elevated, most notably, in soybean insecticide in the northern states. However, we are seeing an increase in demand in the north for insecticides such as FMC's Talisman to address secondary pest pressure in soybeans. In Southern Brazil, market conditions are improved, especially in sugarcane and certain niche crops such as coffee and citrus. We continued to remain disciplined on pricing in Brazil. As we have explained previously, greater stability in the Brazil real to U.S. dollar exchange rate supports price increase to offset FX headwinds. Paul will comment further on the impact on foreign currencies later in the call. Outside of Brazil, we continue to see increasing demand for pre-emergent herbicides in Argentina and products for niche crops in Colombia and Mexico. In Argentina, we see improved conditions with far fewer restrictions on imports and with the lifting of export taxes for key crops. In Europe, sales declined approximately 11% as foreign exchange headwinds and lower market volume more than offset commercial synergies from the Cheminova transaction and new product launches in the quarter. A cold snap at the end of the winter impacted the season in certain Western European markets and we have seen some tightening of demand by growers in an attempt to control costs in the face of persistently low grain prices. Strong demand in Central and Eastern Europe and FMC's transition to Cheminova's direct market access model in Europe partially offset the pullback in market activity in the quarter. Sales volumes across Europe increased for FMC's legal portfolio including herbicide and insecticide for cereal. With the benefit of a broader combined portfolio, we believe the business is well-positioned to address market demand in key crops including cereals and oilseed rate. Profitability in the region improved meaningfully year-over-year as the move to direct market access combined with other cost savings from the Cheminova integration increased operating margins in Europe by about 200 basis points. In Asia, we saw increased demand in China and Australia, however, the stronger U.S. dollar combined with planned product rationalization and cool weather in India and Southeast Asia resulted in a 13% decline in pro forma revenue compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of currency and planned product rationalization, revenue decreased about 3% driven largely by lower sales volumes in India. Globally, we expect challenging market conditions to persist for the remainder of the year. As previously stated, we believe the global crop protection chemicals market will decline by a mid to high single-digit percentage in 2016 on a U.S. dollar basis, driven largely by market conditions in North America and Brazil. We remain highly focused on decreasing FMC product inventory levels in the channel holding on pricing term and increasing collections of accounts receivable. Our full year guidance for Ag Solutions remains unchanged. We continue to forecast full-year revenue of between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion and full segment earnings in the range of $380 million to $420 million. In the second quarter, we expect to deliver segment earnings in the range of $90 million to $110 million along with sequential margin improvement as we move toward the main selling season in North America and Europe. Turning next to Health and Nutrition on slide five. First quarter performance for Health and Nutrition was broadly in line with expectation. The business reported revenue of $192 million and segment earnings of $47 million. First quarter 2016 revenue declined approximately $19 million compared to the first quarter of last year. As discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, last year's first quarter revenue included certain Omega-3 sales which were not expected to occur in 2016. These sales relate principally to pharmaceutical API product and account for the decline in revenue compared to the prior year period. Excluding these sales volumes, and the impact of currency, revenue was essentially flat compared to last year. Global demand for FMC's health excipient products continues to grow resulting in higher sales volume of binder and ingredients (27:00) products for in the quarter. However, lower sales in functional health due to timing and the more competitive Omega-3 pricing environment broadly offset the increase in health excipient revenue. For the first quarter of 2016, Health and Nutrition reported segment earnings of $47 million, while lower operating costs resulted in an increase in segment earnings margin to 24.6%. Looking forward, we continue to expect full year revenue in the range of $775 million and $825 million in segment earnings of between $198 million and $208 million, driven principally by continued growth in demand for MCC based health excipients and nutritional ingredients in North America and Asia and lower operating costs from ongoing manufacturing excellence program and process technology improvement. We expect Health and Nutrition second quarter segment earnings of between $49 million and $53 million with a sequential improvement in segment earnings margin in the quarter. Turning to Lithium on slide six, Lithium delivered an outstanding quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, revenue increased 8% to $60 million and segment earnings almost tripled to $14.9 million. Segment operating margin climbed from under 10% last year in Q1 to almost 25% this quarter. These results reflect the impact of our strategy to focus on the downstream specialty markets. As a result of our advantage process technology and ability to manage sales mix, FMC is uniquely positioned to serve the higher growth and higher value specialty segments while maintaining the flexibility to take advantage of favorable market conditions in lithium carbonate and chloride. Demand trends across specialty end markets remains strong. Demand for lithium hydroxide for energy storage and the electric vehicle or EV applications continues to grow at double-digit rates. Our success in increasing throughput from our existing hydroxide assets allow FMC to deliver higher sales volume in the quarter. In addition, we managed our production mix in order to optimize our sales of butyllithium and high purity lithium metals. Favorable market conditions supported price increases across the FMC portfolio. We continue to realize price increases for lithium hydroxide while approach to the carbonate and chloride markets is allowing us to achieve meaningful price increases on these limited sales volume. The extent to which carbonate and chloride prices remain elevated will depend on how quickly new supply comes online. We expect market supply of all product to remain tight in the near to midterm. Lower operating costs coupled with higher specialty sales volume and price increases resulted in significant increases in segment earnings and margins in the quarter. Manufacturing efficiencies from ongoing process improvement initiatives and lower cost associated with the natural gas pipeline installed in 2015 reduced operating cost by more than $5 million year-over-year helping to drive the increased operating margin in the quarter. We expect the second quarter to be another strong period for the Lithium business. We continue to shift our sales mix to grow our specially product line serving markets such as EVs and polymers while capitalizing on favorable market conditions in lithium carbonate. However, we expect to have slightly lower available carbonate volumes in Q2 compared to Q1 as a result of lower seasonal production in Argentina. Consequently, we expect quarter segment earnings to be in the range of $10 million to $14 million and segment earnings margin in the range of 19% to 20%. Based on Lithium performance to date and our expectations for the remainder of 2016, we are raising our full-year outlook for the Lithium business. We now expect full year revenue to be between $245 million and $265 million and segment earnings to be in the range of $43 million to $53 million, up $10 million from the prior range. Moving next to our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2016 on slide seven. I previously commented on the outlook for each business for both Q2 and the full year. As I mentioned, we are maintaining segment earnings guidance for the full year for both Ag Solutions and Health and Nutrition. Segment earnings guidance for the second quarter reflect normal earnings level for these businesses based on their expectations for 2016. We are increasing the full year segment earnings guidance for Lithium as stated earlier. On a consolidated basis, we're increasing full year 2016 adjusted earnings per share by $0.05 versus previous guidance to a range of $2.55 to $2.85 and we expect second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings to be between $0.62 and $0.72 per share. I will now turn the call over to Paul to discuss select financial results including taxes, foreign exchange and cash flow. Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you very much Pierre. As usual, I'll start with the income statement and specifically the tax rate. Our adjusted effective tax rate fell from 27.5% in the first quarter 2015 to 26% in Q1 2016. Part of this was the continued change in the mix of our earnings away from the U.S. and Brazil and towards Europe and Asia where rates are typically lower. We continue to take steps to increase our tax efficiency and expect that the full year rate will come in somewhere in the 24% to 26% range. The theme in our earnings in recent quarters has been the impact of foreign currency movements and the movement in the Brazilian real has been a particular area focus. In the first quarter, the average rates of real to the dollar was 3.9, significantly weaker than the 2.87 average of the same quarter a year ago. However, the total impact on our earnings was far less than we have seen in prior quarters for two main reasons. First, as you know, Q1 is not a large selling quarter for us in Brazil, reducing the impact of currency moves. Also since we have not seen particularly volatile movements in the currency, our price list has been able to reflect the new currency levels for the entire quarter. As a result, the $13 million headwind created by the weaker real year-on-year was completely offset by price increases. In fact the positive impact of the weaker real on our cost base meant that the change in the real was actually a net positive to our income statement in Q1. Looking to the rest of the world, although a number of Asian currencies collectively reduced earnings, the only major currency in which we faced a headwind in the quarter was the euro, which devalued by 2% versus the same period last year. The net hit to operating earnings from currency movements in the quarter was approximately $14 million. A second common theme on our earnings has also been the challenges of operating in Argentina, including areas such as import license restrictions, negative impacts of export duties and the headwind created by the disconnect between cost inflation and the pace of devaluation of the peso against the dollar. Since the election of Macri as President, we've seen a rapid shift in all these areas to the benefit of our operations in Ag Solutions and especially Lithium. The devaluation of the peso had a relatively limited impact on our earnings in the quarter in Lithium, since the lower cost of operations takes one to two quarters to work its way out of inventory and into the income statement. And our earnings guidance for 2016 reflects this lower cost of operations. We remain cautiously optimistic that the business environment in Argentina will remain positive and will continue to create opportunities for FMC. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on slide eight. Q1 is historically the period in which we consume the most cash given the seasonal nature of our Ag business. However, discipline around spending, the increased focus last year on sales terms, and of course the ongoing collection measures globally, resulted in an improvement of operating cash flow of over $100 million compared to the same quarter last year. Cash flow was helped by higher EBITDA and a better performance around working capital, most notably from collection of receivables. This improvement was seen in all regions. With certain cash outflows, particularly capital spending and pension expenses also lower than last year, we were able to hold net debt flat during the quarter. As noted in our filing of March 28, we elected to amend the debt covenants for our term loan and revolver, deferring the timing of step downs of our leverage ratios, such that we retained the covenant limit of 4.5 times for Q1. Our actual leverage ratio under the covenant calculation was 4.0 times giving the half a turn of headroom that we consider to be prudent. Looking to the rest of the year, adjusted cash from operations is forecast in the range of $450 million to $550 million, an improvement over last year of over a third at the midpoint of the range. This is driven by improvements in both EBITDA and working capital performance. Capital expenditure will remain broadly flat to 2015 in the $120 million to $140 million range. And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Paul. To conclude, we continue to expect a challenging market in Ag Solutions, but we're managing the business to increase visibility and to protect both price and term. As a result, we continue to expect full-year earnings to be in line with prior guidance. Health and Nutrition is performing largely in line with expectation and Lithium is well ahead of our initial forecasts. The portfolio transformation is done. We are now in execution mode targeting year-over-year earning growth for each of our three businesses. Thank you for your attention and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Operator : . And the first question comes from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Perfect. Thank you very much. You mentioned in your presentation that Central and Eastern Europe were showing solid demands, but can you comment on the pricing landscape given the FX headwinds there as well and whether or not you were able to offset that? And then also on the demand front, do you believe the growth was simply driven by the market, or do you believe there's any benefit from adding the FMC portfolio to the legacy Cheminova one in the region? Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think on the Central, Eastern Europe, the pricing is pretty stable and you know, it's not a very, very large market, interesting for us because there is a strong possibility to increase volume. But pricing is quite stable. And I think definitely, the growth is one of the place where FMC had no structure in Central and Eastern Europe where it was an area of focus for Cheminova. So definitely a place where using the infrastructure and commercial organization from Cheminova and bringing in the product portfolio for FMC is going to create some significant possibilities (41:21) for us. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Perfect. And just kind of a tangent question to that one, given the progression of cost savings with Cheminova, it's clearly going well, can you just comment on the other geographies as far as intermediate to long-term revenue synergy opportunities inclusive of the US and then also in Latin America with Argentina in particular? Thank you. Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions : Yeah, Chris, this is Mark. We've talked about North America in the past and in the US, we are seeing very good synergies with the fungicide portfolio from Cheminova going through our distribution network. In Latin America, obviously Brazil in the south, we're seeing increased sales through co-ops where we've made decisions which co-ops and which distribution network we'll go through. Argentina is certainly very beneficial for us. Obviously we have a bigger footprint there now. We have the right products for the soy market, so we're expecting to see growth in Argentina. And then in other parts of Latin America, I would say, obviously Mexico, Columbia, are two countries that we are focused on and we are seeing very good synergies in Colombia on these crops. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And I think when we did the last earnings call, as well as multiple discussions we all had, we've been talking about the share getting to $100 million -- $50 million to $100 million run rate in between the synergies and the new products and very much on very much on track with that. So it is a place, I think the opportunities created by Cheminova from a cost saving and the revenue synergies are very much in line with what we're expecting. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, good morning, gentlemen and nice start to the year. Pierre when you were talking about the Ag business, you were talking about some positives with respect to, glad to say, resistance in terms of providing a boost, so I was wondering if there was a way for you to kind of quantify it and in terms of where you see that -- where you see that over the next 18 months or so. And then, what sort of concerns may you have about some new technologies that Monsanto and others are rolling out in that area? Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions : Yeah, Frank, it's Mark. I think for us when we look at Glyphosate resistance, we are really talking about the US, Argentina as the two big markets. I think you know that through our Authority brands based upon sulfentrazone, we've had great success in the pre-emergent area in both those countries. I expect that to continue. There will be some headwinds with new technologies coming in. But I think to offset that, we still see more weeds getting resistance to glyphosate and more acres increasing especially in Argentina. It wouldn't surprise me if we don't start to see that in the next few years start to develop in Brazil as well and we are already positioning our brands in Brazilian soy for that area. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's very helpful. And as you think about some of the combinations coming -- some of the major combinations in the Ag chem world coming over the next 12 months or less, how do you see yourselves perhaps participating in picking up some pieces there, what's the interest level -- talk about your participation in industry consolidation here? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, Frank, as you know, we made a move which was in line with what was our strategic intent by acquiring Cheminova. We have now a stable situation from a structural standpoint in Ag. We're finishing up on the integration. What we intend to do at this stage is watch what is happening specifically in places when two Ag companies are coming together. So every time there will be consolidation of that companies, if at any point during this process there is, because of anti-trust reason, product which are made available, that is something we are usually very good at doing which is taking a product and commercializing that with our own sales organization. So, we're going to be opportunistic, but it's certainly something we will be able to afford to do and would be very interested in doing. Beyond that, do not expect us making any major move in acquiring any type of company, it will be an acquisition of technology and product. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Jester with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, good morning. Maybe a couple of questions on Lithium. Price mix was a 4% benefit in the quarter. But by some kind of spot measures lithium prices were much higher. So can you just kind of elaborate as to how we should be thinking about pricing, kind of commodity versus your specialty end markets and spot sales versus the contract market as we continue throughout the year? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, if you think about our Lithium business, look at strategic price increase in place where we are technologically advantaged in grain markets where we have significant contracts which are renewed every year like in lithium hydroxide. And then think about on the chloride and carbonate side for what is not used for internal purpose or sold in the contract, we are using the spot market to do one off price increase. We believe that situation is going to carry-on for the next few quarters. I think the market will remain tight which will allow us to, to use the spot market in the more commodity businesses like chloride and carbonate to increase price on a spot basis. And where we have opportunities where people need our technology or product, we will be increasing price on contracts when contracts are being renewed. So it is a situation which we see fairly, fairly stable for the future. If you look at our increase in gallons for the Lithium business, most of it is going to, of the over performance, will be due to pricing. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then just sticking with Lithium, you commented that you think the outlook is going to be tight in the near to medium term, can you just flush out a little bit about what your expectations are for supply additions over the coming years? Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well I cannot comment too much beyond what all of you know on the lithium carbonate side because that's a decision of the people who have announced capacity increase. I'm sure (48:57), when they talk on their earnings we'll be able to tell more about the timing. But we believe (49:04). And we believe also some Chinese or Australian company will be bringing carbonate capacity in the next couple of years. We ourselves are focused more on the downstream and we will bring in time and we'll bring more detail in the weeks to come. But we'll be focusing more on increasing lithium hydroxide capacity as we need. Operator : And next we will go with Mike Harrison of Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Pierre, if we could just continue on the Lithium front. I guess I was just surprised to see that you put up a $15 million quarter in Lithium and your guidance is only calling for $43 million to $53 million for the full year. What's going to change during the remainder of the year that would suggest that earnings could be lower than the Q1 level as we get through the rest of the year? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I will ask for Tom to comment with me. But, as we said in the script, remember there is seasons in term of manufacturing in lithium and we are getting into a period where -- which is the winter part of the season and we're going to have more rain and more snow and conditions which are going to limit more to some extent, our production of carbonates. So, what we're expecting in the next three quarters is less carbonate available because of our manufacturing, like most people operating in this part of the world, in the next couple of quarters. On the positive side, our costs continue to be good and our pricing will be positive. So it's a differential between all of this which creates maybe a little bit less of an over performance in the remaining three quarters than we have in the first-quarter. I don't know if you want to anything, Tom, to this? Thomas Schneberger - VP & Global Business Director- Lithium Division : Yeah, I think if you look historically at the earnings, the seasonality has been there. We are doing what we can to reduce volatility, but that seasonality is going to remain where the first quarter and fourth quarter give us the most volume and flexibility on the mix we can sell. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : And then, as I think about some of the lithium carbonate that you're actually purchasing to convert to hydroxide, are you experiencing higher raw material costs for that, or do you have lower prices locked in for the year, and you're actually getting a margin benefit for some of that raw material you're purchasing? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, we first, as you know, most of the carbonate, by a long shot, we use is produced by us. So what we are buying under contract today versus the rest of the overall usage is incremental and what we are buying is locked under a long-term supply agreement. So we are not facing significant price increase in carbonate. If it plays the way we expect it to play, and once again it's going to have to be confirmed, but the way we look at it is, for now, we are producing enough carbonate and buying enough to run our strategy around chloride, butyllithium, metal and hydroxide. And as time will go, we're going to have to sell more hydroxide. We're going to have to increase our capacity in hydroxide and we'll have to buy more of carbonate on the actual market, which should be at a time when our peer company will be increasing capacity and making the product more available in the market. So, it looks like all of this is falling in place quite well. Tom, you want to add something? Thomas Schneberger - VP & Global Business Director- Lithium Division : Yeah, thanks for the question. Pierre has it down well. The other thing that we look at always is the incremental things we can do in Argentina, and there are small opportunities for small capital to increase our throughput in Argentina, which gives us some flexibility as we go forward? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So right now, I would say there is no major issue around potential increase in the future of our cost in term of our ability to execute a strategy around carbonate and hydroxide. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys nice start to the year. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Pierre, when used think about \u2013 you didn't change your outlook for crop protection markets this year. I understand it's still difficult out there, but it does sound like you're feeling better about the integration and maybe the long-term potential. Can you maybe map out where Ag Solutions op income can go over time as hopefully things recover? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah let me \u2013 I'll tell you the way we look at Ag Solutions right now. First let me talk about the Ag market as we see it for this year. I think we are not changing our view for 2016. We still believe it's a mid to high single digit down market mostly driven by North America and Brazil within the high teens. And maybe Asia and Europe to the low \u2013 sorry \u2013 in the high single-digit while Europe and Asia would be in the low to mid-single-digit decrease. So, we are not changing our view. It could be maybe turning more toward the high single-digit overall global market. The way \u2013 and why do I feel better about the way we are operating in the Ag market, it is not because we are seeing a fundamental change in the market in the short-term. But what I think we are doing at FMC, I think the key difference is that we know better how to operate in this type of market. I can tell you, you see it on our numbers, we are not fighting to keep market share on sales of product. We are much more looking at three type of objectives. First, it's very important for us and focusing only on FMC product is to decrease FMC product in the channels. The second aspect is we want to be able by doing that to focus more on the quality of the sales, which is more term, price and collection. And then, looking at all of that, the objective is to align more sales with a normal demand pattern. You see that on the numbers in Q1 in North America. Sales, down 35% I think, on slide four, while product on the ground were up above market, 7%. So the way we are operating in the market today, I believe, we have more control over our selling process than we might have had in the past when we got hit by the downturn. Beyond that, I would say, I would not exclude the market to turn around in 2017, but I have no indicators telling me that it will be the case. So I think we are much more focused, Mike, on operating under the current conditions with very high control on term, price, managing very closely in partnership with our customers our inventory, to create much more predictability in ourselves. So that's where the level of confidence for me is increasing at this stage. Market turnaround \u2013 I think we'll have to wait a little bit more and certainly to go into Q3, Q4 to have more visibility. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then, Paul, just a quick one. I thought you said at the current levels where the real is at, that it, is it going to be a negative this year or is it a positive? I just wanted to make sure I understood your commentary around foreign currency there. Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's the million-dollar question with the reai. I mean, the truth is that the stability or the predictability in the movement of the new reai is really what matters to us. We've talked about it in the past with regard to the timing of changes and the pace of changes. Q1 and Q2 just aren't really periods in which we have a lot of commercial activity going on in Brazil. So it's really what it does in Q3. And, again, it isn't so much the level. We've shown that in Q1 where with an average rate of 3.9 \u2013 today, it's closer to 3.5 \u2013 we were able to still capture pricing on the limited number of sales that we have in Q1. The question will come into Q3, how stable, how predictable is the reai. In the rest of the world, I mean, you look at the forward curve on the currency, it does not feel like a strengthening dollar is what the market is expecting. And so that generally speaking is what's factored into our numbers \u2013 relative predictably, not a big strengthening of the dollar around the world. Q1 feels like \u2013 when you look at where the dollar is today compared to a year ago, Q1 feels like the last of the quarters that we have those tough FX comps. So subject to any changes away from where the market expects today, it doesn't feel like currency will be quite the high level story that it was last year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO. Please go ahead. Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Hi. Good morning. You have really guided up your operating cash flow projections for the year by $50 million but raised your EBIT projections by about $10 million. Can you give us a sense of where the big delta is coming in the operating cash flow? Is it really an improvement in working capital? Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. It's a pretty straightforward story. We clearly have an increased expectation around EBITDA, but the truth is it's largely around working capital. And you have to bear in mind that if you look over the last few years -- two years ago we had a terrible performance with working capital with largely cash outflow. Last year we turned the corner and sort of stopped the bleeding and improved it slightly but this year we expect that trend to continue so that working capital becomes a positive generator of cash for us. Our biggest focus is always going to be the Brazil receivables balance and getting that receivables balance down. But we're also very, very focused on inventory levels, our own inventory levels and making sure that we are very efficient and very thoughtful about what inventory we hold, where we hold it and how much of it we hold. So it's coming in multiple different areas, but you really should be looking at working capital as the primary driver of the increase in cash flow for 2016. Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Okay, I'm sorry if this was asked already, but \u2013 in terms of synergies from Cheminova, $60 million to $70 million for the year, do you still maintain that and maybe give us how much more you think you can still get in 2017 versus your prior guidance? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I have a terrible time with... Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : ...synergies in 2016, $60 million to $70 million still our guidance and how much more were we anticipating. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes we are not changing the -- actually we still have the same numbers, so the numbers we've been talking about $60 million, $70 million are very well in line and a full run rate of $140 million to $160 million getting into the middle of next year are also still the target. So there is no change in our numbers right now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with BoA. Please go ahead. Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, Thank you. In the U.S. crop protection market are you seeing any increased discounting or bundling by your competitors? And do you see any risk of perhaps maybe losing some shelf space in the retail channel from allowing your product inventories to be trimmed? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You know, I think whenever you talk about terms and pricing, we want to be highly cautious and slowly comment about we do. Our strategy today is quite, is quite simple. We are highly focused on maintaining our pricing at a healthy level. We are very vigilant on terms, as you know balance sheet is always a key challenge for a company like us. And more than ever we are highly disciplined on terms and not giving terms. What it means for us and only talking for FMC, what it means for us is certainly we are prepared to see timing change in our sales and that's what I've been talking about. We're not being willing to do anything to push product in the market if there is not a complete need from this product -- for this product by the market. You know, space shelf is a word we use a lot, but when you have technical product to be sold, those products you know they are needed. And then you have commercial contract with customers. So it is not a situation where because we are aligning ourselves with the market demand, that we are taking an enormous risk to see somebody taking our shelf space by the end of the year and us not being able to sell our product. For example, Mark talked about our Authority product line. It's a pre-emergent product. It's required \u2013 needs to be bought in Q4 and Q1. We know this product will be sold. So I think our strategy might be a bit differentiated but we are only focusing on ours along the line of what we discussed before. Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And Pierre, considering your comment about Authority, would you say that the outlook for eventual penetration of the Xtend and the Enlist soybean products, does that \u2013 is that a risk to your Authority franchise within the Americas or could you see that as potentially an opportunity where you might expand your herbicide franchise and move more over-the-top. And bring in formulations with either 2,4-D and Dicamba? Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions : Yeah, Steve, this is Mark. You know we talked about it earlier, I got a question earlier about whether we thought it would be a headwind or a tailwind. I think in the initial stages, I expect rates to be reduced. Good news is we know with Enlist and Xtend that there will still be recommend in the use of pre-emergent herbicides of which Authority is one of the market leaders. So we know we are going to have a substantial market there. I would say weed-resistant acres continue to grow, so we're going to see that pre-emergent continuing, certainly in the U.S. and as I said earlier, in Argentina. I think from an over-the-top perspective, I mean we have some very good products that we're going to be promoting such as our Cadet herbicide which we think will be a great tank mix partner for those products and really offer a broader spectrum of control. Don't expect to see as us in 2,4-D and Dicamba, that's just not the sort the business we're going to be in. We're going to be in the more differentiated products, more highly specialized where we can bring value to the growers and distribution. Operator : Next we will go to the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks. Pierre the trend among food companies to reformulate to simplify is clearly getting faster, how much is that reformulation trend actually helping you do you think? And do you think about it as a tailwind? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You know, I think the food market for us, there is an acceleration of \u2013 the way we look at our market in Nutrition and in Health, are interesting. In Health, the good news is when you are with a customer, you are there for a while because you're not being reformulated out easily. The problem with that is it's not easy to gain new business. Well, the same applied to food but the reverse. I think there is a trend to reformulate, change formulation. There is a very fast cycle which gives opportunities for us. So the stronger we are with our product, the more opportunities. But by the same token also it opens the door for new product and competitors. So I would say today, it could be slightly a tailwind knowing that we are maybe the largest market shareholder and maybe the complete product line. But I don't see that as a major change from the past. Eric, you want to add some comment to that? Eric W. Norris - President-Health & Nutrition: I would say we see it as a tread, this is, Eric, Mark, Eric Norris. I see it as a trend, we see it as a trend like many others that have come and go in the industry. The industry is very fad based. So to Pierre's point, unlike the health markets where there's very little change over periods of time, there is a great deal of change from every two or three years, whether it's low-fat, Atkins and now this simplification, clean label phenomenon. It really does come down to the breath of product line we have, the fact that they are well-suited to being all naturally-based. And then having the applications capability to respond to them in the right places around the world, having the spread of knowledge in the right places near customers. So, we're well-positioned for it. Anytime there's a reformulation, there's a challenge, right? So, it does create an effort on our part to respond. Going forward we see it as a tailwind though for us, given the breadth of our product line and application capabilities. Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Eric, in Pierre's comments you talked about product differentiation, can you talk about how you think about product differentiation. Eric W. Norris - President-Health & Nutrition: In specifically in the food market? Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Sure yeah. Eric W. Norris - President-Health & Nutrition: Yeah. It comes down to understanding very well not only what's going on with your direct cost customer, the large food or small food company, but with consumers and then being able to put together a formulation that meets the need. So, product differentiation for us is less about proprietary technology, intellectual property, such as a patent that might drive more what happens in our Ag business. It's more about the know-how of being able to put some, of ingredients together that meets a specific need and understanding either color, texture, and or taste issues that might impact the success of that brand. So, it really comes down to the differentiation around the application and the ingredients we bring as opposed to a proprietary ingredient in the food product itself. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Hi guys thanks for fitting me in here at the end. Pierre, you were talking about kind of the overall crop market and the focus that FMC is going to have in terms of working inventory down and being disciplined on price and terms. So, I just want to get a clarification, so if others, or other competitors are not acting rationally and pushing product into the market when the product doesn't need it as you were saying, FMC is not going to be participating in that kind of activity? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Listen, I don't know what strategy our competitors are operating around. Their own market push of product discount. In our rationale, they tend to be, I think what we have made as a decision, and that's a decision we've made globally. We believe we're in a situation where the markets are such and the level of inventory in the channel are such, that you can't guide your activity by what the others are doing. I think we have a plan in place. We are working very, very closely in cooperation with our customers who understand our strategy. We're not going to sell in Q1, or Q2 or Q3 a product which is needed in Q4. And it makes sense, we maintain a healthy pricing and term situation. And that's what we're going to be focusing -- I believe what we're going to do during this downturn, and until these turns around is, we are not going to work hoping that the overall level of inventory in the market channel is going to go down. I think it's too tall of an order and too impractical. So, we're going to be focusing solely on FMC products. I think the numbers are quite spectacular. I said that many times; 34% sales done in the first quarter in North America plus 7% product on the ground. That is millions of dollars of inventory, which are outside of our customers' inventory. We still will need to replenish when the market needed. And that's the way we our operating. Our competitors will have to use the strategy which is appropriate for them. Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Okay. And then just focusing again on inventory obviously in the quarter, your inventories were significantly elevated due to the strategy that you're speaking of. Could you just talk about the timing, you know that you expect to be able to, you know, work through that inventory along with what the channel is going to be doing? And then ultimately, I think you said you expect improvements in the second half in North America. Can you just talk a little bit about that? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think the way we look at it, and you know, there was a question before, I think it's Mike who asked that question around the level of confidence in the market. I think our strategy today, allow us to have more visibility in term of the timing and level of our sales because we become less dependent upon what the market is doing and rushing to place sales to be safe and have those on the shelf. So what it does to us it creates more predictability and maybe increase the level of confidence of how the quarters ahead of us are going to be unfolding. We know which product will be required usually, which technology will be required depending upon the season in Q4, in Q1 and Q2. And that's a discussion we have with our customers, that's the way we our operating, right now. So it's just giving us a bit more certainty on how things will unfold. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead. Aleksey, your line is open. I guess he didn't have a question anymore. That was our last question. Please go ahead. Brian P. Angeli - Vice President, Corporate Strategy and Development : Okay. Well, that's all the time we have for the call today. I want to thank everyone for joining. I'll be available for the rest of the day to go through any additional questions. Again, thank you. Have a good day. Operator : And that is all the time we have for today. This concludes FMC Corporation First Quarter 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. Thank you.",

Peter E. Butler - Glen Hill Investment Research Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call for FMC Corporation. Phone lines will be placed in listen-only mode throughout the conference. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer period. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Brian Angeli, Vice President of Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Mr. Angeli, you may begin. Brian P. Angeli - Vice President, Corporate Strategy and Development : Thank you and good morning. Welcome to FMC Corporation's second quarter 2016 earnings call. Joining me his today is Pierre Brondeau, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Pierre will begin the call with a review of FMC's second quarter performance and discuss the outlook for Q3 and the full year 2016. Paul will provide an overview of select financial results. The slide presentation that accompanies our results, along with our earnings release and 2016 outlook statement, are currently available on our website, and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available at the conclusion of the call. As with our prior calls, Mark Douglas, President, FMC Agricultural Solutions; Eric Norris, President, FMC Health and Nutrition; and Tom Schneberger, Vice President and Global Business Director, FMC Lithium, will join to address questions. Before we begin, let me remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including but not limited to those factors identified in our earnings release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based on these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references, and pro forma revenue and segment earnings for FMC Agricultural Solutions. A reconciliation and definition of these terms, as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call, are provided on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you Brian, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on the first slide, for the second quarter of 2016, FMC reported revenue of $810 million and adjusted operating profit of $143 million. Adjusted EPS of $0.69 was $0.01 below the second quarter of 2015 but above the midpoint of our guidance range. Ag Solutions delivered another solid quarter as it continues to realize the benefits of the Cheminova acquisition. Lithium outperformed on higher sales volume and higher realized prices across the portfolio, with lower operating cost from ongoing manufacturing excellence program. Earnings in Health and Nutrition were below expectation, as results in Omega-3 were significantly weaker than anticipated. Based on our performance to date and the outlook for the back half of the year, we are increasing full-year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to $2.60 to $2.90 per share. I will provide more detail on how that breaks down across each of the businesses shortly. But first, I will discuss second quarter results for each of our three segments, starting with Ag Solutions on slide 2. Overall, market conditions and our performance in the quarter were in line with our prior expectations. We remained focused on reducing the level of FMC product inventory in the channel and on maintaining discipline on price and terms. We also took actions needed to complete the product rationalization that began in late 2014. For the second quarter, Ag Solutions reported revenue of $550 million and segment earnings of $101 million, slightly ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range. Revenue declined 19% compared to the second quarter of 2015, largely due to lower sales volumes, unfavorable weather conditions in Europe and Asia, the drawdown of channel inventory by customers in most regions, and planned product rationalizations all contributed to the decline in volume in the quarter. Excluding planned product rationalizations, revenue declined broadly in line with the crop protection market as a whole. Segment earnings declined 14% compared to 2015, as the impact of lower sales volumes, less favorable product mix in Asia and North America, and the stronger U.S. dollar were partially offset by lower operating costs. Compared to pro forma results from Q2 last year, operating margin increased 100 basis points, reflecting pricing discipline, the elimination of sales of low-margin products due to portfolio rationalization, and cost savings from the Cheminova integration. As we move to slide 3, I will first give a few comments on the global crop protection market, then I will move on to review FMC's performance by region and discuss the outlook for Q3 and the full year. So, first the market. Overall, conditions in the global crop protection market were as expected and little changed from Q1. In North America, soft commodity prices continue to put pressure on farm incomes, resulting in more cautious buying behavior by growers and elevated inventory levels across the channel. In Europe, unfavorable weather conditions early in the quarter, most notably in Central and Western Europe, reduced market demand leading to lower volumes and increased channel inventory in certain countries. In Brazil, channel inventory across the market remained elevated, especially for insecticides. And while foreign exchange rate had been more stable, growers continue to be negatively impacted by a lack of credit availability. In Asia, weather conditions were poor across most of the region, resulting in weaker market demand. We believe these challenging market conditions will persist for the remainder of the year, and we still forecast that the global crop protection chemical market will decline by mid to high single-digit percent in 2016 on a U.S. dollar basis. I will now discuss FMC's performance in light of these market conditions. First, let me address the lower-than-expected revenue for the quarter. Markets in Asia and Europe were weaker than expected, but the main driver of the lower revenue is a more successful and aggressive product rationalization. We continue to manage the quality of our sales in order to protect margin, earnings and working capital. In North America, our strategy remained one of defending price and terms, allowing the level of FMC product inventory in the sales channel to reduce. All the data we see support our view that inventory of FMC product in the channel is declining. Reflecting the benefit of the actions we took early in the season to reduce inventory of FMC product in the channel, sales in Q2 increased 5%. We saw strong demand for FMC's Authority brand of pre-emergent soybean herbicide, and independent data show that the Authority brand has taken market share this year. We also saw grower support for the expanded fungicide products we can now offer as a result of the Cheminova acquisition. In Europe, revenue declined by 19%, driven largely by poor weather conditions and reduced volume due to the planned product rationalization, as well as the impact of transitioning to a direct market access model. However, the product rationalization and move to direct market access have resulted in improved operating margins in the region. In Latin America, revenue declined 43%, primarily as a result of steps we took to reduce the level of FMC product inventory in the sales channel in Brazil. We were encouraged by our ability to recover U.S. dollar pricing in the quarter. While not material to overall segment performance, given the seasonally lower sales volume, realized price increased in Brazil more than offset the negative impact of FX on our reported revenue. In Asia, the combination of poor weather condition, further portfolio rationalization, and a stronger U.S. dollar caused revenue to decline 22% compared to the second quarter last year. Moving on to the outlook for Ag Solutions. Our full-year segment earnings guidance remains unchanged at $380 million to $420 million. For the third quarter, we expect segment earnings of between $80 million and $90 million. At the midpoint of guidance, second-half segment earnings will increase by approximately 35% compared to 2015, driven by improved performance in Brazil and Latin America and additional cost savings from the Cheminova integration. The steps we have already taken to rationalize our product portfolio and reduce the level of FMC inventory in the sales channel leave us well-positioned as we enter the 2016-2017 crop season in the Americas. The relative stability of the Brazilian real over the past few months gives us increased confidence in our ability to recapture price despite tightening credit conditions for growers and weak market demand as channel inventory levels decline. We expect full-year segment earnings margin to be between 17% and 18%, which at the midpoint represents more than 250 basis points of improvement compared to 2015, driven by more favorable mix, improved pricing in Brazil, and realization of cost savings. We remain on track to deliver an incremental cost savings target of $60 million to $70 million in 2016, and a full run-rate cost savings of $140 million to $160 million by the middle of next year. Moving on to Health and Nutrition on slide 4. The business reported second quarter segment revenue of $195 million and segment earnings of $45 million dollars. Revenue declined approximately 6% and earnings declined approximately 11% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Results for the quarter were negatively impacted by worse-than-expected performance of Omega 3. The headwinds we saw in Omega 3 over the past year increased in the second quarter. Specifically, prices and volumes were much lower than anticipated. There is significant overcapacity in the industry, which, combined with lower demand for higher-concentration products, has exerted even greater pressure on prices than we saw earlier in the year. We have seen new entrants win business at prices that are close to cash cost of production, resulting in considerably lower volume for our products in certain key area. We have aggressively taken cost out of this business, with fixed cost falling by almost 40%. We continue to pursue new opportunities for high-end concentration products, but do not expect to recover this lost volume this year and do not anticipate a change in pricing levels any time soon. Excluding Omega 3, results were in line with expectations. In nutritional ingredients, volumes in the quarter were slightly below Q2 2015, largely due to timing as orders shifted to the second half of the year. In health excipients, sales volumes increased in all key pharmaceutical markets. Given performance to-date in Omega 3 and our expectations for the rest of the year, we are lowering our guidance for Health and Nutrition. We now expect full-year segment earnings to be in the range of $190 million to $196 million, roughly flat with 2015, and third quarter segment earnings to be in the range of $44 million to $48 million. We continue to expect operating margins of approximately 25% for the full year, helped by lower operating cost and improved production yields. Turning next to Lithium on slide 5. Lithium delivered another outstanding quarter. Revenue increased 15% year-over-year to $63 million, and segment earnings more than tripled to $16.5 million. Lithium's performance reflects the success of FMC's strategy of converting lithium carbonate into higher-value downstream specialty products, supported by strong manufacturing performance, especially in Argentina and at our Bessemer City hydroxide facility. Higher sales volume, higher average prices in all major product categories, improved mix and lower operating cost all contributed to deliver segment earnings above the top end of our prior guidance range, and pushed segment earnings margin to over 26% in the quarter. We expect supply/demand conditions to remain tight for the remainder of the year, as previously announced capacity expansions across the industry have been slow to come online. This reinforces our confidence in favorable pricing conditions through the remainder of 2016. For the full year, we expect segment earnings to be in the range of $58 million to $66 million, an increase at the midpoint of approximately 30% compared to prior guidance, and nearly three times segment earnings in 2015. Higher prices and lower operating cost compared to last year will support operating margins in the range of 24% to 25% for the year. We expect third quarter segment earnings to be in the range of $13 million to $17 million, as the benefit of higher prices will be partially offset by seasonally lower production and operations in Argentina. FMC's midterm business is positioned to deliver significant earnings growth in 2016 and beyond. In May, we announced plans to triple our production capacity of lithium hydroxide to 30,000 metric tons by 2019 in order to meet growing demand from our customers, starting with a 4,000 metric ton expansion scheduled to come online in 2017. Last week we announced we will accelerate that capacity expansion, and we now expect 8,000 metric tons to come online by the middle of 2017. We continue to evaluate the timing of further capacity expansion and expect the entire 20,000 metric tons of additional capacity to be online by 2017. We believe we will more than double the revenue and earnings of our lithium business between 2016 and 2020, resulting in over 20% per year growth through the rest of this decade. We recognize that our hydroxide investment plans require us to have cost effective access to sufficient lithium carbonate. Our current carbonate capacity is sufficient to support expansion in FMC's hydroxide production through at least 2018. Beyond this, we are actively pursuing multiple paths to ensure we are not carbonate constrained. First, we have several low-capital options to debottleneck our Argentina operations, potentially adding 20% capacity. Second, we are in ongoing discussions with multiple carbonate producers who have announced plans to add capacity in the coming years, and are exploring mutually beneficial long-term supply agreements or strategic partnerships. And of course, we retain the option to add significant capacity at our operation \u2013 our existing operations in Argentina, beyond the debottlenecking I just mentioned. Consequently, we are highly confident that excess lithium carbonate will not be a constraint in our ability to extend the hydroxide business in the coming years. Before I turn the call over to Paul, I will comment briefly on the outlook for the third quarter and full year 2016 on slide 6. As I mentioned, we are maintaining full-year segment earnings for Ag Solutions and adjusting our full-year earnings expectation for both Health and Nutrition and Lithium. As a result, on a consolidated basis we are increasing full-year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 at the midpoint to $2.60 to $2.90 per share. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $0.53 to $0.63. I will now turn the call over to Paul to discuss select financial results. Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Pierre. As usual, I'll start with the income statement, and specifically the tax rate. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year is now expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%, given there's a small benefit this quarter compared to Q2 last year. This lowered rate is largely due to the continued change in the mix of our earnings away from high-tax jurisdictions such as the U.S. toward regions where tax rates are lower. Foreign exchange was not a major factor in our results this quarter, with the stronger dollar mainly impacting the Ag Solutions segment. Various Asian currencies plus the Mexican peso were the drivers of the FX headwind in the quarter. The second quarter is not a period of significant activity in Brazil, and therefore, the recent strengthening of the reais had a limited impact on our financials in the quarter. However, with an FX rate in the quarter that was weaker than the same period of last year, and with a price list that largely reflected the current spot rate, the combined effect of price and currency in Brazil was a net positive to our second quarter earnings. Looking into the second half of the year, the recent stability in the reais-U.S. dollar exchange rate means that the assumptions regarding the future exchange rate that has underpinned our guidance is unchanged. To remind you, our guidance has assumed that we have a reais-to-U.S.-dollar rate that is relatively stable with no major short-term swings in the FX rate, combined with a price list that largely reflects the prevailing spot exchange rate. Sitting here today, both of those assumptions remain unchanged, and therefore, we do not expect either a positive or negative impact on our second half performance from the reais FX rate compared to our previous guidance, provided these conditions hold. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on slide 7. We continue to make progress in increasing our cash generation while maintaining discipline on capital spending. For the first half of the year, our adjusted cash from operations was 40% higher than the first half of last year, driven primarily by stronger working capital performance. We remain on target to meet our outlook for the full year of $450 million to $550 million of adjusted cash from operations. Net debt fell by $90 million compared to the first quarter and by over $120 million since the start of the year. The second quarter is an important period for us in terms of cash collections in Brazil. We remain very focused on the credit capacity of our customers, particularly given the constrained access to third-party financing for Brazilian growers. This has an impact on both our ability to collect cash from customers and our willingness to continue to extend credit in a form of new sales. On the first point, we were pleased with our performance in collecting in Brazil, with net cash collection slightly ahead of our expectations, and particularly good progress in collecting from our past-due balances. As a result, we saw a meaningful reduction in our Brazil receivables balance. However, it is still significantly higher than we would like, and we will remain focused on reducing our exposure in the coming quarters. The credit tightness in Brazil has been an important factor for us for several quarters now, with our willingness to extend credit to certain segments of the market reduced. As we head into the key second-half selling season in Brazil, our guidance reflects this disciplined approach to credit exposure. And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Paul. And before I continue with my remark, let me correct the statement I made. The 20,000 tons of additional lithium hydroxide capacity is to be online by 2019, not as I said 2017. So to continue and to conclude, I am very pleased with the overall execution of our strategy and improved outlook for the year. Despite ongoing challenges facing the agricultural industry, our strategy and the actions we have taken in the back end of 2015 and the first half of 2016 give us strong confidence in our performance for the remainder of the year. We have remained focused on reducing the level of FMC product inventory in the channel, maintained discipline on price and terms, aggressively managed our mix by rationalizing our product line, leading to stronger margins. This strategy, combined with the successful integration of Cheminova and a more benign FX situation in Brazil, have increased the predictability of our business and will drive the second-half performance of Ag Solutions, with earnings up 35% compared to pro forma results for 2015. We are investing in our technology road map in order to offer unique value-added solutions to our customers. We see high acceptance rates for our new product launches, including our biological platform, and remain on track to introduce our new active ingredients pipeline starting in 2017. Lithium continues to deliver strong performance, altering its product mix and increasing output to meet growing market demand. FMC's focused strategy has enabled the business to take advantage of favorable market conditions to realize significant earnings growth in 2016. Our announced capacity expansion strengthens FMC's leadership position in lithium hydroxide and specialty lithium applications, and will deliver further growth in the years to come. Health and Nutrition had a weaker than expected quarter. However, the business continues to generate high margins and returns, and demand across key nutritional and pharmaceutical markets multiple growth over the second half of the year. Finally, we are generating increased operating cash flow to improve our balance sheet. We are on track to increase adjusted cash from operations by approximately 40% in 2016. I thank you for your attention this morning. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for questions. Operator : We'll pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. And your first question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Perfect. Thank you very much. Can you just comment a little more on your longer-term expectations for your European business, given your shift, or I'd say rather evolution, of your go-to-market strategy, and then also parse out your views for Northwest Europe versus CIS? And then also you mentioned a product rationalization as well. Just any additional detail will be helpful. Thank you. Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions : Hi, Chris. This is Mark. Well, first of all, for Europe, obviously we now have a very different business model, with the acquisition of Cheminova. I think you can expect us to see, over the long haul, outperformance in the marketplace. Any it kind of fits in with your second question around CIS and Western Europe. We obviously have a bigger exposure in Western Europe with the Cheminova acquisition. But we see a lot of opportunity in the CIS countries, other parts of Eastern Europe in terms of Poland, Hungary, Czechy, Slovakia, as well as the Ukraine. Introduction of new technologies is important for us in Europe. The portfolio is strong. But with our pipeline, we have new products that will benefit both niche crops and especially cereals where Cheminova have exposure that FMC did not have. So, if you think of outperformance versus the market, it's really going to be cereals and the niche crops, especially in the south, and then accelerated growth in the east. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Perfect. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up. Can you just comment a little bit more about the working capital improvement you saw during the quarter? And then also on a go-forward basis, specifically how do you typically evaluate growth versus credit risk as we head into the third quarter with Brazil? And is it becoming more dependent on crop type, farm size or even region within Brazil? Just any comments on the puts and takes would be helpful. Thank you. Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. Let me touch on that. The working capital progress we made, really if you look at the cash flow improvement we had over last year and the first half of the year, you can really put almost all of that down to better collections in Brazil. So we've made significant progress over there. We've talked many times about the steps we're taking, and I can't point to any one thing that's changed that. It's about getting some momentum behind those collection conversations. Now in terms of growth versus credit, I'm not sure we really think about it that way. We think about credit in terms of credit. And we think about the ability of the customer to repay us, the stability of the customer and their access to finance. There are natural differences by crop and by region in Brazil, and we obviously factor all of that in the way that we go to market. But we have the same questions that we ask and the same standards that we set regardless of region or crop, essentially based on our confidence that we will recover the payments from our customers on the terms that we sell them to. That's the single largest factor that we consider. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's helpful. Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Go ahead. Go ahead. Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions : Yeah. The only thing I would add, Chris, is you know Brazil very well. Given where the exposure is, I would say the north \u2013 the Cerrado regions are where it is probably the most stressed. The south with the co-ops and the distribution channel is in better shape, and then sugarcane as well. Sugar industry has gone through a lot of challenges, but with the price of sugar today, they're in a better shape as they go forward into 2017. But it's definitely the north where the stress is. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you for the detail. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Hi. Good morning. Just staying in Brazil, you commented that you had a good destock of your own FMC product. Can you talk about where you're seeing your competitors for their \u2013 in the channel for inventories? I think we've seen commentary before that there has been over a year of products from your competitors? Thanks. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. No. We can't and we don't want to comment on competitors. It's sometimes quite difficult to understand the overall inventory in the channel. So really what we've been doing, and that's a change we started to make in the fourth quarter, is truly focusing on trimming down our own inventory of product. There is product in the channel, but really to comment specifically about our competitors would not make sense for us to do so. Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): If I look at your guidance, you seem to be implying a 300 or 400 basis point improvement in Ag Solution margin in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about that, where you see the big margin pickup in Q4 and how it's going to play out? Thanks. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Certainly, and I think the comments I would make are valid for the entire second half, is we are getting now into a position, if you look, compared to the back end of 2015, where there is multiple area of improvement. First of all, our product mix is getting much stronger than what it was. Our actions to walk away from a low-margin third-party more generic product is working very well. So we are increasing the margins of our product through mix. Second of all, we have been pretty successful over the last three or four quarters in moving the price. So with a situation looking at the importance of Brazil and Latin America in Q3 and Q4, and taking into account the pricing versus FX situation, we are in a stronger position. So a blend of stronger volume we're going to see in the second half of the year, a better mix because we are moving away from third-party product, and the pricing FX situation will lead to, first of all, to more predictable business. We have a much better visibility going into the second half of the year than we had in a long time, and with stronger margins for the business. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Pierre, you mentioned last call that Q2 in the Lithium business was when you were expecting some seasonal production weakness there, yet you were able to deliver well ahead of your guidance. Can you talk about what drove that upside during the quarter and whether there could be some potential upside as we look at your guidance for Q3 and Q4? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Certainly. I think that seasonal weakness is not only in Q2. It's in the back end of Q2 and through Q3. So, we've seen part of it and we're going to keep on seeing it. It's usually due to the fact that it is winter, there is more rainy season right now in Argentina where we're operating. So it's not only a Q2 phenomenon, it's the back of Q2, early Q3. I think the visibility we have today due to production is quite, quite correct at the earnings level. Mainly, there is multiple reasons which are we leading to the improved earnings. First of all, the mix. We are moving more business toward our lithium hydroxide, where we've been able to operate our plants quite well and where there is a healthy demand and pricing situation. Second of all, our plants have been operating also very well for carbonate production and we have been \u2013 and we're continuing to do that for the second half, selling more product made within the company than third-party product we would resell. And then there is some volume. So if look at the second half of the year, I think our earnings is quite in line with our expectation. I don't think there is a lot of upside. Most likely, what you will see is we decided not to change the revenue range, because we were a little bit below the middle point of the range initially. Looking at the demand for the back end of the year, it's most likely going to lead us toward the higher end of the range from the revenue standpoint. But I believe the earnings we have forecasted in lithium for Q3, Q4 are correct. Unless \u2013 I tell you, the only place where I could see upside, but it is not possible for us to predict that today, is pricing. Pricing is always something, depending upon demand and how capacity come on stream. So that one, we've made some assumption; you never know. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. And then a question just on the product rationalization that you did in Ag Solutions. Is that mostly legacy FMC products or are they some Cheminova products? And is there any more to come? Just trying to get a sense of whether we could see some additional pressure there. And at some point, do you hit a point where you could see some negative leverage as a result of scaling back on the number of products you're selling? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think the product rationalization is very well advanced today. I think it's a mix. It's as much from Cheminova legacy products as it is from FMC product. Both company used to resell third-party products as a service to customers. And the things you can afford to do at a given time with a very healthy market, you cannot do when the market is more tense. So it was a normal thing for us to move the way we had, very precisely define what those products could be. I'm very pleased with the speed at which the organization responded to it. I think more than half of the shortfall in our sales today in the second quarter is coming from product rationalization. But that's pretty much where it is. So you will not see numbers going beyond what we've talked about, which was a total run rate at the end of this year of $350 million, which is $100 million more than we did last year, we did $250 million last year, and this is it. There will be no further, as far as we can see, actions to be taken. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, gentlemen, and appreciate all the details and color. Hey, Pierre, I was struck by the comment that the inventory levels of insecticides are rather high in Brazil, and I guess I was thinking about Zika there. Does that offer any opportunity for you in that marketplace? Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions : Yeah. Frank, this is Mark. Yeah, we have seen increased sales of specific insecticides that we're providing to that vector control market. It's not huge though. Let's put it in perspective. It's not going to move the Ag business. It's a nice business to have. We have a leading position in Brazil, and we've seen that business grow over the last 18 months, and we expect it to continue with the way Zika is progressing through the region. But it's not going to be significant enough to really move the needle. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Interesting. I mean, as the geography of concern spreads, one would think that that would be an opportunity, I guess, just simplistically. How would you describe your market share in that application? Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions : It's pretty good. Why don't we just put it in perspective? The global public health market is about $700 million, and that's within the total ag space, crop protection chemicals, of over $51 billion. So really, for mosquito control, the market worldwide is about $325 million to $340 million, and the U.S. is about $90 million of that. So you can get a sense of the scale of that business. In particular applications we have a very good market share, not only with our pyrethroids, but with a product call malathion that we brought from Cheminova. So just keep it in perspective. I mean, people talk about it a lot, but the U.S. market is only $90 million out of that $700 million. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Mark, I appreciate you throwing a wet blanket on that thesis. And then, hey, lastly, Paul, you sounded more sanguine with respect to the FX impact for 2016. Do you have a size as to what you think the negative effect will be when all is said and done on the year? Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I wish I could predict FX markets that well, Frank. I mean, I wouldn't be in this job, I'm pretty confident around that. I think the key is that we seem to have more predictability around rates. We've seen the peso has been a surprising area for us. We didn't \u2013 I mean, we never see them coming. And Brazil has been \u2013 the reais has been kind of a bright spot, not because of the absolute rate, but as I mentioned, about the stability around the rates. And I think that's sort of the key for us, as we look forward, that stability of the rates and then the lack of surprises is more important to us on most of our business than the actual movements in the exchange rates. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you so much. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Daniel Jester with Citibank. Please go ahead. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning, everyone. What kind of visibility do you have in Health and Nutrition in the second half of this year? Your guidance seems to imply an acceleration in process, which seems seasonally maybe a little bit different than the past few years. So given sort of the comments that you called out about Omega 3, can you just walk us through some of the key drivers for the second half? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Certainly. You know, I think we do have a pretty good visibility on our three segments today, from a demand standpoint. But it is important to understand that the earnings growth, especially in the fourth quarter, is maybe more predictable because it is due to a cost situation. You know, we always work our cost and decrease our cost. But the way cost flows into operations depend upon the speed that you turn your product, and I think we call that capitalized variance. But the main reason for the bump in earnings in the back end of the year is due to the fact that we will be operating at a lower cost than we've been operating the other quarters and previous years. That is why you will see such a jump. So it is not due to a major turn in demand for any of our product, but much more the benefit of prior activity we've done on operational cost and manufacturing excellence. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, of the $60 million to $70 million of full-year cost synergies from Cheminova, can you quantify how much of that you realized in the first half? And then maybe just holistically, beyond just cost synergies, where do you see the integration process for Cheminova today? Thanks. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thanks. I think, at a run rate basis, we're going to close the half year, on the run-rate basis, in the $30 million to $40 million range for the first half of the year on the Cheminova. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You want \u2013 Mark? Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions : Do you want me to talk a little bit about the integration side? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions : From an integration perspective, we're very much done on the commercial side. That's all in place. A lot of the functional groups are also fully integrated and operating. We have some systems that we're still working through, SAP in Europe is an example, which will be completed early in the fourth quarter. And then the long-lead-time item is how we bring together the different manufacturing units, the tall manufacturing units and the formulating units. We are well progressed with that. We still have some to go, but that will occur over time. And the basic need there is to make sure that we have registrations as we move products around the world. So that's the rate-limiting step, but everything else is pretty much done by now. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think from a Cheminova integration, we're going to stop reporting. I mean, we'll answer any question you guys might have. But we can almost declare success. Everything is in place to which, as we discussed, by the middle next year the $140 million to $160 million run rate, the 800 to 900 positions being eliminated. So we are very much more than on track, ahead of initial schedule. And I think the \u2013 lots of the remaining activities are more under in Paul's shop around IT, SAP, finance integration, so much more back office integration than anything dealing with the front end of the business. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Thank you, and good morning everyone. I was wondering if you could talk about the expected lithium capacity \u2013 lithium carbonate capacity increase in 2017. Based on what you see in here in the marketplace, is that coming onstream a lot of it in the first half of 2017, and therefore would have a negative impact on pricing? Thomas Schneberger - VP & Global Business Director- Lithium Division : Thank you, Rosemarie. Yes. We're starting to see some exchange of volumes coming on even in the back half of 2016, mostly out of the new spodumene capacity that's coming online in Australia. As you know, there's also some capacity in Chile and there's been capacity ramping up in Argentina, targeting back end of 2016 and early 2017. So these are the volumes that we're watching, and I characterize it, could be anywhere between 50,000 tons to 75,000 tons by early 2017. So, as Pierre has commented earlier, this is where we make a pricing assumption, and we're monitoring the conditions as we interact with customers, in terms of pricing expectations. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: And that particular capacity addition is going to be smaller than the demand increase, isn't it? And therefore, pricing is going to come down across the board, including lithium hydroxide, or you don't think so? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : First, yes, there will be \u2013 we are expecting, as time goes, turning in 2017 and into 2018, we're expecting carbonate pricing to go more toward normal pricing, which mean a lower pricing we are currently seeing, when they will be more of a balance between the carbonate demand and the supply. It will not impact the hydroxide pricing. If you look right now, and if you put together all of the hydroxide capacity increase, which actually we are leading, they are very much in line with the demand increase. So from a pricing standpoint, we might not see hydroxide rising tremendously in the year to come, but I think we'll be in a healthy pricing situation for the next three to four years. Thomas Schneberger - VP & Global Business Director- Lithium Division : And just to add a little bit to that, Rosemarie, in our hydroxide business, we're targeting specific segments of that demand, where it's high quality hydroxide, where they're willing to pay for the quality we bring to the market. So when we look at supply/demand, we're looking even specifically at that customer mix, versus ones that might trade off to carbonate or other supply. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Thanks. And my second question deals with the inventory, overall inventory in the Ag sector. You said that you have lowered the FMC product inventories, but without talking about any specific competitors. What do you see in terms of the overall inventory channel? Is it declining or is it still growing or more or less at a flat \u2013 has it plateaued? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think from a \u2013 as I said and want to repeat, we are mostly focusing on our inventory. But overall, if I would have or if we would have to make an overall statement, we believe overall inventory in the channel is declining. We do not believe right now we are at a turning point from a market standpoint. But we can see we are at a place where the dialogue with the customer is changing. There is more certainty, there is more predictability. It still means that the inventory in the channel is pretty heavy. We are not yet at a situation where it is not. But the dialogue is changing, and I believe everybody's trying to do their bit to decrease their inventory. We believe we most like are the most aggressive. But overall, I think the situation is improving. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you. Two things. Paul, you talked about the longer time line for rationalization of the manufacturing in Europe. Is that sort of a 2020 time goal in your mind, or is there a specific target in your mind? And then the second question, to Latin America again. As we think about the working capital cycles in cotton and sugarcane, is your penetration in that market permanently shifting your working capital cycle in a material way? My understanding is Cheminova managed working capital much differently than you did, using more receivables, for example. I'm curious whether that has all shifted over to your way of doing things? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Let me address first the question on the manufacturing rationalization. Right now, we are at a place where we have a stable manufacturing network for Ag business. We are always looking at improving, but any improvement, any decision today is always a mid- to long-term decisions because there is some product registrations which are changing when you do a change of manufacturing. So I have to say that right now, as any company would do, we are keeping our options open. But we are in what I would call a stable manufacturing network. And we will see, as time goes what are the best decisions to be taken for our business in terms of network. But today we are not penalized by the structure we have, and it's a matter of dong continuous improvement and being able to supply what will be requested by the market at the time when the market turns around. Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : So, you're comfortable then not being quite as asset-light as you had been, sort of in the medium term? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We are asset-light. I think if you think about FMC prior to the acquisition of Cheminova, our manufacturing cost was 95%, asset-light. I would say today maybe we're at 90%. We should not believe that the fact that we have a plant in India, in Panoli and the plant we have in are fundamentally changing the mix of products which are made at all manufacturers, versus what is being made today. Those are big plants. But in the big scheme of things, their production capacity versus what we do with our total network is fairly small. So, it is not a fundamental departure to what we used to be in the past. Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Let me just on the working capital question down there in Brazil, sugarcane and cotton can have very, very different terms. Cotton tends to be longer term. Sugarcane tends to be much shorter term, although that does vary, depending on the nature of the planting cycles and on the financial health of the sugarcane guys. But as a rule, as we shift it away from cotton, we'll expect to see our working capital terms come in, and towards sugarcane also does the same thing. I would not, though, expect that you're going to have to track that through our working capital balances, as you look at it. It's definitely a factor that helps, but it's not so large that you're going to really see a major movement in our numbers. In terms of how Cheminova approached it, Cheminova \u2013 let's just separate the two important differences. Cheminova did not have a different approach to working capital than anybody else in the industry. They did have a different approach to how they financed that working capital. And to be blunt, as a weak-balance-sheet company with very unsophisticated treasury operations, there used to be some very, very expensive local financing in Brazil, which can give the impression that they're reducing their working capital. It was appropriate for a non-U.S.-GAAP reporter. It was appropriate for a sub-investment grade company. It was incredibly expensive, and will certainly factor into why their overall profitability was so low, and it's certainly not something we intend to do. Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you. What is the current competitive environment in Latin America and North America? Do you see your competitors generally being more disciplined on crop protection prices? Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions : Well, obviously, I'm not going to talk about what the competition is doing on price. I'll tell you where we are. As Pierre said earlier, we're doing everything we can to make sure we manage price and terms across North America, and certainly in Brazil where we have reduced our exposure to the Brazilian market by taking out, through product rationalization, a significant amount of volume and revenue. But we're very focused on making sure that we maximize price, not only in terms of pricing but across the portfolio of what we're selling. I think you're going to see all sorts of different activities as we go through the next year. But for us, it's very much around protecting the margins, protecting the value of the business, and certainly looking after working capital. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think in term of pricing, just to get back to one of the comments Paul made around the balance of FX and pricing, as you know, we tend to have a rule in Brazil where we index price on currency. Last year, we were, with our pricing, running after the currency and trying to move up our price. This year, the same process of adjusting pricing to currency is going the other way, which means this is not any longer us asking the customers to take higher price, but the customer asking us to lower the price more to other currency. So, needless to say that for all of us, regardless of what behavior individual companies would take, it is an easier conversation from the predictability of the pricing. I think this FX situation give us a much better position to talk about pricing, more control in term of understanding pricing in the next two quarters. And I think it's got to apply to every company. It is just an FX price situation. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you. Very helpful. And turning to Europe and crop protection, you have some revenue declines there. How much of that was your move to direct market? And was it a one-time impact, or is there any way to improve that next year? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. The direct market situation is a one-time impact. It is just a couple of situations which happen all the time when you do this kind of a transfer. First of all, you work with your distribution network, which you're moving away from. Those guys have inventory, they have stock, they are filling it while you're replenishing your own, now, warehouses to sell. So there is a period of time where you have two networks which have to overlap for a little while, and you have to give the time to your distributors to sell the product they were supposed to sell in the past by contract. Second of all, you are at a stage also so where your distributors are not replenishing their inventory in advance. So, by the time we get into \u2013 this is happening as a transition now. Our belief is by the time we get into European season, Q1, Q2 next year, we should be in a very normalized situation and it will be stable for the future. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you very much. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys. Just curious, you maintained your outlook for the crop protection markets this year, down mid- to high-single-digit. What was it down in the first half, and just trying to gauge what the expectation is for the second half in terms of demand? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So I think in the first half, the way I would look at it, Mike, is when we give a range, we say mid-single-digit to high-single-digit, maybe we were thinking about more toward, when we started this process, the lower end of the range, maybe 5%, 6%, 7%. We are more today on a 7%, 8%, more toward the higher end of the range. And that is maybe less due to channel inventory than it was to specific reasons in Asia and Europe, mostly driven by weather. So for us, when you look at the market, if you remember, we were thinking about North America and Latin America in the higher end of the range, and this being helped by a flattish to slightly down market in Europe and Asia. We don't see that any longer. I mean, we still see North America and Latin America on the high end of the range, but we see Asia and Europe being down in the 5%, 6% for this year. That is why, today, we are looking at maybe more the higher end of our range. For us, what we've been doing is we've been able, no matter what, to protect earnings by being even more drastic on pricing, more drastic on product rationalization. So we'll be slightly lower on sales, but we believe we're going to be \u2013 we're going to have very solid performance in the second half, and predictability on the earnings side. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. And then for the fourth quarter for Ag Solutions, you talked about better visibility than in the past. But just curious, what sort of gets you to the high end of the range? I mean, it's pretty wide in terms of the top end, given your guidance for Ag Solutions in the third quarter, and the low end. What sort of gets you to the top? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I would say always the same answer. When we give a middle of the range, it is under normal circumstances from a demand and weather standpoint. In those, there is always a range. You just need an infestation, you just need very strong insect pressure or other pressure, and you will drive that either to the lower or either to the higher end. Today, we believe we are very comfortable with the middle of the range. To see anything going up or down would be due to external events, not linked to channel inventory or anything of that kind, but much more to specific agricultural seasonal situations. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Mostly weather. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investment. Please go ahead. Peter E. Butler - Glen Hill Investment Research : Hey, good morning. Pierre, early on regarding lithium, you folks had a conservative outlook on shorter term lithium growth, but you saw good possibilities longer term, and this outlook has been proven correct. What do you see now for the longer term growth of lithium? And how do \u2013 how does your research pipeline on lithium derivatives look compared to what you're seeing from competitors, and how does this change your future position on earnings and cash flow growth, et cetera? Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Peter. Yes. So lithium, I have to say we do have increased confidence in the future today. We believe this market is getting more and more solid. I have to say that we are still prudent. But the big breakthrough for us is technology we're able to develop from a manufacturing standpoint, allowing us to, at a very low capital spend and efficient cost of operations, ability to create 4,000 tons to 8,000 tons modules for lithium hydroxide instead of having to build, in one shot, a 20,000 tons or 30,000 tons. So today we do have an improved view and more certain view of what lithium hydroxide is doing, but all the work we've done over the last two years was to develop a manufacturing process allowing us to follow the demand growth, which means that if the growth is not as we're expecting, we can stop one or two of these modules manufacturing and slow down the capacity increase we have planned. If the demand becomes more aggressive, very easy for us to speed up the building of those modules. So first to your question, yes, we have increased confidence. Our strategy is very highly focused on the downstream product where we have the highest profitability. Third, we have a safety net around demand by this manufacturing process we have in place, so allowing to match the demand. Where are we on our forecast? We are taking pretty much a middle of the range. We are far in a process and predictability for the numbers I gave to you to take the highest prediction from EV companies. So, that was the upside, but you know we are prepared also for the downside. And maybe I'll ask Tom to comment on the technology. Thomas Schneberger - VP & Global Business Director- Lithium Division : Yes, and thanks for the question. On the technology, we've got a technology roadmap, and I'd say that with this strategy that we've undertaken on the high value products, the biggest shift is increased collaboration and formalized collaboration with our customers. So we do have a number of exciting opportunities that are being discussed with customers and being trialed with customers, and we're looking forward to that. It will continue to add to high quality sales of new lithium derivatives and new applications of existing lithium derivative. Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : As this was the last question let me close with a couple of words before I hand the closing comments to Brian. I think we went through those two quarters very highly focused on delivering what we promise to do. Everything we've done in the two quarters has done a few things for us. First of all I believe, from an ag standpoint, if any of the market are not yet returning to the level of growth these kind of markets could expect to see one day, we have improved highly our control, visibility and predictability of our own business. I think from the lithium standpoint, it is a bright spot for us. We have refined our strategy. And I have to say, the breakthrough we had in technology around lithium hydroxide manufacturing are an enormous win for us looking at the future. Health and nutrition, the business is solid. The business is highly profitable. But we also understand the challenges we have on Omega-3, and it's something we'll be focusing in the quarters to come. So with this, I am going to tell to call back to Brian. Brian P. Angeli - Vice President, Corporate Strategy and Development : Thank you, Pierre. As always, appreciate the time and the questions. I'll be available following the call to address any further questions that you may have. So with that, thank you and have a good day.

Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call for the FMC Corporation. Phone lines will be placed on a listen-only mode throughout the conference. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer period. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Brian Angeli, Vice President, Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Mr. Angeli, you may begin. Brian P. Angeli - FMC Corp.: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to FMC Corporation's third quarter 2016 earnings call. Joining me today is Pierre Brondeau, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Pierre will begin the call with a review of FMC's third quarter performance and discuss the outlook for Q4 and full year 2016. Paul will provide an overview of select financial results. The slide presentation that accompanies our results, along with our earnings release and 2016 outlook statement, are available on our website, and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available at the conclusion of the call. As with our prior calls, Mark Douglas, President, FMC Agricultural Solutions; Eric Norris, President, FMC Health and Nutrition; and Tom Schneberger, Vice President and Global Business Director, FMC Lithium, will join to address questions. Before we begin, let me remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including but not limited to those factors identified in our release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references, and pro forma revenue and segment earnings for FMC Agricultural Solutions. A reconciliation and definition of these terms, as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call, are provided on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Q3 2016 was another strong quarter, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy. FMC reported revenue of $808 million, adjusted operating profit of $134 million and adjusted EPS of $0.67. Adjusted EPS increased approximately 60% compared to the third quarter of 2015, exiting the top-end of our guidance range of $0.53 to $0.63. Our performance in the quarter was driven largely by the results of Ag Solutions and Lithium, both of which reported a significant year-over-year increase in segment earnings. In Ag Solutions, compared to last year, we saw an improved start of the season in Latin America especially in Brazil, a stronger performance in both Asia and North America. Lithium continued to benefit from higher prices, improved mix and lower operating costs. Third quarter segment earnings in Health and Nutrition were slightly below 2015 but in-line with our expectations. The lower tax rate in the quarter contributed approximately $0.03 to adjusted EPS. As noted in our outlook statement and as Paul will discuss later in the call, we expect to continue to report a lower tax rate for the remainder of the year and into 2017. Based on our performance in the third quarter and on our outlook for Q4, we are revising the range of our full-range adjusted EPS guidance to $2.76 to $2.86 per share. At the midpoint, this represents an increase of $0.06 per share compared to the prior guidance, and an increase of $0.14 compared to adjusted EPS for 2015. I will provide more detail on the outlook for Q4 shortly but first, I will discuss third quarter results for each of our three segments starting with Ag Solutions on slide two. For the third quarter, Ag Solutions reported revenue of $559 million and segment earnings at the top of our guidance range of $90 million. Compared to the third quarter 2015, revenue declined 3% as lower sales volume in Brazil more than offset the benefit of higher prices in that country and volume growth in other regions. Year-over-year price increases were largest in Brazil, where we continue to recover pricing in U.S. dollar terms. Segment earnings increased over 50% and margin improved 600 basis points as higher realized prices, improved mix and favorable foreign exchange more than offset the impact of lower volumes and slightly higher costs in the quarter. Costs were higher principally as the result of the timing between quarters of certain expenses. For the full year, we remain on track to achieve our integration cost savings target. Turning to slide 3, I will provide additional comments on Ag Solutions' regional performance and discuss the outlook for Q4, starting with Latin America. Revenue in the region declined 18% in the quarter, driven largely by lower sales volumes in Brazil, general market weakness, ongoing product rationalization effort, and our decision to allow channel inventory levels to reduce. Each contributed to the decline in sales volume in Brazil. The elimination of low-margin third-party products accounted for over 50% of the volume decline in the quarter. Revenue in the rest of Latin America was roughly flat compared to 2015. In Argentina, we continued to see increasing demands for FMC's Authority herbicides. (7:15) In Mexico, our focus on high-value crops is helping to offset the impact of a broader market decline. The actions we have taken throughout the past year in Brazil enabled us to realize significant increases in U.S. dollar-based pricing, improve operating margin and drive collections in the quarter. Price actions increased operating earnings in Brazil by about 30% year-over-year, which, combined with lower operating cost, returned operating margins to 2014 levels. Our actions in Brazil also enabled the business to reduce accounts receivables in the country and generate cash collections of over $200 million, a significant improvement over our performance in the same quarter last year. Moving on to Asia, revenue in the region grew by 9% in the quarter compared to 2015, driven mainly by increased sales volume throughout the regions. Improving weather conditions in Australia created strong demand for our L-grade (08:48) herbicide and for fungicide's portfolio. A return to a more normal monsoon season in India and Southeast Asia supported increased demand for insecticide and fungicide, with strong growth in Indonesia for rice applications. In Europe, revenue increased 6% in the quarter. Increased sales synergies and higher volume in Eastern Europe as we expand our direct market access, coupled with strong herbicide sales in the UK more than offset challenging conditions in Northwest Europe. In North America, revenue in the quarter increased 46% to 2015's. We saw higher sales volumes related to new product introduction for winter and spring wheat and increased demand for herbicide. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect market conditions to remain largely unchanged. We are cautiously optimistic regarding Q4 in Latin America, given the start of the selling seasons in Brazil and strong demand for FMC product elsewhere in the region. However, we are more cautious on market conditions in North America, where we expect weak market conditions into 2016-2017 crop season. For the fourth quarter, we expect segment earnings to be between $117 million and $137 million. At the midpoint, this implies segment earnings growth of approximately 25% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Improved U.S. dollar pricing in Brazil and lower cost year-over-year are expected to drive a meaningful increase in segment earnings margins in the quarter from 15% in 2015 to closer to 20%. We are pleased with the progress made in Ag Solutions to drive margin improvement in the business. Prior to the acquisition of Cheminova, Ag Solutions consistently delivered consolidated operating margins between 20% and 25%. And we are well on our way to returning margins to that level. We are tightening our full year segment earnings guidance to $390 million to $410 million with the midpoint of our range unchanged and continue to forecast full year revenue of about $2.3 billion at the midpoint. Turning next to Health and Nutrition on slide 4, for the third quarter, Health and Nutrition reported revenue of $179 million and segment earnings of $45 million. Revenue declined 9% year-over-year largely as a result of lower volume, timing of sales to certain pharma customers in Asia and Europe, and headwinds from Omega-3; each contributed to the volume decline. Segment earnings of $45 million declined 4% compared to 2015. However, operating margins improved 120 basis points, to over 25% in the quarter. The negative impact of lower volumes and product mix was largely offset by lower operating costs as a result of ongoing operating excellence programs. For the fourth quarter, we expect segment earnings of between $53 million and $57 million, and for the full-year, forecast segment earnings to be in the range of $190 million to $194 million. At the midpoint, Q4 segment earnings are expected to increase almost 20% compared to Q4 2015. The bulk of the increase in segment earnings is due to the timing of certain favorable cost variances from prior period which will drive segment earnings margins to between 29% and 30% in the quarter. For the full year, we expect margin of about 25% to 26%. Moving on to Lithium on slide 5. Lithium delivered another outstanding quarter. Revenue increased 22% to $70 million on the back of increased price and more favorable mix. Segment earnings rose to $18 million from just $2 million last year. Market conditions remain favorable with demand increasing ahead of supply. As a result, prices across the portfolio were higher compared to the last year. These price increases, combined with the most favorable sales mix, lower cost and a benefit from foreign currencies, drove the improvement in segment earnings and margin in the quarter. We expect the positive momentum in Lithium to continue with fourth quarter segment earnings between $16 million and $20 million, approximately 60% higher year-over-year, at the midpoint of the range. Based on Lithium's performance to-date and their expectation for Q4, we are increasing full year guidance for segment earnings by $5 million at the midpoint to a range of $65 million to $69 million. Full year segment earnings margin should be about 25% compared to 10% in 2015. Before turning the call over to Paul, I will comment briefly on the outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 on slide 6. We are tightening full year segment earnings guidance for both Ag Solutions and Health and Nutrition and increasing guidance for Lithium. Based on these segment guidance and the lower tax rate which Paul will discuss in a moment, we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.92 and full year adjusted EPS in the range of $2.76 to $2.86. I will now turn the call over to Paul. Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Pierre. I'll start with the tax rate and the non-controlling interest on the income statement, before I move on to the impact of currency cash flow and the balance sheet. So, first tax. Year-to-date, our adjusted effective tax rate is around 23.5%, which is slightly lower than we initially expected. This is driven by an increase in the contribution of earnings from our foreign entities compared to prior years. And while this trend is most apparent in Ag Solutions, we're actually seeing it in all of our businesses. We expect the adjusted effective rates to be in the 23% to 24% range for the fourth quarter. And looking into 2017, we expect that rate may fall by as much as 3 percentage points resulting in a full year adjusted effective tax rate closer to 21%. This further reduction is mainly the result of the operational integration of Cheminova, which will impact our supply chain and our earnings mix globally. Our noncontrolling interest line continues to shrink as part of the integration of Cheminova and taking advantage of opportunities to simplify the ownership structure of some of our international entities and are taking or have taken steps to consolidate ownership in places such as Argentina, China and Eastern Europe. Largely as a result of these steps, we expect the noncontrolling interest line to fall to approximately $5 million this year and remain near this level next year. Touching on currency, this quarter saw none of the rapid movements in major currencies that we saw last year. And, as a result, FX had a far smaller impact on our results. Across all businesses and regions, currency was a tailwind to earnings with a large favorable movement in Brazil, the biggest factor. The other major currencies for which FMC is exposed, namely the euro and the RMB, had no meaningful impact on our earnings in the quarter. For the year-to-date, the currency has been broadly neutral to earnings. Moving on to cash flow and slide 7. The first thing I want to point out is our increase in cash flow guidance for full year from a range of $450 million to $550 million to a range of $550 million to $600 million. The midpoint of this revised guidance reflects an increasing cash generation of almost 60% compared to 2015. Higher earnings, stronger working capital performance and tightened spending discipline will all contribute to the year-over-year increase and give us confidence that the higher level of cash generation we've seen through the first three quarters will continue through Q4. Underpinning our confidence in cash generation is our success in reducing our Brazil exposure. Through September, we collected over $500 million of receivables in Brazil, reducing the outstanding receivable balance by over $200 million. By the end of 2016, we expect to have collected over $700 million of outstanding receivables in Brazil alone. Equally importantly, a significant proportion of the collections are coming from those accounts that were past due at the start of the year, improving the quality of the remaining receivables balance. Our receivables balance in Brazil, however, remains higher than we believe it should be, and we expect to continue to reduce it over the coming seasons. Based on our current visibility, we believe that we have the ability to reduce the current balance by approximately $400 million. We will deliver this reduction over the next 18 months to 24 months. Our strong cash generation has helped us reduce our net debt by over $200 million so far this year, and we expect this to fall further by year-end. Combined with higher trailing EBITDA, our adjusted net debt-to-LTM EBITDA ratio will fall into the 2.5 times to 3 times range as we enter 2017. We will continue to manage our debt to a level consistent with our current credit rating. And looking into 2017, we expect that capital expenditure to remain similar to 2016 at or just ahead of depreciation, even allowing for our planned expansions in Lithium Hydroxide. We will continue to seek out opportunities to invest in technologies and products for our Ag Solutions business. And at an appropriate time, in 2017, we would expect to revisit our ability to engage in share repurchases while maintaining our other net debt, credit rating and investment objectives. And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Before closing, I would like to share a few initial thoughts regarding 2017 on slide 8. Based on what we see today, we expect the global crop protection chemical market to be about flat in 2017, creating a more stable operating environment for FMC Ag Solutions. Market demand in Europe and Asia continues to grow and more normal weather conditions should lead to an improved demand environment in those regions next year. While it remains very early to predict the market crop protection chemicals in Latin America, we are pretty confident that we will enter 2017 with better market fundamentals than either of the previous two seasons. In contrast, we expect market conditions in North America to remain challenging as we do not believe that the market-wide de-stocking process has run its course and that elevated levels of channel inventory combined with low-commodity prices will dampen grower demand across the region. In a flat market and assuming stable currencies, we believe Ag Solutions is well-positioned to deliver another year of growth in segment earnings. Revenue synergy opportunities in Europe and North America, planned new product introductions and continued cost savings will more than offset cost inflation. Our primary view is that Ag Solutions' segment earnings will grow by high single-digit percent in 2017. In Health and Nutrition, next year, we expect growth rate for revenue and segment earnings to return to historical levels both low- to mid-single digit percent. In Lithium, the combination of higher prices, increased lithium hydroxide volume and continued cost discipline should increase segment earnings by about 40% in 2017. We expect to realize higher prices in all major downstream products next year, with the most significant increase in lithium hydroxide. The multi-year lithium (24:00) hydroxide contracts are negotiated in the fourth quarter. And based on the status of customer negotiations to-date, we expect the average realized price to be significantly higher in 2017. We also expect to see a meaningful increase in the production of lithium hydroxide next year as a result of our previously announced capacity expansion. Construction of our hydroxide unit is ahead of schedule. Based on the current construction timeline, we expect production of lithium hydroxide to increase by 4,000 metric tons in 2017, with total production capacity increasing to 18,000 metric tons per year by the middle of next year. Feeding the growth in demand for FMC's downstream lithium product requires access to increasing volume of lithium carbonate. Earlier this week, we announced an agreement with Nemaska Lithium to source 8,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate per year, beginning in mid-2018. These agreements represent only one element of our sourcing strategy and we are actually pursuing multiple paths to diversify our carbonate source. In the near term, we will increase capacity at our Argentina operations by approximately 20% to low capital cost action. We continue to evaluate long-term supply agreements and partnerships with other producers of lithium carbonate, and we retain the option of expanding our carbonate production operation in Argentina in order to ensure we have a secure, reliable and cost-competitive supply of lithium carbonate. At the corporate level, we expect costs to remain roughly flat and to continue to reduce debt. Combined with a lower tax rate for 2017, as Paul mentioned earlier, we expect to grow EPS at a faster rate than we grow operating earnings. Consistent with prior years, we will provide more details and specific guidance for 2017 in February when we report our Q4 and full year 2016 results as we first need to see how the year ends and assess business and market conditions at that time. To conclude, I am very pleased with the performance in the quarter and year-to-date. In volatile markets, FMC has continued to execute its strategy and deliver substantial growth in earnings. I believe we are positioned to continue this in Q4 and beyond. We continue to invest in our technology pipeline in Ag Solutions and are launching new products that bring greater value to the grower. Last month, we announced that FMC has begun the registration process in North America over Bixafen fungicide, (27:42) one of the nine active ingredients in our R&D pipeline. With our unique high return R&D model for active ingredients innovation and strong regional formulation capabilities, FMC is well-positioned to deliver the technology and service that growers demand. We will provide additional information regarding our technology pipeline in the coming months. Health and Nutrition continues to generate high margins and strong cash flow, and demand across our core nutrition and health market continues to grow. We are in the process of commissioning our new MCC production facility in Thailand, which will serve the growing nutrition markets in Asia. Demand for our downstream retail products continues to increase. FMC is well-positioned to maintain its leading position in lithium hydroxide, butyl-lithium and lithium metals, and we continue to pursue multiple paths to diversify our resources of lithium carbonate to feed the expected growth in the business. Our agreement with Nemaska is just the first step and we look forward to announcing more actions in 2017. In closing, the actions we are taking will continue to drive performance across our businesses and position FMC to deliver increasing value to our shareholders into 2017 and beyond. I thank you for your attention this morning. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question today comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. Your results far exceeded what your peers have been indicating for European crop protection growth, especially in 3Q. And you mentioned some things in your presentation such as direct market access across Eastern Europe and strong herbicide sales in the UK. But can you just talk a little bit more about the longer-term key drivers in the market, let's say, over the next two years? Are we in the early innings of the Eastern European theme and what's the latest update on new registrations? Thank you. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Hey, Chris. This is Mark. You highlighted the points that we put out in the release regarding how we grew in Europe. I think, for us, going forward in the next few years, it's very much what we've just said in terms of direct market access. We're very pleased with what we see in Eastern Europe, but we're working off a pretty small base. And we have the JV that we had in Czechoslovakia, Poland. It's important for us to expand in that area, but we shouldn't forget that France, Germany, the UK, Spain, Italy, they're all important markets where we intend to put new products into the pipeline. We do have new products coming next year and the year after, that are based upon our Clomazone franchise for herbicides. So, we expect to see significant growth in herbicides as we move forward. And, in addition, with the acquisition of Cheminova, we've also, as we've said, expanded our fungicide portfolio. So you'll see us grow our European fungicide business substantially over the next three to five years. That's mainly the growth for us. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: And, Chris, remember that many of the products FMC was selling in Europe are registered today in places like France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Southern Europe, UK. We were just not benefiting from a very strong sales organization as we were working with a distribution network, which was mostly focused on Northern Europe. So, even without adding many registration, which we will, and we have new product coming, we just have to start to increase our face-to-face presence with the market is going to dramatically increase our immediate growth. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. And just a quick follow-up, can you just also quickly comment on where you think the insecticide inventory issue is in Brazil and how that may or may not affect the market heading into 2017? And also, you've seen some recent spikes in sugar and cotton prices, could you just quickly comment on the conversations you're having with those customers, as I imagine they've been better than they have been over the last couple of years. Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yes. I think we are always very careful when we talk about level of product inventory in the channel overall at the market level. But the situation in Brazil, including for insecticide, is right now feeling, I would say, more stable. As you can see, year-on-year numbers show a decrease in sales, in addition to the product rationalization. So we believe there is actions which are being taken for insecticides and other product to decrease the level of inventory in the channel. The discussions with growers are better. They are easier on pricing, they are easier on term and our volume are more predictable. So, we do believe it is decreasing. We don't believe it's decreasing fast enough to create a very robust 2017 number, but I would say we want to be entering 2017 in a more stable situation and more flattish market than we did in the previous two years. Mark, do you want to comment on the sugarcane? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah, sure. Chris, well, you mentioned cotton and sugarcane, obviously important crops for FMC down in Brazil. I'm more confident in sugarcane than I am in cotton. As we've talked about, and Paul alluded to, in terms of collections, we've been very prudent in our exposure to certain areas of Brazil and certain, and crops. I would say the cotton growers have faced a very tough time in the north due to the drought. So, liquidity is important for them and we're watching that situation very carefully. Acres are expected to be flat to slightly down in Brazil as we go forward into the next season. Switching to sugarcane, you're right, sugar prices are at least double where they were last year. Ethanol prices are up in Brazil. So, the fundamentals for the business is good. The one thing they're lacking right now is liquidity, given all the debts they've incurred over the last few years. We're ideally positioned. We have strong market shares in insecticides and herbicides. Planting is down right now, probably about 30% due to that liquidity. But I think as the business unwinds next year, I'm very confident that our sugarcane business will grow next year and be a good buffer for some of the other downsides we might see in cotton. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Helpful. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Just to repeat, Chris, I want to use your question to make sure that we are clear. But we are continuing with a \u2013 it's a different strategy but, really, we are not focused on volume at all today. I mean, what is very important for us today is pricing our technology where it should be priced, decreasing the level of our product in the channel, getting terms which are right and collecting. We believe the market is such that this is the right strategy which will make us much stronger when we get into a situation where the market turns around. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Very helpful color. Thank you. Operator : Our next question today comes from the line of Daniel Jester with Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning, everyone. Maybe I can just follow up on Chris' question in a different way. I think you said that low-margin product in Brazil which you're exiting, it should relate to (36:20) 60% of the volume decline in the quarter. So, maybe can we just talk about what's driving the 40% of the rest of the volume decline? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: There is two things which are driving the remaining 40%. First of all, we believe, and we'll confirm that at the end of the fourth quarter, but we are believing that \u2013 we believe that we are in a situation in Brazil where the market will still be down in the 10% range year-on-year for the full year, so there is a market driver. There is also the fact that we are moving away from sales, not because of rationalization, but because of credit risks or term. We are very cautious in not selling for the sake of selling. We are selling when we know we can get no more terms for the region and we will be able to collect. So, as I said before, volume is not the priority. So, those are the three reasons. Sales, which are safe, with good terms, market which will decline and product rationalization, those are the three drivers. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, I think you also commented that operating margins in Brazil are sort of approaching where you were in 2014, but I think for the Ag segment as a whole, margins are still below 2014 levels. So, can you comment on the other regions and where you see margins stay and how maybe they can improve into 2017? Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I think that if you look at when we made the acquisition of Cheminova, acquiring Cheminova would bring to us many benefit in term of creating more global business, a broader fungicide portfolio, a direct access to market in Europe and other benefits, more solid performance in \u2013 more solid market presence in India and Australia. But we also realized that the margins Cheminova was realizing were not at the level of what we're expecting, and we had a plan to bring those margins through cost saving, pricing and new product introductions to the historical level of FMC. And that's the road we are on. I have to say that despite the market condition, the year-end has \u2013 after closing on the Cheminova acquisition, we have brought back those margin to 20%, which is well in, for the fourth quarter, which is well in-line, even ahead of our schedule. We still have work to do. We still have \u2013 remember, we still have additional costs to extract from the business, from the acquisition in the next six months to nine months. So, we see that work. But we are well on our way to margin north of 20%. It is just integration of Cheminova, the pricing of the technology and the new product introduction but we are well on our roadway right now. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll go to the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Good morning. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Eric, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the cost structure and some of the key margin drivers that you saw in Health and Nutrition this quarter? Did we see any of the variance impacts during this quarter that you mentioned you're going to be seeing in the fourth quarter? Eric W. Norris - FMC Corp.: Hey, Mike. Eric here. So, it's a complicated question because the costs that flow through at any one quarter are related to a variety of factors, where a lot of it is stemming from manufacturing, excellence programs. So, that's a sustainable component. However, as we talked about and the guidance Pierre gave for the fourth quarter, we'll see benefits stem from things such as seasonality and how we harvest seaweed, right? There are times of the year, particularly off the coast of Norway where we get a higher quality seaweed, we have more access to the waters because of the favorable weather, what-have-you, that drive one-off opportunities in costs. And the way our variances work, that flows through and it's part of the benefit we see in the fourth quarter. I want to make sure, does that answer the question you're after? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Mike, maybe to answer a little bit more your question, if you look at previous years, it is not an abnormal situation to see \u2013 you could see it maybe not to the same extent, but you can see it through the 2015 results, where you would see higher margin in Q4 than you would see in Q3. So, we realize over the year a 25% margin for the business, but we recognized that there is some seasonality to a margin in this business. So, there is not always a connection between a margin improvement you will see in Q4 and what you could realize in Q3. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Yeah. I guess the question that I had, Eric, also had to do with the weakness in volumes during the third quarter, yet you were able to show pretty nice margin improvement. And I was wondering if there was some variability around the costs or if this was structural cost take-out that was really driving the margin improvement? Eric W. Norris - FMC Corp.: Yeah. I would say it's more of the latter. The structural improvements we've made, there's nothing unique about what's happened sequentially from one quarter to the next. Volumes were lower for the reasons Pierre referenced, Omega-3, as well as some timing in our Health business. But the cost side of that is pretty consistent. There's a structural component that gets us to a sustainable margin that's in the mid-20%s, notwithstanding the occasional and what we've seen in prior quarters benefit we may get in certain quarters like the fourth quarter that are not benefits you roll forward into the first quarter or second quarters of the following year. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : All right. Then, I had a question on the Lithium business. Can you comment on what you were seeing in price activity sequentially across different products? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I think I'll have Tom commenting more on the pricing. But right now, if you look, we have a lot of benefit from pricing on lithium carbonate up to now and maybe less of a pricing benefit of lithium hydroxide. We are now getting into the period of new contract negotiation of lithium hydroxide, which will impact mostly 2017. So, directionally, what we do expect is we do expect to start to see a very significant ramp up in lithium hydroxide pricing, which is very much in line with the negotiation we are having while we will see, maybe, a more stable pricing in lithium carbonate, potentially lowering into 2017. Tom, you want to add some more color to that? Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.: Yes. Just to give a little more color to that, on the hydroxide, the contract negotiations are proceeding well and over the coming month, they should be all solid. We're progressing well through those. And on the carbonate, as most folks saw in the market, there was a little bit of softening in Q3 particularly in China. What we'll see going into next year is the smaller volume of carbonate that was locked in at lower prices, similar to the hydroxide, will come up, and we expect some softening on the top-end, so net-net we'll go into next year on those more opportunistic product lines kind of flat to slightly down. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Excellent. Thanks very much. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: And the big story once again for us, I mean, because of the strategic focus, because of the timing of where we are in contract negotiation and increasing capacity coming up next year, the big focus for us and where you're going to see the other contributor to earnings growth is lithium hydroxide. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : This is Ben Richardson sitting in for Don. Just sticking on, with the topic about lithium, you say you're ahead of schedule with the ramps there. Can you just maybe speak to the timing of additional tonnage? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yes. What we \u2013 we're expecting the mechanical completion of the plant. I had the pleasure actually to be there two weeks ago and see the plant's looking really good. We expect the mechanical completion of the plant in the fourth quarter this year. We're going to be able to start to have product coming out of the plant in the first quarter, and then we're going to start to answer the customer qualification of the product. So, we believe with the commercial situation where the products are produced by the plant by the expansion and qualified to the customer by the middle of the year. So, the 8,000-metric-ton capacity we have for next year should give to us a 4,000 additional tons of products into 2017 and the full 8,000 when we get into 2018. Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And, I guess, flipping back to Ag and specifically potential divestitures in your space and how you see that development? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: We are in contact with any of the companies which are currently consolidating, and we are standing ready to participating in the purchase of any molecule \u2013 any of those company would be divesting if they meet our portfolio. I have to say that so far, we haven't seen anything which would be critical to our portfolio or any significant technology put on the market. But I think those companies are still in an early stage of the antitrust reviews. So, we are standing ready but haven't seen anything right now which has been attractive to us. Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Thank you very much. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Joel Jackson representing BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Milan Shah - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Hi. Good morning. Thanks. This is Milan on for Joel. Just following up there on the acquisitions. I mean, if you are to pursue something, can you maybe give us, put some numbers around magnitude and what would be the funding? I mean, what sort of leverage would you be comfortable going back up to potentially? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I will talk to the leverage. The size, I mean, really, I would not like to speculate here on the result of any antitrust reviews, and what could be the consequences in term of what product would be for sale and what will be the price. Now, of course, we do our own work to be ready and try to anticipate but that's only speculation on our part to stand ready but it's very hard to tell until the antitrust process in each of the region is taking place and having the companies, making decisions around their portfolio. Paul, do you want to talk about the leverage? Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: Sure. Again, to Pierre's point, it's difficult to be particularly satisfying to you with the answer without any real specifics. But I think it's fair to say, I think you've seen from our cash flow performance, we are generating a fair degree of cash right now. We're deleveraging quickly. Because we've bought products like this frequently in the past, one of the key characteristics is that they are typically very cash-generative from day one. And so, they can stand a pretty decent amount of leverage from day one. We also are very disciplined on price. Based on everything we see, we don't see any risk to our credit rating from a cash acquisition of any of the available interesting assets that are out there right now. Again, that could change depending on what assets come available. But we don't see any particular challenge to add our balance sheet based on the opportunities that are available that we see today. Milan Shah - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Thanks. Maybe just switching to Omega-3, you talk about some abating headwinds going into next year. I mean, is the environment more competitive, equally competitive, less competitive than you were perhaps seeing last quarter and going into 2017? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Omega-3 is, I would say, it is not getting worse, but it is not getting better. I think it's a challenging environment. Right now, we are focusing on actions for us to leverage some of our manufacturing capability and quality of product and especially the fact that we have, know we have made product which have very high quality and command a premium to try to improve our situation. But, frankly, at that stage, with the oversupply there is in this market and the number of players, the improvement you will see on Omega-3 will be driven by the work we do commercially and cost-wise more than us benefiting from the market. When we've announced the numbers for expected growth for the Health penetration (51:05) business next year, we are very, I would say, prudent around putting into those numbers any significant improvement in the Omega-3 market, which we do not see. So, it is a challenge. We are addressing it. I would say, right now, I have to admit we are more in damage control than expecting growth but that's the situation for Omega-3. Milan Shah - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with B&A (sic) [BofA] (51:40). Please go ahead. Unknown Speaker : Thank you. This is Ian sitting in for Steve (51:41). Cash flow generation has been very, very good this year and I appreciate the comments about some of the collections in Brazil and looking forward to 2017, provided some preliminary guidance about expecting earnings growth. Should cash from operations grow at the same level of earnings or higher or lower? Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: Yeah. I think you heard in my comments we talked probably still about $400 million of excess receivables sat on our balance sheet related to Brazil. And, we'd certainly expected to start to collect a significant proportion of those next year. So, given that, we would expect cash flow to continue to grow really similarly, like how it did this year. We'll generate higher EBITDA. We do not expect to have any meaningful cash outflows for CapEx over and above what we have today, and we expect to continue to decapitalize our balance sheet in Brazil. So, yes, I would expect cash flow to continue to grow next year just as strong as it's been this year. Unknown Speaker : Thank you. And as a follow-up, just kind of on the broader market. For Ag, specifically in Latin America, what things would you be looking for to potentially become more optimistic about a rebound in that region? I think sales are still far below prior levels of peak. What does the industry need to see? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Well, I think, for me, there's a couple of things. First of all, on the macro level, obviously, if commodity prices start to come back, we're going to see expanded acres down in Brazil for a lot of the row crops. That's one factor. And, then the second factor is just the internal health of that business in the sense of where channel inventories are, pest pressures, the normal seasonal-to-seasonal activity in Ag. I think if you can get those things coming together, you're going to see somewhat of a rebound in the marketplace. But pest pressure is obviously, nobody knows where the pest pressures are going to lie. Commodity prices are going to take some change in overall yields in North America and Latin America. So, we've said what we feel the market will be next year. Those will be the two items in Brazil in particular and potentially Argentina that would change that picture. Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: The one thing I'd just add to that I think having a stable macro-political environment and improved access to credit for the growers will be a positive if we see that start to happen as well. Unknown Speaker : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead, sir. Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you. Pierre, last quarter, you talked about some optimism in your outlook comments for Health and Nutrition, but not about seasonality in Q3 and Q4. What I'm wondering is do you think you have the right mix of products for what customers are looking to do with their products over the next couple of years or do you need to tweak your portfolio, leaving Omega-3 aside? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: That's a very good question and I'll tell you, it's a difficult one to answer. I believe that we have very solid positions in MCC, alginate and carrageenan. I do believe that we have the right formulation technology allowing us to meet the changing need of the market and the customers. And that's the business today, if you put Omega-3 aside, we have strong market share and we are the leading supplier and the place where customers go today when they have need for new product or new technology. So, I believe this is a business which will, for the next two, three years, continue to grow in the mid-single digit, as we said in the guidance, with very strong margin, 25%, and good cash generation. So, to answer your question, I'm quite confident around that business for the next two to three years. We do have interesting new ideas based on the current product we have for new technology for some of the changing market needs around health and other applications. The question for me is more three years and beyond. Really, where do we want to take that franchise? We have great product today. We have great margin and good cash generation. The first attempt to do that was Omega-3. I think we didn't do a good job there. The question is what we want that business to be, not in the next two, three years, but beyond that. So, to answer your question, yes, for the next two, three years. Beyond that, we need to do a lot of work to define the mid-term strategy for Health and Nutrition. Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. That's super helpful. And if I could just come back, I hate to beat on the working capital issue, but just a clarification. Of the additional $400 million and everything else you're doing down there, are your credit practices in Brazil going to be materially different than legacy FMC or is this just a matter of we've got the Cheminova clean-up and better execution, well, and customers in better shape? Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: So, the first thing I would say though is when we look back at the position that find ourselves in, in Brazil, much of it is driven by some of the comments that Pierre talked about, about changing the way we approach the business. And instead of focusing on volume and volume growth and share growth focusing on getting the maximum value. An important part of that is assessing the quality of the customer and the quality of the products that we sell. We do not expect to be in a meaningfully different place in terms of terms, in terms of structure, in terms of credit that we extend to customers to either history or the rest of the market. But we will be much more and we are being much more disciplined about where we're willing to take exposure. It's really a function of multiple factors. It's a function of the movement in commodity prices, it's a function of the weaker access to credit for the growers down there in the market, and it is to an extent, a function of our ability to integrate the Cheminova portfolio and have a higher margin more technical portfolio really across all regions and all crops. So, it's more than one factor that's driving this move towards a stronger credit position with our customers down there. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I think, generally speaking, the crop chemical industries, as a whole, for us and all of our peer company is an industry which is in Latin America and Brazil which has been historically focused on growth and maybe a bit more open to taking risk to gain market share. And we were there with all of our competitors. I do think, today, we might have a strategy without fundamentally changing what we've done to be more careful for the foreseeable future. I think it's important, it's working for us and it's allowing to collect, to price our customers who want our product. So, we're going to be maybe on the lower end of the risk taking without fundamentally changing the way we look at our receivables. Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. Thank you both. Operator : And we have a question from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Hi. Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Couple of follow-ups if I may. First of all, with regards to your announced deal for 8,000 tons of carbonate that you're going to be getting from your new partner. Is that pretty much all of their capacity or, and do you have the right to all of that capacity or is there more behind that? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: The 8,000 ton is, when you say their capacity, it's not their \u2013 it's our capacity. I mean, this plant. If you talk about the expansion in China of this plant... Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: Nemaska. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Oh, in Nemaska. Okay. I was talking about the... Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : I'm talking about the 8,000...yep... Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.: Yes. Dmitry, this is Tom. I can take that. Nemaska's installed capacity will be 28,000 tons. So, it will be a meaningful part of their capacity but it will not by any means be all of their capacity. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. And I'm assuming you have some way of getting more if you need more either from these guys or from other sources as you move past 2018, 2019? Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.: Well, with respect to that, as Pierre outlined in his comments, we've got a multi-prong strategy where we're continually evaluating, one, how do we diversify, have security of supply, low cost supply. So, we're not quite ready to announce the other pieces coming but there'll will be multiple components to that including our own investments in our facilities as well as working with others. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Fair enough... Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I think it's important in all of the discussions we have \u2013 we have this Nemaska agreement. We are in current discussions with some other suppliers of carbonate for partnership. But let's not forget that there is one aspect for which we have 100% of the decision. It is expanding in Argentina. We can expand in Argentina. We do have the mines. We do have the capability. We have the infrastructure. So, it is a decision we can make. I have to admit that I'm not in a rush to make that decision because with all of the companies today investing in lithium carbonate, I believe there will be plenty of lithium carbonate for the next two years, three years, four years. But this is a decision we can make at any time. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. And then, you actually kind of led into my next question, Pierre. There's a 20% debottlenecking expansion that you're undertaking in Argentina. What's the timing for that to come online? Is that a back-end of 2017 as well? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yeah. This is going to start right now. I mean, we're going to see this capacity of carbonate coming in at some point during 2017, 2018. So, this is undertaken right now. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Right. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: It is low capital and no more debottlenecking. The team has been working and we have, I think, three work streams which are allowing us to get to this kind of numbers, but it's more routine-capital expansion. I mean... Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Got you. Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.: And, Dmitry, just to give you a little more color on that, there's multiple components of that. So, there's some operational efficiency changes. There's some low-capital projects. There's a number of small projects that, over the course of 2017 and 2018, we'll add that. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : So, it sounds like you're \u2013 if I do my math right here, your Argentina production will go up to about 21,000 tons, is that about right? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yeah. That's correct Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : And then final question on the crop protection business and sort of your margins have been, in the past, very differentiated between sort of 25% level in the first half of the year and kind of 20% level in the second half of the year, given where the regions that you get your sales from. This year, obviously, has been distorted by everything that's going on. So, it's going to be more like first half and second half to be more or less even in terms of margin. As the business gets back to sort of normal execution, how do we think about 2017 margin cadence? Should we expect sort of 3-point to 4-point margin difference between the first half and the second half of the year or is it going to be more like this year where margins are a little bit more even between the quarters? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yeah. We're going to get into next year and then once again, it's a bit early for us to break down by quarter. We've given a directional number. But yes, the profile of the margins and the business is going to change versus historical FMC just because we have a very different regional profile. I mean, remember, we're very small in Europe. We going to be much bigger in Europe where there is good margin in our business. So, I would say that directionally, we should have less variation in our quarterly margins that we had in the past. Now, there is two things happening today, if, there is the market situation, there is a different approach we are taking to the Latin America market and there is the cost synergies, which are growing quarter after quarter. So, that is taking us to improve margin and taking us to the 20% range. But I would say in the future, you'll have more stable margin quarter-over-quarter. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay, okay. Thank you. Operator : We have time for one more question today. And that will come from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.: This is Chris Evans on for Bob. Thanks for taking my questions. In Lithium specifically, pretty, 40% of earnings growth assumption for 2017, I think you mentioned earlier kind of a low \u2013 flat to down expectations for pricing in carbonate. Can you kind of give the other expectations that are driving that assumption for 2017? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I would say, well, first, if you look at our business in 2017, we're expecting to be \u2013 and, Tom, correct me if I'm a bit off here, but I would say, almost 90% of our business revenues being on the specialty side, the downstream, and only 10% on the upstream, which is carbonate and fluoride. So, we're going to be even more dependent upon the downstream business. We are expecting, I would say, little benefit from carbonate, chloride pricing, knowing that it's only a small percentage of our business, and we believe this pricing is going to level off in 2017. So, you would consider the 40% improvement is going to mostly come from two things, pricing in lithium hydroxide and volume in lithium hydroxide. You will understand that I'm going to be a bit careful on what I'm expecting in term of lithium hydroxide price increase because we are in the middle of a bunch of contract negotiations. So, we will give you more detail around pricing when we get to the February earnings call because those negotiations will be behind us. Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.: To add a little bit more color to that, you have to realize that most of our specialty business is contracted in the prior year. But, when we contracted a lot of that, it was before we saw how strong the pricing had moved across the market overall. So, there's a little bit of a catch up that's happening across all of the specialty products. Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. And just on the supply agreement to speed your hydroxide ramp, should we expect the additional volumes to comes from new entrants like Nemaska or do you expect from existing (01:07:21) or hard rock producers? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yeah. So, of course, when you look at a supply of carbonate to seed growth, you want to be certain that you have the appropriate mix of new entrants and established players. So, we will not, having a strategy to supply carbonate into our business based only or mostly on new entrants in this market. Nemaska, we believe is one of the most solid today, with one of the best source of lithium, so we believe it's a fairly certain supply we're going to get from them but we will do two things. One is supply from existing suppliers and not to forget that some of them already supplying to us carbonate. And second of all, to repeat, we can also increase our own capacity of carbonate which is something, if we decide to do it, there will be a sure supply. Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Brian P. Angeli - FMC Corp.: So, we appreciate your time. That's all the time we have for the call today. As always, I'll be available following the call for any additional questions you may have. Thank you. Operator : That concludes the FMC Corporation third quarter 2016 earnings release conference call. Thank you.",

Phone lines will be placed on a listen-only mode throughout the conference. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer period. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Brian Angeli, Vice President, Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Mr. Angeli, you may begin. Brian P. Angeli - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Roxanne, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today is Pierre Brondeau, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Pierre will begin the call with a review of FMC's fourth quarter and full year performance, and then discuss the outlook for 2017. Paul will provide an overview of select financial results. The slide presentation that accompanies our results, along with our earnings release and 2017 outlook statement, are available on our website, and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available at the conclusion of the call. As with our prior calls, Mark Douglas, President, FMC Agricultural Solutions; Eric Norris, President, FMC Health and Nutrition; and Tom Schneberger, Vice President and Global Business Director, FMC Lithium, will join to address questions. Before we begin, let me remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including but not limited to those factors identified in our release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references, and pro forma revenue and segment earnings for FMC Agricultural Solutions. Reconciliation and definition of these terms, as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to, Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. In 2016, FMC continued to focus on execution. We consistently produced earnings in line with our expectations, and delivered 14% growth in our EPS. The actions taken over the last two years have improved our visibility into the business, and positioned FMC to deliver significant earnings growth in 2017. In Ag Solutions, we focused on maintaining price and terms and took a disciplined approach to volumes in the face of elevated channel inventory levels, matching sales to market demand. Despite headwinds from Omega 3, Health and Nutrition delivered another year of strong margin and cash flow. Lithium increased its earnings by 200% by executing on its downstream-focused strategy and taking advantage of favorable market conditions. As we enter 2017, we expect each of our businesses to deliver growth in segment earnings, and for FMC to deliver adjusted earnings per share of between $3.20 and $3.60, an increase of 20% at the midpoint of the range. I will provide details regarding our outlook later on the call. But first, I will review our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 performance, starting with FMC's full-year results on slide 1. FMC reported revenues of about $3.3 billion in 2016, roughly flat to reported revenue for 2015. However, adjusted EPS increased 14% to $2.82 as a results of 180 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin, which was driven by a combination of higher prices, favorable mix and lower operating costs. Fourth quarter revenue was $866 million, an increase of 4% compared to the same period last year, as revenue growth in Health and Nutrition and Lithium was offset by lower revenue in Ag Solutions. Adjusted earnings per share for Q4 was $0.88, 14% higher than Q4 last year, largely driven by the significant increase in segment earnings across the businesses. As you can see on slide 2, FMC delivered significant growth in reported segment earnings and adjusted earnings per share in 2016. Segment earnings increased by $79 million (5:48), driven largely by Ag Solutions and Lithium. The increase in segment earnings more than offset higher corporate expenses and taxes in 2016, driving the 14% increase in adjusted EPS. I will comment further on each segments' fourth quarter performance, starting with Ag Solutions on slide 3. Fourth quarter 2016 revenue declined 6% to $618 million in line with the market, and mainly due to lower sales in Latin America and Europe. Despite the decline in revenue, Ag Solutions delivered a 25% increase in segment earnings, to $127 million in the quarter. The increase in segment earnings was driven by regional mix, with higher sales contribution from North America and Asia, and by our ability to defend pricing in Latin America despite the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Segment earnings margin improved by over 500 basis points to 20.6% in the quarter. This marks the first quarter since we closed the Cheminova acquisition that Ag Solutions segment earnings margin has exceeded 20%. We remained confident in our ability to return segment earnings margin to above 20% on a full-year basis. Overall, we continue to execute very well in the context of a strategy that focuses on maintaining discipline on price and churn, and limiting credit risk, while pursuing top line growth only where it makes sense for a business. Turning to slide 4. I will provide additional comments on Ag Solutions' regional performance, starting with North America. Revenue increased 8% in the quarter, but declined 6% for the full year. The quarterly and full-year performance in North America was in line with our expectations at the start of the year. The increase in Q4 revenue was driven largely by strong early season demand for FMC's Authority brand pre-emergent herbicides. Returning of sales in 2016 is consistent with the trend that we have seen emerging over the past two years. Growers in North America are generally purchasing pre-herbicide earlier, while deferring other purchases until later in the crop seasons. In Latin America, sales declined 13% in the quarter, and 21% for the full-year. Lower volumes in Brazil and FX headwinds from the Mexican peso drove the reduction in revenue in both the quarter and the full year. The lower volume in Brazil was a direct result of two decisions made by FMC, rather than lower end user demand for FMC products. First, we allowed inventory in the channel to reduce. Second, we were very disciplined with regard to credit exposure. As expected, the disciplined exercise on volumes allowed FMC to defend price and maintain terms despite FX movements. Combined with lower operating costs, we delivered a significant increase in segment earnings in the region for the quarter and the full year. In Europe, revenue declined 17% in the quarter as a result of FX headwinds and lower volumes. Sales activity in Q4 is generally limited as the primary sale season in Europe is in the first half of the calendar year. For the full-year, sales were down 12%. The shift in timing of sales closed by a move to direct market access model across Europe and product rationalization, each contributed to the decline in full-year revenue. In Asia, revenue increased 8% in the quarter due to a strong winter crop in Australia, and strength in Indonesia. Full year revenue fell 6% on the back of softer demand in China, and directions to reduce channel inventories in India, following two years of drought. As we look forward to 2017, our expectations of market conditions remain unchanged from what we saw in November. We continue to expect on a U.S. dollar basis, the global crop protection chemical market to remain flat in 2017 creating a more stable operating environment for FMC Ag Solutions than we have seen in the last two years. However, we expect the market in North America to remain challenging. Continued elevated channel inventories combined with low commodity prices will result in more cautious purchasing decision by growers. In Asia and Europe, more normal weather conditions should lead to an improved demand environment next year, although we expect FX to be a headwind. In Latin America, we expect the market to be up slightly. Based on what we saw in 2016, we have higher confidence that the 2017-2018 season will see increased demand across the region. We expect Ag Solutions revenue will be between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion, which is roughly flat to 2016, as lower sales in North America will be offset by increased demand in other regions. Segment earnings are expected to grow to $410 million to $450 million, an 8% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Earnings performance will be driven largely by improved mix, new product introductions and lower operating costs, which will be partially offset by FX headwinds. We expect continued margin improvement with margin of approximately 19% for the full year. We expect first quarter segment earnings in the range of $60 million to $70 million with mid-teens segment earnings margins. As we mentioned earlier, grower in North America are increasingly purchasing pre-herbicides earlier and delaying other purchases until later in the growing season. We anticipate similar buying pattern in 2017, and will remain disciplined around when we sell products, allowing sales to fall in the quarter in which growers demand it. As we have seen in recent years, Q1 will contribute to lowest revenue of any quarter, but we still expect sales over the 2016-2017 North America crop season to be roughly flat. Turning now to Health and Nutrition on slide 5, which delivered fourth quarter results that were in line with our expectations. Health and Nutrition reported revenue of $177 million. The 3% year-over-year increase was due to higher sales volume of Health excipients in Asia and Nutrition ingredients in both Asia and Europe. Segment earnings increased 17% to $54 million driven as expected by lower costs, this was largely the results of lower manufacturing costs as noted on our Q3 call. For 2017, we expect Health and Nutrition to deliver full-year segment revenue of $750 million to $790 million, which is an increase of 4% at the midpoint. Increased volumes of MCC based products are driving most of the year-on-year increase as we ramp up production at our MCC plant in Thailand. Segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $190 million to $200 million in 2017, an increase of 2% at the midpoint. We expect segment earnings margin to be the same as 2016 at around 25% as cost savings achieved in 2016 will offset the cost of bringing our new MCC plant online. For the first quarter, we expect earnings in the range of $45 million to $50 million. As you see on slide 6, Lithium delivered another strong quarter. Revenue of $71 million was up slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 as higher prices across all product groups were offset by lower volumes in the quarter. A decision to direct lithium carbonate to a lithium hydroxide start-up process resulted in lower volume in the quarter. Segment earnings nearly doubled to $21 million in the quarter due to higher prices and improved mix. These factors combined to drive an increase in segment earnings margin to 30%. In 2016, approximately 75% of our revenue was generated from the sale of downstream products by managing our sales mix and capturing price increases across the portfolio, our revenue per LCE in 2016 increased approximately 25% compared to 2015. FMC Lithium is well-positioned to deliver another year of significant earnings growth in 2017. Demand across our key downstream market continues to grow with most contracts in place for 2017. Sales of downstream specialty product will comprise about 90% over 2017 Lithium revenue. This largely insinuates us from volatility in prices for lithium carbonate and chloride. We expect Lithium segment revenue in 2017 to be between $315 million and $355 million an increase of over 25% at the midpoint, driven by a combination of increased volume and higher prices. Hydroxide expansion will result in a significant increase in volume in 2017. Our expansion remains on track. We have produced several trial runs of material and are putting this material through internal quality and performance tests. We expect to begin offering product to customers for qualification testing in the coming weeks. Based on the product to-date, we remain confident that we'll begin commercial sale in July 2017. The combination of increased hydroxide volumes, high prices and improved mix is expected to deliver a segment earnings in the range of $90 million to $110 million. This represents over 40% growth at the midpoint of the range. We also expect to achieve earnings margin of about 30% for the full-year 2017. We expect first quarter segment earnings in the range of $18 million to $22 million. Slide 7 summarizes the 2017 outlook for each segment as we discussed earlier, and shows we expect adjusted earnings to be between $3.20 and $3.60 per share. We expect the 2017 quarterly earnings guidance to be similar to what we saw in 2016, driven by returning of Ag's sales in North and Latin America, and the ramp up in lithium hydroxide production. First quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be between $0.50 and $0.60. I will now turn the call over to, Paul. Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Pierre. As usual, let me start with the income statement before I move on to cash flow and the balance sheet. First tax, our adjusted effective rate for the year was around 22.8%, broadly in line with our expectations. Since, we were accrued a 23.5% for the year-to-date, this resulted in a slightly favorable impact on our Q4 tax rate, although clearly not as large as we have seen in prior years. While lower than guidance, the tax rate compared to Q4 2015 was a drag on our earnings of around $0.12 per share. Looking into 2017, we expect that rates to fall into a range of 16% to 20% for the full year. As I discussed on our last call, this is mainly due to the impact of the full integration of Cheminova, a large European business, into our supply chain, combined with our current view as to what our regional earnings mix will look like in 2017. Touching on currency next. For full year 2016, across all businesses and regions, currency was a small tailwind to earnings compared to 2015. Favorable movements in Brazil were partially offset by the weakening of almost every other major currency in our business, most notably the euro and Mexican peso. Almost all of the tailwind occurred in Q4. Looking into 2017, we would expect, based on current forward rates, that currency will be a drag of as much as $45 million on our earnings, almost exclusively in Ag Solutions, and spread across multiple currencies. This headwind is factored into our guidance. Let me also give a few comments on the higher guidance for corporate expenses in our 2017 numbers. We are guiding corporate expenses to be approximately $10 million higher than in 2016. As you know, FMC allocates almost all centrally-incurred costs to the business results. And therefore, all of the savings we have achieved from Cheminova integration are reflected in the segment level results. The remaining corporate costs reflect only those costs which reflect the cost of managing a publicly listed company that we've historically not allocated to the segments. For 2017, we have approximately $10 million of non-repeating costs related to various programs which will give immediate benefits to either segment earnings, cash flows, or the corporate tax rate. Some of these programs commenced in Q4 2016 and all of these programs will be completed in 2017, with the benefit starting to accrue in late 2017. Moving on to cash flow on slide 8. We delivered adjusted cash from operations, $561 million. However, this included a decision we made in the fourth quarter, as markets moved in our favor, to take advantage of an opportunity to annuitize our remaining UK pension obligation. By injecting $21 million into this fund, we have now removed all future funding requirements and eliminated a significant annual management cost of this exposure. Without this item, our full-year adjusted cash from operations would have been at the high-end of our Q3 guidance range of $550 million to $600 million. Even after this payment, we delivered a 55% increase in cash generation compared to 2015, with higher earnings, stronger working capital performance and tighter spending discipline, all contributing to the year-on-year increase. In 2016, we collected almost $700 million of outstanding receivables in Brazil. While this is solid progress, we saw no signs in Q4 that the credit tightness being felt by our customers is easing, and we remain cautious about extending further credit to some of our customers through additional sales. This lack of broadly available credit is the reason that the receivables balance in Brazil remains higher than we believe it should be, and we will continue to bring the same focus and discipline to collections in 2017 that we did in 2016. Based on our current visibility, we believe that we will reduce the current balance further in 2017. We reduced net debt by almost $250 million in 2016, ending with an adjusted net debt to EBITDA of approximately 3 times. We will continue to manage our debt to a level that is consistent with our current credit rating. Looking into 2017, we expect our capital expenditure to remain similar to 2016, just ahead of depreciation, allowing for our planned expansions in lithium hydroxide. This does not include any capital investment decisions that we may make with regard to a significant expansion of our lithium carbonate capabilities, which is something we are analyzing today. And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Paul. Despite the challenging Ag market conditions, we believe that our 2017 plan is very achievable. It relies on things we control, rather than expectations of positive external events. We expect to deliver earnings growth in each business, and strong EPS growth of 20% for the whole company. The strategy of each business is aligned with its respective market conditions. We expect revenue and earnings growth in our Lithium and Health and Nutrition businesses, and we will continue a very disciplined approach in Ag Solutions to ensure earnings growth while positioning the business strongly for the eventual upturn in that market. We expect, in 2017, the same predictability of results for the company than we demonstrated in 2016. Thank you for your attention. And I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you very much. Good morning. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Good morning. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Pierre, I was hoping you could talk maybe about what you see as the path, in terms of giving up some volumes in order to tighten up your margins and improve the credit profile? When do you start to lap that? When will we start to see your underlying volumes echo more of what's going on in the end markets? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I think, at this stage, we believe that it is very important to do two things; let the sales happen in the quarter when there is the demand, and be very disciplined around potential credit risk. I do not see us lightening that behavior in the next six months. I think we are still observing the market. There is multiple signals and feedbacks, the market that we could see some signal of an upturn for the 2017-2018 season, especially driven by Latin America. So if I will have to pick a date where we will be more focused on a top line growth in line with market, and maybe a less prudent approach to market, I would say, in the back-end of the 2017. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you. And then briefly, your carbonate sales, you mentioned that those upstream sale is only a quarter of your portfolio, yet there was a pretty big volume decrement. Does that mean, you're filling the pipeline, and we should get the benefit of those carbonate volumes converted to hydroxide sometime in 2017? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yeah. So what happened in the fourth quarter are two things. First of all, just to make sure we would have the volumes needed for the start-up of the plant. We put in inventory, some carbonate just to make sure we were fully prepared to load the plant as soon and as fast as we can, the hydroxide expansion, that is one. The other one, which is more important from the volume impact in Q4. Last year, we had quite a few sales of \u2013 resell of third party, we would buy product, convert what we would need to hydroxide and whatever we would not need for hydroxide, we sell on the open market for carbonate. The problem in the fourth quarter, if you look at the differential between which and which (30:34) we could buy this carbonate, and we sell it, even make it very valuable from an earnings standpoint. So all of our focus was to line up the volume of carbonate with what was needed for a downstream business. So those were the two key reasons. From a benefiting of the carbonate sales going into hydroxide, yes, you will see that in the second half of this year where we have a significant volume ramp-up of hydroxide coming from carbonate. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Perfect. Thanks for the help. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Chris Parkinson, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. You hit on this a little on your prepared remarks, but can you just give a little more color around the shift in your sales in Europe within the Ag segment, and comment just generally on the materiality of the shift, and how it's potentially incorporated into your 1Q guidance? And then also, is there any other region where this could potentially occur throughout 2017? Thank you. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah. Hi, Chris, it's Mark. Yeah. Well, as we've gone through this direct market access model in Europe, we're seeing movement, you saw it in Q4, you'll see some of it in Q1. But really, it impacted the 2016 numbers. We get back onto a more normal run rate in 2017, with the exception of one final country, which is France. It's the last direct market access, we'll be putting that in place towards the end of this year. So we might see a little bit at the end of the year in France, but essentially, it will be done as we move through 2017. We haven't really put a number on the size of that, although clearly, that was a significant reason for what you see in 2017, along with FX. FX is a number in 2017, Q1 that is a reasonably large number that's impacting Europe. I don't think you're going to see that anywhere else in the world. We're pretty much finished with all our direct market access movements. If you watch the press, we've purchased our joint venture in China, and also in Argentina as we went through the end of last year. So, we're pretty much done in terms of the rest of the direct market access. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. And just a quick follow-up actually. Just on the product rationalizations in LatAm and Europe, can you just give us some general color of the magnitude and the cadence of those efforts? I mean, is that mainly something that's going to appear in the first half? And then also, just any general thoughts on how the rationalizations are going to be netted against the launch of some of your new molecules over the next few years and how that flows eventually into longer-term margin guidance? Just any broad thoughts there would be appreciated. Thank you. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah. (33:19) we've done a lot of work over the last 18 months on rationalization, it's coming to an end. I think, we'll see less of it as we roll through 2017. There's still some inventories to be sold as we go through the process. New product introductions; we have about 40 new products to be introduced in 2017. Obviously, that's the first year of those products being sold, so the revenue is smaller than it will be at peak. Those products in many formulations, new mixes that we have for our proprietary molecules, tends to be herbicides and fungicides. And then, obviously going forward in 2018, we have the launch of our first of the platform molecules and then that rolls through all the way through 2023. We have netted that out against the rationalizations that we've seen already. We've set our pipeline has a peak sales of about $1.5 billion in revenue, that still holds true. So you will see that potential new growth coming through as we go through the rest of this decade. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: To give you a sense of product rationalization, as Mark said, we are getting to the end of the process now. But if you look back, we have walked away through this process in 2015 and 2016 of annual sales of $461 million, of which 63% were in Brazil. So it was a very significant move. One of the reasons for which, and besides the careful approach of the market and the already-increased risks and the timing, I think we moved away from $461 million of annual sales. It's a big chunk, 53% in Brazil, 12% in EMEA, and 11% in Asia. I think we're seeing the end, which could make us more aligned with market growth in the future. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: That's a very helpful color. Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Mike Harrison, Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Good morning. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Pierre or Mark, could you maybe talk a little bit about this trend towards increasing Q4 sales of pre-emergent herbicides, and then the fact that you would see delaying in purchases of other chemicals as the crop season progresses, what does that mean for business, and what does that tell you about the market, and is this trend here to stay? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Let me make a color on the first half of the year; and then I'll let Mark comment on the move towards early pre-emergent. The way we look at the market today for North America, we are trying to give a quarterly breakdown, but for us we tend to look at it more on a seasonal basis. So we're giving two numbers, one for Q1, one for Q2. But we are looking more at a six month time period, and for this time period, we believe sales would be shifting more towards Q2, but frankly, you we could see $10 million shifting from Q2 into Q1, and that's Q1 higher by $10 million and Q2 lower by $10 million. That is what we are seeing today, more of a trend for the post, not the pre-emergent market, within the season to value really when you need them, but all depending upon price of commodities and confidence, you can see (37:13) that shifting. So the number, and I know as a public company, we have to talk about quarterly numbers. It's fair game. But look at the numbers as a six month, knowing that you could see $10 million shifting from one side to the other. And Mark you want to talk about the pre-emergents? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah. Mike, I think one of the things that we see is distribution and retail are prepared to hold inventories of products that they know they're going to move and they know they're going to need early in the season, hence, what we've seen on the pre-emergent side. You think about our market share in pre-emergents. We've grown that share over the last seven to eight years. And we have about 28% of the market in North America now with our Authority family of brands. So distribution and retail know those products are going to move, so they're willing to put them in place earlier, hence we've seen that shift from Q1 to Q4. I would expect to see that to continue as we roll through to the next few years. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Thank you. And then, another question on the Ag business. Just looking at the cost structure overall, I'm wondering if there are some typical costs, things like merit pay increases, incentive comp, travel expenses that you've been holding a lid on during 2015 and 2016, and those costs are going to be higher this year. And if so, what would be the magnitude of those higher costs? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: No, we're not expecting costs to be higher. I think via the cost controls which have been put in place, are mostly cost synergies which have come to us with the integration of Cheminova, those are very sustainable. We believe, we have a right sized the organization, and we're not expecting at all to have to make any significant changes on our cost structure. As you've seen in the numbers, we will increase earnings by 8% in the Ag business in a flat market. The only place where we are looking at a temporary cost increase is what Paul talked about, which is at corporate costs, because we do have programs which will have a fast payback around SAP, systems and taxes, for example which knowing that we are heading towards a decent year, we have good visibility for 2017, I think, we feel very much in control, we believe it was the right time to put those program in place, which will pay dividend quickly as you could see on the tax rate. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : All right. Thank you very much. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Daniel Jester, Citigroup. Please go ahead. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Good morning. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So in Brazil you spoke about drawing down your own inventories, and you can talk about that for a while now. So can you give us any sense as to where you believe your inventories are relative to an old part of the cycle, and sort any comments about sort of industry-wide inventories in Latin America. Thanks. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I think we're in a good place right now. We worked very hard on the \u2013 managing the inventory level in the channel. I would say, Brazil and Latin America we're expecting for FMC, with all the work we've done, and we're going to keep on doing in Q1 this year, that's going to be the bright spot of the business in 2017. That's why we're having good expectation. We are at the right level, I don't think we need to further control all over our inventory. We still have work to do in North America, don't get me wrong. But I believe, we are in good shape in Brazil and Latin America right now to be able to push sales at a normal rate. (41:23) cautious around credit risk, but beside that we are feeling quite confident, and the numbers should show it in Q3, Q4 this year. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And then on Lithium, you've spoken today about sort of the benefit of hydroxide pricing, but I think you were out last year with a price increase in (41:45) so, any update on that? And then, as you become more downstream in your Lithium business, does that change the seasonality of your profit margins? I know in the past, third quarter has been sort of a weaker quarter, but as you go more downstream, does that change that seasonality, as we model out 2017? Thank you. Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.: Yeah. Hi, Daniel. This is Tom. On the pricing question, we are expecting to grow our revenue per LCE again. We grew, as Pierre had mentioned earlier, by 25% year-over-year this year, and we expect to grow another 20% going into next year. Hydroxide's going to be the bulk of that, other specialty products like metals are also above the average (42:31) at a higher price point, and some of the other specialties that are at a higher price point will be kind of lower than that average, but it will go up year-over-year. As it relates to seasonality, the specialty product portfolio is very stable. It really isn't a sales seasonality, and it never was in the first place. The seasonality we are continuing to improve, but that's more of an operational improvement process. As we continue to improve efficiencies and reliability in Argentina, we're improving seasonality to the extent possible. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I think what is important for us in our move towards more specialty and downstream is, we have way less exposure to the variability of pricing depending upon supply/demand. You see \u2013 and you could see in 2017 around carbonates and chloride. The seasonality, which is due to our operations in Argentina, the fact we are 12,000 feet, and the winter season, that we'll have to live with, we're trying to improve our operations, but we'll have to live with from a cost standpoint and production standpoint in Argentina. But the big, big benefit is really the fact that, by moving all of the carbonates into a downstream, we have much more visibility, with most of the contracts signed by now, by 2017. I would say the only variable we have this year is to confirm, which we are doing today, that our plant's going to start to have commercial sales of lithium hydroxide, a new plant in July. But beside that, everything is pretty much set. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question is from Frank Mitsch, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, good morning, everybody. Paul, you mentioned that material decline in the tax rate and it was driven by your regional expectations on where the profit's going to grow in 2017. Can you expand upon that a little bit more? Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: Sure, happy to. Ultimately, when we acquired Cheminova, and we did talk about this at the time, it creates \u2013 I wouldn't say an opportunity, but the truth is a requirement to realign our supply chain to reflect the fact that we now have a larger business, Mark talked earlier about a direct market access business. Just bear in mind though, historically, we serviced Europe and sold to Europe essentially from the U.S. Today, none of the product we sell in Europe really touches the U.S. anymore. And so, we're more aligned with the physical flows. And what that does is, change essentially where we recognize profit around the world, tying it more closely to the reality of how we operate our business. And so, this is not a tax planning program per se. It is a tax benefit of the supply chain integration that we've been doing linked to the Cheminova integration. In fact, some of the extra corporate spending and some of the work we'll be doing in 2017 just reaffirms that point. It's realigning where we invoice from. It's realigning our SAP systems to reflect those flows, and the impact is that we do tend to recognize more profit in the future in lower tax jurisdictions, because we're making more sales in those regions. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So it's primarily an expectation of generating greater profitability in Europe, is the simple answer, correct? Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: Correct. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. And then I should ask the obligatory question, Pierre, regarding your most recent thoughts on possible participation of FMC in some of the divestitures that may be mandated as part of the mega Ag mergers that are going on there. What are your current thoughts on your possible participation there? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: We are still very attentive to what is going on, listening to the process. I think we've seen that most of the companies involved in the mega mergers are all having discussions with antitrust authorities. We believe it will result in opportunities, so at this stage, it's a very high priority for us to watch what is going on and stand ready, if we have an opportunity which makes sense for FMC. But we would like to participate if we can. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Perfect. Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Dmitry Silversteyn, Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions that, perhaps, were addressed previously. On the Health and Nutrition, you were expecting sort of pretty decent results to both the top line and bottom line. You talked about MCC ramping up in Thailand. What other drivers are there of both your growth expectations on the top line, as well as your ability to preserve margin on the EBIT line? Eric W. Norris - FMC Corp.: Hello, Dmitry, it's Eric here. So, I'll answer that question. On the top line, it is, as you referenced already, it is MCC that is a driver for us. The Rayong plant in Thailand is ramping up, that is serving largely the food marketplace today, and that market in Southeast Asia remains robust. China remains steady. We see it steady going forward. And so, that's a modest growth there as well. So that's a positive revenue growth driver in the food market. Another driver that has been with us all year long, and we don't see changing into the coming year of 2017, or this year of 2017, is the growth in the pharmaceutical market, the health excipient marketplace, which again is largely MCC marketplace for us. Those would be the two largest drivers, going forward, for growth in the coming year. In terms of preserving margin, that's a story that we've \u2013 that Pierre has told, and continues to be a focal point for us. We're bringing on a lot of cost. We're bringing on a greenfield plant. We simultaneously are going through a lot of manufacturing excellence programs to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in every single operation we have, not just our two legacy MCC plants, but also our seaweed-producing plants around the world as well. So that remains a focus for us. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. And then just to follow-up on the tax rate question. Should we be modeling sort of the \u2013 kind of the 20% that you've delivered over last couple of years, Paul, or in light of your comments, we'll be looking for maybe high-teens by the time we get into 2018-2019 timeframe? Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: No. We've guided in 2017 for 16% to 20%. That range \u2013 it may be a little wide, but as we go into the year, we'll get more clarity where in the range it's going to come out. We're pretty confident, it will be inside that range in 2017, hence the guidance. I don't see that materially changing. Based on what I know today, but as you know, things can move quick in our business. I don't see that materially changing for 2018 versus 2017. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. So, as we sort of \u2013 if I follow your commentary about more and more revenue coming from lower jurisdiction or lower tax jurisdictions; within that range, is it reasonable to assume that you're going to gravitate towards the 16%, 17% versus the 19%, 20% part of that range over time? Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: It's a little early to tell, to be honest, Dmitry. It's going to be in the 16% to 20%, obviously depending on the strength of the regional Ag businesses, which is the biggest driver here. A big rebound in North America versus a big rebound in other regions makes a difference to that rate. So at the moment, I feel most comfortable saying that it's between 16% and 20%. And as it becomes clearer to us as we go through 2017 and into 2018, we'll give you new guidance. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay, Paul. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Mark Connelly, CLSA. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you. Two things. First, we're seeing quite a lot of M&A and joint venture activity in biologicals, even as all those big stuff is going on. Should we expect FMC to announce more deals or ramp-up spending to keep up there? Eric W. Norris - FMC Corp.: Yeah, Mark. On biologicals, I think everybody knows that we have a very strong alliance with Chr. Hansen, and we've been investing in that alliance over the last few years. We're starting to see the first products coming out of that pipeline. I'm not so sure that we're going to do any \u2013 what I would call M&A, because we're fully invested in the alliance itself. And frankly, with the liber that we have in the discovery mechanisms that Hansen has as well, we're very, very happy with where that alliance has gone. So the real investment there is on the pure R&D money, funding scale-ups, funding trials, registrations, et cetera, to get that platform moving. But we're absolutely committed to biologicals, we like where it's going, and we will be committing more R&D dollars to that as we go forward. Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. Okay, I'll leave that one there then. And second, India is talking a lot about local manufacturing, and we've now had two pesticide companies tell us that they may respond to that push for local manufacturing. I'm just curious, does that have any indirect implications for FMC in terms of maybe freeing up capacity elsewhere that might get you some better deals on your contract manufacturing, or is this too small in your mind? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: No. We are embedded in India. We have our own manufacturing site in India where we manufacture active ingredients. We actually have toll manufacturing agreements in India. Our philosophy really on the toll manufacturing side is to have a balanced portfolio around the world. Obviously, we're heavily weighted towards China right now, has been for the last 15 years. India is a very important market to us. It's a growing market. We are likely to put more formulating capabilities into India. But from a toll manufacturing, we will view India as we always have been, it is a source of active ingredients that can help balance our footprint around the world. Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Super. Thank you. Operator : We have a question from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli, Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Going back to Ag, are you seeing any trends or are you hearing anything about the movement towards less sugar in drinks and everything else we eat? And would that have a large impact on your sugarcane business in Brazil? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Rosemarie, not really. You look at sugar prices today, sugar prices are at a pretty high level. And really given, not that demand is dropping, but supply is being tight given the conditions we've seen in Brazil. And over the last three to four years, replanting in Brazil has been at a very low level. So, therefore, overall production in Brazil has been lower. We're expecting that in 2017 to 2018 season, that we know we'll start to see planting come back given the high value of sugar in the world market, and the opportunities there are for Brazilian growers. So if anything, I would say we've have been in a bit of a trough in the sugarcane business in Brazil. My expectation is, we should start to see that come out a little bit better in 2017 through 2018. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Okay. So, no real impact. Maybe that is coming five years down the road, I suppose. Looking at what you call not going back to a normal growth rate in Brazil and Latin America, I was wondering what you consider a normal growth rate? And if I may sneak one in, one additional one, how much leverage are you willing is acceptable to FMC in order to participate in the opportunities created by the big mergers? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yes. Regarding the big mergers, it's always \u2013 we believe we do have financing capacity if we need. It's a matter of what products, what growth potential and how they fit with our portfolio. So we haven't capped anything or limit our expectations on what FMC could not do. We want to be highly opportunistic. If there is something of interest, which is a high-quality product line or technology which fits our portfolio, it's all going to be a matter of price and return. And if it is there, we'll act. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Okay. And then a normal growth rate, please? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah. In Brazil, I mean, you've seen some huge volatility in growth rates in Brazil over the last few years. But if you take the long haul, I would say it's low-single to mid-single-digits in terms of market growth. When we get there, probably later on 2018 into 2019, I think we'll start to see those numbers come through. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our last question is from the line of Don Carson, Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hello. This is Ben Richardson sitting in for Don. Just wondering about CapEx on an ongoing basis. You're running at $130 million to $160 million, a little elevated versus the year ago. And that given the Lithium expansion and whatnot, wondering what level you see that in the out years? Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: So the CapEx of our business, if you (56:33) boil it down to purely non-discretionary, it's probably a little bit behind depreciation or lower than depreciation. So what we see each year is clearly some decisions that we make depending on market conditions, depending on cash flow expectations of where we want to deploy capital. We have seen a fallback in the last two years, and an expansion in the Ag business as we've had enough capacity, clearly, as the rebound comes, we would want to get ahead of that, and make sure we have enough capacity around the world, particularly in our toller network, and also in our formulation plant. They are not typically very high capital requirements. The key \u2013 we've invested historically of course in Health and Nutrition business, particularly with the Rayong plant that we've talked about already, today. As we sit here today, there was a bit of source of spending that takes us above that base level of maintenance CapEx of the Lithium business, and we've talked about the hydroxide expansion and we're spending some money on debottlenecking down in Argentina to free up capacity down there as well. We'll continue to look hard about what is the right capital deployment particularly into the Lithium business in the next 12 to 24 months, and we'll continue to monitor carefully what we need in the Ag business. They'll be the two places that I think we'll be paying the most attention in the near-term. I'd expect the spending as a result to remain just a little bit higher than depreciation levels for that reason. Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And what was the total spend associated with the Argentina debottlenecking? Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: So, the spending as we look into 2017 is what we're looking at. It's a relatively small amount of money. It's low double-digit millions in 2017 going into that. Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you much. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: All right. Thank you for your participation and thank you for all of your questions. We feel confident that we'll deliver on our promise for 2017. I will expect the year to be a no-surprise year of execution in what is a challenging, but more stable and flexible-like market and a very strong Lithium market. At this point, I want to thank you very much, and hand the call back to, Brian. Brian P. Angeli - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Pierre. Thank you, everyone for participating. That's all the time we have for the call, today. As always, Mike and I will be available following the call to address any additional questions you may have. Thank you and good day.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. FMC has had a strong start of 2017. A previously announced transaction with DuPont, which we will transform FMC into the fifth largest agchem company globally, and significantly enhance our R&D capabilities, remain on track for a Q4 close. And we are pleased to announce solid performances of both our ag solutions and lithium businesses in the first quarter, reflecting FMC's competitive position. I will focus on the performance of these two segments today and will also provide a few more thoughts on the acquisition, in particular, what we expect from the business immediately after the transaction closes. Turning to slide 3, FMC reported revenue of approximately $600 million, which excludes $177 million of revenue attributable to Health and Nutrition. Adjusted EPS was $0.43, which excludes approximately $0.21 attributable to the reporting of Health and Nutrition in discontinued operation. On a like basis, with our initial guidance of $0.50 to $0.60 per share, adjusted EPS would have been $0.64, which is $0.09 or $0.16 \u2013 $0.16 above the midpoint of our guidance range. Later on this call, Paul will walk through how the move to have Health and Nutrition to discontinued operation impacted adjusted EPS in Q1 and how it impacts our full year guidance assumptions. For the full year, we have amended our adjusted EPS guidance to reflect the removal of Health and Nutrition and now expect to report adjusted EPS of $2.20 per share to $2.60 per share. To be clear, this guidance excludes any earnings from the acquisition of the DuPont business that we may benefit from in the last few months of the year. Before I get into specifics regarding our Ag Solutions results, let me start with a market update. As you may recall, when we gave guidance in February, we talked about how we saw the market performing by regions. We saw North America down from the prior year, in Europe flat to slightly up. For Asia, we expected an improving market with mid single digit growth and in Latin America, we expected to see improved market performance, primarily benefiting the second half of the year. We expected the bulk of the revenue and earnings from the two Northern Hemisphere regions to be delivered in the first half of the calendar year and noted that the timing of sales between Q1 and Q2 was difficult to predict. North America remains a difficult market and our review of the market hasn't changed. Europe has gotten off to a slow start, especially in the large Northern markets where the weather has been poor. We now expect the European market to be flat to slightly down in 2017. In Asia, we have seen even more favorable conditions than expected in Australia so far, which we expect to continue, and I'm now slightly more bullish on the region as a whole than we were three months ago. In Latin America, we are pleased with what we have seen in the region with a large selling (6:23) crop enhancing grower finances, improved fundamentals in areas such as sugarcane and cotton, and lower inventory in the channel compared to the same period last year. We are therefore confident today that this market will grow as we head into the second half of 2017. In the context of these market conditions, let me now move onto FMC's performance on slide 4. First quarter revenue of $530 million was down 3% compared to the same quarter last year and earnings of $83 million were up 1%. This is a significant improvement over where we guided for the quarter. However, it appears to us to be mainly a shift in timing from Q2 to Q1. As I will discuss later, we feel confident confirming our full-year guidance as a result of this strong quarter and overall solid market in Asia and expectations of a strong Latin America season in the second half of the year. Overall, we believe that our strategy of maintaining discipline on price and terms, and limiting credit risk while pursuing top line growth only where it makes sense for our business is the right one. We see opportunities in Asia and Latin America and we will act responsibly in pursuing those opportunities continuing to balance earnings growth with earnings quality, credit risk and cash flow generation. Turning to slide 5, I will provide additional comments on Ag Solutions regional performance starting with North America. Revenue increased 1% in the quarter, ahead of our expectation. These reflect a shift of demand from Q2 to Q1, rather than improvement in conditions for the market as a whole. Distributors and retailers in North America continue to purchase pre-herbicides earlier, and we have seen this in the strong performance of our Authority brand. In Latin America, sales were down 6% compared to last year. Mexico has performed well, despite the challenges from the movements in the peso against the dollar. We continued to grow in Latin America outside Brazil and our move to direct access in Argentina has been a success. In Brazil, we continue to be encouraged by the benefits of our decisions to focus on collections and drawing down customer inventory. Compared to the same time last year, we believe channel inventory of FMC products has declined by 35% and by over 50% since the end of 2015, which sets us up well for the Q3 and Q4 selling season. And as Paul will comment on later, we are seeing strong cash collection performance in the region. However, I will remind you that Q1 and Q2 are relatively quiet periods in Latin America for us. And we remain focused on conditions heading into Q3 as a predictor of our performance in the region. In Europe, revenue declined from last year by 14% in the quarter. Much of this was timing as Northern Europe started slowly as well as some impact from the strengthening of the euro. For the first half of the year, we expect revenues to be slightly down, largely due to this currency headwind. European markets are an important focus for FMC and we are very happy with our performance given our country, crop and product mixes. In Asia, revenue increased 19% in the quarter due to favorable conditions in Australia driving strong demand for herbicides and successful launches of new rice herbicide in China. In Indonesia, we saw increased demand for rice insecticides as favorable weather extended the rice growing season. We continue to expect that Ag Solutions 2017 revenue will be between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billon, which is roughly flat to 2016. Our view on segment earnings is also unchanged with segment earnings of $410 million to $450 million, an 8% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Earnings performance will be driven largely by improved mix, new product introductions and lower operating cost, which will be partially offset by FX headwinds. We expect continued margin improvement with high teens margins for the full year. We expect second quarter segment earnings in the range of $80 million to $100 million, with mid to high teens segments earnings margins. This will result in a first half of 2017 that is slightly down compared to the first half of 2016, with earnings decline in North America and Europe offsetting increases in Asia and Latin America. Our implied guidance for the second half of 2017 is for year-on-year earnings growth in the high teens percent. This reflects the improvement in conditions in Brazil that we have already discussed as well as an improved pricing and lower cost, particularly with regard to factors such as aging, bad debt and product returns. In addition, the restructuring of our market access model in Argentina will continue to deliver significant additional opportunities in the second half of 2017 compared to 2016. As you see on slide 6, Lithium delivered another strong quarter. Revenue of $66 million was up 9% as lower volumes were offset by improvements in prices in both product and customer mix. Segment earnings increased 45% from Q1 2016 to $22 million in the quarter as significantly higher prices and improved mix offset headwinds from lower volumes. The lower volumes were caused by reduced carbonate sales as we continue to divert carbonate to China for the ramp up of the new lithium hydroxide facility. Segment earnings margins was 33%. Approximately 11% of Q1 revenue was generated from the sales of upstream products, like chloride and carbonate, and this will decline to around 8% of second half revenues. As you know, we have built two new 4,000-ton lithium hydroxide units in China this year. And we are well into customer qualification processes. Our quality and application testing shows the hydroxide we are producing in China is equivalent to the hydroxide that we produce in Bessemer City. We believe that our customers will reach the same conclusion, allowing us to move to commercial sales by the start of the third quarter. It is these additional hydroxide sales that will drive most of the growth in the second half of the year, when hydroxide is expected to represent over 50% of the segment revenue compared to about one-third of first half revenue. We expect lithium segment revenue in 2017 to be $325 million to $365 million, an increase of over 30% at the midpoint, driven by a combination of increased volume and higher prices. The combination of increased hydroxide volumes, higher prices and improved mix as well as greater confidence of the timing of full commercial operation for hydroxide expansion, gives us the confidence to increase our guidance for full year segment earnings to $100 million to $120 million. This represents over 55% growth at the midpoint of the range. We also expect to achieve the low 30%s earnings margin percentage for the full year. We expect second quarter segment earnings in the range of $19 million to $23 million. Let me spend a few minutes on where we see the Lithium business going in the near future. As we stated in March, it is our firm intention to separate Lithium into a standalone public company and we will continue to assess the appropriate timing. There are two factors driving our decision on timing. First, practically speaking, our organization is focused on the successful integration of the DuPont acquisition and we do not believe it would be wise to distract ourselves from this in the next 12 months or so. Second, we believe that we need to further develop key areas before pursuing a separation. The first of these areas is the Phase 2 expansion of the lithium hydroxide operations. Our first phase has gone extremely well. The units have come online quicker than planned and at a lower capital cost. As I mentioned earlier, our tests show that the product produced is equivalent to that produced in Bessemer City. So, we have very high confidence that we can pursue Phase 2 when the market demand warrants it. And in this regard, the rates of growth of hydroxide demand continues to be greater than the rate of increase in capacity. As a result, we expect starting Phase 2, we will add a further 12,000 tons of capacity across three separate units. All three of these units will be online before the end of 2019. We will give more details on the timing, the cost, and the locations of these additional units later this year. A second key area is securing the carbonate supply we need to serve our downstream operations. Today, we are not exposed to the market price of carbonate in any meaningful way. In the second half of 2017, when the two additional hydroxide units are in full commercial operations, only about 5% of our revenue will be generated by sales of carbonate as we will use the majority of our product internally. As we look to continue to grow our hydroxide capacity, we recognize the need to secure reliable cost effective supply of lithium carbonate, and we have always stated that we will pursue multiple paths to do this. Our agreement with Nemaska to buy 8,000 tons a year of carbonate, starting in late 2018 is an example of one path we will continue to explore. A second path is to produce more carbonate from our existing facility in Argentina. We have therefore initiated a program of debottlenecking and other small capital investments that will increase our carbonate production by 4,000 tons a year by the end of 2018. These investments will require less than $30 million in total capital. The third path we are considering is a significant expansion in capacity at our Argentina location. This location is one of the lowest cost producer in the world, and we have started the process of assessing the doubling of capacity through a major expansion there. We are progressing the engineering work and are in discussions with local authorities regarding this investment. We expect to complete our analysis on the economic merits of such an investment this year and we expect to announce our plans including timing, capital cost and total capacity to be added before the end of 2017. Moving briefly to slide 7, which summarizes our outlook for the second quarter and the full year. On a consolidated basis, our guidance for second quarter adjusted earnings is a range of $0.40 to $0.50 per share. As I mentioned previously, we are maintaining full year earnings guidance for Ag Solutions, while raising it by 10% at the midpoint for Lithium. I will now turn the call over to Paul. Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Pierre. Clearly, our results this quarter are impacted by the move of the Health and Nutrition segment to discontinued operations. The Health and Nutrition segment itself delivered operating earnings in line with our prior guidance range. The move of these results to discontinued operations impacts our results in three primary ways : first, the segment operating income is excluded from our adjusted earnings per share and will be excluded for the entire year; second, a portion of the interest expense, around a quarter of it will be allocated to discontinued operations until the transaction closes; and third, the tax rate now reflects only the tax rate on the earnings of continuing operations, that is Ag Solutions and Lithium. This tax rate on continuing operations earnings is much lower, since the Health and Nutrition earnings are taxed at a higher rate. We expect it to be in the 12% to 15% rate for the full year. For those who wish to reconcile our adjusted EPS back to the guidance range of $0.50 per share to $0.60 per share for the quarter. And as Pierre mentioned at the start of today's call, that on the same basis as t guidance, our adjusted EPS would have been approximately $0.64 per share for the quarter or 16% above the midpoint of our guidance range. Moving onto cash flow on slide 8. As with the income statement there is a large impact of the move of Health and Nutrition to discontinued operations embedded in here. In the first quarter, we lose around $50 million of reported operating cash flow as a result of reclassification. And for the full year compared to our prior guidance, almost $250 million of the $350 million reduction is related to the move of the business out of continuing operations. To be clear, the majority of this cash will still be received by FMC during our ownership of Health and Nutrition through the end of October, and our net debt balances will reflect that cash collection. Regarding Q1, overall cash collection was seasonally strong for FMC. As you know, Q1 has historically seen a large cash outflow driven by the Ag segment and we have been working to reduce that outflow over the last few years. Last year, we benefited from a one-off early collection in North America, which we chose not to repeat this year. Once you adjust for this item, our Q1 operating cash flow in Ag Solutions was roughly flat with Q1 2016. In Lithium, we saw a small reduction in cash flow despite higher earnings related to a build in inventory associated with the start-up of the hydroxide units. Our focus on Brazil collections continues to pay off with Q1 cash generation in Brazil up over 50% compared to the same quarter last year. Equally important, the quality of the remaining receivables continues to improve. Total past due receivables continue to fall in dollar terms while the collateral we hold against the receivables whether in forms of crop liens or other legal claims continues to climb as a percentage of total balances. Supporting the comments Pierre made earlier regarding the Latin American market, FMC is heading into the Brazil season in four or five months' time with a far healthier balance sheet than in either of the last two years. For the full year, we expect to see continued benefits from the reduction in receivables in Brazil, reflecting the healthier financial condition of many of our most important customers. However, against this we see two headwinds that will result in full year operating cash flow for Ag Solutions being lower year-over-year. The first and largest factor is a planned build in inventory for sale. This reflects our view, that there is a real possibility that demand will be greater in Latin America and parts of Asia than we have seen in recent years, and given the long supply chains in our business, we do not want to find ourselves short of products to meet that demand. This inventory build should be viewed as an insurance on our part in the event we are being overly cautious on demand in these markets. The second factor is our expectation that prepayments in North America may be lower in 2017 than 2016, reflecting the reality of the market conditions in North America. The net effect of these three items is a reduction in cash flow for the segment of around $100 million, compared to 2016. Foreign currency had a somewhat limited impact on our earnings in the quarter with the real particularly stable compared to recent volatility. The one area that we did see some impact in the quarter was in Ag Solutions in Europe, as the euro strengthened against the dollar, creating a small headwind to both revenues and earnings. And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Paul. As I mentioned at the start of the call, that I would give some more thoughts on how we view the performance of the business we are acquiring from DuPont. A couple of weeks ago, Paul shared with you some modeling assumptions and we thought it would make sense to update you on where we are on those assumptions today. As you can see on slide 9, we continue refine each line item in our model, reflecting work our financial, commercial and integration teams are performing. We remain confident in the numbers we presented to you in late-March and our underlying assumptions as to what will drive the increased earnings have not changed. We are starting to look at weather range estimates to some of these numbers, particularly in areas such as the potential for earnings growth in 2018 over 2017. We also are starting to refine our estimate of the accounting treatment of certain items, particularly taxes. Clearly, the item that we are most focused on refining is the year-over-year earnings performance of the acquired business. Given today's market conditions, we have been quite cautious in our assumptions as to earnings growth. We have assumed a lower rate of revenue growth than was presented to us by the seller. We believe this is the right approach to take until we own the business and can therefore develop our own views as to the near-term growth potential. The same is true as to our assumptions on cost synergies as we have not yet quantified the short-term cost synergies impact versus the acquisition-spending model. The end results remains clear, however. We expect an increase in earnings per share over the $1 per share in 2018 as a result of this transaction. In summary, we feel very good about where FMC is today. Our current Ag Solutions business delivered a good Q1 on the back of a strong performance in Asia and North America. We are reaffirming our full year earnings guidance at $430 million at the midpoint, with the growth driven by a strong second half in Latin America and a strong year in Asia. Lithium also had a good first quarter, and is on track to deliver higher earnings in the second half of the year, as the hydroxide units commence full commercial operations. We are therefore increasing our guidance for earnings for the full year by 10% to $110 million at the midpoint. And we have received very positive feedback from our customers, shareholders and employees on the announced transaction with DuPont, which will fundamentally transform our position in the global crop protection industry and bring greater clarity to the FMC investment story. I want to thank you for your attention and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question will go to Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : This is Ben Richardson sitting in for Don. Thanks for the question. So, just on the issue of sales timing and sales being pulled forward from the second quarter into the first. Is it the case that, given the wet conditions in North America and Europe, you might see sales pushed now to the third quarter? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: So, I think we're facing a situation which is not surprising. You've seen that with many of our competitors. We've said that also in the previous earnings call. We have a difficult time today under the current market condition to exactly understand the timing at which customers are buying. And it seems like in this market and you've seen that with many of our competitors, lot of our customers decided to make purchase of pre-emergent products in the first quarter rather than the second quarter. I think, we are trying to think more in term of first half and second half. So, the first half is going to be very much in line with what we're expecting in total, but with a shift in North America from Q2 into Q1. Europe is also pretty much in line, except that there was a slow start with cold weather in the Northern part of Europe. H2 is still the same, we don't see any move to Q3, Q4 from the first half of the year and H2, second half is very much for us based on the strength of our Latin America and Brazil market. Actually, on the (33:41) side, Mark and I, we were in Brazil last week. It feels very, very different than it did a year ago. We met with our sales organization. We met with customers. Discussions are strong. Confidence is strong. If you look at what we need to meet our objective in the second half we believe that last week, which was the last week of April, we already bought half in the book, half of the orders we need to do our second half, which is much better than where we used to be in previous years. So a first half, which will be pretty much in line with what we are expecting with a tough market in North America, despite the very strong first quarter. And a second half, which is looking very good right now, with what we have in hand in Latin America and Brazil. And across the entire year, a very solid Asia. Mark, you may want to add something on customers, Latin America. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: No, I think what Pierre said is exactly what we saw, the customers are \u2013 obviously, they've come off a bumper crop, so they have cash. As Paul commented, we saw better cash collection that's indicative of the way they feel about their business today. We feel very good going into the second half of the year, both in Brazil, but also in Argentina and Mexico, we performed well in those two countries, which are growing for us. But overall, I think we are very solid on Brazil. Obviously, it'll be interesting to see how the North American market develops in terms of yield as we go through this year, but I can tell you, Brazil for us is in much better shape than it was. And we talked about this a lot over the last few calls, so if you looked at our growth rates over the last 18 months, we've been lower and we've been unwinding our inventories deliberately in the field so that we could get to this position where we had a good forward view, and that's exactly where we are. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: So, as a summary, only surprise so far this year, if I can call that a surprise, we're potentially expecting it is movement in North America from Q2 to Q1. And the other positive is we feel stronger than we felt in a long time around Asia, Latin America and Brazil. Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : All right. And are you seeing a tail from any Cheminova synergies? Are those done or do we still have any to come here in 2017? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: I think all the hard synergies are done at this point. We talked a lot about that over the last few calls. I think where we're starting to see and continue to see is opportunities with some of the active ingredients and formulations that we acquired, we're seeing progress in North America on fungicides and also in Europe with fungicides and insecticides. Latin America, distribution is helping us, continues to help. So, yeah, I think we're very much where we said we would be, and more to come in terms of growth from the active ingredients. Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Excellent. Thank you much. Operator : And we'll go to Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Good morning. Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Pierre, I was wondering if you could go back and give us a little bit more color on operations in Argentina. First of all, it looked like costs were a little bit of a drag in the quarter, can you comment on that? And then I just wanted to make sure I understood that in Argentina you're pursuing a debottlenecking effort that's going to cost you $30 million and would bring on 4,000 metric tons of new material, but then you're also considering a bigger expansion down the road? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: That is correct, Mike. So, cost in Argentina is nothing to be worried about. You see that every year, it is very seasonal, depending upon summer, winter, and rainy period in the towns. We do have quarterly changes in manufacturing cost very often, hitting us in a quarter, which is not the quarter where the challenge were or the conditions were because of the way you are accounting for manufacturing cost, but it's just the seasonality of the manufacturing cost in Argentina. You are correct, you got it right, we are right now working on debottlenecking and we have a strong certainty that the spending of $30 million will drive to an increase of capacity by 4,000 tons by the end of this year regarding \u2013 at the end of 2018. We are also considering the possibility to double the capacity of Argentina with a full-blown expansion we would do in the same location where we are currently producing lithium carbonate. We are doing the pre-engineering work now. We believe we'll come to conclusion sometime end of the third quarter or fourth quarter in terms of the spending the timing, the exact capacity and we're currently in discussion with the authorities in Argentina. That would be roughly an additional 20,000 tons of lithium carbonate. So, if you think about it, today we're in the 18,000 tons range, we're adding 4,000 tons, we'll take it to 22,000 tons and then we're considering doubling the capacity. Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : All right. Thank you for that. And then question on the Ag Business. Just going back to this North America issue where you're seeing pre-emergent demand being pulled forward, but still sounds like channel inventories are still elevated in some areas. Can you help us understand kind of where you're seeing the inventory channels still at higher levels and how you expect that to play out over the next several months? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah. Mike, certainly on insecticides, we see inventory levels are high in insecticides. We've \u2013 I think as most people know, there's been low pest pressure in North America the last few years. So that's an area that we've been focused on. For us, pre-emergents get used very early in the season. So, yeah inventories are high now, but they should be because product needs to be moved to the field. So that's normal where we would expect it. We're not a big player in fungicides, so I can't really comment on that. It's an area that's growing for us. Assuming, we have pest pressures this year, I would expect to see insecticides come down, but it may take more than one season to get us back to normal levels. Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : And we'll go to Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. It's clear that Asia remains a solid opportunity for you guys, but can you just breakdown any other key trends pertaining to the recent product launches in China as well as any similar initiatives in Central or Southeast Asia or even Australia. Just trying to get a sense of how you should perform versus the market in the next two years to three years. And then also any comments on how we should think about Rynaxypyr, adding Rynaxypyr to your Asian portfolio. Thank you. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah. Chris, China has \u2013 the market has been difficult in China. I think a number of people have commented on that over the last month or so. We saw a great success with a new product that we've launched for rice herbicides, weed resistance in rice continues to be a problem. We've had good success there. I see that continuing as we go through this season and into the next season, the team is very focused on that. I would also say an area that we've highlighted before is plant health. These are micronutrient products, biostimulants. We have invested a lot in China and other parts of Southeast Asia and we're starting to see the benefits of those investments pay off. Other parts of the region that we should look for Indonesia, we have very good rice exposure there, markets doing well, the weather was good. So, we saw an extended season. In Australia, really it's a herbicide play for us with some insecticides, weather conditions have been good. I suspect over the next few years, you will see us grow faster than the market in Asia. With regards to Rynaxypyr applications, obviously we're still learning that business, but given the scale of Rynaxypyr in Asia and our markets to, and our channels to market are very strong. I would expect to see growth with Rynaxypyr in Asia over the coming years. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. And just another long-term question, over the last two major crop protection acquisitions, you've diversified yourself from a regional sense and also balanced both your insecticide and herbicide portfolios. But on the fungicide front, just how are you thinking about your owned portfolio, you have a few in the pipeline, I guess, you have four or so in discovery from DuPont. So just from a strategic sense, how should we think about this in your kind of intermediate to long-term total solution offering to growers? Thanks. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah. It is a focus, we've talked about it a lot. Our pipeline, we have two fungicides coming from the pipeline that launched \u2013 our own pipeline, that launch in 2020. Obviously with the acquisition we are making and the discovery capabilities that we will have, fungicides will be an area of focus for us. We will also look as usual to partner with other people who have fungicide active ingredients from a technology standpoint. So, I mean, all areas are of a focus, but more so than most will be the fungicides piece. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Awesome. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go to Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, gentlemen. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Good morning, Frank. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, Pierre, couple of questions on the DuPont transaction. One is, do you guys have some visibility on how the portion that you are going to acquire performed in Q1 and the expectation for that here in Q2 relative to what your expectations were? As you mentioned, I think you said that you were expecting \u2013 you are forecasting a lowered growth rate. Is there anything that was indicative of what's happened so far this year that leads you to that conclusion. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Frank, we don't have visibility at the level of the product line growth. As you know, we manage the business very independently. The comment we are making is through the process of buying the product lines from DuPont, we got their historical numbers and their forecast for the years to come based on historical numbers in the market. And DuPont tends to look at product lines like Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr as long as those products are under patent protection to be mid-single digit to high-single digit growth rate, pretty much regardless of the market. So we have not, in any of our projection and in the model we have here, come close to this right now. The only thing we have factored is a low single-digit growth rate more as a placeholder. But our numbers we have in the model are more conservative than numbers they have been able to demonstrate in the past or they have in their future forecast. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I'm stunned that DuPont's investment bankers would try and project a very rosy outlook for their products, that's absolutely stunning. But on slide 9, just staying with the DuPont transaction and adjusting the incremental EPS for 2018, what \u2013 can you update us on your thoughts on the synergy side between \u2013 for that transaction? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yes, Frank. Once again, this number we have here is pretty much of a placeholder. The synergies \u2013 it's a very different type of synergy process than what you usually experience when you do an acquisition. Pretty much, we're going to get a couple 1,000 people coming \u2013 from 2,000 people coming from DuPont. Think about that as 1,000 people in manufacturing, 500 people in technology position and 500 people in commercial. Very few back office people finance, IT, supply chain or communication et cetera. The question is we have a model, which we presented, which had a 16% to 18% SG&A spend. The question is how many people will we have to add in addition to the TSA, which will result in our 2018 spending and that's what will create the synergies. We don't believe at all that we will need to add as much cost as the one we had factored in the acquisition model, which was based on a standalone business. But we have not yet defined the delta between the cost we have in the model and the number of people we will need to operate the business by November 1, when we close on the acquisition. That's what will create the synergies, those are easier synergies to create than when you do a Cheminova where you have to let go people and it takes time. Those synergies hit you right away, but we just don't know the number yet. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : That's very helpful. Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll go to Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please go ahead Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey guys. Nice start of the year there. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Mike. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Pierre, I think you guys talked or Paul might have mentioned that, you're building inventory \u2013 just in case demand is a little bit better in Asia and South America. Are there any particular crops or areas that you think could come in better that the inventory is being built on or is it fairly across the board?. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I'll make a couple of comments and then have Mark adding on. I think, we worked a lot to lower the inventory of our product in the channel and it's starting to show significant result. Plus I have to say that the financial conditions of the growers in Brazil with the soybean situation have improved and our trip last week was very telling in term of the potential demand. If you look at the orders we have in hand, at this point of the year for what we need to accomplish in the back end of the year are much higher than what we had in previous year. All of those indications are leading to a potential strong Brazil and Latin America season. This is why we are looking at building inventory to face a demand, which could be at least what we're expecting potentially better. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah. Mike, herbicides is a key focus for us given when we get into the later part of the year, obviously, we're looking at inventory builds for the future North American season. Obviously, Brazil is well on the way by then, and then looking at Asia, and especially Europe. So, herbicide is a big focus, also fungicides from the Cheminova portfolio, also a focus for us. And then selective insecticides in certain parts of the world, Brazil being one and Asia being the second. So, it's across the board, but with more emphasis on herbicides. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. And a quick follow-up, on slide 9, you gave us $1.09 to $1.41 incremental EPS for 2018. Just to make sure that excludes potential synergy and a low growth rate for DuPont's business that you're buying. What does it assume for just kind of ag crop protection, recovery, growth for the industry? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: What we decided to do, if you look the line before last, which has 2018 incremental pre-tax earnings. We have set as a place order again, and we feel it's a conservative number, we agree we \u2013 anybody could challenge us on this number. We've put a $50 million to $80 million of earnings growth. If you think about it, it would be a $30 million, $40 million of synergies, a $30 million, $40 million of top line growth, which would mean minimum synergies and low-single digit growth rate in a fairly flattish market or a low-single digit growth market. So those are very conservative assumptions. We intend to refine that as soon as we have our hands on the business. So what you could expect from this $50 million to $80 million. The part which is cost synergies, we believe we'll have that sometime in the third quarter. We will know better this number. The part which is business growth, it will be more once we have our hands on the business toward the end of the year. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. And we'll go to Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Good morning. Just wanted to sort of get back on the Ag business a little bit, but obviously when the first quarter guidance was provided, there was a talk of pull forward into the fourth quarter from the first quarter. But it sounds like you've also experienced a pull forward from the second into the first here. So, I guess, the explanation or the interpretation is that the second quarter is going to be a little bit weaker. Is all of this timing sort of transitory or is the market evolving as we go through this or. I'm just trying to understand kind of all of these pull forwards from quarter-to-quarter and whether or not they are just related to this season and this weather or whether this is something that we look forward to next year, we should be cognizant of? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I think, those movements are very much North American movements in a market where there is a difficult situation from an inventory standpoint. And I think growers are making the decision to buy the product they absolutely need to buy. They tend to buy those earlier to secure the product, and buy then at the last minute the product which are not needed early. So, I would say, what we've seen depending upon the market situation, inventory and we tend to reason to think more in term of adds of years or in crop season, then we really tend to think in term of calendar quarters. And that's something we've seen more and more over the years. When the markets are very strong, then we tend to buy early. When the market become a bit more challenged, people buy when they have to buy and you see those kind of movements. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. So, I guess, does that mean that the pre-buy indicates that there is a little bit of a stronger expectation for the market? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: No. I think it's for pre-emergents, it's just timing of the crops and they want to make sure for the product, which are required early in the season, they have those on the shelf. But it doesn't mean it creates a lot of expectations that the business will be stronger in North America. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Got it. And as a follow-up just on the lithium really quick, I mean obviously you're scrambling as quickly as you can to build out the lithium hydroxide capacity and covert as much of carbonates to it as possible. What happens to this market, as everybody is sort of trying to follow that playbook? What happens to the supply and pricing, and sort of the service in the butyllithium and some of these other derivatives that are not going into the sexy EV part of the business, but are still critical to the market segments where they do go? Is there a danger that those markets will get shorted or is that a good thing? Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.: Hi, Dmitry, it's Tom. Yeah, the market has been recovering from being short for probably going on 24 months now, starting to see a little bit more balance in the products that everybody can supply. The way that we're approaching this is to very specifically target applications that we want to serve and most of that is on long-term contracts. So, we're identifying the demand, locking up the demand and building the capacity to do that. And as we do that, as we ramp up our hydroxide production, these debottlenecks that are taking place in Argentina, it's not one big project, it's a lot of small projects. So, the 4,000 tons that Pierre spoke about earlier, we'll get more than half of that or at least half of that to more than half of that by the end of this year. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll go to Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Hi. Good morning. I just want to understand some of your commentary on lithium, as it seems like you do have a lot of opportunities on the go, whether expanding some carbonate, expanding hydroxide in different places, spinouts, versus a month or so ago when you talked about some of the options of spinning out the Lithium business, has your thought been that this could take a bit longer? Because you think you have more on the table, looking at the supply/demand for carbonate and hydroxide, looking at what you can do that maybe there is more things that you can do in this business before looking to spin it out. So, has your timing delayed a little bit out of some positivity in the business or maybe give a little color on that? Thanks. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I think there is no fundamental change to the timing. We do not want to be in a situation, where we make a decision to spin this business, without most of the key projects being on their way with a very clear strategy. We are not going to wait, for example, to have the doubling of the carbonate expansion in Argentina finished to spin the business. But we want to make sure that we have total clarity when we \u2013 when we're going to be on a road show for this business to become a standalone company, we'll have a full story around capacity. So, what we believe at this stage is we should be able to make a decision, as we said before, toward the end of 2018 or early 2019, but there is no change to what we said before. Operator : And we'll go to the line of Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in here at the end. On a regional basis, are you seeing any pressure on CP pricing given the ongoing lighter volumes and elevated inventories, again, in certain regions? And I get that that's going to be product specific. And then also, are you seeing any pressure on pricing in the channel? Thanks. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah. Brett, it's Mark. Let's quickly run around the world. In Europe, not a lot of pricing pressure. We're seeing improved margins in Europe mainly through our mix. We've gone through a lot of portfolio rationalization. So, things are looking reasonably good in Europe. In Asia, overall, pretty good, less channel inventory pressure with the exception of, I would say, India right now. Everywhere else is looking good. In Latin America, currency has been pretty stable. So, pricing movements have been limited. Hopefully, the currency stays stable as we go through the rest of the year. So, not so much there. Obviously, price \u2013 a significant price increases in Mexico given where the peso has been moving. And then, I would say, North America, yeah, there is pricing pressure in North America. We talked about how the market has inventory in the channel and growers are under pressure. So, I would say, around the world, it's pretty balanced with the exception of North America. Operator : Now, we will go to the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks very much. Maybe question for Tom, just trying to understand better the competitive dynamic in the hydroxide battery markets. I guess, specifically, is there something different or unique about your own hydroxide versus the growing production in China from the Australian spodumene base production, is there a threat to your business there? Is there an opportunity for you? And as you change to an external lithium carbonate supply, does that complicate matters for you? Thanks. Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.: Yeah, Bob. Thanks for the question. Our product does perform differently than the competitive products. If you look at the applications we are targeting there is really two producers who have been capable over a number of years of serving that application and we are able to use multiple inputs of carbonate in order to produce the products we make. So they see a benefit on the production of the cathode material and we expect that to continue. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And Pierre, if I might, since those before me snuck in a second one. In Argentina, you're mentioning spinning the business. Is there a limitation and can you explain a limitation to a sale of the business there? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: So, the only reason for which we want to spin the business versus a sale is purely tax. It is the fact that we have a very low tax base for our Lithium business, I think it's about a $100 million. So if you look at potentially the value of this business, looking at where the EBITDA could be in next couple of years, it would be a very significant tax bill. So, we believe the best way for us to return the value of this business to the shareholders is a spin. Now, shareholders after that could decide whether they want to keep or sell the stock, but we believe it's more responsible to spin and not to pay such a big tax bill. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Perfect. Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you. Operator : We'll go to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC : Hi. This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. You mentioned a couple times about pre-buying or just some sales shifting from the second to the first in North America. I was wondering, if a similar scenario could unfold in South America and Brazil in particular? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: No. I don't think so, I think the market in Brazil for us, especially as we said is a lot stronger. I think what you have to realize when we talk about this subject, in North America the difference between buying in March and buying in April is very dependent on conditions and of course that's Q1 to Q2. The same thing occurs in Brazil, September is a very large month, but so is October. So, you can have flow between the two months, which is a very short timeframe in the ag space, yet it falls in different quarters. So, I think you've got to be careful of how you look at this, but I fundamentally don't see any reason why we would see a shift from Q4 into Q3 in Brazil in particular. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: It is something and we'll have the same comment when we'll come to Q3, Q4 guidance, most likely for Latin America, we're going to give numbers, but we're going to make the same comment. There could be shift from Q4 to Q3. I think today, our level of confidence for Latin America and Brazil is the highest in a long time, but as Mark said, a Q4 to Q3 or Q3 to Q4 movement is still possible. What we believe is H2, H2 to H2, it will be a high teens growth, that's what we have in the forecast. How it will then flow between Q3 and Q4 is still to be defined. Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then you \u2013 we've talked extensively about your big push into fungicides and just expanding the product portfolio. In the future, would that include maybe moving into biologicals or is that kind of too far outside the core business or just too different to consider via M&A or just organically growing into that field or putting R&D towards that? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Laurence (sic) [Dan] (1:03:38), we are already pretty significantly into biologicals. We have an alliance with Chr. Hansen that we've been running for the last three plus years very successfully. And we have products in the marketplace. We consider ourselves already in biologicals. We have about nine new microbial biologicals in the pipeline, expect those to come to market within the next two years to three years. But yeah, microbiologicals are a very much part of our portfolio as we go forward. Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC : Thanks very much. Operator : And our last question will come from Daniel Jester from Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, thanks for taking my question. So, just two quick ones on the DuPont transaction. The manufacturing assets you're acquiring with that. Do you have any updated thoughts about how you can optimize your supply chain. Is there a possibility to shift some of your total active ingredient production into these sites and save on cost that way? And secondly you definitely have been spending some or trying boost your working capital efficiency. So I am wondering how that program fits in as you acquire these DuPont assets? Thanks. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: It's a highly regulated industry, so over the long-term owning large assets like the one we have plus our network of processors would allow us to do, to think strategically about a subtraction in where we make product, but there is not much options you have in the very short-term because of product registration. And you know, re-registering a product could take anywhere from two years to five years, and depending upon, and the manufacturing location matters in the registration process. So in the long run, yes, in the very short term, if you talk about the next two years, there will not be a lot of changes in places where we manufacture a product. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: The working capital, I think we're going to be \u2013 we're going to be pretty much on the same track as we are today, it's a very high focus. We don't believe that the acquisition we did from DuPont is going to fundamentally change the work we do. One good thing about working capital is the situation where we can rebuild. As you know we discussed DuPont retaining the receivable. So we're rebuilding that, so we're starting with a blank sheet of paper allowing us to do that in a very organized way, and maybe not falling in the traps we fell in a few years ago. So no fundamental change, maybe more flexibility for a very structured approach to it. Operator : And speakers, I'll turn it back to you for closing comments. Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.: Thank you. That's all we have for today. As always, I'm available following the call to address any questions you may have. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : That's all the time we have for today. This concludes the FMC Corporation's first quarter 2017 earnings release conference call. Thank you.",

Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call for FMC Corporation. Phone lines will be placed on a listen-only mode throughout the conference. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer period. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Wherley, Director, Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Mr. Wherley, you may begin. Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Pierre Brondeau, President and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Pierre will begin the call with a review of FMC's second quarter performance, and then discuss the outlook for the remainder of 2017. Paul will provide an overview of select financial results. As a reminder these metrics exclude any impact from the pending acquisition of the DuPont business and our Health and Nutrition business, which is reported in discontinued operations. The slide presentation that accompanies our results, along with our earnings release and 2017 outlook statement, are available on our website, and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available at the conclusion of the call. Mark Douglas, President, FMC Agricultural Solutions; and Tom Schneberger, Vice President and Global Business Director, FMC Lithium, will then join to address questions. Before we begin, let me remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including, but not limited to those factors identified in our release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties . Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms, as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call, are provided on our website. With that, I now turn the call over to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. FMC had another strong quarter and with the recent approvals from competition regulators, our pending transaction with DuPont remain on track for a November 1 close. We are pleased to announce both our Ag Solutions and Lithium businesses posted strong results in the second quarter. I will review the overall Q2 performance, then focus on our projections for the second half of the year. And finish with an update on the 2018 financial impact of the pending acquisitions. Turning to slide 3, FMC reported second quarter revenue of $657 million, which was up nearly 7% year-over-year. Adjusted EPS was $0.48 in the quarter up 4% versus the same period a year ago and $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance. Before I get into specifics regarding our Ag Solutions results, let me start with a brief market update. Globally, we expect the crop protection market to decline by a low to mid single-digit percentage in 2017. North America continues to experience difficult market condition, largely due to weaker grower economics and we expect it to be down mid single-digits for the full year. In Europe, the season was negatively impacted by a late start in North and Central Europe in Q1 and by hot dry condition in Southern Europe in Q2. We now expect the European market to be down in the low-to-mid single-digit range for full year of 2017, slightly weaker than we expected three months ago. In Asia, we believe the market will be flat to slightly up for full year of 2017. Although we are pleased with what we have seen in Latin America with the largest selling crop enhancing grower finances and with improved fundamentals in sugarcane and cotton, it is clear that channel inventory levels are still impacting some of our competitors in the region. Largely as a result of this last factor, we expect the overall market in Brazil to be down low-to-mid single-digits for full year of 2017. Let me now move onto slide 4, and FMC Ag Solutions performance in the context of these overall market conditions. Second quarter revenue of $583 million was up 6% compared to the same quarter last year. Revenue growth was driven primarily by increased volume in Brazil and new product launches in Asia, offset partially by lower sales in North America. Overall, volume was up 10% offset somewhat by a 4% headwind from weaker price. Segment earnings of $96 million were down 5% year-over-year with weakness in North America having the largest impact on our earnings. Price was a drag in the quarter. But year-to-date price was down 2% which is consistent with our expectations for the full-year. We continue to execute a strategy of maintaining discipline on price and terms and limiting credit risk while pursuing top line growth only where it makes sense. We see continued growth opportunities in Asia and Latin America and we will act responsibly, continuing to balance earnings growth with earnings quality, credit risk, and cash flow generation. Turning to slide 5, I will provide additional comments on Ag Solutions' regional performance in the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2016. North America sales declined 7% on lower demand for insecticide and lower pricing. In Latin America, sales increased 38%. In Brazil, we saw improvements in sales to cotton, sugarcane and soybean growers. Our move to direct access in Argentina continues to be a bright spot with strong sales in pre-emergent herbicides. In Europe, revenue increased 3% in the quarter as we largely recovered from a lower Q1 sales to perform in line with the market for the first half of 2017. In Asia, revenue increased 4% in the quarter. We saw successful launches of new rice herbicide in China, and increased demand for rice insecticide in Indonesia. Moving next to the outlook for 2017, we expect that Ag Solutions 2017 revenue will be between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion, which is about 3% year-over-year at the midpoint and slightly higher than our previous guidance. We have tightened the guidance range for segment earnings to a range of $415 million to $445 million, with the midpoint reflecting an 8% year-over-year increase. At the midpoint, we are focusing earnings growth of 16% in the second half of 2017 relative to the same period in 2016. This includes third quarter segment earnings in the range of $100 million to $120 million, which represents a 22% increase at the midpoint. This second half growth will be driven largely by improved performance in Latin America, as significantly higher volumes and lower operating cost will more than offset the forecast price headwinds. We expect continued margin improvement with second half earnings margin of 20%. Our expected year-over-year performance in Latin America reflect the benefit of how we have operated in Brazil the past few years. As you recall, we took four broad actions commencing in early 2015 to position our business in Brazil to match the operating conditions we see today. First, we reduced our cost base to better match market conditions. Second, we became more disciplined in our sales process mainly with regards to sales terms and cash collection. Third, we eliminated sales of low value product from the portfolio, selling only those products where FMC was able to achieve acceptable financial returns. And fourth, we acted to reduce the amount of FMC product in the distribution channels. To this point channel inventory of FMC products in Brazil has declined by 60% since the end of 2015. The impact of these deliberate actions in the last few years have been painful, but we are now positioned to reap the rewards of these actions. We have also seen improvements in cotton and sugarcane market conditions in Brazil where FMC has significant exposure. Outside of Brazil, our move last year to a direct access model in Argentina will continue to deliver significant opportunities in the second half of 2017. Moving now to slide 6, Lithium delivered another very strong quarter. Revenue of $74 million was up 17% driven by improvements in pricing and product mix. The pricing improvements were seen across the portfolio. Segment earnings of $24 million in the quarter increased 47% versus Q2 2016 as significantly higher prices and improved mix offset higher costs. The higher costs were largely due to the impact of seasonal operating conditions and costs related to expansion project. Segment earnings margins was 33% versus 26% in the prior year period. We are raising our full year guidance for the Lithium segment. We now expect revenue to be between $340 million and $360 million, a year-over-year increase of over 30% at the midpoint and earnings to be between $115 million and $125 million, an increase of over 70% at the midpoint. We expect a mid 30%'s earnings margin percentage for the full year. We expect third quarter segment earnings in the range of $30 million to $35 million, which represents 34% sequential improvement at the midpoint as well as year-over-year growth of about 85%. The main driver of the increase in our earnings guidance versus our May guidance is increased confidence in the ramp up of our new Hydroxide operation in China, and the success in obtaining customer qualifications. We began selling products from this plant late in Q2, we will steadily ramp up through September and we should be selling at full capacity in Q4. As a result, total Hydroxide revenue in the second half of 2017, is expected to represent over 50% of segment revenue compared to about 35% of first half revenue. Let's now turn to slide 7 to discuss in more detail our Lithium expansions and how they will impact the next few years. This starts with our Hydroxide phase 1, which we discussed in the context of 2017 already. In 2018, we expect to realize the full volume benefit from these two 4,000 ton lines built in China. Hydroxide demand projections continue to outpace capacity addition across the industry, especially in the segments of EV battery market where hydroxide has a distinct technological advantage, which is in high Nickel content cathodes. Most of the pure EV models currently in development will rely upon high nickel content batteries, due to their greater energy density, which provides a longer driving range. We remain fully committed to the Phase 2 hydroxide expansion. Phase 2 will add a further 12,000 tons of capacity across three separate units. All of which will be online in 2019. We will give more details on the timing, the cost and the location of these additional units later this year. But we could see some sales from Phase 2 in the latter part of 2018. We will continue to enter into customer contracts similar to those we currently have, before we dig in to build these new units. These current contracts for a Phase 1 hydroxide volumes are largely three or four-year of contracts with commitments on both volume and price. Moving to the right hand side of this slide, the second leg of our Lithium expansion plan is to produce enough carbonate to continue to serve our downstream operations and remain a fully integrated lithium producer. With the plan outlined here, we will have enough carbonates and chloride to sustain our growth projection for our downstream business into the foreseeable future. Our current facilities in Argentina are operating at record levels and as you saw this quarter, we're successfully managing the seasonal production variation caused by weather conditions. In addition, our debottlenecking project will add an incremental 2,000 tons to 3,000 tons of carbonate production in 2018 with the remainder coming in 2019. Next, our agreement with Nemaska to buy 8,000 tons a year of carbonate, starting in 2018 runs for multiple years and we remain confident in Nemaska's ability to meet their commitments to FMC. We will continue to look at similar sourcing deals where terms and price make sense. However, our first priority option to source additional carbonate is to significantly expand capacity at our Argentina location where we are planning to invest $250 million to $300 million to add 20,000 tons of capacity. This facility is one of the lowest cost producers in the world, significantly lower than it was in 2015 before the Argentine peso devaluation. We estimate our current cash costs are less than half that of a typical bitumen-based producer. Expanding this facility has low risk execution. We have operated at this location for many years and have benefited from our ongoing manufacturing excellence programs. We are progressing the engineering work and we are in discussion with local authorities to finalize these plans. As we have stated since March 31, it is our firm intention to create two independently listed public companies with leading positions in their respective industry. To this end, our current plan is to move toward a separate listing of FMC Lithium in the second-half of 2018. We expect to announce a final decision on the timing by the second quarter of 2018. Moving briefly to slide 8, which summarizes our outlook for the third quarter and the full year. On a consolidated basis, our guidance for the third quarter adjusted earnings is in the range of $0.57 to $0.67 per share, up approximately 45% at the midpoint versus the same quarter last year. As I mentioned previously, we are maintaining full year earnings guidance for Ag Solutions, and raising it by 9% at the midpoint for Lithium. We are tightening our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year to a range $2.30 to $2.50, which represents year-over-year EPS growth between 20% to 30%. I will now turn the call over to Paul. Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Pierre. Today, I will cover three topics, cash flow and net debt, collections in Brazil and the forecast for the corporate cost line item. Starting with cash flow on slide 9. We have seen strong performance in cash flow generation year-to-date, which is reflected in a reduction in net debt of around $150 million, since the start of the year. This is despite the headwind created by one-off cash costs related to the DuPont acquisition. In the last 12 months, we have reduced our net debt balance by over $275 million. Q2 saw encouraging trends in Brazil, which I'll touch on in a moment, leading to adjusted cash from operations of $214 million year-to-date, 24% better than the same period last year. Brazil collections were ahead of forecast, with a particularly encouraging reduction in the past due receivables balance, which fell by over 15% in the quarter. Put simply, we're collecting existing past dues and reducing the occurrence of new past due balances. One of the key drivers behind this collection performance has been our success in reducing the level of FMC inventory in the distribution channels, which Pierre mentioned earlier. From FMC's perspective, channel inventory is a far smaller headwind to sales or collections than it has been in any of the last few seasons. For the full year, we expect to generate operating cash flow in the $530 million to $630 million range, which would be broadly flat with 2016. We expect to see net debt continue to fall in the third quarter, before a small increase in Q4, as we head into the heart of the Brazil selling period and the start of the North America and Europe sales seasons. You'll have noticed an increase in the forecast for corporate costs for the full year and particularly high expenses in this quarter. The driver of this is the higher FMC share price that we have seen since the start of April, which creates a mark-to-market expense for the outstanding long-term incentive awards granted in 2015, which are delivered on the basis of historical total shareholder return. The higher share price is also the reason for the higher estimate of fully diluted shares outstanding, from 135 million to 135.5 million shares. Finally, you have likely noticed that we are not increasing our full year EPS guidance, despite an increase in guidance for the segments of $10 million at the midpoint. The combination of higher corporate costs, higher share count and a slightly higher estimate for the full year tax rate offsets this increase in segment earnings. With that, I will turn the call back to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Paul. I mentioned at the start of the call, that I would give you some more thoughts on the pending acquisition from DuPont. We have received approvals from most of the major jurisdictions needed to close our transactions with DuPont and we continue to work constructively with the few that have yet to issue a ruling. As a reminder, our transactions are contingent upon the close of the Dow DuPont merger which is expected this month. We also need to complete the step required to separate the business from DuPont. This remains on track for a November 1 close as set out in the purchase agreements. If you turn to slide 10, this is a first look of the 2018 financial performance of FMC in its new form. The model starts with our current 2017 EPS guidance and adds the insights of the DuPont acquisition, plus the 2018 impact from the growth of FMC Ag Solutions and Lithium segments. I will touch on some of these key assumptions in this model. We now expect cost synergies will be between $40 million and $80 million in 2018. There will be additional cost synergies to come in 2019 and beyond, but we will update you on the magnitude of those on our February 2018 earnings call. We remain quite cautious in our assumptions as to earnings growth for the acquired business and have assumed a lower rate of revenue growth than was presented to us by the seller. We continue to believe this is appropriate until we own the business and can develop our own view of both near-term growth potential as well as waiting until we take a first look at how the new Ag markets might perform in 2018, but we are comfortable providing a forecast revenue growth for 2018 for the entire Ag Solutions segment in the 2% to 4% range, which equates to EBIT growth of $30 million to $60 million. We may update this estimate again in November, but we will certainly give a formal guidance assumption on the February earnings call. You may have noticed we did not include an estimate for revenue synergies. We expect to give our first estimate in the February 2018. FMC has begun the process of divesting the portfolio of products required by the European Commission remedies which was announced last week. We expect the impact of this to be about $10 million to $15 million of earnings in 2018. Next is the growth of our Lithium segment. By looking at our projections for Q3 and the implied Q4 earnings from running our Phase 1 expansion at full capacity, you get a good starting point for 2018. Taking into account seasonal production, cost and prices, we believe that earnings growth of $40 million to $50 million is appropriate for Lithium for 2018. This model shows significant earnings growth in both businesses in 2018, but we are still at an early stage in the forecasting process. In summary, we feel very good about where FMC is today. Our current Ag Solutions business delivered a solid Q2 and we're set to deliver a strong second half driven by Latin America and Asia. Lithium had a very strong quarter and is on track to deliver higher earnings in the second half of the year as the new hydroxide units commence full commercial operations. We continue to receive very positive feedback from our customers, shareholders, and employees, on the announced transactions with DuPont, which remains on track. Thank you for your attention. And we will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Operator : Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can jump back in the queue. And the first question will come from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. I had a lithium question for Tom if I could. You mentioned customers looking for longer contracts. Obviously, you're going to have quite a bit more capacity. Can you talk about how the pool of customers is changing as the lithium market evolves how broadening has the customer list become? Has it gone beyond just cathode producers can you give us some sense of those discussions? Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.: Yeah, Robert. Happy to. So, first off, we're watching the whole value chain at this point. I think, we've mentioned in the past that we're targeting specific battery types and cathode types, where we see the bulk of the growth in the pure EVs, which are going to use the bulk of the lithium and have the highest performance requirements for the lithium. As we do that, the different auto manufacturers as they launch their new EV lines are in various stages of setting up their supply chain. So there are cases where we're selling via contract to cathode manufacturers in China, there are cases where we're selling to battery manufacturers and there are cases where we're selling to OEMs on contracts and we'll continue to evolve to find the most advantageous position in each. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And if I might follow up on the Ag. Is there any risk of some pull forward in Latin America, obviously the year-on-year comps looked quite strong, should we expect maybe there is going to be a payback in the second half there? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: No \u2013 we, it's a very clean quarter. As I said we are selling online with the demand and we are expecting a \u2013 we have a very large part of the orders in hand. We are expecting a very strong Q3, Q4. We are very certain that there is nothing which came in Q2, which was a pull forward from Q3, Q4. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Just given your comments about the North American crop protection market and inventories and in the context of the leverage that US distributors have over some or most chemical producers. What actions if any, can you take to alleviate their efforts to meet annual sales incentive levels, later on in the year, therefore reducing the risk of an inventory build at year-end, and potentially driving an overhang into 2018? Thank you. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah, Chris. It's Mark, it's a good point. We are working obviously with our customers very closely on where the sales will occur and at what level and those are based into our forecast. So we are predicting that we will be drawing down inventory levels, yet at the same time we built our programs so that our customers can be rewarded for the quality of the technology they buy from FMC. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And just a quick follow-up, just based on the previous guidance range, you indicated that you'd already locked-in, I think it's roughly half of your sales as of late Spring for the LatAm market in the second half, but can you just give us an update on your LatAm outlook by country. Obviously, it seems like there is some [dispersing] trends there including Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico and just any comments you have on your core emerging market trends in terms of pricing in LatAm and Asia. Thank you. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: That's a lot of questions there. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Sorry about that. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Let me start off with Brazil. Yeah, last time we spoke, I indicated that we had about 50% of the orders in hand. Today, that number is north of 65%, most encouragingly it's higher than that in the north of Brazil. So by year, Mato Grosso sugarcane is pretty much on track, slightly less than 65% in the South, but that's kind of normal for us. So we feel very, very confident about where we are in terms of the orders on hand to deliver the type of second half we've said. Around the rest of the region, Argentina, we talked about Argentina given our new direct access model, we are very, very bullish on Argentina for the second half. We got more sales people on the ground. We see continued expansion of weed resistance, and our pre-emergent herbicides are doing well and obviously, we are looking forward to the DuPont portfolio coming through. Mexico, Mexico has had a tough time this year, not only with currency devaluation, but weather conditions. However, we have a portfolio that is spread very much into the niche crops, so berries, fruit and vegetables. So we expect to see a good second half in Mexico as we end the year. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Let me use that question to make a comment very specific about Brazil because it has been in the center of the discussions from many of our competitors. I just want to reinsure everybody that 60% less inventory of the FMC product in the channel, 6-0, since the peak at the end of 2015. An organization which is now half of the size of what it was at the end of 2014, is allowing us to be highly competitive and to look at a very solid demand for our products. So, as many of our competitors, we have concerns for the North American market, but I would say Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Brazil for us, we are feeling much better where the company is, and we believe we have taken our pain over the last two years, it's been painful to announce some of the quarterly earnings, when we were working on this, but I think we're very strongly positioned and believe it's going to show well in Q3 and Q4 this year. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aziza Gazieva - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, guys. It's Aziza on for Frank. I just was wondering, if you guys could elaborate a bit on that positive customer feedback you alluded to regarding the transaction? Thanks. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yes. I think like in any market, customers like to have the choice of companies, which are proposing a different portfolio technologies and product and today we've met actually as late as last week with our largest customer and there is a very positive reaction to see FMC expanding into a company with a broader portfolio, broader technologies. And, Mark, do you want to add to that? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: No. I think the only thing I would add to that Pierre is, you're talking about two significant companies coming together in terms of the portfolios with well respected people with good customer relations, so our customers recognize that, they see us as truly a fit Tier-1 company which is going to give them a lot of optionality, so from a customer perspective, they're going to get new technologies from the pipeline that we have and they get full market access. So, it's generally being seen very positively. Aziza Gazieva - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys. Nice... Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Hi, Mike. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: ...quarter there. Hey, in terms of your outlook for 2018, I appreciate the update there. When you think about some of the puts and takes, the synergies and the Ag Solutions EBIT growth, where do you see some upside and where are you a little bit worried potentially as we head into 2018? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I would say, the only worries we have is not linked to the transaction, it's always today we believe in many places the Ag market has bottomed out, has bottomed. And we see a cycle potentially slowly coming back to \u2013 going back to growth. So, if we are always very careful when we do forecasts, it is not linked to the transaction, it is linked to the market. We want to be sure that its evolving in the right \u2013 into the right direction, which we believe it is. The transaction we feel very comfortable, there is no, not a line we have in the forecast, which is of concern to us. The two lines as you can guess, where we are very careful, because we are still working on them are the year one synergies, we said $40 million to $80 million goes all the way from supply chain to commercial and back office. And the growth where we don't want to push a number, which is much higher than the 2% to 4%, because we want to see a bit what we can do once we have the portfolio. So, those still need to be worked on, but I would say the numbers we are giving in this forecast do not create any concern for us, nor do we have any operational concern at this stage. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: All right. And then it does sound like your Lithium expansion plans are going well, you've got long-term contracts for, it sounds like the bulk of the capacity that you're going to expand to. So, when you think about spinning or starting the spin process in 2Q, are there any variables that we need to consider to see whether that's been where we'll go as planned? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I think today, when we look at the spin, we would be very surprised, if it would not happen in the second half of 2018. We don't see anything which could derail that, but we want to make sure we have finalized all of the discussions with the government in Argentina. We want to make sure we have completely detailed our capital spend and project expansion. And we believe a 2Q announcement of the exact timing for an H2 2018 is very likely. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Right. Thank you very much. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Jester from Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, everyone. So, in North America in the past, you've commented on some sales into the channel versus sales on the farm. Just wondering if you have any color about the second quarter, how that progressed? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah. What we call product on the ground is roughly flat with last year in Q2. We had expected it and hoped it would be a little higher than that, but it hasn't turned out that way, especially given the weather conditions we've seen in parts of the U.S. So, it's slightly lower than we thought, but flat on the ground at this point is not a bad place to be. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then on lithium, with regards to the Phase 2 of the hydroxide expansion, what specific final data points do you need to lock in, in order to pull the trigger and start construction? Is it just customer contracts, is it logistics, site location just can you walk us through what are the key things we should be thinking about going into that? Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yeah. I think, we have no doubt or little doubt that we will be able to contract all of this capacity ahead. I think, the decision Tom and the team have to make is around locations. We have three units and we have to analyze the markets and our global supply chain to decide where each of those units will be. China and North America being two potential locations, but we are looking at all of the options. So, that's the main question which we have to decide on. Tom? Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.: Yeah. The only thing that I would add to that Pierre is that we are duplicating the engineering design. So, whether we put it in China or North America, it's a tactical decision. It's easy to execute. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO. Please go ahead. Fahad Tariq - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Hi, this is Fahad on for Joel. I just had a question on the DuPont cost synergies. So, the previous estimate I believe was $30 million to $40 million and now it's been increased to $40 million to $80 million. So what, was there something that came about that allowed you to have more confidence in the synergy target and any color on why that range was increased? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yes. So, it is simply as a \u2013 as we've said, it's a very different type of synergies. What we are doing is we are receiving an organization from DuPont, and then we are calculating versus the theoretical model which has a $475 million EBITDA. How much resources we will really need to add compared to what we have at FMC. So the only reason for which the number has increased versus the previous version is as we get closer to November 1st, DuPont has more and more freedom to reveal to us the organization we are getting and consequently we are capable of better defining what we need to add to our current structure to operate that business. So, that's why it is not definitive, we're still working with DuPont. By the time we get to a \u2013 to November, we should have a much closer view on exactly the structure we're getting. We still have some questions around commercial supply chain and back office and we're working on that, but it's purely because we're getting more information as we go. Fahad Tariq - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): As a follow-up, so post 2018 is there potential for the synergies to go up once the service agreements with DuPont kind of go in some of that function comes in-house with your own employees. Maybe some color on past 2018? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yes. Certainly, so what we're going to have to do is \u2013 we're going to have over the next year and a half to put in place an SAP system which allows us to operate the entire companies, move out of the TSA. Ultimately, if you look into the back-end of 2019, we will be operating at a lower cost than we will be operating in 2018. Now, there are going to be phase where we are going to have to decide how and when we have resources to be ready to move out of the TSA. So it is not going to be a straight line, but definitely as you think about operating cost when we get out of the TSA with the new SAP system operating with our people, it will be at a lower cost than what we'll have in 2018 and early 2019. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : All right. Good morning guys and congratulations on another good quarter. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : I wanted to follow-up on the comment that I think Pierre you made, I wanted to make sure I heard it right. When you talked about Latin American crop protection business, you mentioned that inventory levels were still high for market participants, but not necessarily for you. So I just want to understand that that it was a comment related kind of to the market overall, but not specifically to your position in Latin America given how much you've drawn down your inventories? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yes, Dmitry. So what \u2013 here is the way that we look at it. We believe the performance companies will deliver in the future will be more linked to the actions they have taken in the last two years in the market. There is no doubt that overall, there is inventory in the channel, but inventory depends very much upon the companies. Some have taken like us, some very serious actions since the end of the 2015. We believe we have a very low level of inventory of our products in the market in Brazil and Latin America. Some have taken less, less actions and we'll have to deal with it in the next two years. So, we're pretty comfortable that's why we're forecasting significant growth in Latin America and Brazil in the second half. Other companies, we believe, will have to take the actions, they need to take to get to the same place. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : That's helpful, Pierre. And then a follow-up question on lithium, not just you, but you specifically have been surprising on the upside in terms of profitability and profit dollars as well as margins for the several quarters going back. So, my question is, is this more a function for you of how quickly you're converting to hydroxide. Is it a function of price increases being more than you've originally thought about or is perhaps volume doing a little bit better although it doesn't look like this quarter at least. Can you give us sort of a source of these repeated and consistent positive surprises on lithium profitability? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Sure. I would say if you look in the last put yourself in 2016 getting into early 2017, I think we got more price leverage than we were expecting. So, pricing was better, pricing increase and pricing options was better than what we were expecting, that was driving the better performance. Also a faster move to a mix containing more lithium hydroxide was also a bit faster than what we thought. That drove the better performance as it happened at the end of 2016, beginning of 2017. The new change is purely because our expansion in China for lithium hydroxide is growing exceptionally well and fast. Customers are qualifying the product very fast and our two units on stream operating very well. So we didn't have the expected troubleshooting, you always have to do when you start a plant and everything went a bit smoother than we were expecting. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Great. I hope this continues. Thank you very much. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. Pierre, I want to go back to your first look at 2018 slide. You were assuming 2% to 4% revenue growth for the combined Ag Solution business. Is that sort of a forecast that the market is going to recover or is that more product specific where you think the combined entity can grow above the market? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: So here is the way we are doing it and once again, it's early but we wanted to give you guys a sense. We are \u2013 it's pretty much, if you think about it the EBIT growth is pretty much in line with the kind of earnings growth our core business is currently doing. So we are looking at a market which is the same as current, maybe a little bit better than what it is today and a portfolio of products which is similar to what we have today with the new product base and new formulations. The upside to be very clear is the portfolio of DuPont coming at us. We know very well that there is opportunities with molecule like Rynaxypyr and very interestingly Cyazypyr, which could boost up that number. If it is still performing, the way I mean look at DuPont performance, it was pretty strong this quarter. So, but we are not assuming that until we see the portfolio. Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Then a follow-up on Brazil. On the last call you talked about how you actually had the need to build inventory for sale to take advantage of your low inventory position. Is that still the case and then also what's your currency assumption in Brazil, I know early in the year you were using a forward curve of about BRL3.50 to the $1, we're back at about BRL3.13 now, so that would seem to be potential upside from a currency perspective? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yeah. So, in terms of the inventory, we are still building up inventory. It might be a little bit lower and maybe more defined, because we have very strong visibility on what is required for growth in H2. We have more clarity today in demand and which product and the mix than we had in a long time. So, we're able to have an inventory buildup, which we're still building up inventory in maybe more and a more defined way. From a currency standpoint, Paul do you want to \u2013 the forward look is what? Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: Yeah. The spot rate today of BRL3.15, we essentially look more at the forward rate Don than we do the current spot rate, the current forward rate is in that BRL3.30 to BRL3.40 range, it's really been pretty consistent throughout this forecasting period and relatively benign for us. The reason we use the forward curve frankly is because once we make the sale, we then hedge it to the collection period which is on a forward rate. And that's the point and the rate at which we recognize the revenue and therefore the profit on that sale. So, I would describe FX today as relatively benign, relatively stable throughout this year both in terms of actual currency in Brazil and also our assumptions. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: The difficulty we are facing in Brazil, in Brazil today and you've seen we're not the only one, many companies have been addressing that is, you talk about upside the difficulty you have when you have a stability of currency below what was the forward curve a few months ago, is you get price pressure. So, basically the potential downside we used to have in previous quarters, looking forward for 2017 which was on currency. It's as Paul said, is becoming almost nothing on the FX side, but you see it more on the pricing side. So, you've to move from a downward risk on currency toward a downward risk on price. That's where, if you look on a look forward now, the currency impact is almost nothing in the second half, but we are looking for a full year with a overall price decrease close to 2%, which I think is about the same range our competitors are seeing. Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. What is the revenue and margin assumption behind that $475 million EBITDA estimate from the acquired products from DuPont in 2017, and what does that reflect on a year-over-year change versus 2016? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: The revenue we are \u2013 we have on the numbers for $475 million was slightly over $1.4 billion and $475 million of EBITDA. Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: Yeah. The EBIT margin on the 2017 numbers was about 28% EBIT margin was our assumption. And if you just back out, and that includes purchase price accounting, and that is different to what it would have been under DuPont's ownership because we have that extra slug of depreciation hitting us as a result of the accounting rules for acquisitions. And it's broadly \u2013 to your question it's broadly consistent with what the business saw in 2016. Steve Byrne - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: And with respect to the forward sales in Brazil for the second half of this year that 60% or 65%, you have already locked up for the second half of this year, are those sales actual...? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: We couldn't get the last part you said. Are those sales? Steve Byrne - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Are they \u2013 are those transactions that you can recognize as revenue, or are these expressions of interest? I'm trying to assess whether that is, those volumes are really secured for the second half of this year or do you run the risk of a competitor undermining you? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: No. Those are firm orders that we have with our customers, distributors and co-ops throughout Brazil. So, no they're firm. Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: And just to tune that point the revenue recognition is when a product is shipped and risk transfers to the customer. So, we will recognize that revenue after shipping takes place, right. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I think, we have not said in a long time but we have a solid certainty around the Brazil sales and what we have in the books today and what we have to deliver. But, as Paul said, the revenue recognition is a different thing. We have to ship the product to get the revenue recognized. We are not of course \u2013 yet except for the month of August, we're not yet in this period of time for Q3, Q4. Steve Byrne - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Very good. Okay. Thank you. Operator : You next question will come from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov - Instinet LLC : Good morning, thank you. You mentioned that other companies may still take action to correct their crop protection inventory in Latin America. Could this impact your business in a negative way? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Well, yes. I \u2013 if I may say, I wish everybody would have been a bit more aggressive and we would have a better situation where we would have more clarity. The competition is always more intense when people have a high level of inventory for which they need to take actions. But you know that's the way you do business and all of this will clear up in the next one to two years. So, yes, it has an impact, but no more than what you see right now or you'll see in Q3 and Q4. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: What I would say though is, just as a point on that, not all inventory is created equal and I think if you'd look at what many of our competitors have talked about the category of product, largely in areas particularly in Brazil, where we FMC are not major players. And so, it isn't necessarily, I know there are lot of concerns of \u2013 as I think Steve just mentioned undercutting price, and concerns with regard to substitution it is not that simple. And so, we are not particularly concerned about direct substitution of inventory in the channel to our product in perhaps the way some of you guys are inferring. Aleksey Yefremov - Instinet LLC : Thank you very much. On lithium, thank you for providing your initial estimate for lithium growth in 2018. You also mentioned that you expect lithium prices to continue growing in 2018. Does your initial estimate of $40 million to $50 million EBIT growth include such potential price increases? Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.: Yeah. So what we're seeing right now is a tight market. We do expect pricing to be, having upward pressure going into next year, but it's still a little early to call just how much we will see. So that estimate really takes into account prices essentially a little bit more than offsetting inflation and it reflects the run rate at full volume from our expansion. Aleksey Yefremov - Instinet LLC : Great. Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Just \u2013 I just want to make sure we give clarity. We wanted to give an overview of the business for 2018 for lithium, but please wait until we get to the firm guidance to have more precision than this $40 million to $50 million. Plus $5 million or minus $5 million today will depend upon what we see in pricing and mix. So we will give much more color and precise number when we get early at the February call in 2018, but directionally just give you a sense what we are expecting. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Lawrence Alexander from Jefferies. Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC : Hi. This is Dan Rizzo on for Lawrence. How are you? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Good. Good. Thanks. Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC : I noticed the cash flow from operations outlook for the full year is now $350 million to $450 million, that's up I think $130 million at the midpoint since the first quarter. I was just wondering what just some color on that, how you're going to attribute the large increase? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah. We're happy to. It's essentially receivables \u2013 collection of receivables we have. We're performing well. We're performing well in Brazil we're performing well around the world and we have a lot more confidence today that the reduction in receivables in Brazil that we've been looking to drive will actually occur. So it is almost entirely driven by a more positive outlook on our side as to what we think the receivable collection performance will be. You'll notice we were ahead in the first-half on cash flow and we expect that trend to continue in the second half. Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks for the color. And then just one other question. You mentioned that poor weather conditions in Europe have kind of limited sales from a growing season. Is there a chance for inventory build in that region. If I recall correctly, a company two years or three years ago one of the initial catalysts for the inventory build in North America was a poor growing season, and then you realized there was kind of a big build up in the inventory. I was wondering if something similar can unfold in a different region? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah. I don't think so for the following reason. Europe is 27 countries. So, you got a lot of different dynamics going on, even when you have a certain type of weather condition. So, I don't think you're going to see broad based inventory build in Europe. You may see some country based inventory, but it won't be big enough to derail a whole region like we saw in Brazil for instance. Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Just to add to what Mark said, it's a very important comment, when you think about inventory level. You see much more challenge around inventory in the channel, when you have markets concentrated with very large customers in very large countries North America or Brazil. You see way less of an impact around inventory when you have a more fragmented market with multiple countries and regions like you see in Asia or in Europe. Operator : And then your next question will come from the line of Brett Wong from Piper Jaffray. Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here at the end. Just wanted to get your thoughts around the crop in the U.S. and how that sets up for chemistry demand in 2018 and I know it's still a bit early, but just wanted to know your thoughts there? And then on top of that, given the weakness in insecticides in the U.S. have seen any increased book pressure so far this season and how that could drive or what your view is on insecticide demand as we look at 2018 crop season? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah. Brett. Today is early you're right to think about where we go into the next season. Obviously soy is doing well in the U.S. corn under a little more pressure, but for us that's good, obviously with a major position in pre-emergent herbicides and we are seeing good business in our post herbicides as well. So, the increase of soy is good for us. Weather conditions we'll see over the next few weeks, how things develop. With regards to bug pressure, everybody says every three years to five years, you should have a good bug run, well we're due one, we've been three years without anything. So we certainly have inventory out there available for in case there are issues with bugs. So, we'll see how we go in the next, again the next month will be very telling. Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks. That's helpful. And then, looking at South America, you talked about sugarcane fundamentals being stronger in Brazil, but do you see any risk looking out over the next season given the decline in sugar prices here more recently or at least compared to where we were at the beginning of the year. And yeah I know again a little bit early and yeah ethanol prices have been supported by ongoing lifts in gas taxes. But just wondering your thoughts given weaker sugar prices? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah. The sugar prices are weaker but you got to remember where they came from, they came from $9, $10 up to $21, $22 they're down at $14, $15. So, they are off the peak, but they are still a profitable business for a lot of our growers. In Brazil we're seeing constant planting now, so our month-to-month sales are very consistent with our forecast. So, we feel very good about where the sugar business is right now. Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks. Just a question on Latin America, one of the large competitors in the space reported very strong growth in acreage for Intacta , any thoughts on how that impacts your legacy products or molecules acquired from DuPont, i.e. Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yes. I think it's always something we're watching of course because of Rynaxypyr now. There are going to be some growth in acreage for Intacta, but it is very important to understand that Rynaxypyr is not a Brazil soybean story. We believe that the usage of Rynaxypyr on soybean and we have not seen all the numbers, but our market intelligence make us believe that, Rynaxypyr on soybean is about mid-single-digit percent of the portfolio we acquired from DuPont. So it is a small part, so it's going to have some impact. But it's very minimum. I mean if you think about Rynaxypyr growth opportunities in major part of the market just for example in Asia I would believe that Rynaxypyr is 50% sold in Asia. So we're watching, we're looking, there might some little down pressure on usage of Rynaxypyr on soybean in Brazil. But we don't think it will be much and it is a very small part of the portfolio we acquired. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's helpful, thanks. And just, can you just give us some thoughts on your margin targets in Ag, you were down year-on-year and I think in the past you had said that you'd want to get those above the mid-teens level. Any thoughts on what your projections are for margins longer term in Ag, thanks? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I think for the second half, we know we're going to be in the 20% range. We also know we're acquiring a portfolio of product which has posted plus in the 28% and so it's about 30% to 40%. So, the math would tell that you're going to bring \u2013 you're going to bring fairly quickly your EBIT margin in the 23% to 26% range. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you. Operator : That's all the time we have for today. This concludes the FMC Corporation second quarter 2017 earnings release conference call. Thank you.",

Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call for FMC Corporation. Phone lines will be placed on listen-only mode throughout the conference. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer period. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Wherley, Director, Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Mr. Wherley, you may begin. Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Pierre Brondeau, President and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Pierre will review FMC's third quarter performance and provide the outlook for the full year and fourth quarter. Paul will provide an overview of select financial results. The slide presentation that accompanies our results, along with our earnings release and 2017 outlook statement, are available on our website, and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call. Mark Douglas, President, FMC Agricultural Solutions; and Tom Schneberger, Vice President and Global Business Director of FMC Lithium, will then join to address questions. Before we begin, let me remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including, but not limited to those factors identified in our release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms, as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's call, are provided on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Before delving into our third quarter results, I just want to state that we successfully closed our transactions with DuPont on November 1 as expected. This was a great achievement for the hundreds of FMC and DuPont employees who worked diligently in a very compressed timeframe to carve out and stand up the acquired portion of the DuPont Crop Protection business for day one operations and to separate our Health and Nutrition segment for divestiture. We are excited about this transformation at FMC and the way it positions our Solutions business as a leader in crop protection. FMC now enters its next phase as a focused growth company in both Ag Solutions and Lithium. We continue to expect that we will conduct a separate listing of FMC Lithium in the second half of 2018 to create two independent public companies with each becoming a pure-play investment opportunity for shareholders. As we prepare for that listing, we will continue to expand both our lithium hydroxide and our lithium carbonate capacities to capitalize on the significant demand expected in the coming decades. But first, I will review the overall third quarter performance where FMC had a very strong quarter in both Ag Solutions and Lithium. Next, I will update our full-year and fourth quarter projection which now include two months of contribution of the DuPont Crop Protection acquisition. Paul will then provide commentary on select financial results. I will then finish with a few highlights of the 2017 performance of the acquired business, followed by updates on our 2018 assumptions. Turning to slide 3, FMC reported third quarter revenue of $646 million, which was up 3% year-over-year. Adjusted EPS was $0.70 in the quarter, nearly 60% higher than the same period a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $0.08 above the midpoint of our guidance, driven by strong operating results in each of our two segments. We are very pleased with our third quarter results. Both of our segments posted record third quarter earnings. Ag Solutions faced challenging market conditions, and many of our ag competitors discussed ongoing price and volume pressure in Brazil. FMC was able to outperform the market due to the work we did in 2015 and 2016 to proactively reduce channel inventories. In Lithium, we executed our phase one lithium hydroxide expansion extremely well in a market where delays have become the norm. Let me now move on to slide 4 and Ag Solutions performance. Third quarter segment earnings were very strong, growing by 31% year-over-year to $118 million. We also saw strong sales performance with 6% revenue growth excluding India. The growth was driven by the 12% increase in Latin America with Brazil volumes especially robust, and a 9% increase in North America. Offsetting this growth was a 4% decline in Europe and a 32% decline in Asia which was largely due to sales decline in India. We decided to take actions in India to prepare for the integration of the different market access channels between FMC and the acquired business which reduced overall Ag Solutions revenue by 7%. India is the only market where FMC and DuPont have significantly different channels to market. In total, third quarter global revenue of $552 million was down 1% year-over-year. The 31% segment earnings growth was driven by volume gains around the world excluding India, improved performance of our Brazilian business and overall lower operating cost. As you can see on the segment earnings bridge, the negative impact of the India sales decline was far smaller than the positive EBIT impact of the volume gains in the rest of the world. We expect overall profitability of the Indian market to increase significantly as a result of the DuPont acquisition. Foreign currency movements in the quarter offset modestly lower prices. Year-to-date, the net revenue impact from price declines is 2%, which is consistent with our expectations for the full year. Moving next to slide 5 where we outline three main drivers of the ag business so far in 2017. First, we have seen significant volume growth across many markets. In Latin America, FMC volume is 20% higher year-to-date, driven largely by Brazil where we are outperforming the overall market. We have also seen continued improvement of the fundamentals of Brazil's cotton and sugarcane market, two markets where FMC has significant share. We now expect the overall market in Brazil to be down high single-digit for the full year 2017 due to ongoing channel inventory actions being taken by some of our competitors. However, we believe product usage is largely flat. In Asia, excluding India, FMC volume is up 9% year-to-date. This growth has been driven by successful product launches in China, strong demand for rice insecticides in Indonesia and increased herbicide demand in Australia. We believe the overall Asia market will be flat for the full year 2017, slightly worse than we thought three months ago. In North America, FMC has posted a 2% volume gain year-to-date, which is largely in line with our market expectations. Our results were driven by stronger demand in the first half for pre-emergent herbicides, as well as third quarter strength in post-emergent herbicide and full year insecticides. We now expect the North American market to be roughly flat for the full year due to higher demand for full year insecticides. In Europe, FMC volumes are down 6% year-to-date, which is slightly lower than the overall market. Our results were largely due to the impact of FMC's business in France moving from distribution to direct market access. You will recall, France is the final country to make this transition from the Cheminova acquisition. We continue to expect the European market to be down in the low to mid single-digit range for full-year 2017. Moving to the second key factor in our year-to-date performance, which is the significant improvement in profitability in Brazil. The primary driver has been higher sales volumes, leading to 24% revenue growth. One of the main reasons FMC is outperforming the market in Brazil is a proactive management of channel inventories over the last two to three years. Our actions have reduced channel inventories of FMC product by 35% year-over-year and by 50% since the peak at the end of 2015. We believe that we are operating with closer to normal channel inventory levels of FMC product today. We have also benefited from a significantly lower cost base and improved product mix. Combined, these drivers have led to operating margin Brazil increasing nearly 400 basis points year-to-date. The third factor in our year-to-date results is the significant top-line headwind from the volume decline in India, which was primarily felt in the third quarter. As we stated earlier, this needed to be done so we could integrate two different channels to market after November 1. These actions mostly impacted the lower value in use portion of our business, hence the low impact on earnings. I will address the outlook for Ag Solutions after covering Lithium's third quarter performance. Moving now to slide 6. Lithium delivered an exceptional quarter, driven by the successful ramp-up of production from the new hydroxide facilities in China. Revenue of $94 million was up 28% sequentially and 35% year-over-year. Segment earnings increased over 50% sequentially and more than doubled year-over-year to $37 million in the quarter. Significantly higher volume and prices were the main contributors to the growth, driving the segment earnings margins of 39% versus 33% last quarter and 25% in the prior year period. Regarding the ramp-up of our new hydroxide operations in China, we operated at an annualized rate well in excess of the 8,000 metric ton nameplate capacity in the month of September. We are very pleased to have delivered this capacity expansion on time and under budget and it speaks to the engineering expertise of our Lithium business. Our debottlenecking project at our operation in Argentina also contributed to our Q3 results. The completed project has a deferred run rate of 2,000 tons per year of carbonate and will be at the full 4,000 ton run rate by the end of 2018. We continue to move forward with the expansion in Argentina where we plan to add at least 20,000 tons of lithium carbonate capacity with an initial investment of $250 million to $300 million. We are progressing the engineering work, and we are in discussions with the local authorities to finalize these plans. Turning to slide 7 and the year-to-date results for Lithium. Revenue has increased by 21% compared to the same period last year and earnings are up nearly 70%. From an overall market perspective, much of the focus remain on the supply-demand balance. In 2017, we have seen conditions tighten further as demand growth continues to exceed supply additions. Incremental supply of lithium carbonate continues to be provided from high-cost spodumene resources. In lithium hydroxide, FMC was the only producer to add significant capacity in the year. As we have discussed previously, pricing for FMC lithium is significantly higher compared to last year. Year-to-date, the average price per LCE is more than 20% higher than the same period last year, with hydroxide being the largest contributor, but all major product groups showing increases. Late in the quarter, our two China hydroxide units produced at full capacity, creating the second-largest driver of improved performance, which is higher volumes. These two hydroxide units, which were completed in less than 12 months, had a capital cost of less than $20 million operated in September at a rate of 9,000 tons per year, which is 12% higher than their nameplate capacity. Just as important, the customer qualification process has gone very smoothly, and the vast majority of our customers have signed off on the quality of the product we make in these two units. This means that we are now producing and filling at an annualized rate approaching 9,000 tons per year, doubling our lithium hydroxide capabilities compared to the same point a year ago. Moving to slide 8, which summarizes our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year including the impact of two months of results from the acquired business. We now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.59 to $2.69 which represents year-over-year EPS growth of 35% to 40%. This includes guidance for fourth quarter adjusted earnings in the range of $0.98 to $1.08 per share. We expect full-year Ag Solutions revenue to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion and segment earnings will be in the range of $465 million to $485 million. We anticipate the legacy Ag Solutions business will contribute $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion of revenue and $425 million to $445 million of earnings in 2017. The earnings guidance for the legacy Ag business represents 9% year-over-year growth and a $5 million increase versus prior guidance at the midpoint. Fourth quarter segment earnings are forecasted to be in the range of $168 million to $188 million. In Lithium, we are leaving our full-year revenue guidance up for the segment at a range of $340 million to $360 million, a year-over-year increase of over 30% at the midpoint. We are raising our segments' earnings guidance to a range of $124 million to $128 million, a year-over-year increase of nearly 80% at the midpoint and a $6 million increase versus prior guidance. We expect fourth quarter Lithium segment earnings in the range of $41 million to $45 million, which represent 17% sequential improvement at the mid-point as well as a doubling of earnings year-over-year. I will now turn the call over to Paul. Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Pierre. Looking at cash flow on slide 9, we continued to improve our cash generation performance with adjusted cash from operations 9% higher year-to-date compared to the same period last year. This is underpinned by improved collection in Brazil as mentioned earlier. Although the credit environment in Brazil remains weak, our overall credit exposure has improved significantly in the last 12 months with account receivables in Brazil 13% lower than a year ago despite strong sales in Q3 of 2017 and past due receivables declining significantly. We're not yet able to give a detailed forecast for full-year cash flows given the short amount of time we have owned the acquired business. However, our cash flow expectations for the legacy FMC business, excluding the acquired business, remains in line with our forecast of three months ago with adjusted cash from operations in the $400 million range. Looking forward to the end of the year and our forecast for our year-end net debt balance. We ended the third quarter at just over $1.6 billion, down $233 million from a year ago. Since the end of the quarter, we have fully drawn a $1.5 billion term loan to fund our acquisition of which we transferred approximately $1.2 billion to DuPont under the terms of the transaction. The remaining $300 million will be held as cash to meet various obligations related to the transaction, primarily tax payable on the sale of Health and Nutrition. The actual payment of many of these obligations will fall into the first quarter of 2018. In addition, we expect to receive significantly higher customer prepayments related to the acquired business in North America. Given this, we expect to carry a significant cash balance at the end of December 2017, with higher cash outflows relative to historical patterns in Q1 and Q2 of 2018. The net result is that we expect our gross debt at the end of calendar year 2017 to be approximately $3.2 billion, with net debt of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion. And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Paul. I mentioned at the start of the call that I would give you a few highlights on how the acquired business is performing this year. The revenue growth for the acquired business has been robust year-to-date. For full year 2017, revenue is expected to grow about 6%, which is driven by very strong performance in India, as well as increased sales of insecticides. The overall performance of the business is largely in line with our forecast made in March. A second key driver in 2017 has been the acquired business strong work this year to reduce channel inventories in its product in the Americas. We believe the acquired business have normalized inventory levels in both North America and Brazil. This performance positions FMC well to continue growing the business in 2018 at a pace at least as high as the 2017 growth. We believe this provides upside to our prior assumptions for the growth of the combined Ag Solutions business in 2018. This brings me to slide 11. We have updated some of the numbers, and we would also like to refer a comment about how we feel after owning the DuPont business for a few days. As we mentioned earlier, we have increased our 2017 earnings guidance for both our legacy Ag business and for our Lithium segment. We have also lowered our estimate for incremental D&A related to the acquisition, and we now have more certainty on the expected financial impact of the regulatory remedies in Europe and India. We are not changing the cost synergies range. As we have explained, these cost synergies are not the usual savings seen in acquisition. Remember that we are getting the business from DuPont with almost no corporate or macro fee structure. Cost synergies, in our case, are a combination of real cost decreases such as opportunities to operate plants at a lower cost and cost avoidance opportunities where we add less cost than were anticipated in the acquisition model. Our assumptions for EBIT growth in the combined Ag Solutions segment has the potential to have the most upside relative to the initial forecast when we assume 2% to 4% revenue growth in 2018. Based on what we have seen so far regarding the current business, we are feeling more positive about 2018 growth for Ag Solutions. We will be able to give more clarity on this topic during our February 2018 earnings call. Moving over to Lithium, We expect the positive trend we have seen year-to-year to continue through 2018, and we continue to expect Lithium earnings to increase by $40 million to $50 million. In summary, we feel very good about where FMC is today. Our current Ag Solutions business delivered record Q3 earnings, and we are set to deliver a strong Q4 driven by Latin America. The integration of the acquired business is in full motion with our team already \u2013 teams already operating together. Lithium had a very strong quarter and is on track to deliver even higher earnings in the fourth quarter as the new hydroxide units are in full commercial operations. I want to thank you for your attention, and I will now call \u2013 turn the call back to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you very much. We'll take our first question that will come from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. As your platform further transforms toward the discovery phase and AI development, can you just comment on your initial thoughts you have on long-term strategies and how you're positioning your team for success. And just that and any initial thoughts on product procurement given the size of some of the new products you'd now have and how that rolls through onto various global agreements and asset utilization? Thank you. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Hey, Chris. It's Mark. I'll take the R&D piece and then I think Pierre is going to take the procurement piece. On the AI, obviously, we have strong research capabilities with the DuPont acquisition, and we've already had our first initial set of meetings. What we're going to be looking at going forward is in excess to what we have today, we're looking at what pests, what crops are going to be our focus in the future. If you look at our portfolio today, you can see we obviously now have a very strong insecticide portfolio. We have a very balanced herbicide portfolio. Where I feel we're behind the market is in the area of fungicides. So that's going to be an area of attention where we're going to be looking for hits coming out of basic discovery to help broaden that portfolio of fungicides. In addition, the area of nematicides also springs to mind, very much allied to our insecticide work but an area of focus that we'll also go for. So I think you can see that the fungicides space is something that we really want to boost going forward. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thanks, Mark. Regarding procurement and the size of the new Ag business, I think needless to say that when we talked about synergies and cost synergies that is typically one of the place where we are looking at significant synergies. We are still quantifying all of that. We believe that one of the number one source of cost saving will be with our toll processors who are producing active ingredients. We do have the former DuPont business and FMC lots of toll processors in common, and we know that we have possibilities to create significant saving here. We also have the same situation on some of the critical raw materials. So, we are quantifying all of that. It will be part of numbers we will be reporting early next year. But we clearly have two source of cost saving. One is tollers and one is direct raw materials. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And just a quick follow up. I know it's obviously a little bit early, but just given what you've seen for Rynaxypyr this year, can you just give us some quick color on what you're seeing on a regional basis in your expectations? I imagine Brazil might be a slight headwind. But what do you see in the intermediate to long term on the opportunity front in Asia and any rice markets? Do you have any line of sight as it pertains to 2018 and 2019? Thanks. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Well, since we've only had it for a few days, Chris, that's a deep question. I would say if you look at the spread of where the products are, obviously Asia is an area of focus for us. The business itself has a superb route-to-market in India, which is one of the fastest-growing markets in the world. So, I think you can expect us to see \u2013 make more headways in India. Obviously, on rice, Rynaxypyr is a big product. But I also feel Cyazypyr on the more niche crops, the fruit and vegetables area in Asia will also be a benefit to us as well. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: On your comment about Brazil, Chris, which is a valid comment, remember, Rynaxypyr is not a Brazil story. It is much more of an Asia, Europe or North America story. The market is fairly, sales are fairly small for us in Brazil. The other point I would like to add, which is not a direct answer, but I want to use your point here of your question to talk about what we understand the team has done, and we went through there a number as quickly as we could. The team, when they were separated from DuPont and operating as a stand-alone organization, Rynaxypyr and other product did a tremendous job in removing excess inventory from the channels. So think about a situation where not only this business in 2017 grew at 6%, but at the same time was capable of bringing its level of inventory in the channel almost to normalized level, which is giving us very strong expectation going into 2018. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, gentlemen, and congrats on the closing of the transaction. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Hey, Frank. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Regarding the assumptions on 2018, it looks like your EBITDA is coming in somewhere around $1.2 billion or something on that order of magnitude. I was wondering if you could do a bit of a walk on where free cash flow may come in based on the guidance that you're \u2013 the range of guidance that you're offering on the EBIT side for 2018. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Sure, Frank. Let me just give you a bit of color around what we're watching out for. I mean, clearly, when we run from EBITDA down to free cash flow, the two big areas I tend to keep my eye out for are number one, clearly, working capital movements, and in our business historically, it has been a Brazil issue. As Pierre just mentioned, the acquired business really is not a large Brazilian business. And so we do not see a big headwind from what I'll loosely call rebuilding receivables in Brazil. As you'll recall, the terms of the transaction were that we do not receive any receivables from this business, so there will certainly be a rebuild. And I would expect that almost all the sales that you see happen in the last two months of this year will run through (33:46) Latin America, run through in an increased receivables balance. Offsetting that though, we continue to make very, very positive progress in Brazil with the legacy Ag business. You've seen some of the data we've put down here. We continue to reduce the capital tied up in that business, and I expect that trend to continue through 2018. When we look at the rest of the business, clearly, the single biggest factor that we will then be looking at will be capital spending. The business we acquired from DuPont is a little more capital intensive than our business, but it is still not hugely capital extensive. The Lithium business, we've made statements about $250 million to $300 million of investment in Argentina alone. Most of that will take a couple of years to spend. So again, while we'd expect capital spending to be higher in 2018, I certainly would not expect it to be a huge swing on that data, so I expect that we will have a pretty strongly cash-generative year next year. It's a little early to put specific numbers on it, but I certainly don't see anything that doesn't encourage me that we would expect to see significant cash generation in 2018 across the business. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And with respect to Argentina and that 20,000 ton expansion costing $250 million to $300 million. I don't believe you've made a final investment decision on that. Have you? And if not, when would you anticipate going down that path? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yes. I think, Frank, we are very close to making a final decision. Hopefully, we are just a few weeks away from this, potentially bringing that to our board at the December board meeting for approval. So we are getting very close to making that decision. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you so much. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: And I must say also, as long as talk about that, 20,000 today \u2013 we are studying the market. 20,000, I would say, is a minimum, and we are looking at building capacity, potentially beyond that all the way up to 40,000. So it's a work in progress but just a few weeks away from it. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. So, I mean, the basic point is that if you do decide to go ahead and do this, this project will be well underway prior to the IPO in the back half of next year. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Absolutely. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Had a couple quick lithium questions. First, I was wondering, do you guys make today more money selling carbonate or converting that and selling it as hydroxide? Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.: Hi, Bob. It's Tom. We make more money today selling our hydroxide. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got you. And then the expansions you mentioned, there hasn't been a lot of industry incremental expansion. Obviously, there's a lot of incremental enthusiasm for the high nickel batteries and hydroxide. What do you see from the industry in 2018, and are you sensing any anxiety on the part of the battery supply chain about availability of hydroxide to feed some of this demand enthusiasm? Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.: Yeah. It's a good question. What we're seeing, and it's very significant in China and then we're seeing it around the world with OEMs, is the ramp-up of the higher nickel cathode material capacity. So it is definitely accelerating, and we're already having discussions around 2019, 2020 volumes and contract discussions are getting longer, not shorter. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And have you picked, Tom, where you're going to put those next modular hydroxide plants? I think you mentioned there's a couple more in the queue, but hadn't quite defined where those would go. Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.: Yes. So again, similar to the carbonate comment that Pierre made, the 12,000 to get us to 30,000 total is a minimum, and we're ready to progress more than that, if need be. And the next units are going to go at both of the existing sites we're operating today to get the benefits of the infrastructure there. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Both being China and North Carolina. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks, Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: One in each. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ian Bennett - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. This is Ian Bennett on for Steve. In the Ag business, year-over-year growth was influenced by costs in other was a large contributor. Can you talk a little about what that cost other line was and what the expectation is for 2018? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yeah. Let me talk a little bit about margin improvement in general in the Ag business. First, let's talk about costs. We are operating with just a lower operations cost across the company in mainly in Latin American and Brazil. Remember Brazil two years ago was over $1 billion with a very large organization. We shrank that organization and tightened up our structure in order to focus on more technical and higher margin products. So we have a lower operating cost from a structure standpoint. We also have a lower operating cost in Latin America and Brazil because we are now, with the work we've done operating with a much cleaner balance sheet. So we do have, yes, less financing cost, less hedging cost. So we do have a much, much cleaner balance sheet, which is lowering our balance sheet expenses. So that's one part of the improvement of the margin in the Ag. The second one is, especially this quarter, is geographical mix. As we explained, we realigned or we are realigning the channel to market in India because DuPont is coming with a very robust system and channel to market, business and channel to market. So we have lowered low-margin sales in India, while we had a very strong quarter in North America, which is the highest margin. So we are benefiting from a good geographical mix. And final, you remember over the last two years, all the way to the end of 2016, we have been decreasing our sales of non-differentiated generic products or third-party distribution. And that also is contributing to a strong increase in our margins. So those are the three key drivers. Mark, did I forget anything? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: No, you got them all. Ian Bennett - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thanks. That's helpful. And as a follow-up, you mentioned earlier that year-to-date price is down 2%, but the outlook for volume growth next year looks quite favorable due to destocking. How do you think about price mix in the industry as we move into 2018, and are there particular areas or products that you're experiencing intensifying price mix pressure? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I think the price pressure has been mostly in Latin America and Brazil, and it's linked to two things. First of all, one is the competitive nature of the business where competitors maybe are starting to see the need to decrease the level of inventory in the channel which is always creating price pressure and also the fact that Brazil is a place where the price is indexed on currency. So that's the main driver. If you look at our, what we're expecting this year is to have a 2% price decrease. That is mostly coming from Latin America and Brazil. So most likely to remain next year because we believe our competitors are going to need a good couple of years like we did to clean up the situation. So those are the main drivers but we don't expect more pressure than that in the market going into 2018. Ian Bennett - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I was just wondering with all the conversions that you're doing to lithium hydroxide, can you update us on how much lithium carbonate capacity and lithium chloride capacity you have left to serve other non-battery markets, and where you are in sort of your drive to convert more and more of your carbonate to hydroxide? And I'm obviously asking prior to this 20,000 ton expansion that you're looking to add. Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.: Yeah. So again, this is Tom. Thanks, Dmitry. We expect to come in between 18,000 and 19,000 tons of LCE production this year. We will be over 20,000 next year and up to 22,000 run rate by the end of next year. That's before any expansions. We may get a little bit more than that. Overall, in terms of the strategy, you have to realize we're trying to stay long carbonate. Some years will be a little bit longer than others. We don't yet see a year where we're going to be short carbonate, but we don't have as much to offer to the market as some do. In 2019 also, we'll have the Nemaska volume begin to come to us for conversion as well, and then we'll have the expansions coming in as well. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. And then just a follow-up on the non-battery market, the butyllithium and the stuff that goes into greases and more industrial applications. Are you seeing strong pricing there as well? I mean is that market becoming short just as the battery market seems to be a little bit shorter of demand right now? And what are the pricing in those markets look like compared to the battery-grade stuff? I'm just looking in terms of year-over-year increases, not in absolute levels obviously. Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.: Yeah. So lithium is a pretty segmented market especially outside of energy storage so you need to look at case by case. In general, prices will go up. We expect prices to go up next year across the board. You do have some regional markets and then you have some different dynamics between the regions. (44:28) is that way to some extent, but across the board, we expect to see price increases. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead. Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. Pierre, I'm just wondering what your updated view on the overall market is. I know you said in the past you thought 2017 would be the third year of decline, albeit there less of a decline and that you saw growth in the overall market for 2018. Is that still your view? And then when will you have a better idea on the synergy side in terms of \u2013 specifically on the costs you need to bring in? I'm thinking specifically on the distribution side because it seems in the past you just used industry average percentages to come up with your forecasted cost savings. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yes. Let me talk the synergy aspect first. We want to be very clear, and I think that's what you're implying in your question. Synergies here are not your regular type of synergies where you're measuring your head count decrease and consequently you're monitoring how much cost you are removing from your operation. We're going to have two type of what we call, maybe a bit loosely, cost synergies. One is the real cost synergies, we talked about procurement is one driver. We believe there is significant opportunities here, and there is opportunities in plant operation and supply chain. Those are real cost synergies. The rest is just we are trying to define what is the operating cost we need for this business versus the model we had when we made the acquisition. Now, understand that the business which is coming at us, I know there is a tendency to push very large synergy number because we sometime believe DuPont being a large corporation, they come with large corporate cost. But remember, none of that is coming to us. We are getting no corporate cost, we are getting almost no back office people, no back office structure. So, we're only getting the manufacturing, the research, the sales, the marketing supply chain people and that's it. From this, we are adding very carefully to operate the business with the TSA we have with DuPont. We believe by the time we get to January, we will have defined our operating cost to run the business. That's where we're going to be. We're going to be looking at it. So by the time we get to the February earnings call, we \u2013 by the time we get to the February earnings call, we should be able to give you a very good sense for the bucket of real synergies and what is the operating cost of the business with those two businesses together. So our guidance in 2018 should be pretty firm when we give it with our Q4 numbers. Regarding the ag market outlook, the way we are looking at it today, we would say globally flat, maybe low-single digits, but that's about \u2013 we believe and we sense a stabilized situation. We definitely do not see decline, but more a flat to low-single-digit picture getting into 2018. Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And your next question that comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Hi. Thanks. Good morning. When you talked about the $40 million to $50 million of Lithium EBIT growth for 2018 can you maybe at least generally talk about how that might divide into buckets in terms of price, volume, and margin? You talked about the volume on hydroxide, but maybe a little bit on how it might split across the different buckets. Thanks. Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.: Hey, Joel. This is Tom. Thanks for the question. I would expect it to be a little bit more than half price and a little bit less than half on volume. We're still early in the price discussion, so we may be able to get a little bit more than that. But it's hard to relay that to you right now. Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Okay. Thank you for that. Also back on crop protection, you talked about channel inventories of the acquired business to be somewhat stable, somewhat just at normalized levels. Can you maybe give a little more color on what \u2013 in what regions do you think that the acquired business' channel inventories are tight or normalized, and maybe which ones are a little bit higher than normal? Thanks. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yes. What we've seen, what we've studied, I mean, clearly, there is two place where there was a very high level of focus, where they have normalized their inventory level, that would be Brazil, Latin America and North America. What is not \u2013 China too. What is normalized? It depends upon the market, but anything around 25% is a number where you would consider you have normalized channel. And so, those are the three places, China, Brazil, to some extent Latin America and North America, where the biggest work has been done. Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to go back to the Argentina expansion. I think, Pierre, you mentioned that you're within a few weeks of making a final decision there. Does this also mean that you're within a few weeks of getting the government approval for the project as well? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yes. When we say a few weeks, it's about everything which is required to build expansion, to get approval to separate the business within a few months. So, yes, it includes all approval, internal, external. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Great. Thank you. And then a follow-up on lithium pricing question. Does your 2018 lithium forecast at this point carry the risk of pricing being higher or lower? In other words, do you still have a lot of volume, a lot of negotiations to conclude for the next year in terms of price? Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.: Yeah. This is Tom. I'd say that it's a muted risk. We've got defined pricing and most of the volumes already under contract, so there's still some discussion as to the actual 2018 price within a defined range. But I don't think we carry a lot of risk there. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys. Nice quarter. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: You had a bunch of \u2013 not a bunch, but you had a number of molecules you were developing on the legacy Ag business. How are those unfolding and will you have any impacts in 2018? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah, Mike. The portfolio itself, the pipeline is absolutely on track to where we've communicated in past quarters. One of the first molecules that comes to market is bixafen. That will hit in the second half of 2018 in North America. So it will have some impact but it will be somewhat muted. Then, we have the rest of the range coming through really in the 2019, 2020, 2021 timeframe. But everything is on track exactly as we said before, so we feel really good about that part of the pipeline. Obviously, as you know, the DuPont pipeline is much more early stage and it comes in anywhere from mid-decade to end of next decade, but we're well suited across the whole portfolio right now. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Right. Okay. And then in terms of the DuPont business, as you think about next year, I think you noted on the legacy business would be up mid single digits. But what about DuPont's asset for next year, what type of growth do you expect to see from them on the year-over-year basis? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I think we need to dive into the numbers and specific customers and crops to really finalize that. The initial look we had, I'd say it was a look we had especially driven by this call here because we knew we'd have to give you a sense. The business is going to grow in 2017 6%, knowing that the 6% was driven by specific countries, region and crop plus was done with a significant work to decrease channel inventory. Between the drivers and the decrease of inventory, we see absolutely no reason not to have at least the same growth rate going into 2018. Actually, with the analysis we've done, we are looking to demonstrate that very early in the year with a solid growth in Q1. So 2018, at least, the same number, starting pretty strong in Q1. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question, that comes from the line of Daniel Jester from Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So, just on Europe, year-to-date the volume has been probably the weakest region for you guys. I know that there were some weather issues there, but is there anything else happening in Europe and can you kind of frame how 2018 could evolve there? Thanks. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah. No, nothing really else apart from the weather impacts that we saw earlier on the year. And then obviously, as we're going through the rest of the year, we alluded to it in the script here from Pierre that France is the last country that we're changing the distribution channel from the Cheminova acquisition. So where we would normally be selling in Q3 and Q4 into that distribution channel, we're not selling right now because we'll be doing that directly ourselves as we go into the season in the first part of next year. So that has a somewhat meaningful impact. But apart from the weather impacts which have been pretty severe depending on the north and the south, there's been no other fundamental issues in the business. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just another really quick one. If I remember last year in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, you guys had a very strong pull forward of pre-emergent herbicide sales into the U.S. As you see the fourth quarter evolve this year, are you seeing the same type of trend or could that be a headwind if it doesn't work? Thanks. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: No. We're seeing exactly the same trend. Pre-emergents are doing well and there's a lot of changes in the herbicide market in North America but our pre-emergent Authority brands are a market leader and continue to do very well and orders are strong. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: One comment about that question which I want to make sure is clearly understood. We had a very strong third quarter, but we see same trend in the fourth quarter, which mean it was not moving forward orders or just things are falling in space and the fourth quarter is as strong as we're expecting it before with significant growth driven mostly by Latin America but also a healthy situation in North America despite the strong third quarter. So there was no pull by our customers or early buys. So it's important to see sales are fully in place in the right quarter. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brett Wong from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow up on an earlier one. You talked about or provided some color on your Ag R&D focus going forward, really talking about product categories. So I was just wondering if you can provide a little color on the crops that you're going to focus on. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah. Brett, we've said in the past that obviously we have more of a niche focus, a niche crop focus. When you look at our mix, we're somewhat more heavy in some of the niche crops such as cotton and sugarcane, less so in corn, and then all the various tree fruits and vegetables. I think with the acquired portfolio, obviously, that expands Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr big on niche crops. Going forward, I think on the fungicides, if we can go into that space, we will focus on niche crops. But also Asia soybean rust down in Latin America is a major, major issue. If we can develop products into that space, we will be happy to do so, and that would give us more of exposure in soy in Brazil. But outside of that, it's going to very much depend on the types of products that come out with regards to the crop focus. Operator : Thank you. Your next question now will come from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC : Hey, guys. It's Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. How are you? You mentioned that focuses for growth going forward would be nematicides and fungicides. Is there a particular end crop that would be a focus as well to kind of go with those or that shows the most promise in terms of how they apply with those products in mind or those product categories in mind? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah. Just to clarify, what I said was, from an R&D perspective, from discovery, we would obviously like to expand our fungicide and nematicide, that's much more longer term given that it takes 10 to 12 years to bring a product to market. Our near-term focus will be continuous across the niche crops and then bringing products that are differentiated to any of the row crops whether it's soy or corn. Obviously, with the acquisition, we have a much broader portfolio for cereals now, so we're going to be looking at potential growth opportunities there with the strong portfolio that we have. Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then with regards to Brazil, you've kind of laid out how things are going there. But is there any concerns about maybe farmers trading down to cheaper products this year as just as a counter to what with the environment that's occurring there? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: No. I don't think any more than normal having \u2013 Brazil is a very competitive marketplace. We're used to operating there. You will remember we jettisoned a lot of our generic third party products a couple of years \u2013 over the last couple of years. So we've really been focused on more of our proprietary portfolio. Doing very well in sugar cane, insecticides, specialty insecticides for the soy area are doing well. Obviously, cotton is strong. So we're not big there but it's no worse than it normally is in my opinion. Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And your last question comes from the line of Chris Kapsch from Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Good morning. I had a follow-up in for each segment. Just in ag following up on the discussion around synergies with the DuPont acquisition. I appreciate the opportunity there is really focused on \u2013 or the big piece of the opportunity there is more about cost avoidance, in other words, costs you don't have to layer in as you absorb that business. But I'm curious about how that is juxtaposed against the TSAs that are in place. So what are the magnitude of TSAs? As you identify cost avoidance opportunities are those mutually exclusive or do you have to \u2013 or as you figure out what costs you don't need to avoid, do you then have to fade some of the costs associated with current TSAs in place. I'm just trying to understand when you'll be able to recalibrate on what the real costs are necessary to run those businesses. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yes. So we have a TSA with DuPont which had a cost, we were expecting in the $50 million range for very well-defined services. And over the next 18 months, this TSA is going to be phasing out, which mean we don't keep the TSA all the way to the end. Once this TSA was defined, our functional team finance, IT and others define the bare minimum structure they would need to operate that business. And that's what we are putting in place and we are making good progress, to almost get to this. At this point, we're going to pose. These points will be well below the model but we are not sure that this place where we'll pose will be strong enough for us to be able to operate the business for the two-year period while we have a TSA in front of us. So that is the process we are following our targets. I would say by early into next year we should have a pretty strong idea of bare minimum plus what do we need to run the business which will create the operating model going into 2018. Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just following up on the Lithium business here, looking at the fourth quarter guidance for I think 17% sequential earnings growth. Just curious about, one, that pricing assumption that's baked into that sequential earnings progression. And then also you mentioned that in the month of September, your new hydroxide plant was running at 9,000 metric tons. Is that to imply that the product you're producing is fully qualified or are you in the process of still ramping up the qualifications? And if that's the case, can you just talk about how you see that qualification progressing sequentially in the quarter and into 2018? Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.: Yeah. Hi. This is Tom. So starting with the question. The customer qualifications went extraordinarily well. Traditionally in these markets, it's 9 to 12 months. I've seen even multiple year of qualification processes. We are qualified across our customer base. There's a few still in the process but it relies on customer processes. So there's no concern. We're qualified for the sales that we have forecasted. And in terms of the pricing, it's relatively minor impact Q3 to Q4 the way that the mixes go, it's relatively minor on price, mostly volume Q3 to Q4. Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC : And then could you just extrapolate on that last comment into 2018 at this juncture? Based on the contract that you took. Thank you. Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.: So earlier I had indicated we expect more than half of the benefit going into 2018 to be price and we just started those conversations. So it could be a little bit better. Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I'd like to turn the call over to Michael Wherley for closing remarks. Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.: That's all the time we have for the call today. As always, I'm available following the call to address any additional questions. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the FMC Corporation Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Release conference call. Thank you.",

Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Pierre. Pierre Brondeau : Thank you, Michael and good morning everyone. Before outlining our fourth quarter results, I wanted to first state that 2017 was a pivotal year for FMC and we are excited about the opportunities ahead of us 2018. The integration of the acquired DuPont Ag business is progressing very well as is the process of separating the Lithium business into a public company. As we prepare for listing in the second half of this year, we will continue to expand both our lithium hydroxide and our lithium carbonate capacity to capitalize on the significant demand expected in the coming decade. Turning to slide three, FMC reported fourth quarter revenue of $918 million, which was 42% year-over-year -- up 42% year-over-year. Adjusted EPS was $1.10 in the quarter, an increase of 67% versus the same period a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $0.02 above the top end of our guidance, driven by strong operating result in each of our two segments. We are very pleased with the fourth quarter results. In Ag Solutions, our business performed very well and earnings came in above the high end of our guidance range. The integration of the acquisition into FMC is meeting all our expectations. In Lithium, we delivered our first full quarter of commercial production at our new lithium hydroxide facilities in China and finalized an important agreement with the Argentinian government, paving the way for expansion in that country and for the separation of the Lithium business into a standalone company. Moving on to slide four in Ag Solutions, revenue grew 40% year-over-year. Performance of FMC's legacy Agricultural Solution business was very strong, growing 9% year-over-year, driven by double-digit revenue growth in North America, Asia, and Europe. Acquisition revenue of $193 million accounted for the remainder of the growth. We do not have comparable results for the acquired business for the last two months of 2016. However, it performed well and as expected. Fourth quarter segment earnings of $189 million increased 48% year-over-year. Segment revenue for 2017 was approximately $2.5 billion, an 11% increase compared to the prior year. Full year segment earnings were $486 million, a 21% increase year-over-year and segment earnings margin improved 160 basis points to 19.2%. Our legacy Ag business posted 3% revenue growth and strong earnings growth in the year. On slide five, we outline the regional performance in the quarter. In North America, we posted a 38% revenue increase. Our legacy FMC business grew 14%. The performance was driven by early demand for pre-emergence herbicides as farmers plan for expanded soybean acreage this year and strong demand for our SU herbicides for cereals. In Latin America, revenue increased 21% in the quarter. Our legacy FMC business grew 3% in Q4 and 9% for the entire year. In Brazil, FMC's legacy business grew 15% on a full year basis, a very strong performance in a market that contracted approximately 10%. In Asia, revenue increased 84% in Q4. Our legacy FMC business grew 14%, driven by successful product launches and strong growth in our Plant Health product portfolio. We also saw strong sales of Rynaxypyr insect control, especially into rice markets in India and Indonesia. And finally, in Europe, revenue increased 59% in Q4. Our legacy FMC business grew 13% with strong sales in Eastern Europe and in France, where you may recall we have moved to direct market access. Moving now to Lithium on slide six, Lithium delivered another exceptional quarter. Revenue of $113 million increased 60% year-over-year and segment earnings more than doubled to $44 million. Significantly higher prices and the shift in mix to higher value product drove the increase in segment earnings margin to 39% versus 30% in the prior year period. We took an important step in December when we finalized new operating agreements in Argentina. The provincial government of Catamarca formalized these agreements by passing legislation that sets our royalty rate and our commitment to corporate social responsibility programs while also paving the way for us to expand capacity and move toward the intended separation of our Lithium business later this year. We want to highlight the revised royalties and CSR programs are at the level generally consistent with our prior commitment. Combined, this amounts to a mid-single-digit percentage of sale out of our Argentina operations. Turning to slide seven, which summarizes our outlook for the first quarter and the full year. We expect adjusted earnings per share for full year 2018 to be between $5.20 and $5.60 per share, which represents at the midpoint of the range a near doubling of EPS year-over-year. First quarter 2018 adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.45 and $1.59. We expect 2018 Ag Solutions revenue will be in the range of $3.95 billion and $4.15 billion and segment EBITDA will be in the range of $1.05 billion and $1.15 billion. We anticipate legacy Ag Solutions revenue will grow 2% to 4%, while the acquired business is expected to grow by 6% to 10%. First quarter segment revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.0 billion to $1.07 billion and EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $290 million to $320 million. The Lithium business is well-positioned to deliver another year of significant earnings growth in 2018. We expect full year revenue for Lithium to be in the range of $420 million to $460 million, a year-over-year increase of 27% at the midpoint. Full year EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $180 million to $200 million, which represents an increase of 34% at the midpoint. We expect price mix and incremental volumes to each contribute approximately half of the increase in earnings. The volume increase is largely due to the 4,000 tons of incremental capacity coming online from debottlenecking projects. We expect first quarter segment revenue to be in the range of $95 million to $110 million and EBITDA is forecasted to be between $44 million and $48 million, which represents a year-over-year increase of 78% at the midpoint. Moving on to slide eight and the key drivers for the Ag Solutions business in 2018. Starting with the overall Ag Chem market where our expectations for 2018 remain unchanged from what we saw in November. We continue to expect the global crop protection chemical market on a U.S. dollar basis to be flat to up low single-digits in 2018. We expect the market in Asia-Pacific will grow the fastest, increasing by low to mid-single-digit percent range, driven by India and Southeast Asia. We expect the market in Latin America will increase in the low single-digits. Brazil will be a bit ahead of that base, benefiting from increased acreage for nearly all crops. The market in Argentina should see continued expansion in certain applications. And in Mexico, we expect growth in these crops. In North America, we expect the market will be flat to up low single-digits as farm incomes remain below trend. Growth will come from post-emergence herbicides and a modest increase in serving acreage in general. We expect the market in EMEA will be flat to up low single-digits. Improved weather and growth in Eastern Europe could provide upside to this forecast. Turning now to a forecast for how FMC will perform in 2018 considering the market conditions just outlined. We expect revenue for legacy Ag Solutions business will grow 2% to 4%, driven by several factors. In Brazil, we expect to see a continuation of positive trends in cotton and sugarcane markets where we are well-positioned as well as increased demand in the soybean market. In Asia, we anticipate higher demand for our products going to rice, fruit, and vegetable, as well as cotton. In Europe, the move to direct market access in France, new products for oilseed rate and price increases will all drive growth in -- for FMC in 2018. Moving on to our acquired business, which we expect will grow 6% to 10% in 2018 on a full year basis, well ahead of the market. This will be driven primarily by increased insecticide revenue. We believe Cyazypyr insect control is far from its peak in annual sales. In 2018, volumes are expected to grow for cotton and soybean applications in Brazil. New product registrations in EMEA will also drive growth. Rynaxypyr insect control will continue to expand into new crops and geographies, such as rice and sugarcane in India and further penetrate into Southeast Asia. Finally, we also expect to increase sales of our acquired SU herbicide with new formulations in North America for cereal applications. As I said earlier, the integration process is progressing very well after almost four months of ownership. Our 2018 guidance reflects what we believe will be the maximum operating cost as a percentage of revenue for our combined Ag Solutions businesses. Our assumptions for gross margin, R&D expenses and SG&A expenses are not meaningfully different than what we have shared with you on calls last year. But as the DuPont transition service agreement roll off and as we implement a new SAP system in 2019, we will see further cost savings and improvements in EBITDA margins. Turning to slide nine and starting with our views on the Lithium market. In summary, we expect global demand for lithium on an LCE basis to grow from about 200,000 metric ton in 2017 to 335,000 metric tons by 2020 and to 1 million metric tons by 2025. This is an average annual growth rate of over 20%. On the supply side, despite recent news out of Chile, we believe that supply for high-cost spodumene producers will continue to be needed to meet the end market demand in every year through at least 2025. We expect this will create a price floor for lithium carbonate of low double-digit dollars per kilogram for at least the next seven years. FMC is very well-positioned to take advantage of these market conditions. Our business is focused on lithium hydroxide and we have demonstrated that our approach to expanding our lithium hydroxide capacity is more than capable of meeting the growth in demand with relatively low capital needs. Our locals carbonate production resource in Argentina are capable of expansion to at least three times our current capacity and we have secured the necessary agreements with the local and national governments to allow us to pursue an expansion of this scale. In 2018, prices will be higher than in 2017 across all our product categories. The majority of our 2018 forecast revenue falls under multiyear contracts that have defined pricing already in place. We expect this trend of customers looking for longer term supply commitments to continue, especially in hydroxide, reflecting customers' general view that supply will remain tight into the foreseeable future. In 2018, FMC will produce more lithium hydroxide as well as more base LCEs that in 2017. FMC was the only producer to have significant hydroxide capacity in 2017 when we expanded our production capacity from 10,000 tons to 19,000 tons. We will realize significant growth in 2018 as we run our channel plan for the full year. Our next phase of hydroxide expansion should see us commissioning at least one additional 4,000-ton unit by the end of this year. In Argentina, we expect to produce about 21,000 LCEs in 2018, up from 18,500 tons last year as we realize higher volumes due to the debottlenecking project at our plant. The completion of this project will lead to an incremental increase in 0LCEs produced as the year progresses. The subsequent expansion project in Argentina will add around 10,000 tons of lithium carbonate capacity by the end of 2020 and a further 10,000 ton increase by 2022. These first two increments are expected to require total capital spending of around $250 million to $300 million as we have previously stated. We are currently exploring adding a third carbonate expansion phase, providing a further 20,000 tons of capacity by 2025 at the latest. Moving on to market demand, we believe that today, too much of investor focus is on supply and not enough on demand. In particular, we believe the investment community as a whole has yet to absorb the impact that the growth in demand for electric vehicles in the coming years will have on the lithium industry. Simply adding mining or extraction capacity will not be enough without the corresponding increase in manufacturing capacity for battery-grade lithium products that are in a form that the customers can use. Equally, producing technical-grade carbonate that needs to be further processed to remove impurities will simply add to the cost of that product. And as we move to nickel-rich cathodes in the high performance batteries, hydroxide will become a requirement in the production process, not just a preferred option. A view of the demand outlook is summarized on slide 10. Clearly, the source of growth for lithium demand is the rapid penetration of pure EVs into the global auto market. We model the growth of EVs at the individual vehicle level based on public announcements as well as own directing directions we look to manufacturers and their suppliers. The chart on the left shows the growth of pure electric vehicles and a few things stand out. First, we expect pure EV penetration to reach 2.5% by 2020 and 12% by 2025. The source of this growth is multiple launches by over 30 manufacturers. This is not dependent on any one manufacturer. And it shows the influence of China as this country maintains its position as the largest single market for electric vehicles. Of course, this growth in EVs needs to be converted into demand forecast for lithium. The right hand side of the chart shows how important the EVs will be to the market as a whole by 2025. And equally important, you can see that the nature of the growth in demand is such that there will be heavy shift towards lithium hydroxide. We reached these conclusions through a vehicle-by-vehicle assessment of the battery technology and size, which we expect to be used in each announced vehicle, as well as through discussions with the customers and end users. In fact, many of our customers and the ultimate end users of lithium are coming to FMC today looking for multi-years contract that commence in 2019 or 2020, demonstrating their confidence in the demand growth shown here. Ultimately, it is the detail in relation [ph] of future demand that gives us the confidence to pursue a strategy in lithium. Now, let me move on to the supply side of the equation. There is another reality that we believe the market as a whole is not correctly as it seems. We have seen repeated example of new entrants making large claims about intended capacity additions that are ultimately proven to be far too ambitious. Even a simple review will show that almost without sale, the capital cost increase significantly and the start-up dates are pushed further and further back. Once projects have been brought online, we have seen production rate that fall far short of nameplate capacity, product quality that is inconsistent and operating costs per unit of production that are far higher than what was originally projected. What is possible today to construct the cost curve using announced project that suggests a risk of oversupply in the future, all available evidence suggest that this is highly unlikely to occur. The supply curves are well known to you all, and the current status shown on the left side of slide 11 is reasonably well understood and accepted. It is clear that incremental terms of supply is coming from high cost spodumene, which is being shipped to convertors in China. We have marked a range for the market price based on data published by others. The prices publicized by our competitors have been realized price, plus those quoted by different market observers such as benchmark minerals indicate a price range of between $11 and $14 for carbonate in most markets today. On the right side of slide 11 is the cost curve we expect in 2020, taking into account all of the expansions that have been made public. I would point out a few key items on here. First, you can see that at today's price range for carbonate, the higher royalties payable in Chile means that there is no meaningful cost difference between carbonate produced in Argentina and in Chile. Second, the marginal producer of carbonate remains the high cost spodumene source and will likely remain so even if demand fell by around 10% from our forecast. There is simply not enough brine capacity of being added by 2020 to change this. When you overlay the price range from today out to 2020, you ended with a chart that looks remarkably similar to the situation we saw in 2017. We acknowledge that there are many differing opinions about supply and demand growth over the coming decade and that this [Indiscernible] could see positive and negative surprises. However, we remain of the view that the risk to the demand side are that we are underestimating the level of EV demand and that the risk of the supply side is that we are being overoptimistic about industry's ability to add capacity on time and on budget. I will now turn the call over to Paul. Paul Graves : Thank you, Pierre. 2017 saw a solid cash flow performance, driven by a significant improvement in cash collection in Brazil. One important metric that we track is, of course, past due receivables in Brazil, which have declined by almost 30% compared to the end of 2016. While we do not expect past dues to completely disappear, we believe that 2018 should see us move back to levels consistent with historical performance. For the full year, we saw adjusted cash from operations slightly below 2016. However, this was entirely due to a cash outflow in the final two months from the acquired business as we started to build trade receivables. As you recall, we did not acquire any of the receivables with the business, creating this one-off cash flow in the quarter. Net debt finished the year at just under $3 billion, reflecting the $1.2 billion payment to DuPont made in the fourth quarter. One important area that is getting a lot of attention today is the tax rate. We finished 2017 exactly where we expected with an effective tax rate of approximately 15%. This rate reflects the fact that the majority of our income is generated in lower tax jurisdictions, reflecting the nature of our supply chain and our revenue mix. Looking forward to 2018 and beyond; recently enacted tax reform in the U.S. impacts us in three main ways. First of all, we will have a transition tax payable over the next eight years of approximately $200 million, reflecting tax on overseas retained income. This will impact cash flows in the coming years but will not impact our effective tax rate. Second, we see a one-off charge to GAAP earnings, reflecting the revaluation of certain assets, most notably deferred tax assets of around $160 million. Again, this will not impact our future effective tax rate. And third, we will see a rise in our effective tax rate for 2018 as a result of the imposition of what is effectively a minimum tax on overseas income, combined with the restriction on the use of foreign tax credit to offset this additional tax. What this means to FMC is that wherever we see a tax rate outside the U.S. of less than around 13%, we will be hit with an additional U.S. tax bill under the guilty provisions of the tax reform. For us, the offsetting reduction in the U.S. tax rate will not be sufficient to offset this minimum overseas tax surcharge since we do not generate significant U.S. income today. While this change is a little as the result of the acquisition of assets from DuPont, the net effect is that our effective tax rate for 2018 is likely to increase by about 300 basis points at the midpoint of the range to 18%. I would caution you we continue to work our way through what a very complex calculations and legislation that in many areas is somewhat ambiguously worded. We will continue to refine our calculations and seek clarity as to the treatment of certain items and you should expect us to update you on our estimate as for the tax rate in each of the coming quarters. Looking into 2018 for cash flow, we expect to generate adjusted cash from operations in the range of $550 million to $650 million. Capital spending will increase to around $250 million at the midpoint. Lithium will invest around $105 million, led by the expansion of lithium carbonate capacity in Argentina and the continued addition of lithium hydroxide capacity. The benefits of these investments will start to accrue later in 2018 for the carbonate debottlenecking, in 2019 for the hydroxide expansions, and in 2020 for the carbonate expansion. Ag Solutions capital spending is expected to be approximately $95 million and corporate-level CapEx will be approximately $50 million, which is mainly the initial spending on the two-year implementation of a new SAP system. Finally, the Lithium separation remains on track. We expect to be in a position to file initial drafts of the required documents with the SEC in the summer of this year, which gives us confidence that we will list Lithium in the late third or early fourth quarter of 2018, with the full separation from FMC taking place late in the first quarter of 2019. And with that, I will hand the call back to Pierre. Pierre Brondeau : Thank you, Paul. In summary, we feel very good about where FMC is today. Our Ag Solutions business delivered a strong Q4, and we are set to deliver an exceptional 2018, with revenue growth significantly above the market growth rate. The integration of the acquired business is progressing very well. We are in the early stages of understanding the growth synergies, and we will communicate further regarding scale of these synergies on future calls. Lithium had a very strong quarter to finish the year and is on track to deliver another exceptional year in 2018. With that, I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Thank you for your attention. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Stephen Byrne : Yes, thank you. How proprietary and/or differentiated would you assess your hydroxide conversion capacity to be relative to the capacity that's out there in the industry? And do you have any Chinese partners for your operations in China? Thomas Schneberger : Hi Steve, this is Tom. I didn't quite hear the second part of your question, so let me answer the first one first and then maybe you can restate that. In terms of differentiation of our hydroxide product, really, what it comes down to is how that product performs. There's not a spec out there that is specified where somebody could produce a product, measure against that spec, and then know exactly how that's going to perform in the cathode material. So, our assets as well as our production processes are geared around detailed processes to produce specific products that then we test and we understand the performance characteristics of that product. And that's how it's going to continue going forward. Can you restate the second part of that question? Stephen Byrne : Yes, sure, Tom. It's kind of an extension on that and that is, do you have Chinese partners for your capacity in China and therefore, the risk to ultimately losing that technological edge? Thomas Schneberger : Yes. Partners is a good way to say it. And what we did was we began a partnership with a long-standing partnership of our Ag business. We invest in the assets, we manage the technology, and we keep tight control over the sensitivity of that technology. Pierre Brondeau : One comment I would add to what Tom is saying is the -- we have a very thorough process to protect our process technology. I believe there might not be more than two people within all of FMC and our partners who have a full understanding of this process. So, we have a way to protect the process technology by segregating part of the process, and nobody has a complete visibility onto the process and how the parameters of the process impact the performance of the products. Stephen Byrne : [technical difficulty] forecast, is that consistent with what your expectations were prior to acquiring this business? And do you see any longer term acceleration in that by either expanding those -- the Rynaxypyr, Cyazypyr into new markets and/or recruiting new formulations? Pierre Brondeau : I think for some reason, we have a little bit of a connection problem. We couldn't hear the beginning of the question. But in a few words, what we believe is that Rynaxypyr, Cyazypyr and overall the acquired market is performing at least at the level of our expectations from where we do have markets and applications today. There is definitely a process and you can see it through our comments, for example, what we said about Asia, India, Southeast Asia where we do have increased penetration of new crops, new registration, new formulations for product, which are allowing to grow faster. Needless to say that in the coming years, FMC will also be looking at developing new products from those base chemistry. The last point we have not touched here and we are gathering a lot of data is around growth synergies. We do believe there is significant growth synergies to be seen in the years to come between the FMC and the acquired portfolio, allowing additional growth to what we have talked about. So, I would say, all in all, everything we are seeing and we're operating is it's very positive for us. And I don't believe we are capturing all of the potential today of -- in the numbers we are presenting. Operator : Thank you. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and then reenter the queue; we\u2019ll take follow-up questions as permitted. Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : Yes, good morning and congrats on a nice end to the year. Pierre, you were talking about Brazil for full year 2017 of being able to generate 15% growth, whereas the market was down 10%. I was curious as to what percent of that preferential performance was due to some prior actions you took on your channel inventories versus market growth and how we should think about your ability to continue to outperform in that part of the world. Pierre Brondeau : I think I would say when you look at a plus 15% in the market shrinking 10%, there is two reasons to the performance. One is the fact that we are one of the very few companies, compared to others, which are operating with almost, I would call, a normal level of inventory in the channel. So, we are not in a growth penalized by products which were in the channel, lowering our ability to sell into the channel, allowing us to have growth rate which are closer to product on the ground utilization. Now, the number is, of course, increased by the fact that as we've been taking measures over last two years and moving away from some low profitability-generated products, you are comparing to -- for us, to sales which were understated because of the actions we are taking. So, those are the two reasons for which we are outperforming so much. Do we expect to outperform the market next year? Yes, we do. Do we expect to outperform the market by the same extent? Certainly not because we had -- we're going to have a tougher comparison when comparing to 2017 performance. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Christopher Parkinson : Thank you. Apologies for being a little shortsighted, but your 1Q EPS guidance is particularly strong, which appears to be driven mainly by the Ag segment. Can you just kindly comment on your expectation for your legacy Ag asset growth as well as the seasonal cadence for the DuPont assets and whether or not you'd expect any considerable FX tailwind? And also are there any key trends within product mix which should further benefit margins? Thank you. Pierre Brondeau : All right. Thank you. Those are some questions. Let me talk about the cadence. I'll ask Mark to comment about legacy products growth. We announced our legacy business will grow in the 2% to 4%, which is above market we're expecting. So, Mark will comment about that, and maybe Paul will say a couple of words around FX. The cadence, as you can see, we do have a first quarter which is stronger as a percentage of the overall business than we used to have. And it's something which is important, very good for us with the acquired business. If you think about FMC legacy business, we would have slightly above 60%, 6-0, 60% of the business in the back end of the year, mostly driven by the size of our business in Brazil and Latin America. So, it's 60% in the back end, 40% in the front end. If you look at the acquired business, it is reversed. It's slightly above 60% in the first half and 40% in the second half of the year. And this is driven by the size of the business for the acquired business in Europe and North America with a very strong underlying business in Asia and smaller business in Latin America and Brazil. So, what it does to us, it rebalances across all of the quarters, and as we wanted, decrease our exposure to Brazil and Latin America. Mark, do you want to talk about the growth of the legacy business? Mark Douglas : Yes. Of course, as Pierre mentioned, we're expecting a range of about 2% to 4% growth for the full year. That's going to be pretty evenly spread across the four quarters. We're already seeing Q1 well into the business in North America where the retail is getting ready for the season in the Midwest. I would say the market in California or in the West has kicked off a little earlier than normal, so that's going to help in Q1. Around the rest of the world, in Europe, we're seeing growth, as we said, from our business, particularly in France. This is our first year of direct market access. So, we're out in the market now selling and that's going very well. So, I think that 2% to 4% range is roughly what you should expect per quarter as we go through the year. Paul Graves : Yes, the FX question, I think pretty straightforward. The euro is the only exchange rate that really had a meaningful difference on a budget basis, think about how we hedge forward compared to what we saw in 2017. A few small changes in other currencies. The net impact of this is actually relatively small across the entire business. We do have a small tailwind, very low single-digits percent increase in revenue and a very small tailwind to operating profit as well as a result of the forecast FX rates, but really not meaningful numbers. Operator : Thank you. And the last -- next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura. Please go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov : Good morning. Thank you. In your Lithium business, you earned about $48 million EBITDA in the fourth quarter and you're guiding to $44 million to $48 million in Q1 2018 and sort of similar level for the rest of 2018, if I just average your annual guidance. Can you help us build the bridge between your fourth quarter result and average cadence in 2018? And I mean, the bridge if you look at sequential price changes and also volume. Pierre Brondeau : I think the operation for Lithium in the first quarter are about the same. I mean, there is no fundamental change in the business in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. It is the sequential comparison between Q4 and Q1. If you look back at historical performance, it's the same. The fourth quarter is historically a quarter which is a strong quarter. Sales are high and the products out of Argentina, because of the seasonality of our production, are very high. So, it is just a normal sequential. And you will most likely see when you look at -- on a quarterly basis for this year, you'll most likely see a stronger fourth quarter than you will see first quarter. You will see earnings ramping up and being at the highest level in the fourth quarter. First quarter -- there is a good thing about the first quarter. If you look at the sales to earnings, it's a high profit quarter because the mix is favorable. So, there is nothing fundamentally different. It's mostly driven by Q4 performance by production -- seasonal production in Argentina and first quarter margin by product mix. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joel Jackson : Hi, good morning. Maybe, Paul, on Lithium. It seems like there'll be short carbonate in 2019. Is that true? And then how will that work out? Will you maybe run hydroxide a little bit lower? Will you go into the market and purchase carbonate? What will margins look like? It seems like the Nemaska project being on finance will probably not be able to offer your carbonate for at least a couple of years, so maybe you could just elaborate on that. Thomas Schneberger : Yes, hi Joel, this is Tom. Yes, I mean, it's a little bit early to be forecasting 2019, but I'll give you an indication of where things are. The debottlenecking will come in over the course of 2018 and there's potential upside there. This is a number of different projects that have different characteristics on yield and some incremental capability of equipment that we may see additional there. We do expect Nemaska volume to begin in 2019 and we still need to see, to your point, how much of that volume will be there, but there are commitments and penalties to that end. And we continue, I would say, a multipronged effort on the acquisition of carbonate elsewhere. So, as you know, in 2018, we'll continue to be long carbonate and we have the ability to shift LCEs toward hydroxide to continue to grow. We have potential for more debottlenecking and we have the potential of more LCEs from the outside as well. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow. Please go ahead. Dmitry Silversteyn : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just looking at the timeline of the Lithium spinoff, I think you talked about as recently as the third quarter conference call of doing this midyear 2018, but now it looks like the initials move is going to be made in the second half of the year and then the full spinoff in the first quarter of 2019. Am I just misremembering or making too much of the changes in timing? Or is there something going on that you pushed back the timing? Paul Graves : Hi Dmitry, it's Paul. No, we've always had really Q3 lined up. It's largely driven, frankly, by requirements for listing a public company, SEC filing, the need for audited financials, the need for quarterly financials. It's -- we are really exactly where we always said we wanted to be, internally at least, when we first announced this almost -- some -- almost a year ago. So, no. If we've made statements that implied the summer for an actual listing, then that's probably incorrect because in the past, there's always been an expectation of a Q3 listing. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Michael Sison : Hey guys, nice quarter. Pierre Brondeau : Thank you. Michael Sison : You seem pretty positive or bullish on lithium demand through 2020 and 2025. If you think about what the Lithium business could earn in EBITDA by 2020 and 2025, any thoughts on the earnings power there? And how much capital cost to sort of get to that potential? Paul Graves : If it was early for Tom to forecast 2019, then forecasting 2025 is asking a lot, Mike. I think a couple of comments I'd just make. I think the capital commitment we've laid out there for the expansion in here is pretty straightforward. We took about $250 million to $300 million for a 20,000 ton expansion. As we expand further in Argentina, we would expect a similar kind of cost, maybe a little less for the next phase, although we're still working on that, so I wouldn't want to stick a pin in it yet. On the hydroxide side, again, it really sort of depends on where we put the units. So, there is a meaningful difference between the capital cost in different parts of the world, but you also get a -- in return for that, typically an inverse correlation between operating costs. So, we will go through that and work out where is the best place to put these units based on demand, based upon supply of carbonate, et cetera, but it's a much, much lower capital commitment that comes through there. Now, this business today operates at an EBITDA margin of about 45% or so. And I think we've been pretty clear that we -- where we view pricing to be into the future and I think we have a pretty clear view to how many LCEs we'll be producing. I think you guys can probably knock out pretty easily a headline view of what you think the earnings power of the business might be under those scenarios. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Donald Carson : Yes. I want to go back to the cost synergy outlook for Ag Solutions. In the past, you've talked about $40 million to $80 million, and I know your cost synergies are different because it's a question of what costs you bring in. So, as you've had a chance to run the new business and as the DuPont TSA rolls off, what's your current view on cost synergies for Ag? Pierre Brondeau : So, I mean, you said it, Don. There is no cost synergies per se. We always talk about that as a tool to try to model EPS for 2018 based on the negotiation we made when we acquired the business. So, where we are today is we have structured an organization which can run a $4 billion-plus business with a TSA supporting the acquired business. We spend about $50 million per year on that TSA and that TSA runs until end of 2019. Today, we have not been able -- we're not separating the functional organization and we just have an organization which supports the entire business. So, the way we look at it is what we have today is a structure which supports, as I said, a $4 billion-plus business with minimum -- what we believe as being minimum EBITDA margin for this year on an average of 27%. Then new projects [Indiscernible] toward the end of 2019, what will be happening then is we will have implemented and we started the process a month ago now, we will have implemented a brand-new SAP system, S/4HANA and we will be rolling out -- rolling off the TSA. Now, we have not yet done a calculation of what potential savings. But to think about three digits in million dollars by the time we're rolling off the TSA and having a new SAP is not a stretch. So, what we are thinking is we're operating today with a 27% EBITDA margin. Could we -- could it get better? Yes, it could. We are adding very carefully resources to operate our business. And then you project yourself two years down the road and you can eliminate $100 million of costs. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Daniel Jester with Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Jester : Good morning everyone. A couple more on Lithium. Sorry if I missed this, but did you comment on the hydroxide operating rate in the quarter? I think, previously, you had said that you were running above the nameplate capacity. So, I was wondering if you're able to sustain that. And then just secondly, you commented earlier about having conversations for 2019, 2020 sales in the Lithium business. Would it be fair to say that you would lock in some contracts before you would build your further hydroxide expansion? Thanks. Pierre Brondeau : Yes, we are demonstrating our ability. Initially, we believe the two units for lithium hydroxide in China should be able to produce 8,000 tons per year, and we are operating and have been able to operate throughout the quarter above the number. So, yes, expectation that will be at or north of 9,000 tons of lithium hydroxide potential with these two units is being confirmed. We are planning to add another unit in China of lithium hydroxide and then another two -- couple of units, most likely in North America for at least one of them. And we will have the exact same process, which we move the securing contract before the French [Indiscernible]. But with what we see of the demand today, discussion we have with customers, as it was the case for the first unit, we believe the unit will be sold out before we start operation. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Mike Harrison : Hi, good morning. Pierre Brondeau : Good morning. Mike Harrison : The -- in the Ag business, your Latin America sales you mentioned for the full year were up 15%, but they were lighter than that in the legacy business, looked like only 3% this quarter. Is that just a matter of lapping some tougher comps? Or can you maybe give a little bit more color on kind of how the underlying market looked in Latin America and how it's been trending? Mark Douglas : Yes, Mike. Taking Latin America overall, I think Pierre alluded to earlier that we think the Brazilian market is probably down 9% to 10% full year. When you look at our business in Brazil, we're up significantly. As you said, we were -- we had about a 3% growth in the fourth quarter. I think one of the things that you have to recognize is that's exactly how we planned it. If you remember, Q3 was a very large quarter for us. We knew that was the cadence that was going to happen, so we fully forecasted that type of growth rate. I think going around the rest of the region, Mexico is very good for us. Good growth in niche crops. Obviously, the newly acquired portfolio helps us there tremendously as well. In Argentina, market was very tough weather-wise. We see continued expansion of the pre-emergent herbicides with our Authority brand. So, Argentina was good for us in the second half of the year, expect that to continue as well. So, overall, Latin America performed very well for us. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Daniel Rizzo : Hi, this is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. How are you? Pierre Brondeau : Good morning. Daniel Rizzo : Could you comment on what you're seeing in terms of pest pressures and channel inventories in North America just given the weather we've had in North America over the past couple of months? Has anything changed in terms of outlook for that? Mark Douglas : Dan, no, not really. I mean, it obviously is very early to tell whether what the pest pressure is going to be like. I can tell you, though, from a herbicide perspective, our sales already for pre-emergent Authority for soy is very, very strong. So, clearly, retail and distribution are gearing up for a very strong soy season, which will benefit us. With channel inventories, I think different companies have different channel inventories. We've said it in the past for us; we think in-soil insecticides is a high for us. They will come down over the next season. But from a herbicide perspective, we're exactly where we want to be. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks. Just wanted to get a question in on Lithium here. Maybe you can just comment on your outlook for pricing given that effective capacity, on your slide, looks like it could be above demand through 2020. Thanks. Thomas Schneberger : Yes, this is Tom. First, let me comment on the effective capacity being above demand. If you look at 2017, effective capacity results were above demand. It doesn't mean that the right products are getting to the customers. We saw 2017 demand limited by supply, and we saw prices up substantially in 2017. So, the same could occur even though effective capacity is above demand. Looking at what we see 2017 to 2018, we've gotten price increases across all of our products. If you take the midpoint of the revenue and the LCEs, you can come pretty close to see that we got a revenue per LCE that is well above the market and that is driven by a mid-teens increase in our lithium hydroxide product line. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Mark Connelly with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly : When we look at your Ag business and all the markets you're expanding into, how much work do you have left to do in terms of capital, people or partners to really build out the distribution you need to take full advantage of that? I'm talking India and all the other new stuff. Pierre Brondeau : I think the integration is moving forward quite well. The supply chain between the two businesses are being integrated. And we do have capacity without manufacturers, which is well in place. If I would say we have work to do and Mark's organization is doing a lot of work, I believe once the synergies are going to be in place that we do have upside to any numbers we are now seeing. So, what -- where we do have work to do today is finding capacity increase in our own acquired business manufacturing network. That's where we want to add capacity as fast as we can because we have, as you can see, extreme synergies, we have a 6% to 10% growth, and we see that being the case for the future. So, that's where we are working at forecasting for the future. Mark, do you have any additional comments? Mark Douglas : Yes, the only thing I would add to that is from the legacy FMC pipeline that's coming out of research, we now have products that are getting close enough that we're thinking about brand-new capacity for those new active ingredients. So, that's part of that overall capacity view of our supply chain. So, we would expect to be making those investments outside the next 12-month period, but it's coming quickly. Pierre Brondeau : And it is more a, I would say, a normal course of business planning in a situation where we believe we're going to have very interesting growth rate for this business versus the market than an integration challenge. Operator : Thank you. And we have no further questions in queue. Mr. Wherley, please continue with closing remarks. Michael Wherley : Thank you. That's all the time we have for the call today. As always, I'm available following the call to address any additional questions you may have. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : Thank you. And that's all the time we have for today. This concludes the FMC Corporation fourth quarter 2017 earnings release conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the First Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call for FMC Corporation. Phone lines will be placed on a listen-only mode throughout the conference. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer period. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Wherley, Director, Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Mr. Wherley, you may begin. Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Pierre Brondeau, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Pierre will review FMC's first quarter performance and provide the outlook for 2018 and the second quarter. Paul will provide an overview of select financial results. The slide presentation that accompanies our results, along with our earnings release and our 2018 outlook statement, are available on our website; and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call. Mark Douglas, President, FMC Agricultural Solutions; and Tom Schneberger, Vice President and Global Business Director, FMC Lithium, will then join to address questions. Before we begin, let me remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors including, but not limited to those factors identified in our release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call, are provided on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter this year, Ag Solutions benefited from higher revenue synergies and lower operating costs. Both of these factors will continue to deliver stronger earnings in the rest of 2018. The rapid progress we have made on integration is creating a very strong platform for 2018 and beyond. And the early traction we're seeing on revenue synergies will enhance 2018 performance and accelerate in the years to come. We will talk about these areas in more detail today. In addition, while we do not believe the crop protection market outlook has changed from three months ago, we see significant pockets of opportunity that are a very good fit for FMC's portfolio. For example, the late planting season in the U.S. has the potential to lead to greater shift to soybean from corn, which could be a large benefit for FMC, given our Authority's pre-emergent herbicide. The fear of Chinese tariffs on U.S. soybean import is leading to South American growers looking to expand soybean acreage. So again, a shift that will benefit FMC. Higher replanting of sugarcane in Brazil plus expanded acreage in cotton due to higher cotton prices, will create greater demand for FMC product in these markets, where we are particularly strong. Asian rice growing conditions are very favorable and we are seeing very rapid growth in demand for the acquired insecticides as a result. Overall, market-driven opportunities in the next two or three quarters are perhaps the best FMC as seen in multiple years. The critical component of the growth strategy of the business is new product registration and label expansions. We have over 200 of them coming for Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect controls over the next four years. Beyond the immediate future, FMC has a very strong technology pipeline. We launched our first new active ingredient from FMC R&D pipeline, Bixafen, in North America later this year and we'll launch new fungicides and insecticides in multiple regions in 2020 and 2021. What you will hear today is that FMC has started the year very strong, due largely to a very successful initial integration of the acquired portfolio that FMC is operating in market conditions over the rest of the year that are very good fit with its strength, leading to above-average growth for the rest of the year. And FMC's growth potential beyond 2018 is extremely high, driven by revenue synergies, technology launches and wider and deeper market penetration of the combined portfolio. The Lithium business also continues to perform strongly, as demand for different performance products remains very high. We are on track to release the Lithium business targeting an October 2018 IPO, which will be followed by a direct spin to FMC shareholders within six months. Turning to slide 3. FMC reported first quarter revenue of just over $1.2 billion, which was double the revenue from Q1 2017. Adjusted EPS was $1.84 in the quarter, more than 4 times the EPS from the same period a year ago and $0.32 above the mid-point over original guidance range. Ag Solutions EBITDA was $51 million above the mid-point of our guidance range. The outperformance relative to our guidance was mainly due to strong revenue growth and lower operating costs in our Ag Solutions business. In Lithium, the strong year-over-year performance was due to more favorable customer mix and higher pricing combined with higher volumes and good operating performance. Moving on to slide 4, and Ag Solutions. Revenue of $1.1 billion in the quarter more than doubled year-over-year on the reported basis and increased 13% on a pro forma basis. Following the close of our acquisition, we gave high priority to training the two sales organizations on all products which has allowed us to quickly capitalize on cross-selling opportunities. Our global sales force delivered an impressive performance in its first full quarter with the combined portfolio. First quarter segment EBITDA of $356 million increased 250% year-over-year and were $51 million above the mid-point of our guidance. Segment EBITDA margin was over 32%, 270 basis points above the mid-point of our guidance. Higher revenue contributed about two-third of the earnings beat in the quarter and lower cost contributed the final third. We have been able to leverage FMC's existing sales and back-office infrastructure to limit the number of new position added. We also incurred lower operating cost as a result of savings across procurement and plant services. On slide 5, you see we delivered double-digit Q1 revenue growth on a pro forma basis in every region. North America revenue increased 16%, Latin-America revenue grew 15%, Asia revenue increased 13% and Europe revenue grew 11%. There were several broad themes that drove revenue synergies, which led to the strength in the quarter. Turning to slide 6. These are some examples that highlight synergy opportunities we are seeing all around the world. Extended market access is the simplest way to look at where the synergies are coming from, and this is driven by two things. Cross-selling to customers that didn't have access to the product before and leveraging the extended portfolio to address more of the available market. Brazil is a good example of this, which we show on the left side of the slide. You can see that 975 of the customers previously served by FMC were also served by DuPont. But nearly 700 customers, over 40% of the total, only had access to either FMC or DuPont products. Let me remind you that the product portfolio that we acquired has very little overlap with their existing portfolio. So every customer that didn't have access to one or the other's product is a cross-selling opportunity for us. The second part of expanding our addressable market is through a broader portfolio of product. This is not totally distinct from the cross-selling, but it is another way to look at it. We believe that our new portfolio of products, our addressable market in Brazil has increased from 53% to 62%. This equates to an additional $1 billion in a $10 billion market. When you look at the different channels to market in Brazil, dealers are an important piece and we believe we now have access to about two-thirds of all dealers across the country compared to 50% before the acquisition. We now sell to nearly all the crops in the south and these crops provide significant access to growers of niche crops. We support the growth of the acquired portfolio. But Brazil is not the only country where we believe our addressable market has expanded. In China, agricultural practices and policies are changing. The entire crop protection market is evolving toward higher technology product and growers are aligning with suppliers they see as technology providers. We have an example. We're one of the largest ag chem distributors in China, is expected to triple its purchases of FMC product in 2018 due to our expanded portfolio and pipeline of new products underway. We believe this is evidence of a customer that is perceiving FMC differently. Beyond the quality of the products, this customer truly values our service and business model. In addition, they now see us as a technology provider, one with which they want to be a closer, longer-term relationship. In Europe, our extended commercial organization has much broader and deeper access into all parts of the region. In Italy, for example, we have doubled the total of customer base. And with more retail outlets, we have more shelf space and expanded access. The acquired business had better market access than FMC in Eastern Europe. In Romania, for example, we increased the number of distributors we sell to by 5 times and quadruple our sales of legacy FMC product in Q1. We are seeing opportunities in multiple countries in Europe, and together, we expect they will deliver significant growth in the future. In India, our new super distributors give us a much better access to the overall market as well as the ability to sell FMC's herbicide portfolio into new segments such as sugarcane. Another opportunity for further sales synergy is in crops, where either FMC or the acquired business had a very strong market position and we can now aggressively sell a broader portfolio to the specific groups of farmers. For example, we can sell the acquired insecticide to our long-time sugarcane and cotton customers in Brazil. And we can sell FMC legacy herbicide to the super distributors in India. We're also seeing opportunities in specialty crops in Eastern Europe as well as rice, fruits and vegetables in Asia. Moving now to Lithium on slide 7. Lithium delivered another strong quarter with revenue up 57% compared to Q1 last year and segment EBITDA of $50 million, almost double that from a year ago. The business continues to benefit from a favorable environment with demand growth continuing to outpace supply growth for key battery-grade lithium product. Prices continued to climb with realized hydroxide and carbonate prices around 30% higher than Q1 2017, n-Butyllithium prices also up 8%. Volumes were also higher in all areas, as debottlenecking in Argentina, new hydroxide campus in China and higher demand in Butylli, all contributed to the year-over-year growth. Our EBITDA margin was 49% in the quarter, as these factors combined with a better than normal customer mix, all drove stronger financial performance. Our product mix continues to migrate towards performance products with basic carbonate and chloride accounting for only 10% of revenue in the quarter. We continue to see very strong demand. Customers are increasingly seeking long-term supply commitments, demonstrating that they're expecting a very tight market for lithium hydroxide for several years to come. The performance of hydroxide puts FMC on a very short list of companies that can provide the necessary grade of product for high-end EV battery applications. We took an important step in March when we announced Paul Graves will become the CEO of the new lithium company and Gilberto Antoniazzi will become its new CFO. As you know, Paul has been FMC's CFO since he joined the company in 2012, while Gilberto has been CFO for Ag Solutions segment the past four years, and has been with FMC since 1993. We would like to thank Paul and Gilberto for the exceptional work they have done for FMC. Turning to slide 8, which summarizes our outlook for the full year and for the second quarter. We expect adjusted earnings per share for full year 2018 to be between $5.90 and $6.20 per share. At the mid-point of the range, this represents an increase of 12% from our February guidance. Second quarter 2018 adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.65 and $1.75. We expect 2018 Ag Solutions revenue will be in the range of $4.05 billion and $4.25 billion, an increase of 2.5% at the mid-point compared to our February guidance. On a pro forma basis, this equates to a 7% to 8% year-over-year increase. We also expect Ag Solutions EBITDA will be in the range of $1.16 billion to $1.24 billion, up 9% or $100 million compared to the mid-point of our prior guidance. This increase is being driven by both high revenue and lower cost, with about half of the impact coming from each. Second quarter segment revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.16 billion, which represents a year-over-year increase of 6% at the mid-point on a pro forma basis. Segment EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $315 million to $345 million in Q2. Our guidance implies nearly 60% of 2018 Ag Solutions EBITDA will appear in the first half of the year. This is a reversal of the ratio in previous years when 40% of the segment earnings were generated in the first half. The shift is driven by the acquired business, which is more heavily weighted to the first half. We are also raising estimates for Lithium business, reflecting a strong Q1 performance. We now expect full year revenue for Lithium to be in the range of $430 million to $460 million, a year-over-year increase of 28% at the mid-point. Full year EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $193 million to $203 million, which represents an increase at the mid-point of 40% year-over-year and $8 million versus our February guidance. We expect price mix and incremental volume to each contribute approximately half of the year-over-year increasing earnings. The volume increase is largely due to the 4,000 tonnes of incremental capacity coming online from debottlenecking projects. We expect second quarter segment revenue to be in the range of $110 million to $120 million, a year-over-year increase of 55% at the mid-point. EBITDA is forecasted to be between $47 million and $51 million, which represents a year-over-year increase of 77% at the mid-point. Moving now to slide 9, and the key drivers for Ag Solutions business in 2018 and beyond. Our expectations for the overall market remain unchanged from what we said in February 00 :21:59. We continue to expect the global crop protection chemical market on a U.S. dollar basis to be flat to up low-single digits in 2018. However, we expect Ag Solutions revenue will grow 7% to 8% on a pro forma basis, which is up from the 5% growth forecast we presented in February. This includes the impact of revenue synergies which were not in prior forecast. The growth factors, we said in our February call, still holds true, and they are driving most of the growth in 2018. It is the sales synergies from a larger addressable market that we saw in Q1 that are accelerating our growth forecast. The most important driver we mentioned three months ago was the strength of the acquired insecticide. As we said earlier, we believe Cyazypyr insect control, it's far from its peak in annual sales. Volumes are expected to grow because of expanded sales into cotton and soybean in Brazil and because of new product registration in EMEA, as well as fruits and vegetables in many Asian countries. Rynaxypyr insect control will continue to gain market share in the crops and geographies, such as rice and sugarcane in India, and further grow in Southeast Asia, China and Japan. New products in the form of new active ingredients coming from FMC's legacy pipeline and new formulations of the acquired products, will be another leg of growth starting in 2019. Our first new active ingredient, the fungicide, Bixafen, will be introduced near the end of the year in North America. These growth factors will have no clear impact and we are only starting to see the benefits of the synergy opportunity. FMC will continue to outperform the global crop protection market for many years to come. As I said earlier, the integration process is progressing very well. After six months of ownership, we are finding that the business requires lower spending than was forecasted by the acquired management team. We are seeing significant savings on the SG&A line, which I outlined earlier and lower cost in our manufacturing facilities. We expect these cost savings will continue through the rest of 2018 and beyond, helping to drive EBITDA margin of approximately 29% at the mid-point of the full year 2018 guidance. As the DuPont transition service agreement roll off and as we implement a new SAP system at the end of 2019, we expect to realize further cost savings and another meaningful step-up in EBITDA margin in 2020. In Lithium, the key drivers for 2018 and beyond are unchanged from what we showed you in February. FMC is very well positioned to take advantage of a unique strategy focused on high performance lithium hydroxide applications. We have demonstrated that our approach to expand our hydroxide capacity in line with market growth is capable of meeting accelerating demand, with relatively low capital needs. Our low cost production resource in Argentina provides us with the raw materials we need to make the downstream products highly cost competitive. Prices in 2018 will be higher than in 2017 across all product categories. The majority of the 2018 forecast revenue falls under multi-year contracts that have defined pricing and we believe this trend will continue in 2019 and beyond. We expect that by the end of this year we will have 80% over 2020 lithium hydroxide capacity of 3,000 metric tonnes committed under long-term contract. To that end, our current expansion in both carbonate and lithium hydroxide are on track and progressing as expected. I will now turn the call over to Paul. Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: Thanks, Pierre. Since this is my last time delivering this section of the earnings call, I will keep it as short as possible. Let me start with FX and its impact on FMC's consolidated results. The euro has had the largest impact on our results in Q1, with the RMB and the Argentine peso smaller factors. We estimate that around 3% to 4% of the year-over-year growth in FMC's pro forma revenue was due to currency tailwinds; meaning that underlying top line growth for FMC as a whole was around 12% to 13%. We estimate that the Q1 benefit to EBITDA compared to last year was around $10 million. We do not have sufficient data on last year's earnings from the DuPont portfolio to be more precise than this. Looking at full year guidance, we are not expecting this FX tailwind to continue. We have far lower euro revenue in the latter half of the year, and forward rates do not suggest the same tailwind will occur. We always watch the Brazilian real carefully at this time of year. The forward rates for the real, which are the rates at which we protect our revenues and receivables, are in line with the assumptions underpinning the guidance we have provided. Our estimate of the impact of FX on our full year revenue guidance is unchanged from our previous guidance of 1% to 2% positive; meaning underlying revenue growth guidance of 7% to 8% across all of FMC. Interest expense continues to tick a little higher as interest rates climb. However, the impact on our guidance is muted by our expectations of cash generation go into debt to pay down. Tax expense is in line with our estimates, but we continue to work through the interpretation of the new tax rules and we'll have more clarity on the overall impact on our tax rate and especially on our tax provisions by the end of the second quarter. Cash generation in Q1 was another bright spot. Q1 is historically a cash outflow quarter and the required build in receivables for the acquired portfolio was expected to make this pattern even more pronounced. However, a very strong collection performance in Brazil with past dues falling by over $100 million compared to the same time last year, allowed us to largely offset this build and generate operating cash flow in our legacy Ag business that was stronger than prior years. We did not increase our cash flow guidance, despite the EBITDA we forecast and the strong first quarter. However, we have greater confidence that we will deliver cash flow at the high end of the guidance range and we will revisit our full year cash flow guidance in early August with our second quarter results. We believe that 2018 will be an unusual year in terms of cash generation; and the ones with through the build in receivables, we will generate significantly more cash from operations. When we normalize for this receivables build and remove the non-recurring capital spending from our base, we expect that adjusted cash from operations less CapEx will be at least twice that of 2018, assuming constant EBITDA. A final comment on the Lithium separation. We remain on track to IPO of the business in October of this year. We will be looking to file with the SEC this summer and we'll have a clearer view of the timing when we get our first set of comments back. It is important to be aware that as we get closer to the filing, our lawyers have advised us that we will be expected to reduce the commentary we provide on the Lithium business during earnings calls and investor meetings as required by securities laws. You should therefore expect that this is the last quarter that we will give extensive comments or undertake substantial Q&A on the Lithium business, before we enter what will be effectively an extended quiet period on the business. With that, I will pass the call back to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Paul. We feel very good about where FMC is today. Our Ag Solutions business delivered an exceptionally strong Q1 and we're set to deliver an outstanding 2018, with revenue growth significantly above the market growth rate. This channel growth above market will carry on for the foreseeable future. The integration of the acquired business is progressing very well. Gross synergies are being realized and our costs will be lower than we were expecting a few months ago. Lithium had another strong quarter to start the year and is on track to deliver another exceptional year in 2018. With that, I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Thank you for your attention. Operator : Thank you. And your first question will come from the line of Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thank you. You guys continue to buck the sluggishness trend in ag chemicals pretty well in most geographies, which many attributed to your earlier actions on inventories, years ago leading to better flow through. But it now appears you're expanding your addressable markets, enhancing distribution and have a pretty solid pipeline of new products. As the competitive environment is still fairly fierce, what do you, Mark, have up your sleeves left to further assess the opportunities to outperform the market? Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Chris. I think the way we're looking at the situation \u2013 as we said, first of all, I think we have a pretty clean base of operation. We do have a situation from an inventory of FMC products, including the acquired business which is healthy and which is close, if not normal, so allowing us to operate under normal conditions. I think to this, as we said in the previous half hour, there is multiple drivers which are going to play out over the years to come. I think it is very clear that, and it's even better than what we were expecting, on the customer front there was way less overlap than we were expecting. There is many customers which were only solely served by FMC and some solely served by DuPont, creating an incredible cross-selling opportunity. We are seeing, as we were expecting, a capability to reach more crops and more markets or distribution over the years. And then we have, above all of this, the quality of the portfolio we have brought to market where we keep on expanding registrations. So you put all of that together.=, it is giving us a picture of growth potential not on the quarter, not only this year, but when you create multi-billion dollar growth opportunity, those are multi-year growth opportunities we are facing. Mark, do you want to add any comment to that question? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Chris, I think Pierre hit on the main points. For me it's a two-way factor really. It's the market access and the portfolio that we have and that we have coming. We talk about the growth we've had this year in all the regions in Q1 and it's come from different places. I think of North America as an example, which is, let's make no mistake, it's a tough market right now. We know it's delayed. But our Authority franchise for pre-emergent herbicides, we launched a new product, Authority Supreme. It's a different combination. It's there to address growers' needs that have extremely tough weed resistance issues. It's taken off very well in its first quarter of sales and Q2 is also looking strong. So that's kind of the example that we're looking at in terms of bringing new technologies to address growers' needs. And that's not just with the acquired portfolio, it's with the legacy FMC portfolio. But more importantly, longer term is the technology pipeline that's coming and I'm very excited about the opportunities we have to address those growers' needs both from an insecticide, herbicide and fungicide needs. So for us, it feels very good where we are today. Operator : Thank you. And your next question will come from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yes. Good morning and congrats on a nice start to the year. And Paul, congrats on becoming the CEO of the Lithium business. Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thanks, Frank. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And given your commentary, Paul, perhaps this is a great opportunity to ask just a couple questions on Lithium. Pierre mentioned that by the end of the year you're going to have 80% of your 2020 volumes under contract. How should we be thinking about those contract terms in terms of flexing with the underlying lithium carbonate costs? And I guess more broadly, there's been a lot of discussion about new supply of lithium carbonate. What are your general thoughts there on what we can expect how that plays out? Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: Sure. Look, I think the first point I would make is that the hydroxide market is distinct and different from the carbonate market. They have very different supply and demand dynamics. There is a very different supplier landscape and there is a very different requirement on the part of the purchaser of that product in terms of performance of the product. So, it's difficult to draw direct parallels to carbonate, because frankly it really isn't a conversation with the customers. The carbonate market, as I say, it really is truly a distinct and different market than the hydroxide market. An analogy I draw, although a different product, it's no different to our Butylli business, which is also clearly a Lithium business, but again, is sold under very different market structure, very different customer requirements. And so, you see very different contracting expectations. Customers are far more focused on security of supply of hydroxide than they are on certainty of price, while price is always important. The conversations and the contracts are far more focused on security of supply, especially as the demand pattern for hydroxide in the coming years is significantly great to grow than it is for any other product. It really reflects the move of our customers towards different cathode technologies, which require hydroxide. And they all recognize that this is not a straightforward product to manufacture; it's not a straightforward product to source on their part. And it's a key question in their own supply chain that they have to answer to their customers is, do you have the security of supply of all of the required metals for your product. So they are the dynamics that are at play, and that's what's driving the contract terms. It's what's driving customer behavior, and it's what's driving frankly the degree of confidence we have in our business today. Operator : Thank you. And your next question is from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys. Chris Evans on for Bob. I took note of the, in your guide for Ag EBITDA, you've got an implied margin that's below the 1Q level for the second quarter and for the full year. So I thought maybe that would be a good opportunity to talk about the seasonality of the business, maybe the costs and how they flow through, and just maybe why you guys are expecting the second quarter profitability to be below the first. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yes. What is happening, and if you think about the way the business is now distributed. The first reason for which you have a Q1 and then Q2 for that matter, and overall the first half had a higher EBITDA margin, it is because there is a higher percentage in our business mix of the acquired portfolio, which itself carries a higher margin than the FMC legacy portfolio. So that's one of the drivers to have a first half and mostly a first quarter higher EBITDA margin. The second reason is that, the beginning of the year is a much stronger business in North America and Europe, which also are regions which are carrying higher margins. So, those are the reasons. There is nothing else to it than the percentage of new business versus legacy FMC business and the regional distribution in the first half versus second half. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ian Bennett - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Yes. This is Ian Bennett on for Steve. You commented earlier about having really strong growth in Ag and being able to cross-sell, and I wanted to dive into that. How much of these products had the existing necessary registrations, and there just wasn't a historical relationship with the distributors? And how do you think about the longer-term outlook to expand product registrations in different crops and regions? Thank you. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah. This is Mark. So I think, clearly, when we look at distribution, I think Pierre mentioned a number of statistics and it's on the slide there, you can see that we have a much broader market access in many of the major Ag countries and growing regions. That's a key development for us, because to be able to walk into a major co-op or distributor or retailer and have a broader portfolio, is very advantageous, it's something we've been looking for for a while, and this acquisition really brings that to life. I would say the second piece that you're mentioning is registrations, and it's an important part of the Ag space. I think everybody knows, without the registrations, you can't sell. If you think about Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr as two active ingredients, we have today over 200 new registrations and label extensions around the world. They'll be coming through in the next 48 months; that is all new potential for us. It is new countries, it is new crops. And I have numerous examples where we're looking at niche crops in smaller countries that we don't participate in today. Now, that is what is already rolling through the process, and I think a lot of people know it can take anywhere from three to five years depending on which country you're in for registration. We ourselves, after six months of ownership of this business, have some very novel ideas of how we intend to use Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr in the future. We have a whole suite of new active ingredients coming through our pipeline that will actually go very well with these products. So we have a mixture strategy that we will be executing over the coming years that will further enhance that growth into different crops with different pest spectrums. Operator : Thank you. And your next question is from Daniel Jester from Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everyone. So we're hearing from some of your competitors that there might be some inflation coming out of China on the active ingredient front. And I was just wondering can you comment what you're seeing and how you think that could have an impact on part of the pricing environment as the year progresses? Thanks. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yes. Thank you. Yes, there is, today, there is issues of restriction of manufacturing for some of our raw material, or I say some of our or some of the industry raw material suppliers and active ingredient suppliers. We have limitation in manufacturing because of an environmental issue. It is a problem the industry is facing, it is a problem we are facing and we are dealing with. In some places, it's creating tight supply; and in some other places, it's creating pressure on cost of raw material. It's all factored in the guidance we have going forward. So it's there, it is not really a dramatic impact and all accounted for, but something which is real and we're dealing with on a daily basis. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Hi, good morning. Could you maybe speak to, as much as you can, about what the two balance sheets might look like of the two companies once post-split? And what your plans are for the proceeds from the IPO effects? Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: Sure. I know it's pretty straightforward I think. Look, our view on the Lithium business given its investment needs is that it will be separated with a very clean balance sheet. There's not a lot of logic to piling it up with some structural challenges even if we wanted to on a tax basis, et cetera. But frankly, the right decision for the business is to let it go public with the ability to finance its investment plans in the future without stressing the balance sheet. The proceeds will, frankly \u2013 and they won't be used for debt pay down. So we will raise proceeds in the IPO and we will attempt to raise enough proceeds to make the transaction leverage neutral for FMC as a whole, which will allow us to keep our net leverage at about 2.5 times EBITDA after the IPO. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Mike Harrison from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Good morning. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Was wondering if you can just address the margin performance in the Lithium business. What things went right for you, and can you talk about what happens in the rest of the year that would lead the margin to be a little bit lower than the Q1 level? Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: Sure. The punch line is pretty straightforward and I think we've mentioned this before. On a full year basis, we expect the margin to be largely where we said it was at the start of the year, in the low-to-mid 40% range. We do have in this industry different customers and different prices and with different margins, depending on who they are, how long their contracts been in place, or ultimately what kind of product they're taking. And so, we will see and we'll always see likely on a quarter-to-quarter basis, customer mix impacting the reported margin. There's no fundamental change. We have full year plans as to when we ship to which customers. This is not a shock to us, which is why it came in largely where we guided, and it's nothing more than a simple customer mix issue or effect, should I say. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Mike Sison from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys. Nice start to the year. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thanks, Mike. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Pierre, I think you mentioned that you felt prices for lithium will be higher in 2018 versus 2017 across all product categories, and you expect prices to be up in 2019 and through the end of the decade. Is that largely because of your contracts? And can you maybe just give us some color; in the last presentation you had a really nice supply outlook. Exactly what you think, on an LCE basis, demand will be in 2019 and 2020, and what you think industry supply will be in those two years? Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yeah. I think Mike, it's always a difficult topic to address like that because it looks like there is the rules and there is the bears and there is the believers, and there is non-believers. So we build a model from two things; demand from our customers and what are their plans, as well as the contract we have and the prices we have in those contracts which are multi-year contracts. Then we apply our knowledge around manufacturing and how much the capacity \u2013 the actual real capacity with usable product will hit the market. When we bring these together and our customers view it the same way, if not, you know the automotive industry, they are not known to overpaid for any products. Everybody looking at the real capacity potential which will be in place and the demand. You have a situation where every numbers point to a very tight supply/demand situation on the lithium hydroxide front and also on the lithium carbonate. And that is creating a set of contracts with our customers, which have price escalation every year. So, between our understanding of the market, supply/demand and the actual contract we have and some certainty around price increase every year, we are pretty sure that we're going to see price going up next year and the year after. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. I just want to go back and understand what you meant when you said your costs were lower than expected in the Ag businesses. Was it just from faster, so the rationalization of head count or manufacturing efficiencies and maybe putting some of your products into the existing plans? Kind of can you provide a little bit more detail around the \u2013 I understand the sales synergies, but I'm just looking at the cost \u2013 our cost outs which seems to be happening a little bit faster. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yeah, Dmitry. So go back to November 1st, we closed on the business and at that time we do have two distinct business; the FMC legacy and the DuPont legacy, each of them having a budget. The DuPont legacy business, which is coming to us from DuPont, is an extract of their ag chemical business. And this business is coming to us with need for resources to run the back-office and to run the sales and technical organizations. And we knew it; there was no surprise there. The management team of DuPont had analyzed where they would believe we would need to add costs by adding resources, to be able to run the front-end and the back-office of the company. That's what we put into the budget. After operating the business now for five months, we realized that, I would say, into the beginning to me the first quarter, there is different way to operate. First of all, we are finding ways to leverage the FMC and DuPont sales, marketing and the field engineer organization across different regions without having systematically to add resources. We were also able to leverage much more the structure we have at FMC or back-office, to run the DuPont part of the business. So all of these led to a much lower SG&A cost that was expected by the management team with the previous business, and for that matter for \u2013 to some extent, from us. On the plant operations, we are looking at opportunities and it's not big change on the way we operate the plant, but lots of small contracts you have in plant services where we are able to do things a little bit differently, which are bringing savings at the level of gross margin. So all-in-all, it's just a matter of finding ways to operate the business by leveraging much more the existing FMC infrastructure rather than adding resources to operate the DuPont business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet : Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Pierre, you just mentioned certainty in lithium price increases for some years. Is this you're referring to your belief or is this part of the contract structure that you have with your customers? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: It's definitely in the contract with customers. I mean, there is a yearly annual price escalation in the contract with customers. There is a formula base which guide if the price should go up or down, with a bias to price increase in the contract. So, that is the main driver of a certainty. But as important for us is maybe the way we look at the real capacity, which will be hitting the \u2013 not capacity, supply, which will be hitting the market versus the demand our customers are contemplating. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Kapsch from Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC : Yeah, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Good morning. Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC : So if I had sort of one takeaway from this call this morning, it would be probably the previously underappreciated top line synergies story associated with the DuPont transaction. And so, sort of a follow up on the opportunities you're seeing there. Clearly, the Rynaxypyr is a story with broad expansion of registrations and uptake for that product. But can you just talk about the registrations in other areas? And over what timeframe do you see the development of those, the expansion in the addressable market opportunity that you referenced? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yeah. I'm going to ask Mark to go into more detail around registration label, label expansion, and maybe give some example as occur. But before he does that, I would like to say, Rynaxypyr is one of the critical elements for growth. But it is also Cyazypyr which is important molecule, it is also, and we should not forget that the complementarity of the two portfolios, remember, there is very little overlap. So we leverage the relationship of the DuPont business with some customers to sell more of the FMC product and vice versa. So it's a very broad base. I would dare to say, it's a multi-billion dollars broad-based growth opportunity we see, which will be accelerating even beyond what we see today in 2019 and 2020. And Mark, maybe you can talk a bit more about label and registration for Rynaxypyr and even others? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: No. Sure. I mean, we all focus on Rynaxypyr because obviously it's the largest molecule. But we've said many times that we believe Cyazypyr is far from its peak in sales. And indeed, it's a later product. It was launched later, its patent estate runs much longer than Rynaxypyr. If you think about registrations and label extensions, we have pretty much approximately 50 coming this year, 50 coming in 2019 and going all the way through 2022, we have approximately 130 to 150. So we know that this year and next year, we are going to expand the opportunity for Cyazypyr considerably. Our sales force is ready for it. We have plans to exploit and aggressively grow Cyazypyr. So you can see why we feel that Cyazypyr has a strong growth trajectory ahead of it, certainly through the next four to five years. And it's those label expansions and brand new registrations that really drive all of that. I do also want to say though that we have the new portfolio coming. Those products are starting to hit in 2019. We're well advanced for 2020 and 2021 with new products from our existing legacy FMC portfolio. That also adds to those billions of dollars of market opportunity that Pierre is talking about. So, it's multifaceted. It's not based around one product or one technology. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Mark Connelly from Stephens. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you. As you talk about all these new opportunities, I'm wondering whether your view on R&D is changing. You had talked earlier about finding some savings in R&D, but it almost sounds like maybe you need to be expanding R&D with the strength you've got in the pipe and these market opportunities? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I think if we are giving the impression at any point that we're looking for savings in R&D, I think it's we gave the wrong impression. There is no intent to realize cost savings in R&D. If anything, we're investing more. And it was part of our contract with the European Commission to make sure that we would protect DuPont and FMC R&D investments once we did the acquisition. The European Commission was very strong about creating a fifth large technology-based company and their requirement was for us not to create cost synergies in R&D. So, I know pretty much what we had in FMC and what we had in DuPont is what we'll be adding up this year plus the no more R&D increase you'll see on a yearly basis. Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Arun Viswanathan from RBC. Please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just a question on Ag and, one, then Ag and one on Lithium, if I may. So in Ag, looking at the second half, looks like it implies a little bit lower result than what I was expecting. And I guess I was just wondering if that's due to greater strength in the northern hemisphere in the first half. And then secondly in lithium, do you still feel confident on hydroxide prices longer term? We've seen some recent pressure on carbonate in China, but I would imagine that that's not as relevant for you guys. So, just wanted to get your thoughts on that. Thanks. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I think H2 performance for the Ag business is very much in line, but, even above. I mean, you look at a growth rate overall for the year, 7% to 8%, is above what we've been indicating in any previous conversation or call. So we are feeling very strong about our second half business, driven of course as always by Latin America, specifically in the fourth quarter. Now, as we said before, the H2 will be more based on legacy FMC business which means lower gross margin and also it is based on regions like Latin America, where margins are lower than North America or Europe. So de facto you're going to see a business with a lower EBITDA margin. That's why we like to talk about across the year our target this year is a 29% EBITDA margin, but above 30% in the first half and below 30% in the second half. Paul, do you want to? I think I talked about the hydroxide, but maybe Paul, you want to reiterate differently what I say? Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: I'll just repeat what Pierre said. We have both, for this year at least and beyond, pretty strong contractual protections around price. When we look at the supply/demand dynamics in hydroxide, it is tight. It's extremely tight and the demand is growing incredibly rapidly. And so, we don't see that tightness changing in any meaningful way. I'll keep making a point that maybe people miss with our business, that there is no connection between carbonate pricing and hydroxide pricing in our conversations with customers. And the fact that the two have moved together just reflects the fact that there's been tightness in both markets. Carbonate is and will always be a raw material to FMC's Lithium business. And so, the hydroxide market, you really have to understand completely, separately and independently today from the carbonate market. Operator : Thank you. And your last question will come from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Hi, there. Could you address, I guess, just maybe some areas where you have some optionality? And I guess, what I'm thinking about sort of an update on the Christine Hansen biologicals effort and when that could be meaningful, whether the terms have changed in the Roundup Ready PLUS cross-marketing effort with Monsanto? And how you're thinking about sort of CapEx for the two separated businesses once the SAP and TSA have drop off? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah, I'll address the two related to Christine Hansen. Our relationship continues to grow. We are investing in what we call out plant health platform. Plant health for us is biologicals, micro-nutrients and sea treatment. That business is growing rapidly around the world that is now north of $100 million in revenue. As I said, we continue to invest. We're seeing great opportunities in Asia on micro-nutrients. But more importantly, on biologicals, we're seeing growth in Brazil and certainly growth in the U.S. As we've said many times over many calls, this is a platform that we intend to continue to invest in. We see both opportunities for standalone biologicals, but also biologicals with synthetic chemistry and we're seeing growth in both areas. So for us, very important and we'll continue to invest. On the Monsanto Roundup Ready, FMC last year made a decision along with Monsanto that we would not be part of the Roundup Ready program. We have instituted in North America our own Freedom Pass program, which has been extremely successful in the first year. We are aligning with our retailers around the products that we sell and how they can benefit from various activities. It doesn't mean to say that we don't have a very strong relationship with Monsanto and other areas which we do, and we continue to both enjoy that relationship and both grow. But I am very excited about the Freedom Pass program that we put in place in the U.S., and especially how well it's taken off in its first year. Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: Yeah. I think on the \u2013 what's call, on the CapEx question, one of the reasons for separating the Lithium business is to really demonstrate the fact that the two businesses have different capital requirements. The Ag business will probably be in the $80 million to $120 million of CapEx range in any given year. Lousy maintenance CapEx, some expansion, and you've heard about the growth plans for Cyazypyr and Rynaxypyr and other molecules. So there's likely to be some expansion in those numbers. The Lithium business is obviously a completely different beast. There's a large expansion in Argentina planned between now and 2025. I think we've talked about somewhere between $550 million and $700 million for that, plus the hydroxide expansion which while much lower capital is coming sooner, we talked about anywhere between $100 million and $200 million coming in the next three or four years on the hydroxide piece as well. Operator : Thank you. And Mr. Wherley, please go ahead with your closing remarks. Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.: That's all the time we have for the call today. As always, I'm available following the call to address any questions that you may have. Thank you, and have a good day. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude the FMC Corporation first quarter 2018 earnings release conference call. Thank you.",

With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Michael, and good morning everyone. Q2 was another strong quarter for both businesses at the revenue and earnings level. For Ag Solutions, the demand for our products, revenue synergies, and cost were very much in line with expectation we laid out a quarter ago. The business integration is on schedule and the commercial teams continue to perform very well. The strong global performance through the first half of 2018 combined with a high percentage of orders in hand for the rest of the year in Latin America gives us great confidence for our second half. Beyond the immediate future, we continue to see very strong growth potential for our acquired portfolio, especially Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect controls. On the technology front, the integration of our R&D organization is progressing very well and is confirming the strength of our expanded pipeline. We remain on track to launch our first new active ingredient from the legacy FMC R&D pipeline the fungicide, Bixafen, in North America later this year. The Lithium business, which we recently announced, will be named Livent Corporation, continues to perform strongly with demand for differentiated performance products continuing to grow. Realized prices and delivered volume are in line with our previous expectations. We remain on track to list Livent in an October 2018 IPO, which will be followed by a direct spin to FMC shareholders within six months. Turning to slide 3, FMC reported second quarter revenue of just over $1.25 billion, which was nearly double the revenue from Q2 2017. Adjusted EPS was $1.78 in the quarter, which was $0.08 above the midpoint of our guidance and up 270% versus the same period a year ago. The guidance beat was mainly due to stronger operational performance driven by revenue growth in Ag Solutions and the combination of higher pricing and favorable customer mix in Lithium. Moving to slide 4 and Ag Solutions, revenue of about $1.15 billion in the quarter nearly doubled year-over-year on a reported basis and increased 8% on a pro forma basis, with zero net impact from foreign currencies. We continue to capitalize on cross-selling opportunities and our global sales force delivered another impressive performance in its second full quarter with the combined portfolio. You can see in the bridge on the right side of this page that we saw top line growth on a pro forma basis in every region for the second consecutive quarter. Stepping back and taking a look at the first half revenue, we delivered a very strong performance with 11% pro forma growth. This was led by the acquired insecticides, Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect control, which grew 24% and continue to gain market share and demand across every region. Second quarter segment EBITDA of $344 million was triple the earnings from the year-ago quarter, and was $14 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Segment EBITDA margin was 30% on strong mix and a continued focus on cost control. This performance was achieved despite the broader challenges faced by the chemical industry. The Chinese government has been shutting down facilities and industrial parks as part of their environmental strategy. These shutdowns have limited the supply of certain active ingredients and intermediates causing shortages of material and, in certain cases, rising raw material cost. FMC has been able to mitigate and manage the impact on our ability to supply our customers, thanks to a global diversified supply network. We are very pleased with our margin performance in today's environment and believe this will grow in future years as the portfolio continues to shift to higher margin product. Turning now to slide 5, Q2 revenue growth was strong on a pro forma basis in every region. North America revenue increased 8%; Europe revenue grew 3%; Latin America revenue grew 21%; and Asia revenue increased 6%. In North America, we performed well compared to the broader crop protection market, which we estimate was down low to mid-single digit. We saw very strong volume growth for insecticide, mostly driven by Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect control. We are also seeing strong demand for our latest Authority branded herbicide, Authority Supreme, as the market for pre-emergent herbicide continues to grow due to increasing weed resistance. In Europe, despite difficult growing condition, our business grew 3%, which was ahead of the crop protection market that we believe was down low single digit on a U.S. dollar basis. The market conditions were in line with the strength of our portfolio. The insecticide and herbicide market performed better than the fungicide market which was weak. Consequently, we have seen strong growth of Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect control. In Latin America, our business grew 21% on a pro forma basis, which is a very positive indicator of underlying demand for our products even in a seasonally lighter quarter. This strong performance is primarily due to a low channel inventory in Brazil and our crop exposure across the region. The Brazilian crop protection market is healthy. FMC's sales in Brazil grew an impressive 35% in Q2, driven by strong demand for our legacy FMC herbicides and insecticides. Mexico also delivered a strong performance, driven by expansion of niche crop applications. In Asia, we saw strong pro forma growth in nearly all countries. In India, we have made significant change in our market access model as we highlighted on the last call. This change to the super distributor model is going extremely well and delivered mid-teen revenue growth on a pro forma basis, led by strong demand for Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect control. In China, our legacy rice herbicides drove a double-digit sales increase on a pro forma basis, as we continue to gain traction in a market that is trending toward higher value crop protection product. Growth in these two major markets, along with a host of smaller ones in the region, was more than enough to offset the impact we felt from significantly weaker demand in Australia due to the severe drought. Moving now to Lithium on slide 6. Lithium delivered another strong quarter, with revenue up 46% compared to Q2 last year and segment EBITDA of $51 million, 85% higher than a year ago. We continue to see very strong customer demand for FMC's performance product. Higher realized prices remained the primary driver on a year-over-year growth, with hydroxide, carbonate, and lithium metal prices each up at least 20%. Volumes were also higher in all major products as increased production in Argentina, increased hydroxide production and higher demand in BuLi all contributed to the year-over-year growth. Our Q2 EBITDA margin of 48% was higher than our full year margin forecast of 45% at the midpoint, due mainly to favorable customer mix in the first half of the year. Turning to slide 7 which summarizes our outlook for the full year and for the third and fourth quarters. We still expect adjusted earnings per share for full year 2018 to be between $5.90 and $6.20 per share. At the midpoint of the range, this represents an increase of 123% versus 2017 EPS. Third quarter 2018 adjusted EPS is expected to be between $0.87 and $0.97, and fourth quarter 2018 adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.41 and $1.61. We expect 2018 Ag Solutions revenue will be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. On a pro forma basis, this equates to a 9% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. We also expect Ag Solutions' EBITDA will be in the range of $1.17 billion to $1.23 billion. Our expectations for the overall crop protection market remain unchanged from what we said in May. We continue to expect the global crop protection chemical market on a U.S. dollar basis to be flat to up low-single digit in 2018. We expect North America to be down mid-single digits, Europe to be up low to mid-single digits, Latin America to be up mid to high-single digit, and Asia to be flat to up low-single digit. For FMC, third quarter Ag Solutions revenue is expected to be in the range of $870 million to $930 million, and fourth quarter segment revenue is expected to be in the range of $980 million to $1.1 billion. These revenue forecasts represent pro forma growth rate of low-single digit in Q3 and low-double digit in Q4. The third quarter is a low season for the majority of our market, and it will be the lowest sales quarter for FMC from now on. In 2018, this is magnified by internal events which are moving sales into Q4. In any major integration process, there often are delayed closings of countries and sites due to legal entity, registration and permit transfers under local laws. Since the close of the transaction with DuPont, we have known and planned for delayed closings. DuPont is operating certain countries and sites on our behalf under our direction, and we are receiving the economic benefit. The majority of this delayed countries and sites along with the related permits, licenses and registration are being transferred to FMC in Q3, thus creating a temporary sales blackout period in Q3. These sales will occur in Q4. FMC's outperformance versus the crop protection market in the first half of 2018 will continue as we expect second half Ag Solution revenues to grow 7% on a pro forma basis. We have very high confidence in our forecast as our visibility into Latin America, which represents roughly 40% of expected revenue for the period, has increased versus previous seasons. In particular, in Brazil, we have over 70% of our orders in hand to reach our full year target, which is meaningfully above what we have seen in past years. Segment EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $195 million to $215 million in Q3, and in the range of $275 million and $315 million in Q4. Our guidance implies nearly 60% of 2018 Ag Solutions' EBITDA occurred in the first half of the year. This is a reversal of the ratio in previous years when 40% of segment earnings were generated in the first half. The shift is driven by the acquired business, which is much more heavily weighted on the first half. Moving over to Lithium, we expect full year segment revenue to be in the range of $430 million to $460 million, a year-over-year increase of 28% at the midpoint. We are increasing our full year EBITDA forecast by $2 million to a range of $195 million to $205 million, which represents a year-over-year increase of 41% at the midpoint. Our Q3 guidance for the segment is for revenue to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million and EBITDA to be between $45 million and $49 million, each representing a year-over-year increase of 17% at the midpoint. I will now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew David Sandifer - FMC Corp.: Thanks, Pierre. Let me start this morning with the income statement, specifically taxes and the impacts of foreign exchange. We've lowered our guidance for adjusted effective tax rate for the full year to a range of 16% to 18%, a reduction of 50 basis points at the midpoint of the range, driven by our updated forecast of the mix of earnings across various jurisdictions. The 16.5% adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter brings our year-to-date provision for taxes in line with this updated guidance. Foreign exchange impacts on revenue were a net zero in the second quarter for our Ag Solutions segment, with euro strength offsetting weakness in key Latin American currencies, aided by ongoing price increases. For the Lithium business, FX was a modest tailwind in the quarter. Looking to the remainder of the year, we will, as always, be watching the Brazilian real closely. We manage our currency exposures throughout the year and this year is no different. With the combination of price increases and our hedging activities, we expect to completely offset any FX headwinds in the Ag Solutions business in the second half and the full year. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow, net debt at June 30 was $2.75 billion, down more than $150 million from the beginning of this year, reflecting solid cash generation and the pay down of $100 million of outstanding term loan debt in the quarter. Turning to slide 8, FMC generated adjusted cash from operations of $287 million in the first half of 2018, up 34% compared to the prior year period, driven by higher EBITDA. We also benefited from lower working capital build of the DuPont acquisition than was previously expected. Looking to the full year, we are increasing our guidance for adjusted cash from operations by $100 million to a range of $650 million to $750 million. This increase is driven by our updated forecast for the working capital build for the acquired DuPont business, supported by our continued expectation for strong EBITDA. With that, I'll turn the call back to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Andrew. First, a comment on the Lithium separation. We remain on track to IPO Livent this October. We made a confidential filing with the SEC in June, and we will file a public version of the S-1 in late August. Securities laws require us to reduce the commentary we provide on the Lithium business now that we are within 30 days of its public filing. Therefore, we will not be able to undertake substantial Q&A on the Lithium business today. We feel very good about the direction FMC is headed as we move to becoming a standalone agricultural sciences company. The business delivered another strong quarter, and we have high confidence on our second half estimate. Our full year pro forma revenue growth will be significantly above the market growth rate in 2018, and our disciplined approach to cost will help drive an EBITDA margin approaching 30% for the full year. The integration of the acquired business is progressing very well, and our SAP implementation is on track for the end of 2019, which will drive significant margin improvement from 2020 and beyond. Growth synergies are being realized faster than we would have expected nine months ago as our new portfolio is gaining well adoption with our strategic customers. We expect to outperform the crop protection market for the foreseeable future. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to remind you we are hosting an Investor Day in New York on December 3rd and we hope to see many of you there. I will now turn the call back to Michael Wherley. Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Pierre. As we're in a quiet period for the Lithium business, we're happy to answer questions on the first half performance of that business. But we're very limited in what we can say about the future, so we may choose not to answer some forward-looking questions at this time. Please frame your questions in that light. Operator, you can now begin the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Ian Bennett - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you and good morning. This is Ian Bennett on for Steve. In the agricultural outlook for 3Q, could you help describe the moving pieces in the lower margin of legacy business, or currency and maybe some of those trucking issues in Brazil or perhaps compare the margin structure in 3Q to what it would have been pro forma for 3Q of 2017? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: That's a lot of questions at the same time. Yeah, Q3, as we explained \u2013 first of all, Q3 and \u2013 has to be, and will be in the future the lowest season. So, if you think about it, the margin, the EBITDA margin for the business is very much the result that your SG&A and your R&D cost go against a gross margin which is lower because the revenue is lower. So, the math just makes you end up with an EBITDA margin which is lower. So, it's purely the fact that your below-the-line cost doesn't move as the spending is about the same every quarter, while your revenues are lower. Historically, Q3 has always been a low quarter, because Europe is non-existing, and Asia and North America are fairly low, while Brazil mostly start in September. It is magnified with the new portfolio, which is much more of an Asia, North America, Europe portfolio making the first half even stronger and Q3 even weaker. So, for the future, I think we have to expect Q3 to be the month with the lowest revenue, consequently with the lowest EBITDA, and consequently with the lowest EBITDA margin. From a currency standpoint, if you look at each half and the full year, we are pretty much \u2013 not pretty much, we are going to offset any headwind we will be seeing from currencies and mostly the real by a combination of our hedging strategy and our price increase. Now, if you look at the two quarters, I would say we might be slightly lagging in Q3. So, you might have a slight negative impact of FX in Q3. And you will have more of a positive impact when we're really in the full season in Brazil in Q4. Last question, I think last point of your question was around the truck and trucking strike. And maybe I'll let Mark add a couple of sentence. There is no direct impact of the trucking strike on the crop chemical industry. There could be some side effect to the agricultural industry, maybe Mark you want to comment on that? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah. I think the way we're structured in terms of our logistics contracts for Brazil, we are not seeing and not expecting any issues when it comes to supply of trucks to move our materials. And let's be honest, a lot of our materials are extremely concentrated. So, we tend to ship a lot less volumes unlike some of the other Ag inputs such as fertilizers which are extremely bulky. I think the other impact you might see if this doesn't get resolved, it's not necessarily for this year but certainly into Q1 when the harvest starts, is how the grains get moved to the ports. And I think you've heard a number of the grain traders talking about that already. So, those are maybe the two impacts right at the front end of the season in terms of fertilizers and right at the back end in terms of grains. But as far as FMC is concerned, we don't see any issues in terms of delivery. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Now, let me finish to answer your broad question around Q3. Something I want to be \u2013 to make very clear. Q3 is always a difficult quarter to predict. We do have today \u2013 you could see, and I'm not forecasting, it's hypothetical, but you could easily see $40 million or $50 million in Latin America or specifically in Brazil shifting from Q4 to Q3. We have a very strong cotton season ahead of us, and the customers might decide to secure supply earlier, and that would create a shift in the buying pattern. If that will happen, we would rebalance the growth rate of Q3 and Q4 to a level which are much more in the same range. Finally, I hope I was clear in my explanation around what we are facing, pure integration process. We knew about it. But there is a few countries like Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam or a site in Brazil where there is a delayed transfer to the company. We knew about it. That creates a blackout in sales. Those sales are not lost. The orders are taken, but the sales will be delivered and accounted for in Q4. So, that comes and creates more noise and creates a lower Q3 than we should have. Ian Bennett - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. That's very helpful. And just as a follow-up, on the Lithium business, how has spot prices declining in China affected contract negotiations in the first half of the year? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: So, most of the contract negotiations for us for any business we have under contract is done in the back end of the year. So, we have very little contract negotiation in the first half of the year. So, today, as we said for hydroxide, carbonate and even metal price are up over 20% year-on-year. We participate very little in the lithium carbonate spot market. But I can tell you for our sales (31:41) between Q1 and Q2, sequentially, pricing are also up for hydroxide and carbonate. So we are seeing sequential up pricing as well as very strong year-on-year pricing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Jester with Citi. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, everyone. So, I wanted to ask you about the comment you made in your prepared remarks about your order book for Brazil and how it's much stronger today than maybe it's been in the past. Is this something specific that you're doing to build an order book differently this year, or is this something that's more a market drive \u2013 market driven driving early orders? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I think it's purely market driven. It is the fact that we have been very, very careful in supplying the market. So, there is a very low inventory in the channel of the FMC product. Consequently, our customers who have a pretty good visibility on their demand are placing orders and firm orders at an early stage. So, I would say we are in a much more normalized situation in Brazil and because we keep on being very careful even today in a high demand period in not supplying product when they are not absolutely required to keep a low level of inventory in the channel, we're getting very strong demand. Now, I said 70%, and I'm not saying that jokingly. I said 70% because we wrote a remark a few days ago, but the number is already above 70%. So I think it's one \u2013 it's been a long time since we had such a high amount of orders in hand before (33:36). Mark, maybe you want to give more color? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: No. I do believe that the last few years of working down those channel inventories have served us very well, and we're in a very advantageous position. I also do believe that our crop focus in Brazil is going to serve us very well as we go through the rest of this year. Cotton increased significantly over the last season in terms of acreage and prices were good. So, the cotton growers are once again looking at a pretty significant increase in acreage going forward. So, we're eyeing that market not only with the acquired portfolio, but with our legacy portfolio. So, we expect significant growth there. And then, overall, with what is happening around the world on soy, obviously the growers in Brazil are feeling very bullish about their acreage. So, we expect to see acres increase in Brazil as well for soy. So, for us, it's a combination of a lot of hard work over the last two to three years to get ourselves in good shape, and then an advantageous market position right now. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then actually that touches exactly what I have on my follow-up question, Mark, is with what's going on with soy, I think the conventional wisdom is that Brazil is going to sell a bit more to China, and the U.S. will need to find new suppliers to sell their soybeans. Is FMC agnostic between a planted soybean acre in Brazil versus a planted soybean acre in the U.S.? And I just wonder if long-term the U.S. plants less soybeans, what kind of impact that could have on FMC's business given how important soybeans are for you. Thanks. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah. I mean, it's a good follow-up question. I mean, just over 20% of our portfolio is exposed to soy around the world. There's one country you're forgetting in that mix which is Argentina, which is a big country for us. We have a significant pre-emergent herbicide business down in Argentina, and obviously the acquired insecticide portfolio is important to us down there as well. Yeah, we are pretty agnostic. I mean, we're growing in all three regions. Soybeans will be provided around the world from one of those three or all three. So, for us, it's \u2013 we really don't mind. We want to grow in all three and we'll grow with our technologies. Operator : Your next question is from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, everyone. This is Chris Evans on for Bob. We're clearly seeing the benefits of the combined portfolio given the pro forma growth rates you showed in the first half. You're guiding to a strong 2H top line expectation as well, but maybe at a decelerated rate versus the first half. Could you give us some context here? And then maybe secondly, can you opine on the growth drivers for Ag as you move beyond 2018? What contribution do you think is possible from new formulations and the acquired DowDuPont product pipeline that you receive? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I'll take the first part, and Mark will take the second part on the new technology. I think, yes, we had a very strong first half and that was driven by the demand on our insecticide. We believe Rynaxypyr, Cyazypyr are still the benchmark molecules in the insecticide market, and they grew 24%. So, we believe that the quality of the portfolio plus the customer synergies are creating a very significant market share gain. We actually \u2013 the overall portfolio of FMC in the first half grew also a healthy 17%. So, we believe we are in very strong position now. When you move in H2, and I think the right way to look at this business within H1, H2, there is \u2013 we foresee a deceleration versus H1. It is mostly because, as we said before, the DuPont acquired business is much more of an H1 business, and that business is growing faster than the legacy FMC business. So, if you look at the Latin America and Brazil, the growth will be driven a lot by the herbicide and insecticide from the FMC portfolio and to some extent, the acquired business, but less. That is why we do have an 11% growth rate in the first half, and we would expect to be more in the 7% range in the second half of the year. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah. With regard to the portfolio, we've talked numerous times about the strength of the two combined portfolios coming together. We launched our first product, as Pierre said in the script, Bixafen, a fungicide targeted at North America later this year, so for the 2019 season. We pretty much have launches coming every year after that, certainly through the mid part of the decade, and actually we expect some more products to come that will be hitting later in the decade. We've had a metric for some time that we think of in terms of products introduced over the last five years. That's kind of a metric that we had in the legacy FMC in terms of how efficient we are in turning over the portfolio. We're going to be revamping that metric, and we'll talk more about that at the Investor Day in early December. But you can expect a healthy increase in formulations that are coming to market not just new active ingredients. I talked on the prior calls about the number of registrations we have coming for the acquired portfolio. We have similar numbers for the legacy FMC portfolio in terms of both herbicides and new fungicide mixtures. So, it's a very robust portfolio going forward starting in 2019. Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. And maybe I was hoping you could comment on the impact of the Argentine peso on FMC Lithium in the quarter? I was surprised a large devaluation didn't result in a bigger impact and it doesn't seem to be, let's say, factored into your guidance. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: The Argentine peso was a tailwind in the second quarter. I think, Paul, maybe you want to... Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: Yeah. It was \u2013 look, you have to understand that our exposure to the peso is \u2013 it doesn't seem \u2013 it's not as large as people seem to believe. It was less than $1 million tailwind to the EBITDA in the quarter. It is factored in for the rest of the year. Clearly, you have to bear in mind that one of the drivers of the depreciation of the peso is cost inflation. And so we do have an offsetting cost in peso terms. By the time you've washed through all those, we're not seeing a huge tailwind or headwind for peso devaluation year-to-date. Operator : Thank you. And your next question will come from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital. Please go ahead. Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): I just want to reconcile something you're talking about expecting a bit of the sales blackout on some of the DuPont sales moving from Q3 to Q4. It looks like you have a $900 million revenue guide for Q3 for Ag and $1 billion for Q4, give or take. How much revenue is roughly swinging from Q3 to Q4, because if Q3 is the lowest quarter of the year for Ag, it seems like Q4 in a normalized basis would be very similar to Q3? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yes. If you look at the \u2013 right now, at the numbers for revenue in Q3, we have about $200 million differential in the two quarters from the sales. Yeah, $140 million differential between the two quarters in Q3 and Q4. So, that is a bigger differential than we've seen in the past, and it's a big \u2013 if you remove the impact of the blackout sales, we are not talking about $100 million of blackout sales. We are talking about tens of millions of dollars. So, I think every $10 million is about 1%. So, if you have a few $10 millions, you can bring another 2% or 3% more in a quarter. So, that's the kind of shift we are talking about. Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question now comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet : Yes. Good morning. Thank you. Just to confirm, the sales blackout is purely an accounting issue, and the sales are actually being made and booked by DuPont at this time? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: No. It's more of a sale recognition. It's just \u2013 when we have the orders, and we do have the product, the only question is if we can \u2013 so, we have a firm order, we have the product, it's only a matter of being entitled to register the sale, ship the product, and do have revenue recognition. So, it's already as soon as we get the registration or the legal entity transferred or the permit, then we do ship and do the revenue recognition. It's purely a revenue recognition, legal issue for us to be able to account for the sales. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet : So you're waiting for government approval to ship the product. Is there any risk that this slips further into next year and you don't get that approval in Q4? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: No, absolutely not, because when you do delayed sites, you do transfer the site only when everything is secured and ready to go. So it is not a full quarter for us. I think it's going to depend on the place, but sometimes it's a couple of weeks, sometimes it's a month. It's mostly impacting a part of July or a part of August. But it is not something \u2013 there is no questions around the delayed transfers. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kapsch from Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. Good morning. My question is about this sort of more pronounced or acute seasonality that you're referring to with the new portfolio. Just wondering if what emerged \u2013 new information emerged last quarters about the enthusiasm around both the cross-selling opportunities with the DuPont business as well as a strong pipeline of the new registrations. I'm just wondering if there's anything about this that is \u2013 as we now have two and a half quarters of the DuPont business having closed, anything about this more pronounced seasonality that's inconsistent with those views about cross-selling opportunities and the new registration pipeline associated with the new chemistries? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: No. We feel actually the same, if not stronger. Just to look at the number, we have a \u2013 if you look at the total forecast in sales, at the end of Q1, we were expecting for the full year to see a growth rate for the company for the full year in the 7% to 8% range. We are forecasting today for the full year 9% range. So, our level of confidence around growth synergies has enormously increased versus where we were at the end of last year and increased to some extent versus where we were at the end of the first quarter. So, there is no change. It's only a situation where Q3 is a quarter where the acquired business is a very low percentage of the overall portfolio, and there is less demand for this business. So, it's an historical low quarter for DuPont and it was for us. That's all there is. But there is no \u2013 if anything, we are increasing the forecast in term of growth and speed at which we are creating synergies versus what we said at the end of the first quarter. Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks for that. And if I had to follow-up on the Lithium business and just about the market and the industry more generally there, there's disconnect between spot prices in China, and obviously you and other sort of incumbent players are seeing obviously strong both year-over-year and sequential pricing trends tied to the contract that you guys have both inked and are rolling over. So, the question is about the spot price, one possible explanation or plausible explanation is just that in China you have a surplus of either low-grade spodumene or DSO that's generally low quality that the conversion industry over there is constrained, and therefore, there's kind of a surplus of that sort of material in inventory over there, which is sort of creating the sort of short-term phenomenon of de-stocking. Do you sort of view it that way? Do you feel that's a plausible explanation? And the other thing that might be contributing, of course, is this longer term shift towards high nickel cathode chemistries that's favoring hydroxide, therefore, maybe spurring some destock on the carbonate side in China? Any thoughts on if those are plausible explanations and the disconnect? Thanks. Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: This is Paul. I think your second explanation there really goes to the heart of it. What we've seen in Q2 particularly, bear in mind that the new Chinese rebates and incentive structures really kicked in in June. And what we saw early in the year, in the first half of the year, one of the underlying trends that we've seen is a more rapid move towards hydroxide-based cathode technologies than we had expected. And what we're seeing is, as the new rebates and incentives kick in, a retooling going on amongst the cathode manufacturers to be able to meet those energy density and other requirements of the new incentive programs. To do that, we've seen plants closing down while they retool. We've seen certainly a drawdown of their own inventory of carbonate as they finish production of cathodes that are using carbonate. And we've seen an increased focus on their part as where they will secure the hydroxide from. And there is a significant disconnect between the availability of carbonate and the availability of qualified usable hydroxide in China and elsewhere in the world. I'll keep making the point until I maybe go blue in the face that this Chinese spot market for carbonate is not a really very useful market even if it is a market to look at. It carries very little informational content for the overall state of the market of what customers are looking for with them on contracting strategies. So, while I recognize that people pick up on that data, it's leading everybody down the wrong path as to what the true fundamentals of the market are, I'm afraid. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you. Pierre, do you think that your raw materials and sourcing are going to have to shift towards India if China keeps up the pressure on producers, and where else would you be increasing your sourcing? And second question, before the DuPont deal, you've been expanding some of your basic R&D through collaboration. Is that still strategically important, and how does it fit together with your big R&D efforts now? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. I mean, when we look at the manufacturing strategy, we've been looking and starting to diversified our manufacturing from different location. India is a location, but I can tell you also that we have moved some of the manufacturing for some intermediates, for example, toward Europe with some partners and towards some of our plants in Europe and other locations. So, yes, over time, there is a strategy to keep on investing in China where we do have a stronger \u2013 strong partnership and players, but certainly diversification will take place. We'll produce more in India, but you have also to look at Europe and North America as potential places where we will be generating most \u2013 generating some of our products which are critical. I think also one critical aspect of what we do, and that's why we got out of the tough situation in the first half of the year, what the organization in Ag has done for years is always, always make sure that your key molecule or intermediates, you have multiplied suppliers who are qualified and registered. I think it's very important; you cannot be depending, even in China, solely on one. So, you always have to have two or three or four capable suppliers to be able to manage potential shutdown. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: On the question of the R&D, your point is a good one, Mark, that we did have strong collaborations in the past as legacy FMC. And obviously, now, we're very heavily into basic research. That basic research actually helps when it comes to collaborations because what it means is you have technology that you can actually, in the broadest sense, trade for new technologies. I'll give you an example. FMC, we're very interested in expanding our fungicide portfolio. That may mean that in the future we're willing to trade technologies that we're developing in terms of herbicides or insecticides to get access to new fungicides. Our ability to do that is vastly enhanced with the capabilities that we acquired last year. So, for us, it's very much a game that we know very well. We've played it very successfully over the last five years. And we will continue to keep that tool in our toolbox as we look to continue to broaden that portfolio of technologies. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Good morning, Mike. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the Brazilian real and your exposure in Latin America. The last time we saw the real under pressure like this, you ended up seeing a lot of challenges in your business. Can you just talk a little bit, Pierre, about how the business has changed since the last time FX was an issue in Brazil and comment in a little more detail on what steps you're taking to mitigate this impact in the second half? I think you mentioned price increases and hedging activities. Thanks. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Absolutely. I think we learned a lot from 2015, and we'll do all we can not to get back to a situation equivalent. I think we are very close to what is going on in Brazil, and we are looking at it from two different angle, and I'll ask Andrew to talk about the hedging. I think, first, on the pricing, we do have a very tight connection between the currency and the price list, and as long as there is not very, very abrupt change over a few weeks of significant amount, I think now we are structured from the way we negotiate price and establish the price list to be very much in line with the currencies. And also remember that only half of our business in Brazil is dollar denominated. So, we've moved from the less vulnerable business with a tighter control of the pricing. And I have to say, since the beginning of the year, we've been doing very well in connecting pricing. Plus, Andrew, could you talk about the change of approach we had to hedging, and how do we do that to limit potential issues on the one side (54:34)? Andrew David Sandifer - FMC Corp.: Sure. Thanks. I'll speak to two things. I think \u2013 since 2015, I think we've become much more systematic and routine in the way we approach hedging the BRL. It's been our practice since 2015 to hedge a significant portion of the anticipated BRL denominated sales once we have a confirmed order from the customer. Now, it can be some time between confirming the order with the customer and actually invoicing the sale. So, that protects us from BRL movements between that time of confirming the order, fixing the order with the customer and actually invoicing the sale. This year, as we saw higher volatility and anticipated some continued volatility in the currency in Brazil, we also chose to do some additional hedging, hedging a portion of our sale, anticipated sales in advance of confirming orders where we felt confident on the demand to take some of the risk in terms of their ability to move price sheet fast enough against rapid movements in the currency off the table. So it's really a combination of regular, systematic, as we confirm orders, taking that risk off the table and then some additional work we did this year to prepare for potential volatility in the currency through the year. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : All right. And then I wanted to ask also about the Asia Ag business. You mentioned the strength in the rice markets in India and China. Is that related to market dynamics or just some new application wins since the combination with DuPont? Could you just talk a little bit about how you're positioned for growth in the rice market in Asia going forward? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah, sure. Three very big markets : India, China and Southeast Asia. I think taking India first, we made a significant step this year in changing the legacy FMC go-to-market model by adopting the acquired super distributor model. That is affording us opportunities where we were selling some very key products from the legacy FMC portfolio into that new channel. And also, I would say having a broader access channel in rice with the acquired portfolio, i.e., continuing to take market share with insecticides in India. In China, slightly different story. We introduced a very, very good rice herbicide in 2017 that is continuing to gain traction in China. That combination with sales synergies with the acquired portfolio is helping drive both pieces of the portfolio, so hence, a very strong first half in China for us. And then laterally, in Southeast Asia, obviously, the acquired portfolio complements very well the legacy FMC rice portfolio, and we have a very good market access in places like Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines. And now, with the acquired assets, we get more access to key countries such as Vietnam. So, overall, for us, it's a lot of sales synergies and a very good strong portfolio in terms of herbicides as well as insecticides. Operator : Thank you. Your last question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yes. Good morning. Mark, it sounds like channel inventory levels of crop protection chemicals are quite low in Brazil. I was wondering if you could comment on the levels that you're seeing in your other key markets, at least in terms of outliers, including both your perception of industry inventories and FMC's own inventory levels? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. I think, in general, I would say, from an FMC perspective, we're feeling very good about our channel inventories around the world. Obviously, we've focused for the last few years on Brazil, absolutely no issues for FMC in Brazil. I think North America, we've talked about where we've had insecticide, legacy insecticide inventories in terms of corn rootworm applications. That certainly still holds true, although we are seeing more pressure on corn rootworm than we have in the last few years. So, we'll see how this season develops. Market, in general, is probably going to be spotty depending on different companies' portfolios. I would say the biggest area that I see going forward is Europe. Given the extremely dry conditions in Europe, I would expect to end this season with higher than normal channel inventories of fungicides, just given the market conditions. India and China, China has elevated inventory levels mainly because of both weather and market conditions there. The rest of the world, pretty much okay. I would expect \u2013 oh sorry, one more, Australia, I would think Australia will end up with very high channel inventories given the severe drought that we've seen this season. Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC : That's helpful. And then perhaps for Paul, I just wonder if you could comment on the sequential pattern of earnings in Lithium as per your EBITDA guide. Is the decrement that you expect there a function of volume, price or other factors if I compare your stated guide for 3Q versus 2Q? Not sure if you can answer that or what you can tell us that might be helpful to discern that. Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.: Yeah. I think there is one factor you have to bear in mind in this business. And as we mentioned in Q1 and we'll mention it again today, and it will be a feature of this business really for a while which is the timing of which to ship to different customers in different regions in hydroxide business can meaningfully move the margin, revenue in any given quarter. Most of the contracts are annual contracts, but we don't necessarily ship everything to every customer on an equal basis through the year. So, we certainly, and I think we've talked about this, saw a richer mix of customers in the first half than we expect in the second half. So, if you look at our full year guidance, strip out what you saw in the first half, you'll see the impact of essentially equalizing throughout the first year. I just encourage people not to assume that the first half margin is replicable across the entire year, and instead look at our full-year guidance. Just bear in mind that almost all of our contracting is done on an annual basis. And both volumes and price are pretty much predetermined by the time we start the year. So it is simply a question of timing as to when we ship to which customer that drives some of these movements. Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.: It's all the time that we have for the call today. As always, I'm available following the call to address any questions you may have. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : Thank you. That's all the time we have for today. This concludes the FMC Corporation's second quarter 2018 earnings release conference call. Thank you.",

Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Joan Tong - Stephens, Inc. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call for FMC Corporation. Phone lines will be placed on listen-only mode throughout the conference. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer period. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Wherley, Director of Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. You may begin. Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Pierre Brondeau, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; Mark Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Pierre will review FMC's third quarter performance and provide the outlook for 2018 and the fourth quarter. Andrew will provide an overview of select financial results. All three will then address your questions. The slide presentation that accompanies our results, along with our earnings release and the 2018 outlook statement, are available on our website, and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call. Before we begin, let me remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including, but not limited to, those factors identified in our release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Q3 was another strong quarter for both businesses at the revenue and earnings level. It also was a quarter for executing on our commitments. The Ag Solutions business performed very well in a seasonally weak Q3, driving 5% pro forma sales growth, which was about 300 basis points higher than our forecast, despite an estimated 4% to 5% headwind from foreign currencies. Revenue synergy continued to boost results and demand in Brazil was very strong in the quarter. As a reminder, we do not have precise data from DuPont in 2017 to calculate exact year-over-year impact from FX, pricing, or volume, but we base our FX estimates on what we saw in our legacy businesses. In Q3, we successfully transferred to FMC delayed sites and country from the DuPont acquisition. As discussed on our last earnings calls, these transfers did result in a shift of revenue into Q4 that was in line with our expectation, but they will not result in any missed sale for the full year. There remain one more delayed transfer, a small formulation site in India, that will occur in the second half of 2019. We expect no impact on business results. On business integration is on schedule and we have begun the systematic rollout of the new SAP S/4HANA system starting with our corporate finance function. The complete rollout will be implemented by the end of 2019. On the technology front, we are on track to launch our first new active ingredient from the legacy FMC R&D pipeline in North America in the first quarter of 2019. This fungicide will be branded Lucento, and is based on the active ingredient Bixafen. Our Lithium segment performed strongly in Q3, and we successfully completed the IPO of approximately 15% of Livent Corporation on schedule last month to begin the separation of that business. Last night, we announced our intent to spin-off the remaining 85% to FMC shareholders in the form of a dividend of Livent's shares on March 1, 2019. The spin will complete the full separation and is expected to be tax-free to FMC shareholders. FMC Lithium will remain a reporting segment of FMC in the fourth quarter of this year, but will be reported as discontinued operations when we report first quarter results next year, assuming the spin is completed in March. We have significantly reduced debt this year, having paid down nearly $600 million of debt through October. Andrew will expand on this topic later on the call and describe the rationale for an announcement to buy back $200 million of FMC stocks by year-end. Our five-year strategic plan is complete and being implemented. We will share it with you at our Investor Day on December 3. We are proud that we have been able to make significant progress on all our major initiatives that we set out to accomplish at the beginning of this year, including the DuPont integration, our SAP S/4HANA implementation and the completion of the Livent IPO, while delivering strong quarterly results. Turning now to slide 3 and our third quarter results. FMC reported third quarter revenue of just over $1 billion, which was 60% higher than Q3 2017. Adjusted EPS was $0.98 in the quarter, which was $0.06 above the midpoint of our guidance and up 40% versus the same period a year ago. The guidance beat was due to the strong performance of Ag Solutions, a $0.07 beat, plus $0.01 from Lithium and $0.03 from the lower tax rate, offset somewhat by a $0.05 headwind from higher-than-expected corporate cost and other costs. Andrew will address the higher corporate cost in his section. Moving to slide 4 and Ag Solutions. Revenue of $924 million in the quarter increased 67% year-over-year on a reported basis and increased 5% on a pro-forma basis. This was driven by 17% growth of our acquired insecticide portfolio and 8% growth in our selective herbicides. We continue to capitalize on cross-selling opportunities and our global sales force delivered another impressive performance in its third full quarter with a combined portfolio. On a pro forma basis, we delivered strong top-line growth in both Latin America and North America, which more than offset lower sale in Asia and EMEA. Third quarter segment EBITDA was $216 million, increased 57% versus the earnings from the year-ago quarter and was $11 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Segment EBITDA margin was 23%, which was in line with expectations. As previously discussed, Q3 is the lowest margin quarter for many reasons. First, it is our lowest revenue quarter, yet SAR spend is flat; second, product mix shift to a higher percentage of FMC legacy products; and third, geographic mix shift to a lower contribution from our highest margin region. These elements were expected and will be seen each Q3 in the future. Turning now to slide 5. Q3 revenue growth was strong on a pro forma basis but it was mixed across the regions. North America revenue increased 32% and Latin America revenue grew 9%. Revenue in Asia dropped 4% and in Europe revenue contracted 17%. North America and EMEA are in the low season in Q3. And therefore, the relatively small absolute dollar increase or decrease creates a disproportionate percentage swing. In North America, the key driver was volume growth from Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect control. We saw continued overall expansion of the diamide portfolio. Of note was the late season growth in California on tree nuts, combined with growth in our herbicide portfolio. In EMEA, our business contracted 17% in a seasonally light quarter, which only represents about 15% of annual sales of the region. The decline was due in large part to lower herbicide application on all seed rate because of dry weather. In addition, we saw orders move into Q4 on the back of a distribution change we are making in Belgium and Holland. This change is a timing move and will not result in any lost sales. We are consequently expecting strong double-digit growth in the fourth quarter in EMEA. In Latin America, our business grew 9% on a pro forma basis despite a strong FX headwind. This performance was primarily due to strong demand in Brazil, which grew 17% on the strength of our acquired products due to our expanded market access. We have taken advantage of increased exposure to crops in the South and more broadly to existing distributors. We are cross-selling our new portfolio with an emphasis on crops such as coffee and citrus. In addition, we expect that cotton acreage will increase 25% this coming season, driving stronger sales over insecticides and herbicides portfolio which started in Q3. We also successfully implemented significant price increases across the board in Brazil. In Asia, revenue declined 4%. However, excluding a proactive restructuring of our India business, we grew revenue 2% despite significant headwinds from foreign currency. We had strong sales of our acquired insecticide portfolio in rice and soybean in India, and in rice and fruit and vegetables in Japan and Korea. Moving now to Lithium on slide 6. Lithium delivered a strong third quarter with revenue up 19% compared to Q3 last year and segment EBITDA of $49 million, 21% higher than a year ago. As a reminder, we will continue to include FMC Lithium in our segment results for the fourth quarter because FMC still owns approximately 85% of Livent Corporation, but we will limit our comments as Livent is reporting its quarterly earnings separately. When we issue fourth quarter results, you will see 15% of Livent's earnings deducted in the non-controlling interest line of our income statement, and this is reflected in our guidance. Turning to slide 7, which highlights the impact of the Livent's IPO on our EPS guidance. Excluding the adjustment for Livent, the midpoint of our guidance would still be at $6.05, exactly where it was a quarter ago. However, we now must account for the full stand-alone cost of Livent, which are a $0.03 headwind, as well as the approximately 15% minority interest deduction for Livent post IPO, which is a $0.04 headwind. Incorporating those factors, we expect adjusted earnings per share for full-year 2018 to be between $5.93 and $6.03 per share or $5.98 at the midpoint, which represents an increase of 121% versus 2017 EPS. Turning to slide 3 (sic) [slide 8], which summarizes our outlook for the full year and for the fourth quarter. We expect 2018 Ag Solution revenue will be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.26 billion. On the pro forma basis, this equates to a nearly 10% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. We also expect Ag Solutions EBITDA will be in the range of $1.195 billion to $1.215 billion, which is a raise of $5 million at the midpoint relative to prior guidance. Our expectation for the overall crop protection market has slightly improved from what we say in August. On a U.S. dollar basis, we now expect the global crop protection chemical market to be up low-single-digit in 2018. The two regional outlooks that have improved are North America, which we expect will be up low-single-digit due to more pronounced strength in herbicide; and Latin America, which we expect will be up high-single-digit with a change in forecast primarily due to recent FX-driven price increases. We still expect the market in Asia to be flat to up low-single-digit, while our European forecast is slightly more conservative. We expect it to be up low-single-digit on a U.S. dollar basis and down low-single-digit in local currencies. FMC is growing considerably ahead of the market in 2018. Increased market access in many parts of the world is one of the largest factor. First, this includes new and enhanced distribution and crop access in Brazil, particularly in the South; second, full utilization of our new super distributor model in India, resulting in more coverage; and third, full direct market access in Europe with growth in Eastern Europe and improved access in France and Benelux countries. Another growth driver is the launch of new formulations developed by the regions to respond to local customer needs. In 2018, we launched 30 formulated products, which we expect will contribute 1% point of the overall growth rate. For FMC, fourth quarter Ag Solution revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.015 billion to $1.075 billion. This revenue forecast will present a pro-forma growth rate of 12% at the midpoint for the quarter and implies 9% pro-forma growth for the second half of 2018. Segment EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $280 million to $300 million in Q4. This outlook includes an estimated $3 million to $4 million headwind for the quarter from the recent trade tariffs. We are confident in our Q4 forecast largely due to visibility in Brazil, with 85% of expected revenue in that country already booked as orders. This is a much higher level heading into the period than in previous years. We are also confident we will manage the FX headwind in Brazil with pricing and hedges. Moving over to Livent. I am just going to repeat the guidance that Livent issued last night. We expect full-year segment revenue to be in the range of $440 million to $450 million, a year-over-year increase of 28% at the midpoint. Livent decreased its full-year EBITDA forecast by $5 million at the midpoint to a range of $193 million to $197 million to account for $5 million of stand-alone costs. Q4 guidance for Livent revenue is in the range of $117 million to $127 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 8% at the midpoint, and EBITDA guidance is between $43 million and $47 million due to about $4 million of stand-alone costs. We now expect adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter to be between $1.33 and $1.43. I will now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew David Sandifer - FMC Corp.: Thanks, Pierre. I'll start this morning with a few specific income statement items then move to the balance sheet and cash flow. I'll also provide an update on the use of proceeds from the Livent IPO. Corporate expense was $29.7 million, $7.6 million above the quarterly pace of expense implied by our guidance at our last earnings call. This increase in expense was driven primarily by foreign exchange impacts on inter-company fund movements. We are currently operating in a dual IT system environment, which makes it more challenging to address currency imbalances on inter-company fund movements. While a large portion of the impact in the quarter was non-recurring, the system challenges are likely to cause some volatility in our corporate expenses on the order of plus or minus $1 million to $2 million per quarter. This variability will go away as we exit the DuPont TSA in late 2019. We estimate foreign exchange was a 4% to 5% top-line headwind in the third quarter for our Ag Solutions segment. Importantly, in Brazil, we estimate that we offset 100% of the impact of FX on earnings in Q3 through significant price increases complemented by our hedging activities. For the Lithium segment, FX had virtually no impact on revenue and with a modest tailwind to earnings in the quarter. We lowered our guidance for adjusted effective tax rate for the full year to a range of 16% to 17%, a reduction of 50 basis points at the midpoint of the range, driven by our updated forecast and the mix of earnings across various jurisdictions. The 14.6% adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter brings our year-to-date provision for taxes in line with this updated guidance. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow on slide 9, FMC generated adjusted cash from operations of $550 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, up nearly 80% compared to the prior-year period, driven by higher EBITDA. We also continue to benefit from lower working capital build for the DuPont acquisition than initially expected. Looking to the full year, we are raising our guidance for adjusted cash from operations to a range of $700 million to $750 million. Using strong cash flows from Q3, we paid down $300 million of term loan debt, ending the quarter with $2.75 billion in gross debt. This is down nearly $450 million from the beginning of the year. We completed the Livent IPO in October and FMC received net proceeds of about $320 million from the sale of 20 million shares of Livent. On October 31, we used $150 million of those proceeds to further pay down term loan debt, consistent with our commitment to reduce leverage in line with the impending loss of Livent EBITDA early next year. This increases our cumulative debt reduction this year to nearly $600 million. With debt-to-EBITDA, excluding Lithium, now below 2.5 times and consistent with our targeted solid investment-grade credit profile, we will use the remainder of the Livent IPO proceeds and other excess cash on hand to begin repurchasing FMC shares. We are launching a program to purchase $200 million of FMC shares via open market purchases by the end of this year under our existing share repurchase authorization. This initial $200 million share repurchase marks an inflection point and FMC transformation, as we move past de-leveraging from debt-funded acquisitions to generating substantial free cash flow going forward. You can expect the cash generation and its deployment are key topics we will cover at our upcoming Investor Day on December 3. With that, I'll turn the call back to Pierre. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Andrew. I could not be more pleased with where we are today. We are preparing FMC for a long period of growth, while delivering exceptional results in the short-term. We are delivering on every front, the 10% global revenue growth rate for Ag business in 2018 on a pro forma basis, much above the market, with a strong EBITDA margin close to 29%. We are flawlessly integrating the DuPont business and realizing early sales and cost synergies. We successfully completed the IPO of Livent in challenging market condition. Our SAP implementation is on track. Our cash flow is strengthening. We are paying down debt quickly and returning $200 million to our shareholders through a stock buyback. More importantly, we have a strategic plan firmly in place which leverages our core competencies, the strength of our current portfolio and our unique ability to develop short- to long-term technology. As I said before, our team is delivering on every front. I cannot wait to discuss the future of the company on December 3 with all of you. I will now turn the call back to Michael Wherley. Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.: Thank you, Pierre. As Livent has just had its own conference call, we'll keep this Q&A session focused on our Ag business, other than to answer to any potential questions you might have on the Livent separation plan. Operator, you can now begin the Q&A. Operator : And your first question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thank you. Given your new ever-evolving portfolio on a geographic and product basis, how should we think about your long-term outlooks given your newly found independence? I'm sure you guys don't want to front-run yourselves on the Analyst Day, but just how should we perceive your own thought process regarding acquired R&D platform from DuPont? And maybe just a quick comment on the strategy regarding the FMC of old, if you want to call it that, in acquiring mid- to late-stage molecules. So, just any comment on that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Thanks, Chris. I appreciate the question. But as you can guess, really discussing technology in depth would require a lot of time, which we intend to do at Investor Day. We'll have our Chief Marketing Officer and Chief Technology Officer going deep into our technology capability. What I would say is we do have, with the combination of FMC and DuPont, the DuPont business we acquired, developed a capability which is quite unique. We do have now coming from DuPont a very strong discovery organization and ability to bring new molecules, new active ingredients, new mode of actions towards development stage. FMC is bringing a formulations technology which DuPont didn't have before, enhancing the value of those active ingredients which are being developed by DuPont. Third of all, FMC and DuPont have complementary capabilities in terms of technology development and field testing in each of the region of the world, allowing us testing, data gathering, but also the fast development of formulation for local requirements. So we will describe all of these, but technology and blend of short-term, mid-term, long-term technology will be a very key driver of FMC growth in the future. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And just a quick follow-up. Just given the role for the TSA, the eventual refined corporate cost structure as well as your, let's say, greater geographically balanced portfolio with better Asian exposure, which to my understanding is better payable terms. Can you just give us any sense on just how you're thinking about your future cash flow generation versus history, especially given your relatively low maintenance CapEx requirements? Just any broad color there would be appreciated. Thank you. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yes, Chris. Broad color and as Andrew said in his comment, we want to make cash deployment a very critical topic on Investor Day. You will start to see in 2019 a significant increase in the cash generated by the company and the real step-up will be in 2020. The reason for which 2019 will be a little bit less than the following years is because we'll still have SAP implementation cost and some integration cost. Then you have a real jump into 2020 all the way to 2023. If you look at the cash we will be generating, including the structural saving which will take place with the S/4HANA implementation, if you look at the capital spend, and we'll detail that, if we look at the cash before R&D because we want to make sure we fully fund R&D for growth, you're going to get to a place where we're going to have to change the way we are returning cash to shareholders. So we'll have very significant non-allocated cash for the next few years, which we intend to return, in most part, to shareholders through dividend and stock buyback. And we'll be discussing with you this unallocated part of cash, which you will see for the size of our company is a pretty significant number, how we are deciding to do that through the regular payment of dividends and what we will do through repetitive stock buyback. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: That's great color. Thank you. Operator : Next we will go to the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. One moment. Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.: Please move to the next question if he is not available. Operator : One moment, please. Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.: Operator, please move to the next question. Operator : Yes. One moment. My computer is froze. One moment. Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hello. Can you hear me? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: We can hear you. Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Oh, thanks. Sorry about that. Yeah. Question on South America. There was a lot \u2013 you kind of round-tripped on the reais. You went from BRL 3.68 to BRL 4.10 back to BRL 3.68. How did that affect your ability to raise local currency pricing? And if you raised them at that BRL 4.10 peak, should you be able to hang on to those increased reais pricing and, hence, expand margins as you get into the fourth quarter? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yes, Don. That's a regular situation you always face when you connect your pricing to currency. I think it's an important point you're making. As we said before, on the way up when the \u2013 sorry, when the currency goes down and we are increasing price, we have a lag. We're always behind by a few percentage points. When then the currency strengthen, the same thing is happening, then we become ahead of the game because we hold the price as long as we can to the previous currency. So, needless to say that while the currency was going up quite fast all the way to BRL 4 in Brazil, the fact that we're able to take to zero impact the currency on EBITDA in the third quarter made us feeling pretty strong about our ability to move price up. And now the job you have is, as the currency strengthen, is to try to hold on to your older price as long as you can, but you will have to bring it back closer to currency as it goes. Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : And can you talk about... Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: But you'll face a lag negative at the beginning on the currency weakening and positive when the currency is strengthening. Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : And can you talk about your sales position in Brazil? How collection's been going and where are receivables by historical standards as a percentage of sales? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah, Don. It's Mark. Receivables are in very good shape and especially in Brazil. I think you know that we spent a lot of time and effort over the last couple of years really getting the quality of our business back in shape after 2015. So we feel very strong about where we are. Collections have been very good. Past dues are down at the lowest level they've been for the last three to four years. We're obviously in the season now, so we'll see how things go. But for us, we're very confident about where our receivable levels are, and more importantly so, about where our past dues are heading. Operator : Thank you. And our next question goes to the line of Daniel Jester from Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Hi. Good morning, everyone. So I think in your prepared remarks you said that you might have a couple cents of headwinds from tariffs from China. Can you just comment about, if those tariffs are sustained in 2019, just color on the order of magnitude of what that could be? And is there anything that you could do in your own supply chain to mitigate some of those costs? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I think the currency impact, if we project out our sales to 2019, to give you an order of magnitude, if tariffs stay around 10%, we believe it's going to be around a $10 million negative impact on EBITDA. If the tariffs move to a 25% range, it would be in the $30 million to $35 million impact on EBITDA. That would be if we are not successful at getting any exception. As you know, we are fighting for exemption to some of the critical raw materials of product. I cannot anticipate on how successful we will be in doing that, but the two numbers I gave to you would be the max impact. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful. And you commented on your higher market growth view for North America. I think previously you thought the North America to be down a little bit this year and now it looks like it's going to be up. Can you just dive into that? Is there something specific that's driving that change? And can you give us any broad sense as to where do you think the market could go into next year with some of the anticipated shifts in acreage that we might see between corn and soybeans? Thank you. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah, Dan. It's Mark. North America was stronger than we thought. We continued to do very well with the diamide acquisition, especially in California. I think we noted that on one of the slides. We saw it in other niche crops as well towards the end of the season. Now, of course, as Pierre said in his prepared remarks, it's a bit of a slow time in North America, so you don't need much movement to get significant percentages. I think we also saw good business with our selective herbicides based on two key molecules. We've launched some new products this year, and they've done very well going through the third quarter. So, think of the herbicide and the insecticide portfolio as doing better than we thought. Obviously, we're watching very carefully as we roll into the next season for the U.S., given where corn and soy projections are. Frankly, I think it's too early to tell where growers will go with this. We're watching it very closely. I think you do know that we have much more of an exposure to soy in the U.S. market than we do corn. Obviously, that's offset by a greater exposure in Brazil. And we know that Brazil are right in their planting season now which is going very well. We expect them to have roughly about a 3% increase in acreage for soy. So, for us, it's been a much of watch and see really. We're making sure that our supply chains are well-positioned to take any advantage of movements in the U.S. and, in particular, in Brazil. But right now, as I said, a bit too early to figure that one out. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: And one additional comment around Europe and North America, we like to repeat that. So, third quarter is a low season, so don't forget that dollars change creates significant movement in percentage, when actually it is not that big of a change. So there is a bit of the fact we're occurring at a time that Europe is only 15% of the U.S. sales. So, not as big as the percentage might indicate it. There are no... Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And the next question will come from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Thank you. I understand there's been reports recently of some corn rootworm resistance developed to the Herculex proteins, and just wanted to know whether or not that created an opportunity for you. Does your insecticide platform include some products that would control below-ground insects as a seed treatment? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Yeah, Steve. We're not in the seed treatment side, but we're very much in the in-furrow application of insecticides, especially for corn rootworm. We have also seen instances of increased infestation. We're well-positioned to take advantage of that as we go through the next season, not only with our branded product Capture LFR, which is a liquid fertilizer-ready in-furrow application, but with our new foam-applied technologies that we're introducing into the marketplace, which are much more sustainable in nature. And we'll talk more about that on Investor Day. But, yes, you're right, we are seeing instances and we're well-prepared for that with our portfolio as it stands today. Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And the recent EPA-labeled revision on dicamba has a lot of the professional applicators upset about the additional certification requirements that many of them think they're not going to be able to achieve. Is that a net benefit to your selective herbicide platform? Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Well, yeah. I mean, obviously, we don't participate in the dicamba market directly, but we do have a market-leading position in pre-emergent herbicides for soy with our Authority brand. Obviously, if we can continue to grow that franchise, if there are issues with dicamba, we will certainly take that opportunity. However, I do have to say, a lot of the new technologies of the companies that are promoting those are also promoting the use of pre-emergent herbicides as well, of which as I said we're the market leader. So we will take advantage of that. Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Sison, KeyBanc. Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Curt Siegmeyer in for Mike. I was just curious in terms of the benefits that you've seen from DuPont largely from cross-selling and some of the distribution benefits that you've talked about, what inning would you characterize us in in terms of those benefits and how should we think of that in terms of contribution to potential pipeline growth in 2019? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I think today we are growing \u2013 if you think about this year, the overall company will be growing about 9% in the business and that will due to the DuPont portfolio growing in the high-teens and maybe low-20% range, which is very fast. So, what is important for us, and we're spending a lot of time studying that, is to try to understand how much of this is very short-term synergies versus what is more sustainable synergy. We do not believe we're going to be growing the portfolio side despite (43:46-43:54) Operator : And one moment. We may have lost the main feed. (43:58-44:13) Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.: The line went dead. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: (44:15) Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.: Can you hear us? Operator : Oh, there you are. Yes, we can hear you now. Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys. Can you hear me? Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Yes. Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for that. I lost a little bit of the last part, but I'll... Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Okay. Let me give you the bottom line, okay? What we'll be discussing (45:05-45:51) Operator : And we are unable to hear. Mr. Wherley? Ladies and gentlemen, please wait one moment please. You may begin. Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.: Can you hear us? Operator : Yes. Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.: Okay. Thank you. Can we just resume with that last question from KeyBanc? Sorry about that. We have an interruption (47:32- 50:17) Operator : And you may begin. (50:19-50:49) Operator : And you may... Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.: Can you hear us, operator? Operator : Yes. I can hear you now. Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.: Okay. Let's go back in the Q&A and start with the next question. I believe it's Mark Connelly at Stephens. Joan Tong - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. How are you? This is actually Joan Tong for Mark Connelly. You guys called out Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr are one of the key drivers for the strong North America results despite weak seasonality. Can you just tell us what additional growth opportunity these products have, which geographic regions offer the best potential, or maybe perhaps talk about how deeply penetrated are these product there in the market? Hello? Operator : One moment, please. (51:44-52:01) Operator : I hear you. Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.: Can you hear us? Operator : We can hear you now. Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.: Well, if it goes blank again then we're just going to have to end the call. But let's try and answer this question. Mark, go ahead. Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.: Sure. Thanks. So, yeah, as I was saying that over 50% of the growth of the diamide products are coming from Asia. So we see growth both in Asia, in Europe, North America, and in selected parts of Brazil and Latin America. When we get to Investor Day on December the 3rd, we'll be digging into more details around why we see these products continuing to grow, what is it that makes them special in terms of their performance versus other competitive chemistries. But we do see Cyazypyr in particular, which was a later launched product, as having very good growth opportunities especially on niche crops. So, rather than going through all the details today, we'll certainly address that at the Investor Day on December the 3rd. Joan Tong - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And then just one follow-up. So, thanks for the color on the impact of the Chinese tariffs earlier. Just maybe one follow-up on China as well. So we are seeing Chinese chemical producers are facing rising environmental compliance cost. Just wondering how much of your business are being sourced in China? And also maybe longer-term, are you thinking about maybe perhaps the evolution of how you change like, how you source your raw material going forward? Would that be a more of a significant shift towards India and other part of the world? Thank you so much. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Regarding China, I mean, from a business and size of the country itself, China is one of the top 10 country in the world, but this not where the issue is for us. One of the challenges I would say we have is the supply of active ingredients and raw material for FMC as well as for most of the other Ag chemical company comes from China. So there is always two issues we are facing. One is, is the cost; and more constraint on supply there is from China, the higher the risk of the cost going up. And the other one is because of environmental reason, shutdowns, which would prevent the supply of active ingredients or raw material. So the second one is always something we're watching because if the issue happen, there is not much we can do. We've been dealing quite well with that. We are well-structured with multiple qualified suppliers for most of our products. So we have to use the flexibility of the supply chain, but is something so far we have been able to manage and expect to be able to manage without shorter paying customers in the foreseeable future. The price is something which we'll have to address. Now I have to say the cost of raw material impact in 2018 is not very significant. Just because of the way accounting work, the increase of cost is pushed into the products which then are going into inventory, and you're impacted on the cost when you sell the product. So we are currently expecting raw material pricing not to be a very significant issue in 2018, but certainly something we're going to have to watch in 2019 and, for which, we're going to have to define a very well-thought through pricing strategy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Harrison, Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.: Hi, Mike. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: Good morning, Mike. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : You didn't realize that separating Livent would lead to some potential technical difficulties on the call. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit in a little more detail about your ability to manage through the FX impact. And in particular around the hedges, I'm just wondering if there was sort of an unusual contribution from the hedges in Q4. And as we go forward through the season, maybe they get shorter-term or they get more expensive, they become less effective somehow. Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.: I'm going to ask Andrew to address the hedging process and what we've done. Now, let's put things within context. Most of the work which was done to limit the impact of currencies on our business was done through pricing. That was the biggest driver. That's where most of the work was accomplished. Now, hedging was a very interesting complementary strategy we had to protect us further. Andrew, maybe? Andrew David Sandifer - FMC Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Pierre. Mike, I think, thinking about Brazil specifically, I would not say there was an extraordinary benefit from hedging in the quarter. We did supplement our hedging approach with some additional layers of hedging in advance of orders being... (57:25-58:30) Operator : That does conclude the FMC Corporation third quarter 2018 earnings release call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call for FMC Corporation. Phone lines will be placed on a listen-only mode throughout the conference. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer period. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Wherley, Director of Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Mr. Wherley, you may begin. Michael Wherley : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Pierre Brondeau, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; Mark Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Pierre will review FMC's fourth quarter performance and provide the outlook for 2019 and the first quarter. Andrew will provide an overview of select financial results, and then all three will address your questions. The slide presentation that accompanies our results, along with our earnings release and 2019 outlook statement, are available on our Web site and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call. Finally, let me remind you that today's presentation discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including but not limited to those factors identified in our press release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion and the supporting materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations and free cash flow, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that earnings shall mean adjusted earnings and EBITDA shall mean adjusted EBITDA for all income state references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our Web site. With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre. Pierre Brondeau : Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. 2018 was a critical and very successful year for FMC. In Ag Solutions, we delivered tremendous performance in both Q4 and the full year that significantly outpaced our peers and the broader ag market. Our sales team aggressively pursued revenue synergies made possible by the limited cash overlap and the strength of a broader product portfolio. They delivered 11% pro forma sales growth for the full year posting gains in all geographies. Our entire organization executed well against our growth goal. We achieved this performance in 2018 while taking great strides toward integrating the largest acquisition in FMC\u2019s history separating Lithium business which included [indiscernible] IPO and advancing the implementation of the SAP S/4HANA platform. We also reduced debt to $500 million and completed a $200 million share repurchase program. Turning to Slide 3. FMC reported over $1.2 billion in fourth quarter revenue, including Lithium, which reflects a year-over-year increase of 24% on the reported basis and 17% on a pro forma basis. This increase was driven by strong commercial execution that enabled broad-based growth in every region in Ag Solutions along with 6% sales growth in Lithium. Adjusted EPS came in at $1.69 in the quarter, an increase of 54% year-over-year. This was $0.02 above the high end of our preannouncement from January 31, 2019 and $0.31 above the midpoint of our guidance given on our last earnings call. Slide 4 will shed some light on this outperformance. The guidance beat was due to very strong operational performance in Ag Solutions which drove $0.08 of the outperformance and lower taxes which drove another $0.21 of the gain. The lower tax was primarily driven by more favorable earnings mix by jurisdiction and to a lesser extent by the clarification of certain international tax provisions of the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We also gained $0.02 of incremental EPS from a lower share count due in large part to the repurchase of 2.4 million shares. Moving onto Ag Solutions financial results on Slide 5. Revenue of nearly $1.1 billion increased 27% year-over-year and 18% on a pro forma basis. Excluding an estimated 5% headwind from currency, the pro forma organic growth was a very strong 23% and far ahead of the market. Performance in the quarter and the year was driven by strong commercial execution and robust demand for industry leading products. Our sales organization has leveraged valuable cross-selling opportunity due to minimal customer overlap between FMC and DuPont to deliver significant sales synergies. Additionally, we reduced expected operating cost for the acquired business through accelerated functional integration, leveraging FMC back office capability and reducing manufacturing costs in legacy DuPont plants. Fourth quarter segment EBITDA of $302 million increased 35% versus a year-ago period and was $13 million above our original guidance. Our EBITDA margin for Q4 increased 160 basis points year-over-year to 27.4% and full year margin increased 560 basis points to 28.4%. Turning now to fourth quarter regional financial results on Slide 6. Q4 revenue growth was sharply up on a pro forma basis led by strong commercial performance in Latin America at 27% followed by North America at 21%, EMEA at 13% and Asia with 4%. In Latin America, price increases more than offset the effects of currency headwinds. The outperformance in the region was driven by strong demand from cotton growers in Brazil with acreage expected to be up 25% year-over-year and wheat farmers in Argentina where acreage is forecasted to grow by 5%. Robust demand for insecticides in soybean applications was also a key factor in the region. In North America, despite an expected shift in acreage away from soybean, strong demand for pre-emergent herbicides remains key to our growth. I\u2019m glad to say resistance continues to spread. We saw strong customer uptake of our pre-emergent herbicides, especially Authority Supreme that was launched last year in addition to strong sales of insecticides and new fungicides. EMEA experienced strong growth in France, Germany and Russia with the combined sales of those three countries growing 45% year-over-year. This growth was driven by the range of SU herbicides and Rynaxypyr insect control. In Asia, we continued to benefit from a commercial integration and strong demand in Pakistan, Vietnam, Philippines and Malaysia. If we exclude India restructuring, which included the discontinuation of certain products and the loss of sales from the required anti-trust divestiture in Asia, sales in the region would have grown 14% on a pro forma basis. Moving now to Lithium results on Slide 7. Lithium fourth quarter revenue was $120 million, up 6% year-over-year. Segment EBITDA came in slightly above the midpoint of guidance at $46 million in the quarter. As you most likely saw in a separate press release yesterday, FMC\u2019s board of directors has officially declared the spin of remaining stake in Livent to FMC shareholders which will occur on March 1, 2019. This will complete the separation process. Please refer to that press release posted on fmc.com for details. Looking ahead at our 2019 outlook on Slide 8, as we discussed in the prerelease on January 31, 2019 earnings per diluted share are expected to be $5.55 to $5.75. This represents an 8% at the midpoint over recast 2018, excluding Lithium and the impact of any share repurchases in 2019. All comparative values from 2018 will now exclude the Lithium business entirely. Shortly after the spin on March 1, we will file an 8-K with recast 2018 results that slip out the Lithium business. We expect 2019 revenue for FMC will be in the range of $4.45 billion to $4.55 billion. That\u2019s 5% at the midpoint year-over-year versus 2018 recast sales. Excluding an expected 3% FX headwind, organic sales growth estimate is 8% at the midpoint. We also expect total company EBITDA of $1.165 billion to $1.205 billion which represent 7% growth at the midpoint versus 2018 recast results. As a reminder, in 2019, our EBITDA guidance includes all corporate expenses. We will no longer delineate between Ag segment results and corporate expenses as we had in the past when we had multiple segments. FMC first quarter revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.18 billion to $1.21 billion which represent growth of 8% at the midpoint. Excluding an expected 6% FX headwind, organic sales growth estimate for Q1 is 14% at the midpoint. We are also forecasting EBITDA of $320 million to $340 million in Q1 which will be flat year-over-year at the midpoint. This is despite significant FX and raw material cost headwinds. We expect first quarter EPS to be in a range of $1.58 to $1.68, up 3% versus recast results from Q1 2018. Our 2019 expectation for the overall global crop protection market growth is that it will be flat to up low-single digits. We expect North America, EMEA and Asia will also be flat to up low-single digits driven by a variety of factors and Latin America will grow in the low to mid-single digits. In North America, growth will come from an increase in corn acreage and normalized pest pressures. In Latin America, Brazil is experiencing dry weather in important soybean and corn area to start the year, but we expect this will be offset by favorable climate conditions in Argentina and another strong soybean season across the region next fall. In EMEA, we expect recovery of the winter and spring cereals area and strong cereals pricing. Asia is expecting strong growth driven by a more normal monsoon season in India as well as a recovery from the drought in Australia. We expect that FMC\u2019s above market growth in 2019 will be driven by the continued strength in global demand for diamides, pre-emergent herbicide growth, sales expansion in Brazil, SU herbicide growth in key European countries as well as new product introductions. These new products will account for approximately $60 million to $70 million or 1.5% in incremental sales growth in 2019. In our third largest country India, which had over $300 million in sales in 2018, we\u2019re expecting strong top line growth in 2019 from our insecticide portfolio as well as new applications over herbicide portfolio in sugarcane. A well structured, super distributor network in India drives increased market excess and demand generation further lowers credit at-risk and requires less working capital while increasing profitability. Earlier this year, we launched our first new active ingredient from the legacy FMC R&D pipeline, Lucento fungicide in time for the 2019 growing season in North America. Our R&D organization also reached secondary important milestones since our Investor Day in December. We advanced one of our insecticide active ingredients out of discovery phase and into the development pipeline. Launch for this product continues to be expected in 2026. This means we still have six AIs in our development pipeline after launching Lucento commercially. We will continue to update you with progress within our investment pipeline on future calls. As you can see from this full year 2019 EBITDA bridge on Slide 9, the headwinds from FX and higher raw material costs are significant factors in 2019. The full year headwind from FX is expected to be 7% at the EBITDA level plus another 10% headwind from higher costs for raw materials representing a total of about $190 million. We expect price increases will offset the $130 million of this combined headwind or approximately 70%. Turning to Slide 10. The first quarter EBITDA bridge reflects the pressure on profitability as we begin the year. Q1 headwinds from FX are expected to be 15% at the EBITDA level plus another 18% headwind from raw material costs representing a total of about $110 million in headwinds. We expect price increase in Q1 will offset $65 million or about 60% of these headwinds. We will absorb about half of this full year impact from raw material costs in Q1 alone. The impact will diminish significantly in the second half of the year. Likewise, about two-thirds of the full year headwind to EBITDA from FX is expected to occur in Q1 and this is also expected to diminish greatly in the second half. Our plans to affect a large part of these adverse costs with price increase throughout the year are in place and the execution is taking place as we speak. I will now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks, Pierre. There\u2019s a lot to cover this morning, so let me start with a few specific income statement items for 2018. I\u2019ll then move on to the yearend balance sheet, cash flow, share count and finish with a few comments on the 2019 outlook. Foreign exchange had a meaningful negative impact on fourth quarter Agricultural Solutions revenue estimated at approximately 5%. We believe its impact was more than offset by our price increases in the quarter. For the full year, we estimate FX was an approximately 2% headwind on Ag Solutions revenue. In the Lithium segment, FX was a modest headwind to revenue in the quarter and the full year. Corporate expense was $28.4 million for the quarter, $4 million higher than implied by guidance given our last earnings call. There were several drivers of this variance including a higher than anticipated year-end LIFO inventory valuation adjustment reflecting continued raw material price increases, higher health and welfare benefits expense and to a much lesser extent than in the third quarter foreign exchange impacts on intercompany fund movements. Interest expense was $1 million higher for the quarter than guided with higher than expected commercial paper balances throughout the quarter due to higher working capital. Our tax rate for full year 2018 came in much better an anticipated at an effective annual rate of 13.7%. The primary driver of the outperformance was the earnings mix by jurisdiction that was substantially improved versus our forecast with more profit being earned in lower tax jurisdictions than expected. Also contributing to a lesser extent to the lower 2018 tax rate was the impact of the proposed regulations released in the fourth quarter related to U.S. and international tax provisions. This resulted in a less unfavorable impact than projected for global low tax intangible income also referred to as GILTI. The 5.1% effective tax rate in the fourth quarter is a result of bringing our full year provision for income taxes in line with the full year rate. We took $106 million non-cash charge against GAAP earnings to adjust our environmental reserves to reflect the recent agreement and principle reached with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation that would among other things settle past costs and govern remediation of historical contamination within a defined area attributed to FMC\u2019s Middleport, New York operations. Upon finalization, this settlement will resolve a significant portion of the issues related to the Middleport site and provide FMC with certainty of the cash outflows required to support these liabilities. The cash outflows specified in the pending agreement will be capped and are well within the assumptions we\u2019ve made for ongoing cash spending on legacy expenses. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Gross debt at December 31 was $2.7 billion, down more than $500 million from the beginning of 2018. Gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA, excluding Lithium, was 2.4x consistent with our long-term target of 2.5x or less. Now turning to Slide 11, FMC generated adjusted cash from operations of $576 million in 2018, up 47% compared to the prior year. Adjusted cash from operations was lower than expected in the fourth quarter as growth in working capital as well as higher legacy and transformation expenses more than offset better than expected EBITDA. Working capital was higher than expected in both Agricultural Solutions and Lithium. For Agricultural Solutions, higher working capital was driven by stronger than expected sales in the quarter and recovering inventory levels due to the faster than expected returns of full production from our China toll manufacturing partners. We continue to monitor our inventory and safety stock levels very closely as we move past this period of uncertainty in China. Transformation expenses were higher than expected, primarily due to timing of spending on our SAP implementation. In early December, we completed the $200 million share repurchase program announced on our November earnings call purchasing 2.4 million shares at an average price of $81.97 per share. Looking ahead now to 2019, as Pierre mentioned, FMC expects meaningful FX headwinds to revenue growth, particularly in the first half of the year. Interest expense should be roughly in line with 2018. We expect our effective tax rate to be between 14% and 16% for 2019 based on our current forecast for earnings by jurisdiction and our evolving understanding of the implications of the newly proposed regulations governing taxation of foreign income. As Pierre also noted earlier, we anticipate full year 2019 earnings per share to be between $5.55 and $5.75 with first quarter 2018 earnings per share to be between $1.58 and $1.68. We are in the process of developing fully re-casted financials for 2018 to remove all impact to the Lithium business to provide a clean year-on-year comparison for EPS and other metrics. Due to the complexity in involving interpretation of the 2017 U.S. tax law, it will be March before we can provide fully re-casted financials for 2018. At present, we estimate that like-for-like earnings per share growth removing all impacts of the Lithium business is 8% for full year 2019 and 3% for the quarter. Slide 12 shows a summary of our 2019 cash flow outlook laid out in generally the same way we discussed cash flow at our December Investor Day. FMC expects to generate adjusted cash from operations of $750 million to $850 million in 2019. With capital spending expected to be in the range of $140 million to $160 million for 2019 as well as with legacy and transformation costs in the range of $200 million to $250 million, we expect to generate free cash flow of $375 million to $475 million. This suggest free cash flow conversion from adjusted earnings to be in the range of 50% to 60%, a significant improvement though not yet at our target conversion rate of greater than 78%. This is due to continued legacy and transformation expenditures in 2019 and particular cost to complete our SAP implementation. With this growing cash flow and improving cash conversion, we will continue to regularly purchase shares through 2019. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 1.25 million shares at an average price of $79.84 for a total of approximately $100 million. We intend to purchase a total of up to $500 million of FMC shares in 2019, inclusive of $100 million already completed. FMC expects to maintain gross debt at 2.5x trailing EBITDA for full year 2019. You should expect some variation quarter-to-quarter due to the seasonality of cash generation relative to our desire to be consistent purchasers of FMC shares through 2019. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Pierre. Pierre Brondeau : Thank you, Andrew. All is in place for FMC to deliver a strong 2019 as a pure play agricultural sciences company with above market growth. Quarterly earnings in 2019 will be atypical because of cost pressure in the first half of the year. The first quarter itself will see nearly 60% of the full year raw material costs increase and FX impact. Q2 will continue to see strong headwinds with relief in the second half of the year. We are highly confident in our ability to recover a large part of these adverse costs through the year and deliver 5% revenue growth with 7% EBITDA growth. Our high confidence is driven by the current work on price increases, which is going well and the fact that cost pressure from raw materials will decrease considerably in the second half of the year. We are also highly confident that we will deliver EPS growth of at least 8%. I will now turn the call back to Michael Wherley. Michael Wherley : Thank you, Pierre. As Livent has just had its own conference call, we\u2019ll keep this Q&A session primarily focused on our Ag business. Operator, you can now begin the Q&A. Operator : Okay. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Christopher Parkinson : Thank you. Can you give us a quick update on just active ingredient procurement and how the Chinese market evolved in '18? What your key assumptions are in '19? And just any longer-term thoughts you have on your global procurement? Thank you. Pierre Brondeau : Yes. Right now as I said in the previous remarks, we are in a good place from supply of active ingredients from China all over units as well as all over toll processors currently functioning, and we were able to quickly rebuild the safety stock which are needed for us to operate and we\u2019re able to do all of that at a faster pace than expected in the fourth quarter. From a situation in China today, there is still the same pressure around environmental issues, but it is I must say calmer and more organized approach. I think this approach which was a bit at time surprising with one bad actor [ph] in an industrial park and everybody shutdown is going away to a much more targeted and rationale approach. So right now the situation has changed. It is also one of the reasons for which we have so much certainty around our ability to deliver on targeted earnings for the year is because we have a very good view of raw material active ingredient price increase which will be in the first year, but we already have the contacts in place for what will be coming into manufacturing in the first half and sell in the second half in terms of pricing. So all of that is very clear now for the year. From a strategy standpoint, as Mark has said many times before, China remains very important to our active ingredient supply but we are looking at diversification in the U.S., increasing the capacity of some of our plants in Europe where we do have active ingredient plant also and capability, we\u2019re increasing our ability to supply from there and also India. So yes, we will tend to diversify our active ingredient supply in the future. Christopher Parkinson : That\u2019s great color. And just as a quick follow up, given your current portfolio pipeline as well as the existing product suite, can you just comment on your existing perception of your competitive positioning versus from your larger peers? And then also just quickly comment on your willingness to purchase and/or trade for third party molecules? Thank you. Mark Douglas : Yes, Chris, when you look at our pipeline we predominately showed in December, we feel very confident that the pipeline we have stacks up extremely well with anybody else in the industry. When you think about having six products in development, that means within the next few years those six products are going to come to market, three within our five-year plan timeline, the first one already out this year. And then the 16 products that we have in discovery that continue to evolve and as Pierre said in the script, we moved one of those discovery molecules which is an insecticide into development. That\u2019s a very good sign that when we make those strategic decisions moving from discovery to development that\u2019s when we start to spend significant amounts of money. So we\u2019re very confident that that new insecticide will hit the market mid next decade. So we feel very good about where our pipeline is but more importantly we feel good about what is coming through into that pipeline from discovery. We have a tremendous amount of new leads that we\u2019re developing down in Stine and I fully expect that that discovery pipeline will continue to expand over the next few years. Christopher Parkinson : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Stephen Byrne : Yes, curious as to what your full year revenues were in 2018 for the Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr and how did that compare versus [indiscernible] what were the key drivers and any other new formulations in development that incorporate those active ingredients to expand the patent life? Pierre Brondeau : You cut off a little bit on the second part of your question, so I\u2019m going to answer the first part and then if you don\u2019t mind to repeat the second part. On the first part, what we are doing is trying to measure the legacy FMC and the legacy DuPont business and look at the year-on-year growth. So we believe that the legacy DuPont business on the like-for-like basis, on the pro forma basis was for the total portfolio but mostly driven by Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr but also including Indoxacarb and the SUs, the growth rate was north of 20% most likely in the 25% range while the FMC portfolio was more in the low to mid-single digit. Now you always have to be very careful because we have pushed a lot of sales cannibalizing FMC sales with DuPont sales because of the quality of some of the products and the profitability of this product. So it is not exactly a like-for-like, but I would say north of 20% for the DuPont and low to mid-single digit for FMC. Could you repeat the second part of your question? Stephen Byrne : Yes, sure, Pierre. Sorry about that. I was asking about any new formulations that include Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr to extend the patent life on those active ingredients and maybe I\u2019ll couch that in a broader question of the present value of your pipeline being fairly insecticide heavy because of the potential for mutation-driven demand increases and more difficulty being disintermediated by seed-based insecticides, just wanted your views on that. Pierre Brondeau : Sure. Let me start around mixture and then I\u2019ll move that to Mark who will give you details. But absolutely we do have a full strategy around mixtures and signed the right partners for Rynaxypyr sales. First of all for normal growth and that\u2019s what we do at FMC. We use formulations for growth but also for our patent extension strategy. Now you do not see these formulations impacting '19 sales or even '20 because every time you do create those new formulations you do have to go to the full registration process. So depending upon the countries and the regions, it could be from two years to four, five years. So that is the process we are going through. All of these products are currently in development with a very active portfolio. Mark, you want to add a couple of things. Mark Douglas : Yes. Steve your question around the insecticides versus the rest of the portfolio for us, yes. When you look at our portfolio, we\u2019re one of the world leaders in terms of insecticides and we\u2019re very happy with that situation. Pest pressure continues to expand around the world, especially in Asia. But if you look at our pipeline, if you think of the development molecules, they\u2019re all fungicides and herbicides. And then a few were the exception of the new insecticide we just put into development. If you look at the discovery pipeline of 16 molecules, 11 of them are herbicides and fungicides. So as we\u2019ve talked about many times, we\u2019re very active from a discovery and development perspective to rebalance that portfolio. And of course, we are talking to other parties around expanding the use of fungicides and herbicides. So I\u2019m very confident that we have the right programs in place to help sort of rebalance or continue to grow the portfolio, but I\u2019m not unhappy with where we are within insecticides right now. Stephen Byrne : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Jester with Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Jester : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just a few questions on the quarter. First, in Latin America, was there any benefit in terms of pull-forward? I think the soybean season in Brazil this year was pretty quick, so any benefit in the fourth quarter from that? And then on Europe, you called out very strong sales in France, Germany and Russia, much, much higher than the segment overall. Were there any countries that were particularly weak in Europe in the fourth quarter? Pierre Brondeau : Listen, really your question in North America around pulling \u2013 and I think the question for us would apply to any region of the world. There was a very strong performance of all of our regions from a growth standpoint, even including Asia. It does not look like there was a very strong pull, but we do believe customers were anxious to procure our product. They have all heard about the tension around China, even if they all understand today that it is quite stable. So could there be some? I couldn\u2019t say no. But in all regions, we saw very healthy sales, especially in Latin America. Slight pull by customers to make sure they will be supplied, possible, but nothing which jumped at us in Latin America. Daniel Jester : And then with regards -- Pierre Brondeau : Yes, Mark is going to give you on Europe. Mark? Mark Douglas : Yes, you\u2019re right. In Europe, France, Germany, Russia were very strong for us. Good mix. I would say from a weakness perspective, the UK was certainly weak, certain parts of southern Europe as well but far outweighed by the other areas. And I have to say the other areas are growing very quickly, mainly because of the things we\u2019ve done over the last few years with direct market access. That\u2019s been an important element of our growth in Europe, continues to be so. And certainly in France, where we now have a much stronger presence with a much broader portfolio, we see them growing very well. Pierre Brondeau : One additional statement around your question around Latin American and potential pull, I can guarantee you that following our experience in 2016, we are keeping a very, very close eye on inventory and we are doing a physical check of our inventory at customers, at distributors and in-house. And we are in a good place today with a very normal inventory level in the supply chain of FMC products. Daniel Jester : Thank you. That\u2019s really helpful. And then on your 2019 guidance, you have 8% organic growth and you commented that the market is only going to be up low-single digits. So you\u2019re certainly outgrowing the market at a very brisk pace in 2019. Can you comment about what regions you think that you have the best shot to outgrow the market or where you may be taking incremental share? Thank you. Mark Douglas : Yes, first of all, Asia. Asia is one of the fastest growing parts of the world, especially in India. We have a very good market access model in India. The portfolio has grown. We\u2019re introducing some of our herbicides from around the world. We have a new formulation in India, which is a mixture of Sulfentrazone and Clomazone, which has specifically targeted the sugarcane industry where we\u2019ve not had herbicide growth before, but we have tremendous market access. So we\u2019re very confident that we\u2019re going to see that business grow. And then I would shift to parts of Latin America. Argentina last year was a very down market. We continue to see growth with insecticides but also with our pre-emergent herbicides. And then Brazil; we continue to take share in soy with our insecticide portfolio, not just the acquired diamide portfolio but the FMC formulations as well. And then I would say in parts of Europe where we see that strong market access and growth. Daniel Jester : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead. Don Carson : Thank you. Pierre, a question on your 23% organic growth in pro forma in 2018. What was the price/volume break out there? And as you look to your 8% organic growth in 2019, what are you expecting on price versus volume? Pierre Brondeau : In \u2013 you\u2019re talking about 2018 versus 2017 or 2019 versus 2018? Don Carson : Well, first, in 2018, you had 23% pro forma growth, ex-FX. What was the price/volume breakout on that? Pierre Brondeau : Understand that we cannot do a breakout of price/volume on a year-on-year because we can only do it on the FMC product and most of the growth came from the DuPont product. We do not have the information to do EBITDA year-on-year or volume/price mix on the DuPont products. So we believe a very large part of what we did was driven by volume and most of the price increase was focused on Latin America to overcome the currency. But we do not have a geological, like we have for '19, geological breakdown. Don Carson : And how about for that 8% in '19, what would be price versus volume? Pierre Brondeau : So '19, what we have is for the full year we believe we\u2019re going to have an FX impact of about negative 3%. We\u2019re going to have a price mix \u2013 on revenues, I\u2019m talking, okay \u2013 the price mix of about positive 3% and a volume of 5%. Don Carson : Okay. Pierre Brondeau : So your price mix offsetting your FX. If you go to EBITDA, the drivers are a bit different because of course you have FX and costs, but volume would be on your EBITDA growth driving 9%. Don Carson : Okay. And then finally, last year you were quite aggressive. You changed your policy on hedging sales in Latin America. Are you continuing with that policy of basically hedging the full sale as soon as you book the order? Pierre Brondeau : Actually, let me take that opportunity about the question to elaborate a little bit why we have a bit of a very high confidence around our target despite the fact that a lot of the earnings are coming into the second half. First, to answer your question on currency, we\u2019re taking the forward values for currency and we have a very significant part of our currency exposure which is hedged, like every year. So we have the same hedging process we have every year in place. And like last year, we\u2019re going to make a decision I would say most likely in the next four weeks, if we do the additional hedging for Brazil. If you would ask me to guess right now, I would say yes, most likely we\u2019re going to go with the same approach for Brazil as we did last year. There is a little upfront cost but we believe it\u2019s giving us much more certainty. So I feel pretty strong around hedging. The current programs we have in place and the next one we\u2019re going to most likely take for Brazil will put us in a very predictable situation. For the raw materials, which is the other part, we saw the increase which is primarily I think the first half coming from raw materials which we have contracted and use in manufacturing last year. Those are the products which are sold in the first half. What we have procured and contracted for the second half is already done at a pricing which is lower than what we saw in the first half and actually pretty neutral versus the prior year. So we have a very strong visibility around our costs in the second half of the year. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : Hi. Good morning, fellows, and a nice end to the year. Pierre, I want to expand upon that raw material headwind and I like the description that you pretty much have already contracted for your raw materials for the first half of the year, so you know what the headwind is going to be and then it seems like you already contracted for the second half of the year at a much lower rate. But what are the key drivers there, because I don\u2019t normally think of FMC\u2019s Ag business as being very raw material driven. So can you help explain why we\u2019re seeing the big swings here on the raw material front? What are the key factors there? Pierre Brondeau : Yes. Actually, Frank, it\u2019s a good question. I should have said that. It\u2019s a very simple factor. It\u2019s supply from China. The specialty chemical industry for the ag industry is mostly coming from China. China went to a pretty abrupt approach to the environmental issues last year, which created a lot of shutdown and shortage on raw material supply and active ingredients supply. Those were the products we were procuring at that time to manufacture them in the end of 2018 and sell them in the first half of 2019. Now, everything has been reorganized. The shutdowns are not so visible or high than they were last year. The supply has normalized. There is less emergency shipment. So we are much more back to a normal situation. So the products which are being contracted and sold now are contracted under a normal supply from China. So we are back to a normal level of inventory, normal supply and back to normal quantity available which gets the price back to normal. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly : Thank you. I\u2019ll keep it to one. Can you remind us of how working capital is going to change from here once everything with the DuPont acquisition is settled through the system and your product launches are settling in too? I\u2019m particularly interested in how seasonality might shift a little bit. Andrew Sandifer : Hi, Mark. It\u2019s Andrew. I think certainly 2018 is a bit abnormal in terms of working capital growth because as you point out when we acquired the DuPont business, we bought inventory but we didn\u2019t receive \u2013 get receivables or payables with that. So we had to build up receivables and payables to normal levels to support the acquired DuPont business. As we look through to 2019, we would expect to see working capital as a use of cash normalize with incremental working capital in the 20% to 25% of sales kind of range. I do think you have to think about the seasonality of working capital a bit. And certainly from a cash generation perspective, it\u2019s not even during the year; Q2 and Q3 being very strong cash generative quarters. Let me let Mark talk a little bit more specifically about some of the other seasonality elements. Mark Douglas : Yes, Mark, it\u2019s a good question. The business has changed a lot over the last few years. I\u2019ll throw some numbers out for you just so you can get a feel for how 2018 played out. And 2019 is probably going to be pretty similar so this is I would guess a new norm for us. If you look by region, North America has about 60% of the revenue in the first half of the year. Latin America has 70% in the second half of the year. Europe has 70% in the first half and Asia has about 55% to 60% in the first half. So you can see we have some very big swings in terms of where our business comes from. And as Andrew said, that is obviously going to impact what you see on a quarterly and semiannual basis. So just bear those numbers in mind and I would say 2019 will be very similar to that going forward. Mark Connelly : That\u2019s super. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you. Good morning. On Slide 9, you\u2019re showing cost and other part of the EBITDA bridge for 2019 at 150 million headwind. Is it fair to assume that this is mostly the raw materials headwind? And also if prices have now fully reversed, is it fair to assume that we could see a similar positive item on the 2020 EBITDA bridge? Pierre Brondeau : I will say yes and yes. I think the 150 is all cost. And certainly especially in the first half when we\u2019re going to move to 2020, we should have a very favorable year-on-year comparison because as far as we see today with a more normalized situation from the supply standpoint, we will not have in the first half of 2020 the raw material headwind. So we\u2019re going to like our comp in the first half of 2020 much better than we do right now. Aleksey Yefremov : Great. Thank you, Pierre. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Mike Sison : Hi, guys. You have a really strong start to the first quarter in terms of volume growth. It implies that one of the other quarters will be a little bit less than the outlook for the full year. Can you maybe just walk us through some of the seasonality again in the business on a quarterly basis and maybe just what we need to keep an eye on as the year unfolds? Mark Douglas : Yes, Mike, it\u2019s Mark. Similar to what I just answered the other question with regarding the seasonality in the halves, if you looked at Q3 in 2018, it was our slowest quarter. You\u2019ll see that similar trend again. It won\u2019t really change. Q1, Q2 are the highest quarters followed by Q4 and then Q3. You should not expect to see that change. There shouldn\u2019t be material shifts unless there is some major weather impact in one of the regions. People are talking about what\u2019s going to happen in North America this year. Will the spring come early? Will it come late? Well, obviously planting occurs right around that Q1/Q2 border. So who knows? We plan for a normal year when we do our forecasting. Same thing in Brazil with late September being the planting season, that swings between Q3 and Q4. So those are the kind of bridges you have to watch for. Mike Sison : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy, Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Kevin McCarthy : Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment on the expected contribution margin in 2019 associated with your volume growth projection of 5%. The reason I ask is if I look at Slide 9 on the lower right, you show the 5% and on the upper right it seems as though the attached EBITDA benefit is 12%, which seems to imply a very high contribution margin of, I don\u2019t know, 65%, 70%. So I guess my question is, is that correct? And if so, what is driving that or perhaps there are other factors baked into there? Pierre Brondeau : No, I think you\u2019re correct. I think usually contribution margin \u2013 it\u2019s going to depend which region and which product, but quite a few of our insecticides or other products do have a profit on sales which is north of 60%. And when you\u2019re growing, because we are not adding resources, it drops straight to the EBITDA line, to the earnings line. Now we don\u2019t see it in the full P&L this year as we should, because of the FX and raw material issue but your calculation is correct. Kevin McCarthy : That\u2019s fantastic. Thank you so much. Pierre Brondeau : And also our regular earnings, we have on some of the growing product line. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Mike Harrison : Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me okay? Pierre Brondeau : Yes. Mike Harrison : Thanks. You talked about your ability to grow faster than the underlying market in Asia, Latin America and Europe. It seems like you forgot an important region in North America. Can you maybe talk about how you expect to grow in North America relative to underlying markets that might be flat to up slightly? Mark Douglas : Yes, thanks, Mike. I\u2019m certainly not intending to leave North America out of the mix given the scale of its importance to us. I think you\u2019re going to see a couple of areas where we continue to grow. First of all, the whole pre-emergent herbicide space; I think you know that we have a very large position in that area. We\u2019re introducing new products and cannibalizing our own product range, which allows us to lift up value to distribution, retail and growers while introducing new technologies to us which allows us to keep ahead of the competition. So that\u2019s one area. Second area is obviously our insecticide portfolio and when you look at our growth in specialty and niche crops in California and Florida, that\u2019s an area that we see as significant potential for us. And then the third one that we don\u2019t talk a lot about but is quietly growing for us and nicely so is our herbicide portfolio in the corn segment. We are introducing new products there. You\u2019ll see us continue in that area. It helps our balance with soy especially in a year like this where there may be swings between soy and corn. And then last but not least, obviously fungicides. We\u2019re introducing a brand new fungicide. We have two others that are growing nicely on more niche crops. So I think if you take those areas together, you\u2019ll see us continue to outpace the market in the U.S. and Canada. Mike Harrison : All right. Thanks very much. Operator : And the last question that we have time for will come from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Laurence Alexander : Hi. Just a quick one. Are you seeing any \u2013 in your discussions with regulators any shift in how they\u2019re thinking about insecticide legacy effects or lingering effects or the duration of insecticide effectiveness, particularly in Europe? Mark Douglas : No. Laurence, listen, the regulatory environment that we work in is an extremely stringent one anyway. You\u2019re not allowed mixtures of insecticides in Europe. The neonics have been removed in Europe and that\u2019s created opportunities for more targeted insecticides, like our diamides. So we\u2019re not seeing anything that I would say is out of the ordinary with regards to insecticides. In fact, I could argue that the technology players that are introducing newer, more targeted chemistries will continue to take market share in those markets. Laurence Alexander : And in the past when those kind of impulses have happened, is it about a 5 to 10-year kind of tailwind or is it faster than that that the market shifts? Mark Douglas : Sorry, what was the first part, Laurence? I couldn\u2019t quite get that. Laurence Alexander : When such regulatory shifts have happened in the past where a class is taken off the market, can players like yourselves who have the newer products, does the shift happen fairly quickly over three, four years or is it more of a 5 to 10-year kind of transition? Mark Douglas : It tends to be more quicker depending on the space of which the product is removed by the regulatory authorities. If it\u2019s very quick, then obviously growers need something that they can use to combat the pest pressures. You can step into those spaces rather quickly. But it does generally take that four to five-year timeframe to get the whole market moving. Laurence Alexander : Perfect. Thank you. Michael Wherley : Thanks. That\u2019s all the time we have for the call today. As always, I\u2019m available following the call to address any additional questions you may have. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the FMC Corporation conference call. Thank you.",

Phone lines will be placed on a listen-only mode throughout the conference. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer period. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Wherley, Director of Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Mr. Wherley, you may begin. Michael Wherley : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Pierre Brondeau, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; Mark Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Pierre will review FMC's first quarter performance and provide the outlook for 2019 and the second quarter. Andrew will provide an overview of select financial results, and then all three will then address your questions. The slide presentation that accompanies our results, along with our earnings release and 2019 outlook statement, are available on our website and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call. Finally, let me remind you that today's presentation and discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including but not limited to those factors identified in our press release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion and the supporting materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations and free cash flow, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that earnings shall mean adjusted earnings and EBITDA shall mean adjusted EBITDA for all income statement references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre. Pierre Brondeau : Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. As you so you know earnings release FMC continued to outperform the market as we have for the past six quarters. We're especially pleased with the strong volume growth. This in addition to a price increase in all regions, as well as cost control which led to a strong top and bottom line results. Our outperformance relative to the market is driven by three key elements, balanced our geographic exposure, the strength of a product portfolio, and finally, a diverse crop exposure. Turning to Slide 3. FMC reported $1.2 billion in the first quarter revenue, which reflects a year-over-year increase of 8% on a reported basis and 14%, excluding FX headwinds. This increase was driven by strong commercial execution that enabled growth in every region. Adjusted EBITDA was $343 million, an increase of 4% compared to recast financials from the year ago period, and $13 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Company EBITDA margins were nearly 29%, despite $95 million in combined headwinds from raw material costs and foreign currencies. Adjusted EPS was $1.72 in the quarter, an increase of 9% versus recast Q1 2018 and $0.09 above the midpoint of our guidance. The strong EPS was driven by higher volume price increases and product mix. Moving now to first quarter revenue analysis on slides 4. Q1 revenue grew by 8% with volume contributing 9% growth and price mix another 5% growth, for a total of 14% organic growth. This was offset partially by a 6% headwind from FX. Performance in the quarter was driven by strong commercial execution and demand for a product which led to above market growth. The strongest growth came from Latin America at 30%, followed by North America at 7%, EMEA at 3% and Asia at 1 - with 1%. Excluding foreign currency headwinds, organic growth was even stronger with Latin America up over 40%, EMEA up 11% and Asia up 8%. Although Q1 is a seasonally smaller quarter of the year in Latin America, the outperformance was broad based. Overall we evolved infestation [ph] increased acreage drove strong demand - demand in Brazil for a dozen insecticide. Demand for herbicides and insecticide in sugarcane, as well as robust demand for insecticide in soybean applications were also key contributors to the growth. Price increases in the region offset nearly all the impact of FX on both the top and bottom lines. Over the past three years we have implemented the discipline channel inventory management system in Brazil, so that we can maintain visibility on inventory levels of FMC products throughout our distribution channels. The FMC sales team conducts monthly check of all third party warehouses, retailers and growers and then capture the data in our inventory tracking system  These data indicates that channel inventories of FMC products are low and in line with levels typically expected during this time of the year, despite very strong growth in 2018 and in Q1 2019. In North America despite the weather issues in the quarter that caused a late start to the season and an expected shift in acreage away from soybeans demand for pre emergent herbicides remain one of the growth drivers. I\u2019m glad to say resistance continues to spread. We saw good customer uptake of our pre-emergent herbicides, especially Authority Supreme herbicide that was launched last year. We saw robust sales over [indiscernible] insect control for fruit and vegetables applications, including as a core insect control for peanuts and same in some herbicide and Topguard EQ fungicide also had strong sales. Also in North America in Q1 we launched a first new active ingredient from the legacy FMC R&D pipeline, new central [PH] fungicide. It is gaining traction already in corn, soybean and peanut applications and such as true launch suggests we can reach big sales of $30 million to $50 million sooner that we use to expect. Growth in EMEA was driven by favorable weather with very strong sales in Turkey in south western Europe, as well as new direct market access in Belgium and the Netherlands. Our diamide products, including Coragen, [indiscernible] insect control had robust demand across the region and pricing actions help offset a significant portion of the FX headwind. In Asia, we saw double-digit growth in Pakistan, China, Japan and Southwest Asia. China's growth was led by diamide products, including Coragen and bonide [ph] insect control. In India we are seeing the benefits of a commercial restructuring last year as we are gaining sales traction across more of the portfolio. In addition to reviewing regional business, I would like to highlight our Plant Health business which is globally managed with financial results embedded in all the regions. It consists of biological, micronutrient and seek treatment product and continues to grow over 20% per year. This part of our portfolio is approaching revenues of $200 million in 2019. Slide 5 shows the balance of revenue across geographies and crops. From a geographic standpoint, our revenue is spread nearly equally in four regions, which provides a natural edge against the effect of microeconomic and weather events in the region or country. These types of event impact our industry on a regular basis. Our geographic diversity provides a certain amount of insulation from specific events as we have demonstrated during the recent flooding in parts of the US and the drought in Australia. As you can see on the right side of this line, the spread of FMC revenue in each region across the four quarters of the year is relatively balanced in North America and Asia. While the seasonality in EMEA and Latin America are complementary. This means we have a meaningful revenue contribution from three regions every quarter of the year, which also gives us some protection from adverse events in one region or country. When considering crop exposure 60% of FMC revenue is in a wide variety of how use value in these crops with the remainder of the revenue in raw crops. FMC does not rely too heavily on any one crop or any one region making a performance more predictable and sustainable. Turning now to Slide 6. First quarter EBITDA was $343 million, up 4% versus recast results from Q1 2018. Strong demand led to a year-over-year volume increase of $55 million of EBITDA. We achieved price increases in all regions which contributed $53 million to year-over-year EBITDA growth with a stronger contribution from EMEA and Latin America. Volume and price together more than offset the headwinds from relative [ph] costs and FX which totaled $95 million shares in the quarter. Looking ahead to 2019 outlook on Slide 7. Given the strong performance in Q1 and more clarity on the outlook for the year, we are raising our guidance for 2019 revenue EBITDA and EPS. We expect 2019 revenue for FMC will be in the range of $4.5 million to $4.6 billion, up $50 million at a midpoint versus programs and reflecting 6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint versus 2018 recast sales. Excluding a forecasted 3% FX headwind, organic sales growth estimate is now 9% at the midpoint. We also expect total company EBITDA of $1.18 to $1.22 billion, up $15 million at the mid point versus prior gains, and representing 8% growth versus 2018 recast results. As a reminder in 2019 our EBITDA again is for the total company and includes all expenses. We are also raising our guidance for 2019 earnings per diluted share to a new range of $5.62 to $5.82, an increase of 7% as a midpoint compared to prior gains. These represent growth of 9% at the midpoint, although recast 2018 and only includes the impact of the $100 million in share repurchases completed in Q1. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.185 to $1.215 billion, which represent growth of up 4% at the midpoint. Excluding an expected 4% FX headwind, organic sales estimate is 8% growth at the midpoint. We are also focusing EBITDA of $325 million $345 million in Q2, which would be an increase of 5% year over year at the midpoint. This is despite significant FX and manufacturing cost headwinds. We expect second quarter EPS to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70, up 10% at the midpoint versus recast results from Q2 2018. For 2019, we expect the overall crop protection market will be flat to up low single digits. We expect Latin America to grow in the mid to high single digit, North America and Asia to be flat to up low single digit and EMEA to be flat to down low single digits. All these estimates are in the US dollar terms. In Latin America continued strength in cotton in Brazil, recovering conditions in Argentina and an expected strong soybean season across the region next fall will drive the market growth. In North America, market growth will come from an increase in corn and wheat acreage and more normalized price pressure. In EMEA, we expect recovery of cereals acreage for the strength of the US dollar related to the euro is likely to reduce the market growth rate in the region by 200 to 300 basis points. We expect growth in Asia to be driven by more normal weather conditions across the region. FX is expected to be a headwind in Asia which is embedded in our outlook for the market. As you can see the full year 2019 EBITDA bridge on Slide 8. The headwinds from FX and higher manufacturing costs are significant factors for 2019. The full year negative impact from FX is expected to be 7% at EBITDA level, plus another 13% headwind from higher raw material cost, representing a total of about $220 million. We expect price increase will offset the $145 million of these combined headwinds for approximately 65^. As was widely reported in late March, there was an explosion in an industrial park in China. One plants operated by one of FMCs contract manufacturing tours [ph] is located near the explosion. That plant has been shut down temporarily, as the government crack down to investigate the root cause of the blast. It is important to note however that FMC is global manufacturing network provides us with significant supply chain flexibility. Due to the strength of our partnerships and our alternate sourcing options, we are confident that we can continue to secure a supply of the FMC active ingredients normally manufactured as impacted to other to location as needed. We have already included the impact of this situation in our guidance. Turning to Slide 9. The second quarter EBITDA bridge reflects a $55 million cost headwind similar to Q1, but lower FX headwinds of $20 million, representing a total of about $75 million IN headwinds. We expect price increase in Q2 will offset $60 million or about 80% of these headwinds. I will now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks, Pierre. Let me start this morning with a few specific income statement items. Foreign exchange had a negative impact on revenue of approximately 6% in the first quarter. Offsetting this were strong volume growth of 9% and price increases of 5%. For the full year, we continue to expect foreign exchange to be in approximately 3% headwind to revenue. Interest expense was $1 million higher for the quarter than implied by our prior full year guidance, with higher commercial paper balances through the quarter due to the timing of share repurchases. Interest expense for the full year is now expected to be in the range of $137 million to $143 million, reflecting primarily changes in the mix of foreign versus domestic borrowing, as compared to our initial outlook for 2019. The higher levels of foreign borrowing will allow us to more cost effectively manage currency risk in certain countries in particular Argentina. Adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 15% in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. We are maintaining our full year tax rate guidance of 14% to 16% percent. Moving onto the balance sheet and cash flow. Growth debt as of March 31 was $3.1 billion, up roughly $450 million dollars from the end of 2018, reflecting the expected seasonal build in working capital and our decision to continue regularly purchasing FMC stock across the year rather than waiting for the more cash generative quarters later in the year. Gross debt the trailing 12 month EBITDA at quarter end was just below 2.8 times. This is above our targeted leverage of 2.5 times again due to the seasonality of our cash flow and the timing of share repurchases. But we expect to rapidly return to leverage levels below 2.5 times in the second half of the year. Turning to Slide 10, adjusted cash from operations was negative in the first quarter as expected, reflecting a more normal seasonal build of working capital. Cash from operations was also substantially below the prior year period, although this comparison is misleading due to several non-recurring impacts that benefited working capital in the prior year period, including a step down in past due balances in Brazil which reduced cash used for receivables, lower cash used for inventory given inventory levels in the acquired business at the time of acquisition and a significant increase in accounts payables associated with the ramp up of the acquired business, post acquisition. Excluding these one time items in the prior year period, the impact of working capital on cash from operations was generally consistent with the prior year and our expectations. Capital investment and spending on legacy and transformation efforts in the quarter were at a pace consistent with our full year guidance for those uses of cash. As expected free cash flow was negative for the quarter and well below the prior year period, due to the factors I just mentioned impacting cash from operations, as well as two additional positive impacts to legacy and transformation spending in the prior year period. First, the prior year period results include proceeds from a required anti-trust divestiture. And second, the prior year period results reflect certain transactions through up payment receipt following the closing of the acquisition of the DuPont business. FMC continues to expect to generate adjusted cash from operations of $750 million to $850 million in 2019, with capital spending anticipated to be in the range of $140 million to $160 million for 2019, as well as legacy transformation spending in the range of $200 million to $250 million. We expect to generate free cash flow before financing of $375 million to $475 million for the full year. We have repurchased 1.88 million FMC shares year to date at an average price of $79.70 for a total of approximately $150 million, including 4100 million of repurchases made early in the first quarter as discussed on our last call, along with $50 million of repurchases thus far in the second quarter. It is our intent to remain a regular purchaser of FMC shares throughout the year, purchasing a total of up to $500 million of FMC shares in 2019, inclusive of the $150 million already completed as of today. In summary, 2019 looks to be another year of exceptional financial performance for FMC, with increasing cash generation and improved cash conversion, 6% top line growth, despite FX headwinds and tepid market growth, 8% EBITDA growth despite significant cost increases and FX impacts, 9% EPS growth with potential further upside from additional share repurchases and return on invested capital in the mid teens percent. And with that I'll turn the call back to Pierre. Pierre Brondeau : Thank you Andrew. Following a very strong 2018, FMC delivered exceptional performance in Q1 and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. The growth rate and EBITDA margins are at the very top of the industry and sustainable. Additionally, we have a clear path to expand EBITDA margin another 200 to 300 basis points with improving mix from new product introduction, exiting [indiscernible] and finishing the implementation of a new FMC system. Starting with our Q2 earnings call, we will provide an annual update on the R&D pipeline which includes six synthetic molecules in the development phase, 15 synthetic molecules in the discovery phase and six biological strains. We plan to do these every year on the cuticle. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Thank you for your attention. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Chris Parkinson : Thank you. You did touch on this, but there has been a lot of noise on active ingredient procurement in China over the past two years. And as you accurately flagged the recent accident and its driving season [ph] flare up again. Can you just give us your perspectives on how FMC can overall insulate itself from these pressures and also offer some color on kind of where we were on the steam a few years ago where we are now? And then how you see this developing for the future for FMC, as well as the industry as a whole? Thank you Andrew Sandifer : Thank you. Thank you, Chris. Yeah, its a very valid point and the situation in China is simply impacting many of the of the ag companies. Let me talk specifically about FMC. I think 2018 was a difficult year. You remember with what happened in China. And I must say that our manufacturing and supply chain organization used 2018 not only to resolve the 2018 problems, but to diversify further a source of intermediates and AI for the future. I have to say that fully 2018 we've developed a very broad network with multiple sources for critical intermediates or for active ingredients. And we've done that in different ways. So I would say what we are doing today beyond 2018, beyond 2019 is focusing on the high priority product intermediates or AI and we are already implementing solutions outside of China. And how do we do that? We for example are right now working on developing capacity in our European plants, mostly in Denmark to produce some of these products. We are also contracting with some of our key partners in China to produce outside of China for \u2013 and especially in Europe. We are looking also through the outsourcing from Europe from India to partners for our own plants. So we are diversifying our network. It's moving fast, but of course, they will still be for the next few years a strong need for China to operate. For 2019 we believe today that we can face the situation of the shutdown and assuming it's reopening within the timeframe we are expecting which is you know, planned very conservative forecast. There is a cost to it because we had to implement last minute solutions and we have factored that 30 million that are cost in our EBITDA forecast for the year. But we do believe right now we are pretty secured from a supply standpoint to our customers as long as things do not get worse. So two production, one was making sure we could act in a way which give us what we need for 2019. But we've used this 2018 situation and 2019 to broaden our supply of intermediate and AIs using Europe, using India to produce outside of China. Chris Parkinson : Great. And just a quick follow up. You previously laid out some framework to improve cash flow conversion at your Analyst Day. I fully understand it's a little bit early, but can you just update us on your progression, as well as your conviction to hit these targets, just anything to help us conceptualize the opportunity here will be greatly appreciated and maybe just a quick point on updates on uses of cash? Thank you. Andrew Sandifer : Sure. And Chris its Andrew. Thanks for the question. I think certainly where we stand today you know, we continue to believe there's a strong trajectory for improving cash generation and cash conversion from FMC. The biggest driver in the step up over the next two years will be moving past this spending for on legacy and transformation, particularly the transformation efforts, the finishing of the DuPont integration, the implementation of our SAP S/4 HANA system and the related spending. And as you can see in our slide today, that's spending is about $200 million $250 million this year. Of that you know, a certain portion less than half of that, third to half and that will continue as sort of ongoing legacy spend. That's one of the biggest step changes we'll see in \u201820 versus \u201819 in cash conversion, combined with the ongoing growth of the topline where you're expecting still very substantial 7% to 9% [ph] EBITDA growth over the mid-term horizon, that will flow through cash flow pretty directly with a small headwind from working capital growth 20% to 30% of incremental sales. So we can very easily see a path from \u2013 and our guidance this year would have free cash flow before financing at about 55%-ish of net income. Very easily within the next two to three years, I would expect that number to be in the upper 70s, if not the 80s percent, as we move past this big lump of transformation expense. So that's the story on cash generation and conversion. From a cash deployment perspective, I think we continue to be committed to fully funding the organic growth of the company. You know, we're guiding spending between $140 million and $160 million on capital expense this year, notably not particularly heavy load, an aggregate, that's about 3.5% of our sales. And then with the other funds that are not committed to organic growth, pretty sizable amount. We are strongly committed to continuing to return those to shareholders through dividend, which made a significant raise last year and through share repurchases which as you've seen we've made pretty steady progress in chipping away this year $150 million done so far. Chris Parkinson : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from Stephens. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly : Thank you. So two things. Investors seem to be particularly concerned about the potential for the molecules you've picked up from DuPont. So can you give us a sense of how that group performed in the quarter and whether your expectations have changed any? You mentioned diamide specifically in Asia and EMEA. Can you tell us whether the growth that we're seeing in those sales is coming primarily from your FMC customers or is it coming from you know, continued growth that was already in place before you bought the assets? Pierre Brondeau : Yeah, Mark. To your first question in terms of growth of the acquired assets, in the first quarter those growth rates were in the mid-teens for the acquired assets. Pretty broad based, as we said in the press release and in the slides that you see. It's very difficult to actually parcel out exactly where that growth is coming from in terms of the synergy growth. What we are seeing is market expansions. So from a geographic standpoint we highlighted south-western Europe which is a very good area for us. That is coming from distribution where we've expanded our distribution networks over the last 18 months. Places like China, where again, we're gaining traction with major distributors and retailers. Latin America on some of the crops we mentioned such as cotton. So it's very broad based. I don't think our expectations have changed at all in terms of growth rates for these products. We were surprised last year at the amount of traction we got. And obviously we've continued that in Q1 and we expect that to continue for certainly the next few years. Mark Connelly : Super. And just a question on late planting, clearly you haven't been hurt by it, but do approach the selling season any differently when planting is delayed? I mean, obviously aside from the potential for acreage shifts, do you anticipate any different - significant differences in application that would affect the way you're rolling product into the market? Pierre Brondeau : Not really Mark. I think - I think from our perspective, when things do get delayed, you better have product in the right place in the distribution channel, because when the planting does start, I think everybody knows it goes 24/7 and demand is very high. So for us it's very much a case of from a logistics and supply chain perspective working with our distribution partners and retail partners to make sure we've got the right products in the right place. Obviously we talked about the pre-emergent side of our business, uptake has been very strong and I would say uptake has been very strong in the high end of our pre-emergent. So products like Authority Supreme which are extremely high performance, we've seen good demand there getting ready for the market when it eventually gets here. Mark Connelly : Super. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Don Carson : Yes. Just wanted to follow up on the U.S. season, the pre-emergent, so is the product actually going out to the grower and are the pounds in the ground being applied or is there a risk here that we could see a build up in channel inventories of your pre emergent products? Pierre Brondeau : Do, I think the pre emergent now is - some of it is going on the ground. The market is delayed, so some of it's that waiting in distribution channel. That's normal. Obviously, the timing of application will be critical. We're getting into the period now where growth will come. We're very confident in terms of how much we expect from our pre emergent business this year and certainly we have the right products in the right places today. Don Carson : Then a follow up on Latin America, you had very strong 40% organic growth, but obviously this is your latest quarter of the year. How should we think about sustainable organic growth, you know, as the year progresses and for the year as a whole? Pierre Brondeau : Yeah, you know, we've talked about a market in Latin America that is obviously going to grow in that mid to high single digits. I think Brazil will be at the top end of that range. Q1 although a light quarter, we had very good performance on cotton, broad across the portfolio. Insecticides were strong, obviously increased acreage. All the trade issues that are working their way through today, obviously Brazil is a major exporter of soy. We continue to expect soy acreage to increase in Brazil. And with that we should expect to enjoy you know, increased sales as well. Don Carson : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you. Just continuing that discussion about Brazil, you had very strong insecticide demand in Brazilian soybeans. Would you say that that is driven by the economic benefits that those growers are having you know, given the trade disputes or is this a reflection of just insect populations that are effectively not controlled by impact or maybe intact as some waning efficacy issues? Pierre Brondeau : Yeah, Steve I think it's a combination of the two. I mean, obviously the Brazilian growers are looking to get the maximum yields they can, given the high demand they see from the export market, specially to China. So that's one factor that I think the whole industry is seen. I think second for us is the growth in our insecticides in the quarter we're really focused on the pest spectrum that is more related to a lot of the legacy FMC products, not necessarily the diamide products here. Although we are seeing slight leakage on leps which is very strong for further an exit portfolio. So it's a bit of both actually. It's a bit of the market growth, but then it's a pest that particularly adept to what we have in our portfolio and that's mainly the legacy side of FMC business. Steve Byrne : And just also wanted to ask you a little bit about the diamides, particularly your efforts to create some new formulations that contain multiple modes of action, potentially giving a little longer patent estate there. Can you give us an update on those efforts? Pierre Brondeau : Yeah, sure. I mean, maybe I can take the opportunity to talk about that patent estate and how we see the world. We talked about that at the Investor Day. You know, I think people have to be aware that we have a patent estate that is very deep and very broad and also covers multi-years. For instance, you know, we've talked about Rynaxypyr and some of the main patents coming off in 2022. Well, the reality is they don't come off until 2023 in Brazil and in the European Union until 2024. So you can see there is a longer period of time. We have a number of activities underway within the portfolio, some of it relates to formulations. Those activities are in high gear. We are applying for registration today as we speak in many countries across the world. So from a formulation capability standpoint it's for us steady as she goes. We are looking at other activities as well to defend these high value franchise that we have. I'm not going to talk in too much detail about what they are, but it is very broad. So we're expecting that post patent you will see continued growth in the FMC portfolio from the diamide perspective. Andrew Sandifer : I think India something, I think contrary to what has been written in some - in some report where dates of patent expiration were actually wrong. There is composition patents which are protecting a product. But you know, everybody does that in that field, you do have an estate of patents, which are protecting the manufacturing, as well as the composition and the performance. All of that make it very difficult for people to come and produce the product on the day there is somewhere in this world an expiration. So we have the composition which protects the product, then we have them all the manufacturing patents, which make it difficult for people to manufacture. Even when we get to a place where they can from a patent standpoint manufacture they need to get the registration and they need to do the capital investment for the manufacturing, which I can tell you in some cases is quite high. So you can see today even on some product, take an example [indiscernible] which is - which is by the way have very large molecules in markets in the world, 600 million to 700 million\u2026 Pierre Brondeau : It's probably more in the $350 million, $400 million. Andrew Sandifer : 400 hundred million. It's a molecule where we end up so paying a lot, the people who are selling the molecule because you need to have the capacity and the technology to do it. So it is not something where cells disappear on the day of the exploration of the composition items, which for us go to 2022, three and four. Steve Byrne : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joel Jackson : Hi, good morning. You gave some good commentary, you expect that crop protection market globally to grow I think flat, up low single digits. Obviously your guidance you know mid to high single digits, FX here. Can you walk through exactly you know, why you're outperforming the market, is it all just the diamide, maybe break down a bit through the highest buckets here between the diamides and legacy products. What really letting you outperform there? Andrew Sandifer : So, yeah, I mean Joel the diamides are growing. Obviously, we believe we're taking share into that markets and we're also expanding in terms of crops and geographies. I would say on the other side of the carve, our herbicide portfolio continues to grow. We see that growing in Latin America. We see it growing in the U.S. and Canada. We also see growth in India on new applications such as sugar cane. We also - another area that we don't talk a lot about though is the herbicide portfolio that we acquired. We're seeing good growth there in Europe on cereals and also new formulations being introduced into Europe. So that's another area of growth. And then lastly there's two other areas the fungi sides which will continue to expand with new formulations both in the U.S. and in Europe. And then we also have our plant health business, that Pierre highlighted in his script, where we see growth in biologicals and micronutrients. So if you think of the buckets of activity that's how I would describe it. Joel Jackson : I want to follow up one of the topics of biologicals, so I may have this wrong, but at your Investor Day in early December, my memory was that you know biologicals are tough to develop efficacy, have to reproduce and maybe this wasn\u2019t going to be something that happens he was going to throw a lot of money in the R&D side, can you talk about \u2013 you can give an R&D pipeline update in a few months and what some of the things in the pipeline for biological? Has there been a shift at FMC in the last five, six month about what you may be able to do down the road with biologicals? Andrew Sandifer : No actually Joel, maybe we didn't communicate in the right way because we've been - we've been invested heavily in biologicals since around 2013. We have very much the belief that niologicals are going to play an important part in the crop protection industry, either as standalone products or equally as important with formulations with synthetic chemistry. We have six strains in our pipeline, both fungicides and bio stimulants. I can tell you now that the money we're putting into this has increased every year sine 2013. So for us we see this as an important growth area and as we said, the plant health business is growing at greater than 20% and is getting close to $200 million. So it's becoming a meaningful part of the portfolio. We do a lot of educating, not only internally on biologicals, but with our retailers, distribution and growing network. Selling biologicals is different. They behave differently. They have different modes of action. So all that has to be built up over time. But I can tell you now we're very committed to biologicals. Mark Douglas : Yeah, It is going to be as miss-communicating because since 2013 we've made acquisitions of research laboratory. We have been investing in R7D. We have actually built an R D center in Denmark which is solely focused on biological, including fermentation capability. So its one of the priorities we have for the company and the spending has been growing year after year since 2013. Joel Jackson : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Jester from Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Jester : Yeah. Hi, good morning everyone. I just wanted to go to your 2019 EBITDA bridge, it looks like you have \u2013 you have pricing mixing [ph] $145 million benefit, but that's fully offset by cost. So I know it's a little bit early, but conceptually does that mean that you're going to continue to push price later this year and into 2020 to make up for some of these logistic challenges that you talked about? And you know, you've been raising price for a while now, but farm economics are still maybe uneven globally. So you know, how confident are you that these price initiatives are be able to come to fruition? Andrew Sandifer : You know, I think a pricing - pricing situation continues to be - to be thought through. We are definitely not increasing systematically across the board. We do it where - where the molecule can afford, and increasing in pricing we are very thorough around it and very systematic. We also use the seasons, for example you increase price in Latin America in the third and fourth quarter of the year, well, you will do that a different turning in North America. So it's over a long period of time, but it's not constant across a year for every region. So we do believe the pricing increase we do have for the full year right now we have quite a high level of confidence that it's sustainable and manageable. And like anything, price increase to be a - our customers are smart and they understand what they are buying and what they are paying for. So it's going to be very well thought through and done where you believe you can do it and that's what we've been doing. So I think we have a situation which is right now quite stable and we have a good way for early in 2019. The critical question which should be asked because we don't have an answer, is how sticky those prices are when the headwinds are disappearing, so that is a 2020 situation and we don't have an answer, as you can guess, we're going to try to hold onto those prices even in the face of less headwind, as long as possible. Daniel Jester : That was very helpful, thank you. And then on the inventory situation, really appreciated the additional color you talked about in Brazil about how you're doing check throughout the channel. Do you do similar exercise in some of your other regions and what is that telling you about the channel inventories of FMC product? Thank you. Andrew Sandifer : Yeah. We - not to the same extent. For example in North America we do not have to do it as much because there is data which are generated by the industry special here on what we call EDI [ph] which are products on the ground. So when you have regular data coming at you from all of the suppliers of what goes into the market versus what goes on the ground, you are usually able to have a pretty good view of some of the inventory situation in North America. And I'd say Mark maybe you only want to add to this, but I think North America is one of the place where we are concerned not cost and maybe too strong of a word, but we are watching the situation around run inventory level where we have much more visibility today or less concerning in Latin America. But on a regular basis, yes it is a process, different methodologies we are using, but we are very highly focused on inventory of products into the into the channel. Brazil and Latin America being a place where we have developed our own system because that's the place where things could get out of control faster. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next we'll go to the line of Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Kevin McCarthy : Good morning. I appreciate the detail that you've provided on geographic trends on Slide 4. I was wondering if you know, kind of disaggregated the sales in a different way by product category, insecticides, herbicides, fungicides. Where would you've seen the fastest growth globally and which category would have been the slowest? Pierre Brondeau : Yes. Let me think \u2013 let me quickly think about that. So insecticides are the fastest growing segment broad based, not any one particular product. I would say pockets in Asia, China, India are fast growing, Brazil depending on the crop. Obviously we mentioned soy and cotton as to, sugarcane is more balanced. And then I would say in the U.S. as well on the niche crops, tree nuts, fruits that would be a good market for us. And then in Europe on pretty much all the niche crops down in the south of - south of Europe. Next would be herbicides for us growing the next strongest and then followed by fungicides. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Harrison : Hi, good morning. Pierre Brondeau : Good morning, Mike. Mike Harrison : The $30 million in higher raw material costs that are baked into your guidance is that exclusively related to the plant explosion that you referenced or are there other factors that are worsening in China? And also just wondering the timing of that $30 million impact is that going to be more of a Q3 or Q4 phenomenon or is it something you're seeing right now? Andrew Sandifer : So first, yes, the $30 million there is exclusively due to the plant explosion and where we had to procure some of the products with different type of contract. So to your first part of the question, yes. In terms of impact, highest impact of the 30 million [ph] will be in Q3, and then about even between Q2 and Q4. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Mike Sison : Hey, guys. Nice start to the year. When I take a look at your 2018 outlook, buying [ph] got the 6%, levering to 15% EBITDA growth you know pretty impressive given how high your margins are. Is that that kind of a right operating leverage to think about the business going forward and is there any major changes between the regions in terms of volume growth to EBITDA growth? Andrew Sandifer : I think - I think the numbers - you're talking about are numbers which - that's the kind of leverage we were expecting. Of course, you could do worse or better leverage depending upon position [ph]. Remember that we are facing very significant adverse cost this year which we are going against us and we are mitigating them with price increase. But that's the kind of leverage we could expect globally. Looking forward, especially with an eye on 2021, we hope to be able to leverage our systems, plus exit of TSAs where you could have even higher translation of sales growth into higher EBITDA growth and margin. So all in all, we don't believe there is nothing out of the ordinaries. In the numbers we are producing to date in, taking to account the adverse conditions. From a profitability standpoint to a region, Mark you want to say a couple words? Mark Douglas : Yeah. You know, Mike if you think back five, seven years ago we used to talk about the disparity of our profitability across the regions. I can tell you today that with the portfolio we have and the way it's balanced around the world, profitability for FMC across the regions is pretty balanced. So you know, that growth rate around the world as we see it, it really flows through to the bottom line. So don't think of any one region of having a very high margin or a comparatively lower margin. They're pretty much balanced around the world. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kapsch from Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Chris Kapsch : Good morning. I had a follow up on the pricing discussion. I am just wondering if \u2013 and the strong pricing and pricing outlook, is there any way you could parse it out by how much of that is just sort of related to the FX paradigm as opposed to the cost issues that you and the industry is incurring? And then also is there any instances where your procurement flexibility and agility has translated into some share gains for particular product lines, whereas maybe your competitors might have been you know, seen a little bit more dislocation in terms of their sort sourcing active ingredients or intermediates? Andrew Sandifer : Yes. The first question was? Pierre Brondeau : Pricing, FX versus raw materials. Andrew Sandifer : FX versus raw materials, there is only one place in the world where the selling methodologies is accepted from the supply side and the customer side where there is a link of FX to pricing, that's Brazil. Brazil is a place for - as far as we can remember, there was almost indexation of pricing to currency, everywhere else in the world it is a negotiation.\\ So the way we look at it as from a commercial standpoint we just consider everywhere outside of Brazil cost and when there is cost we are facing whether it's the raw material or an FX cost. We do what we can in the places where we can afford to do it. Increase price to decrease - in terms of cost. No differentiating effects from raw material or other costs. From a procurement standpoint. And the second part of your question, I think what we do and nothing to compare ourselves to what our competitors are doing because in general we know exactly know what they do. But Europe we have uncovered in 2018, that supply disruption in China or issues are not things which cannot be dealt with. There is multiple sources of product in this world which are available if you do have a very active supply chain organization and procurement organization and yes, we've been very, very highly focused not only at fixing long term problem, by diversifying away from China supply, but also by creating through procurement organization and supply chain, a number of partnership which almost standby partnership ready to jump in as soon as we have issues. Operator : And your final question today comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura. Please go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you. Good morning. In the case your tolling partners plant in China doesn't restart in the time you expect. What are the consequences? How can you describe the ongoing elevated costs and also could you potentially be limited on availability of active ingredients? Andrew Sandifer : So I want to be very careful on what I say, because in no case should we substitute our sales to the Chinese authorities, but we have no reason to believe today that the plant will not restart. It is a question of when every single we have is that the plant will restart and when we do a forecast with $30 million headwind cost it is a very conservative forecast, indication we have is that right now it is a worst case scenario. But once again I want to be careful, we believe the plan we have outlined for you guys from the financial standpoint is very achievable and we have no reason to believe it will not restart. We have a lot of education, but that's about as far as I can go. Michael Wherley : That's all the time that we have for the call today. As always I'm available following the call to address any additional questions you may have. Thank you and have a good day. Operator *: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the FMC Corporation conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Phone lines will be placed on a listen-only mode throughout the conference. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question and answer period. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Wherley, Director of Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Mr. Wherley, you may begin. Michael Wherley : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Pierre Rondeau, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; Mark Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Pierre will review FMC's second quarter performance and provide the outlook for the rest of 2019. Andrew will provide an overview of select financial results, Mark will then address the long-term sustainable growth for Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect controls. We will then address your questions. The slide presentation that accompanies our results, along with our earnings release and 2019 outlook statement are available on our website and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call. Finally, let me remind you that today's presentation and discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors including but not limited to those factors identified in our press release and in our filings with the SEC. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion in this forum materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations and free cash flow, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that earnings shall mean adjusted earnings and EBITDA shall mean, adjusted EBITDA for all income state references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's call are provided on our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Pierre. Pierre Brondeau : Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our earnings release FMC continued to outperform the market as we have for the past seven quarters. We delivered results in-line with the forecast and adjusted to specific global conditions in the quarter. Turning to Slide 3. FMC reported $1.2 billion in second quarter revenue, which reflects the year-over-year increase of 4.5% on the reported basis and 9% organic growth excluding FX headwinds. This increase was mostly driven by strength in Brazil, India and EMEA. Adjusted company EBITDA was $330 million, an increase of 6% compared to recast financials from last year and $3 million above the midpoint of the guidance. Company EBITDA margins were up 28%, but year-over-year despite $64 million in combined headwinds from raw material cost and foreign currencies. Adjusted EPS was $1.66 in the quarter, an increase of 11% versus weaker Q2, 2018 and $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance. The strong year-over-year EPS growth was driven by price increase, higher volume and the lower share count. Moving now to second quarter revenue on Slide 4. Q2 revenue grew 4.5% versus prior year, with volume contributing 5% growth and price mix to another 3% growth. This was offset partially by 4% headwind from FX. Although, Q2 is a seasonally smaller quarter of the year in Latin America, sales in that region grew 29% year-over-year or 34% organically, continuing the trend from Q1. Drivers include strong revenue growth in Brazil across the portfolio with high demand for applications on cotton and sugarcane, and price increases that more than offset the impact of FX on both revenue and earnings. Following such a strong first half in Latin America, it is important to note that we continue to monitor channel inventory levels of FMC products very closely in Brazil. They are at an all-time low for this point in the season. In EMEA, improved market conditions in Russia and Ukraine grew demand in Southwest Europe and new country registrations for Cyazypyr insect control drove year-over-year revenue growth of 4%. Organic growth was 10%. In Asia, revenue was down 2% overall, but increased 4% organically year-over-year. We were especially pleased with the strong performance in India where our sales grew over 20% driven by growth in herbicides for sugarcane and the benefits of our new commercial organization structure, which we put in place about a year ago. In North America revenue was down 2% year-over-year as the well-understood whether issues in the quarter caused a reduction in demand from our rootcrop customers. This low demand was offset in part by strong sales of Rynaxypyr insect control, especially in niche crops in California, and our new fungicide Lucento. Turning to Slide 5. Second quarter EBITDA was $338 million, price increases in all regions and strong volume demand everywhere, but North America combined to more than offset the headwinds from raw material cost and FX, leading to 6% growth versus recast results from Q2 2018. Moving to our 2019 outlook on Slide 6. We are maintaining our guidance for 2019 revenue and EBITDA. We expect full year 2019 revenue to grow 6% at the midpoint on 9% organic growth, excluding the forecasted 3% FX headwind. We expect total company EBITDA to grow 8%, we are increasing our 2019 EPS guidance to a range of $5.68 to $5.88, which represent a gain of 10% at the midpoint over recast 2018. Our EPS guidance now reflects the $200 million of buybacks completed in the first half of 2019, as well as an additional $200 million of buyback anticipated in the second half. We continue to plan to make $400 million to $500 million in total share repurchases in 2019. But our EPS guidance reflects the lower end of this range. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $960 million to $990 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 6% at the midpoint. We are also forecasting EBITDA of $190 million to $210 million in Q3, which would be an increase of 7% year-over-year at the midpoint. As expected, the impact from FX will be more muted in the second half of the year. We expect third quarter EPS to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.85, up 13% at the midpoint versus recast results from Q3 2018. The third quarter is a seasonally smallest quarter for FMC, which is in line with the quarterly pattern from 2018 as Q3 is not a high season in any of our regions. The healthy growth we forecast is in-line with our full-year growth expectation and the Q3 guidance is essentially in-line with the prior year period as a percent of annual sales, annual EBITDA and annual EPS. Guidance for Q4, implies a very strong quarter with sales growth of 7%, EBITDA growth of 17% and EPS growth of 10%, all at the midpoint of the ranges versus recast Q4 2018 results. Q4 performance will be driven by Latin America. In Brazil, similar to last year, we have already received nearly 70% of the orders needed to deliver our second half forecast. This is giving us a very strong confidence in our ability to deliver our financial targets for the second half. However, we are carefully monitoring the North America market and channel inventories. For 2019, we now expect the overall global crop protection market will be flat on a U.S. Dollar basis. Down slightly from our previous outlook, we expect Latin America to grow faster in the high-single digits and North America to be weaker down mid-single digits. These adjustments in market forecast does not change our overall outlook for FMC's financial outperformance related to the market. Turning now to a full-year EBITDA bridge and revenue drivers on Slide 7. Our full-year cost headwind is higher than our prior forecast, mainly due to increase tariffs in the U.S. and a delayed reopening of a key tolling partner in China. However, strong pricing is now expected to offset over 70% of the $220 million in combined headwinds from cost and FX. Moving to Slide 8. We provide the key drivers for EBITDA and revenue growth in Q3 and Q4. Volume growth and price increases are expected to be consistent driver over revenue and earnings performance. I will now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks Pierre. Let me start this morning with a few specific income statement items. Interest expense for the quarter was $4 million higher than implied by our prior full year guidance due to higher interest rates on foreign borrowings and higher than anticipated commercial paper balances. Interest expense for the full year is now expected to be in the range of $144 million to $148 million. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 15%. We are maintaining our full year tax rate guidance of 14% to 16%. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the second quarter was $132.3 million, down nearly $4 million shares versus the prior year period, reflecting the benefit of the $400 million in share repurchases, we've made over the past three quarters. Moving onto the balance sheet and cash flow. Gross debt as of June 30th was $3.2 billion, up roughly $100 million from the end of March. Gross debt to trailing 12 month EBITDA at quarter end was 2.8x. This is above our targeted leverage of 2.5x due to the seasonality of our cash flow and the timing of share repurchases. We continue to expect to see leverage drop to 2.5xor lower for the full year. Turning to Slide 9. Adjusted cash from operations was negative $174 million in the first half of 2019, below the prior year period. Non-recurring impacts that benefited working capital in the prior year period as discussed in our last earnings call remain the largest contributor to the year-on-year change. Additionally, cash from operations in the second quarter was also impacted by credit term accommodations made to certain North American customers in light of extreme market conditions, more than half of which have already been paid to us in Q3. We also had higher sales in Latin America and India where normal terms extend beyond the quarter end. These additional factors will unwind over the following two quarters and as such we are maintaining our full year guidance for adjusted cash from operations at $750 million to $850 million, with strong operating cash generation in both the third and fourth quarters. Capital investment through mid-year while lagging the pace implied by our full year guidance is in-line with project schedule. We are maintaining our full year guidance for free cash flow of $375 million to $475 million. However, we are currently exploring a few product line acquisitions as well as certain capital investments to support the rapid growth of our diamide platform. These opportunities - if pursued - would reduce full year free cash flow somewhat, so they would further reinforce our growth trajectory. We repurchased $2.56 million FMC shares year-to-date at an average price of $78.11 for a total of approximately $200 million. It is our intent to remain a regular purchaser of FMC shares throughout the year. So we have not purchased any shares since the quarter-end, you should expect that we will make further repurchases during the third and fourth quarters. As Pierre said, we intend to repurchase a total of $400 million to $500 million of FMC shares in 2019, I note that our full year EPS guidance reflects the benefit of repurchases at the lower end of this range in light of the potential additional investment opportunities I just mentioned. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Andrew. Over the last few months, we've seen numerous published reports discussing our diamide insecticide portfolio, speculating on the timing of patent expirations and the impact these may have on the long-term profitability and growth of these important active ingredients. I want to take the time today to provide further clarity on not only our patent estate and the timing of key patent milestones, but also on other critical elements that will allow FMC to continue to profitably grow the diamide franchise well beyond the expiration of key patents. These other critical elements include registration and data protection, commercial strategies, brand recognition, as well as manufacturing and supply chain complexity. Our diamide portfolio consists of two key molecules, Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect controls with current combined annual revenues of approximately $1.5 billion. It's important to note that Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr are FMC's trademark brand names for the active ingredients chlorantraniliprole and Cyantraniliprole. These two molecules class-leading in terms of performance, combining highly effective low dose rates with fast-acting systemic long residual control. These attributes quickly established Rynaxypyr's the world's leading insect control technology and we expect it to continue a strong growth trajectory. Moving to Slide 11 to begin our discussion of the diamide patent state. Let me first pause to recognize DuPont. Out of all the quality assets we acquired in 2017, the IP estate and thought that went into building the IP protection of these molecules was extremely well done. Today I will largely confine my comments to Rynaxypyr, though the same comments are generally true for Cyazypyr with extended timelines by 18 months. The Rynaxypyr patent estate is made up of several different patent families which cover composition of matter - both the active ingredient and certain intermediates - manufacturing processes - both the active ingredients in certain intermediates - formulations, uses and applications. For Rynaxypyr, we have 21 patent families filed in 76 countries, with a total of 639 granted and pending patents. Together with Cyazypyr related patents, we have over 30% patent families and close to 1,000 granted and pending patents. Composition of matter patents cover the structure of the molecule and are generally the patents that most observers have focused on. Process patents cover the manufacturing processes for both active ingredients chlorantraniliprole and Cyantraniliprole, as well as the key intermediates that are used to make the final products. In the case of Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr, these process patents are extremely important. Chlorantraniliprole is a complex molecule to produce. In fact its production requires 16 separate steps, many of which produce an intermediate that sole use is in the production of chlorantraniliprole. This is very important as it means there are no other commercial uses for these intermediates and hence no other commercial outlets for them. Importantly, FMC has many of these 16 process steps separately patented. Several of these intermediate process patents run well past the expiration of the composition of matter patents and in some cases stretch all the way to the end of the next decade. Third parties that intend to manufacture and sell generic chlorantraniliprole Cyantraniliprole and rely on FMC's product safety data will be required to demonstrate that their products has the same regulatory safety profile as FMC's Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect controls. To meet these stringent regulatory requirements for such a difficult to manufacture molecule, the AIs will have to be made the way we're making it which is protected by FMC process patents. Process patents can also include manufacturing processes that are not currently used, but are alternative ways to manufacture our diamides. We hold patents on several alternate processes, but it is important to note that these alternate processes do not match our diamide impurity profile. Formulation patents cover the use of an active ingredient in specific formulations, while used in application patents cover how the products are used and how they are applied. In addition to the patent estate, various regulatory bodies around the world also offer added protection to the holder of patented molecules in the form of data protection and registration timelines that can extend after the composition of process patents have expired. This means that the patent holder is afforded a further period of exclusive use after the application after applicable patents have expired. Over the coming slides, I'll show by major country how the patent estate registration timeline and data protection come together. These highlighted countries currently account for over 70% of our diamide revenue. Turning to Slide 12 you can see how we view the entire timeline for Europe. We have two parts of protection. First, we have patent protection for the composition of matter through August 2022 and later in certain EU countries. In addition and importantly, we have patent protection through December 2025 for key processes that are required to manufacture Rynaxypyr. In effect this means that no one will be able to manufacture or import chlorantraniliprole in the EU until December 2025 as they would be infringing our process patents. Second, in Europe, owners who have patented active ingredients are also granted exclusive data protection, which for chlorantraniliprole effectively means of third-party cannot use the FMC data to gain a registration for a period of 13 years after the first registration. In addition, a further 2.5 years of data protection will be given at the initial re-registration of the active ingredient. Practically speaking, this means that no one, seeking to register chlorantraniliprole can use FMC-generated data to apply for registration during the data protection period, which runs through the end of October 2026. A third party can start to generate their own product specific data for registration purposes during this period and after the data protection period has expired, they could then apply for registration, which under EU rules should take 18 months, but generally takes two years. This multi-layered framework means that we will not see competitive sales of chlorantraniliprole until Q2 2027 at the earliest in the EU, unless it is sales of products sourced from or under license from FMC. On Slide 13, you can see a similar chart to what we had in the EU with regards to patent protection, but with a different registration process. The U.S. does not have the same type of data protection as in the EU. However, under U.S. patent law, a third party cannot test or generate data or sell a product in the U.S. prior to patent expiration. This means that any third-party company wishing to gain registration to manufacture and sell chlorantraniliprole cannot start the regulatory process and allow main process patents begin expiring in December 2025. At that time the third party company can apply for a federal registration, which under normal circumstances will take about 12 months. After the federal registration has been granted, a state registration is also needed for each state where the products will be sold. These state registrations normally take an additional six months to be granted. In addition, the third party is legally required to compensate the data holder, in this case FMC, for using FMC's data to gain a registration. This robust patent protection and regulatory timeline, means that we do not expect third party to be able to sell chlorantraniliprole in the US until June 2027 at the earliest, unless they are supplied or licensed by FMC. Moving to Slide 14, which shows the timeline for two other key countries for diamides : China and India. Similar to other countries we've reviewed, you can see that the AI composition of matter patents expire in August 2022 and the key process patents begin expiring in December 2025. In India and China, a third-party can start applying for registration for a product during the time frame that a molecule has patent protection. However, in both these countries, we have the key manufacturing processes patented, which effectively means that even if the registration is granted, a third party could not start selling competitive chlorantraniliprole until Q1 2026 at the earliest. Finally, the last county I'll cover is Brazil on Slide 15. The patent timelines for Rynaxypyr in Brazil are longer than most other countries. The composition of matter patent on the active ingredient will expire in April 2023 and our key process patents will begin expiring in August 2026. Under current Brazilian regulatory practices, a third-party can apply for registration before the patents have expired. However, Brazil has a law of protecting the exclusive use of initial registrant's data for a period of time, after the initial registration. FMC believes that any company that filed for registration during the period of our continued data exclusivity falls foul of this Brazilian law, we have initiated a legal process with the Brazilian regulatory authorities to have FMC's data exclusivity respected. Taking this into account, it means first competitive sales of chlorantraniliprole will not occur before September 2026. Turning to Slide 16. The second part of our growth strategy for the diamide is our commercial approach. It should be very clear that we have an air-tight patent coverage for the process of manufacturing the diamides. However, we are also advancing a strategy of allowing others to sell Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect controls as long as they purchased the active ingredient or formulations from FMC and license the trademarks. Selling the active ingredients to third parties is a profitable way for us to grow our business as it increases the market reach for the molecule, it is not EBITDA margin dilutive. At a reasonable gross margin the absence of SG&A expense for FMC means incremental gross margin drops straight to EBITDA. The third-party bears all costs related to formulated the active ingredient into a marketable product as well as selling and distributing the product to the customer. As of today, we have commercial agreements already in place or are actively negotiating new agreements with more than 15 companies to supply Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr on a global or country basis before patent expiration. We are continuing to explore opportunities with additional companies beyond the 15 we already engaged with today. The duration of the agreements extends well beyond the patent expiration dates and are exclusive in nature. This means our third-party partners will be required to purchase a large majority of their diamide requirements from FMC over the lifetime of the agreement and all their needs prior to the expiration of our process patents. The number of companies where we already have signed supply contracts all have ongoing negotiations demonstrates that many competitors would prefer to partner with us rather than attempt to manufacture a complex product that is highly protected by IP. Our commercial strategy ensures that the diamide technologies will continue to gain share. These new commercial partners will leverage different market access in different geographies and crops with different formulations than FMC has today. These actives will be additive to the overall growth of the FMC diamide franchise. For years past the patent expiration date, FMC will have a growing diamide business with a strong share of the market at the grower level and an even stronger share of the molecule at the manufacturing level. Beyond our significant patent protection in commercial strategy, the complexity of manufacturing and scale of economies FMC enjoys are further under-appreciated aspects of the long-term strength of the diamides platform. Today, FMC manufactures all the required intermediates in the 16-step process as well as the final Rynaxypyr products and our own active ingredient manufacturing plants all via partners under exclusive long-term agreement for a third party to replicate this complex supply chain and manufacturing network would be a major undertaking with very large capital requirements. In addition, given the know-how we have in the scale of our operations, FMC's manufacturing cost will be substantially lower than any new entrant. This explains why we are confident, most companies that want to participate in the formulated diamide market will choose to do so in partnership with FMC. In closing, I hope of addressed any misperceptions about the long-term sustainable growth of FMC's diamide franchise. Our deep patent estate proprietary regulatory data, manufacturing scale and knowledge, strong brand recognition as well as commercial approach will ensure that FMC is a company of choice to supply diamides to third party partners. This will further ensure that the diamides franchise continues to be a major driver of value for FMC through the end of the next decade and beyond. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Pierre. Pierre Brondeau : Thank you, Mark, for covering that important topic. To conclude our prepared remarks, FMC delivered another quarter of financial performance despite the challenging Ag environment in the U.S. Volume demand and price increases in other regions around the world are continuing to deliver strong revenue and EBITDA growth. At the beginning of this month, we successfully launched a new SAP system with the pellets in Brazil. The new system is performing very well. 20% of FMC now operates on the new S/4 HANA system and we expect to complete the full implementation in Q2 2020. The Brazil launch is a major milestone in the implementation process which is giving us strong confidence, that we will be able to implement the full system without disrupting our operations. In May, we indicated that we will provide an update on the R&D pipeline on today's call, but we felt more important to dispel misperceptions about our diamide franchise. Rather than squeeze an R&D update into a future earnings call, we will have more comprehensive and in-depth R&D investor event in the first half of this year. FMC remains well-positioned to outperform the industry and our focus on crop chemicals and biological product is an advantage. Short-term execution is delivering superior quarterly results and we are confident that our current portfolio and technology pipeline will deliver longer-term growth. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Thank you for your attention. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Chris Parkinson : As we enter 2020, you have a few moving parts on the cost front, including a new baseline for raw materials just given on what's happening in 2019, the SAP which you mentioned, as well as the roll off of the TSA among a few others. Can you just update us on your thoughts regarding the setup for the second half and also just into 2020? Kind of run rates et cetera, your general line of sight into these variables and your conviction on your ability to drive margins higher? Pierre Brondeau : Sure, Chris. As you know, we had adverse cost and a part of those costs will not be seen next year. So we know we're going to start 2020 with a tailwind from a cost-standpoint and also from an FX standpoint. There is also the fact that we are expecting to get out of the TSA with DuPont and settled by Q2 2020the new SU on a system. I look at two buckets. The total cost will be the increase in cost we are facing in 2019. We will not repeat themselves in 2020. But we will still see only a part of that coming. We have not yet quantified exactly how this will be impacting next year. We know it will be a tailwind but don't take the entire cost increase into 2020. From an S/4 HANA implementation and TSA, we still believe that the cost saving on an annual basis will be in the $60 million to $100 million a year, but we will only see fraction of that in 2020 and same thing, we have not yet quantified. So we have two source of benefits from a cost standpoint that we will eliminate a bit more time most likely at the Q3 earnings call to give you a more qualified number. The other thing which is positive as we are seeing today and we are pleased with as the cost increase - decreasing in H2 as well as FX, price is sticking quite well. So it's also a third tailwind we will see in 2020. You guys have to give us a bit more time. We're still highly focused on 2019. Those are tailwind for 2020. But we're hoping to quantify that in next two, three months. Chris Parkinson : And just on the cash generation fronts. You put some targets out there which are kind of in the stark contrast to the old FMC, but obviously in a good way. Can you just comment on your progress on the cash conversion for 2019, what else needs to be done in the second half and into 2021 to kind of further drive that conversion up to a peak level potentially let's say 85ish%. Just any incremental color on the moving parts will be greatly appreciated. Thank you. Pierre Brondeau : Yes, the cash, in fact there is not much change on the cash forecast for the year versus what we were expecting the difference as Andrew said in the prepared remarks was Q2 was not as cash generative as we are hoping, because we made the commercial decision to support our customers distributors and growers in Q2 we are facing tough very challenging time and give them some a break on the cash correlation, a big part of that has been paid as was promised and will be seen in Q3 and Q4. So not much change in term of the forecast outlook for the year, maybe a bit more weighted towards Q3, Q4, then we're expecting, Andrew you want to add anything? Andrew Sandifer : So I think for the current year. I think Pierre comments are spot on. I do remind everyone that in the first half of last year, we did have some benefits to working capital that don't repeat related to the DuPont transaction both on inventories and payables, as well as a pretty market step down and in past news in Brazil. So that comparison is a bit extreme. I think looking beyond 2019. I do think that long term 80%-ish conversion of free cash flow from net income. It's still very much in reach, we do need to see a step down in our legacy and transformation spending, which we anticipate as we move past the S-4 HANA implementation in the finalization of the DuPont integration. And continue to drive efficiency and working capital, but very much in reach. I think this year's the cash flow forecast as Pierre mentioned, as staying where we are and really does give us the capacity to commit to large return of capital to shareholders, both through share repurchases and the dividend and the flexibility to do some incremental investment depending on opportunities through the rest of the year. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly : Pierre every quarter we get questions about whether the diamide growth can continue. I think, in addition to the confusion over the patents. There is some misunderstanding about how FMC goes to market with products versus the way the previous owner did, so can you talk about your market penetration and why you're confident about diamide growth? Pierre Brondeau : I think there is not a fundamental difference in the way we go-to-market versus the previous owner. I think we just have a very different profile in terms of the crops to which we sell and the region of the world, which we sell. So, it allows us to, to keep on penetrating markets, which we are underpenetrated in the past by DuPont's, not because there is as much of a difference of approach and usage. Just because of the fact we are a different company and we are benefiting from position in crops, which are very strong crops for Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr. There is also the fact that as we've seen in the prepared remarks, we keep on getting registration, especially for sales appear in multiple countries and that is generating more growth. So when we look at the long term. I would not say that we would continue in the 15% to 25% growth rate of the franchise as we had last year and this year, but a long-range plan, we would be doing taking us way into the next 10 years. Looking for mid-single-digit to high single-digit growth rate for the diamide is very appropriate. Mark, do you want to add any color to this? Mark Douglas : Yes, I think we're not finished with the sales synergies. So that's where a lot of the growth is coming from. So greater market access. Pierre said for Cyazypyr, we had - this year, we've had eight new registrations in eight different countries, both in Europe and in Africa. We continue to leverage our position with major co-ops and distributors in the South of Latin America in the U.S. and we have our new channel access in India, which is a large market for us. So wherever those niche crops are in terms of what I would consider fruit and vegetables, that's why we're seeing continued growth. So you can focus on Asia, you can focus on the south of Europe. You can focus on the South of Latin America and Mexico. Pierre Brondeau : There is a final point, maybe this point is a bit different from what the previous owner deal, those all the comments made by Mark. We are looking at Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr had a great partnering tool with other companies and as we said, we have partnership and are negotiating with about 15 companies. We are allowing those companies under some conditions to sell Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr in different crops different part of the world. So those companies are increasing dramatically market reach and allowing us to grow faster and that is a very profitable way for us to grow the franchise, it's not at all EBITDA dilutive and it's a tool we intend to use for the years to come. I think our competitors understand well, the quality of the patent estate and are very willing to enter into those 10 years contract or more to partner with FMC on those molecules. Mark Connelly : I want to follow up with a question about Brazil, you've obviously been exceptionally strong there and that's been a core strength of FMC for pretty much forever. We're starting to see some big retail players and distribution struggled down there and we've got a major North American retailer talking enthusiastically about that market. If we do see the Brazil ag retail market gradually shift to be more like the U.S., how is that going to affect you in Brazil and how realistic do you think it is that that happens given the massive differences in market structure down there? Pierre Brondeau : So first, let me make a statement. As a large supplier of crop chemicals to the ag market, we like the U.S. structure. We do like to have large buyers, well established companies, public or private or corps, which play by the rules of the time and pay in time. So we are not adverse at all to a market outside of the U.S. starting to structure itself more like a U.S. market. It is not - it's good from a cost standpoint, it's good from a cash standpoint, it's good from an operation standpoint. Now, I still believe, if you look at the size of the growers in Brazil that we will see last distributors at our U.S. model happening, but it's going to take some time. It's a very big market, it's a market where there is a large number of large players, who are growers. Soto see a market where you go down to five or six or seven largest distributors like we have in U.S., I don't see that in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, a transition more towards the U.S. market is not a negative for us. Mark? Mark. Douglas: Yes, only thing I would add to that is you've got some extremely large co-ops in the South of Brazil, which operate in a very similar way to the U.S. model in terms of scale and breadth of capabilities. So I think in parts of Brazil, you already have more of a U.S. type model. I do think the market is consolidating in terms of distribution, you are seeing acquisitions and roll ups. I think that will continue. But as Pierre said, I think it will take some time to get to where we are in the U.S. for instance. But I do see it going in that direction. Pierre Brondeau : And we don't see that as a negative at all. Mark Douglas : No, not at all. Operator : And next we go to line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : Mark, appreciate the review of Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr patent protection time on that. Obviously, you mentioned that's $1.5 billion in terms of sales today, so very attractive. I just wanted to drill into one of the comments you made, that it would be very capital intensive for someone else to duplicate your supply chain. Can you give us an order of magnitude of what would be involved there in terms of dollars and cents? Pierre Brondeau : It's complex to do, because understand that when you have a process which is 16 steps, which for us is done through a series of partners who are manufacturing some of the intermediates and some of the final steps, which are made by us, it is a very-very complex network. You would not imagine somebody building that in a short period of time over a single site. So it would require not only capital spending at the level of the company itself, which intend to, but most likely to find partners to produce some of those intermediates. None of these partners could be the partners we do have today, who are in exclusive arrangements with our sales for the long-term. The number is certainly, we have not quantified if somebody would try to replicate all or part of a product. But, I'd say, for part of the total, to see numbers more in the $1 billion range would not be surprising. Frank Mitsch : Pierre, I believe you mentioned that at this point, here we sit on July 31st, you have 70% of orders already received to meet your second-half objectives. I'm just curious, how does that stand in prior years in terms of the percent of orders that you would already have in-house? Is that somewhat typical or is that a higher than normal sort of percentages? Pierre Brondeau : It is the same as last year, which was a very strong year. So I would say the last two years, we reached that 70% number. Usually by this time of the year, we are about 40% to 50%, maybe 40% range at this time of the year. Last year for the first time, we hit the 70% range, which was positive and resulted into a very strong second half. And once again this year, we are at the same place. So we view that as a positive versus a normalized year. Operator : We do have a question from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is open. P.J. Juvekar: Given the delayed planting inventories in the channel, question on that, if I look at your inventories, they are up year-over-year, so, like, compared to second quarter of last year. So was there any missed early application that led to inventory increase? And where do we stand about inventories? The reason I'm asking is, couple of years ago we had this inventory situation in Brazil. That was painful and took some long time to get that inventories down. So how do you compare that situation? Pierre Brondeau : Sure. So first of all, let me make a comment outside of North America. We are in low to normal level of inventories. So we currently have a situation in Brazil. Actually, we have a new process in place, as we said before. I think it's the lowest ever level of inventory in the channel we are having. In other part of the world, we are under a more normal situation. We recognize that there was misapplication in North America. We are taking that into account in our forecast for the rest of the year where we have made plans which are contemplating not selling some product, which will already be in inventory and our customers or in the channel, or we have also accounted for returns. So that's a place where we are facing fundamental difference from Brazil in 2015. Brazil in 2015 was a consequence of a process from all of the ag players over multiple years. We had multiple years of selling too much into the channel. Here it's a more isolated event over this year, because of weather conditions. So we have a year which is difficult versus multiple years in 2015 where the channel was too loaded. So it is not good, but it is manageable, accounted for in our forecast. But we are still watching it. Mark, you want to say? MarkDouglas: Yes, PJ, the only nuance I would put to what Pierre said about the U.S. is, the U.S. for us is really two core markets, what we call the Heartland's, which is the Midwest, mainly row crop business. And then the Horseshoe, which stretches all the way from California through the Southern states up the East Coast, very different situation in those two markets. I would say, where we know we have or we think we have higher channel inventories, is in the Heartland on the row crops where we believe pre-emergent herbicides were missed in certain areas. But in the rest of the U.S., where all the niche crops are grown, we're in absolutely normal conditions. So it's very-very isolated to that part of the U.S. and that part of the business. P.J. Juvekar: And a quick one for Andrew. Andrew, you mentioned the extended terms of payments in the U.S. for growers; can you talk about when did we do that last time and what was your experience back then? Andrew Sandifer : Yes, we've done it on a very limited basis in the past. Our experience has always been that we catch right back up as agreed. Yes, I think, as I mentioned, over half the accommodations we gave in Q2 have already been paid at this point in Q3, and the rest will be cleared out by year-end. So really just trying to support our customers as they work through their quarter end, and what's been a tough year. But historically, in this year, I think no concerns about the collection time and timing our ability on that. Pierre Brondeau : And just a quick comment, PJ. I mean, we made that decision, it is not something we've done in the past or we used to do, it was just exceptional to the - especially in the Midwest, our customers were facing a situation where we felt we had to support them. Lots of them, as we said, are big corporations. They live by their word. They pay when they say they will repay and as Andrew say, as half of it has already been done with a very precise schedule. So, no concern. It's an exceptional situation, but no concern on this. Operator : Next we move on to the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : A question on the CapEx potential expansion diamide, just wondering, is that decision a function of, sort of, your assessment of how much incremental inventory you want to have for your own needs or is it a function of, perhaps as you referenced in the patent discussion, maybe extending some of the license agreements or creating new license agreements with other interested parties or is it bit of both? And is this a significant capital expenditure? What time period would it be over and potentially where would it be located? Andrew Sandifer : The CapEx increase, we are, looking at today are simply due to the fact that when we made our capital, three-year capital spend plan when we acquired the DuPont business. As you remember, we were forecasting a high single-digit growth rates for those products. We've been in the 15% to 25% range since the acquisition. So we are getting tight on capacity. Those are not big capacity it's for part of the chain of manufacturing well, we're doing it. Especially, including some of the, the intermediate you\u2019re talking about of tens of millions of dollars you're not talking hundreds of millions of dollars, for the one which are taking place potentially this year. And as we said before, from a location standpoint we have a couple of locations, but as we said before, the idea for us is to manufacture you as much as we can today outside of China. So those expansions will take place outside of China. It's not huge, but it's necessary to ensure we can keep on growing at the speed at which we are growing. Vincent Andrews : And if I could just follow up there's been a lot written recently about armyworm infestation in new geographies. I would assume that is an attractive opportunity for your diamides\u2019 portfolio. So is that something you've already contemplated sort of as we think about your long-term growth rate or would that be incremental? Mark Douglas : Yes, it definitely is you know the diamides are right at the top of the tree when it comes to impacting for armyworm. We've seen the growth of these pests in India. We seen it in China and it's now moving through Southeast Asia, Vietnam, Thailand moving south. So we already have in our forecast, some incremental revenue from Rynaxypyr essentially - in those countries, but we believe there is more upside as this pest becomes more prevalent especially throughout the rest of South Asia. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go to line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joel Jackson : All right downgrade to one question. Thanks guys I'm just kidding. Okay, so you've got it down, the market growth to about flat. So on rough math to me that will be like a $100 million or $200 million gear, excuse me $120 million of headwinds on the topline macro pressures. You've maintained your guidance like you said despite that, could you talk about what's offsetting some of that pressure down on the macro? Thanks. Pierre Brondeau : Yes, you know, I think the pressure down in the market is mostly driven by North America as we said. So what does it do to us, if you look at the disproportionate strength of our business versus many competitors outside of North America plus the fact that within North America. We do have a very balanced crop profile with loss of specialty crops. The slowdown of the world growth in Ag is impacting us not as much as it could impact other competitors. So yes, it is a bit of a headwind, but what, we are very well positioned to compensate that other by growing more into specialty crops in North America or by using the strength of our business in place like Brazil, Latin America or India. Remember, as we said, we only do 25% of our business in North America. So all in all, it is balancing out quite well for us. Operator : Next, we go to the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead. Don Carson : Yes, Mark a question for you on these commercial arrangements you're negotiating with other parties you say you out of the 50 now. What is the margin profitability on that and then as you bifurcate that into supplying generic AI's post patent what's the margin implications for that versus selling it on branded product? Mark Douglas : So Don, we don't obviously give out the margin expectations. But what I put in my prepared remarks were the fact that when we have these agreements and we make these sales. They're not EBITDA dilutive to our overall business so when you think about it there are highly profitable marketing-exercise for us. Now on a pricing standpoint again, I'm not going to disclose the types of conditions we have in these various contracts, but they are very long-term in nature. And obviously the prices that we agreed with outside parties allow them to make a more than adequate margin on their sales. So both parties are compensated for what we're doing in the marketplace. So the bottom line is, these are highly attractive relationships for us and doubt that party partners and they are there for the long term. Pierre Brondeau : Let me quantify a bit by using information, we've already shared with you. As you know, we do have depending upon the quarters and EBITDA margin for this business in the 27%, 28%. This EBITDA margin of course is driven and we've said that when we made the acquisition of DuPont with the damage which are expected to be north of 30% from an EBITDA margin. That's what we are able, through this process to protect. So we are selling this product, the active part to a partner and it's generating for us with limited SG&A spending and R&D and formulation spending an EBITDA margin north of 30%. Operator : Next, we go to the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Laurence Alexander : Just one last one on the diamide discussion, as you've looked at the manufacturing chain that already exists for these products and FMC's historical approach to re-engineering the chain and finding new manufacturing partners. How should we think about the five to 10 year opportunity for bringing down the cost of manufacturing and should we see that in terms of lower market prices. So basically protecting the growth rate and protecting the margins, which we see it as margin expansion over time? Mark Douglas : Yes Lawrence, I mean we have our whole engineering group looking at the diamide manufacturing processes and looking at how we can bring cost down over the mid to long-term. So, that's certainly something that we're not going to let pass. We know how to do this we've done it very successfully - not only our own molecules, but other molecules as well. I wouldn't comment on this point about price volume relationships in the marketplace going longer term. In today's world, these molecules are highly valued. They produce tremendous results for their cost in use. So right now, we're growing the market at the right margin at the right price. I don't see that changing in the near term at all. So whatever we get in terms of manufacturing cost reductions over the mid-term will stay within FMC. Pierre Brondeau : And we've already done in two years, in two years we've already done multiple debottlenecking, brought new partners into the process. So we already actively increasing capacity at very low cost you've not seen a major increase so far in capital spending despite the fact that we've already increased our capacity in a significant way for diamide. So your point is correct for both Cyazypyr and Rynaxypyr. We are doing it and intend to continue to do it. Operator : And our last question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Kevin McCarthy : Thanks for squeezing me in a two-part question on your capital budget. The first part is that you affirmed your range for the year at 140 to 160 yet you spent only $34 million in the first half. Looks like the last couple of years the spend has been quite back end loaded. So I was wondering if you could speak to what is driving that kind of quarterly cadence, number one. And then number two, do you have any preliminary thoughts on how the budget could trend in 2020 versus 2019? Pierre Brondeau : So from a capital spending, I have been doing that for years now and I think it's been the same thing, year after year, which mean usually you start your big project, lots of your big projects are starting with - the beginning of the year, when you start with the new capital spending. So you usually highly process where there is a lot of planning an engineering study which do not represent a lot of spending. And then it accelerates by the middle of the year when things are already put in place and you start to spend the cash. So I don't think there is anything abnormal, I must say that 70% or 80% of my years in the industry yeah I have always seen back-end loaded, big engineering product and capital expenditure. I think from next year today, we have not been yet through the process. We believe we\u2019ll have a higher capital spend, mostly due to capacity increase for the product we are commercializing new products for the existing product as the diamide. Mark Douglas : Yes Kevin, the only thing - the attitude to what Pierre said is, basically we have two new active ingredients that are coming out of our pipeline that come to market in 2021. We're putting steel in the ground next year for that capacity expansion. So it's a combination of both current products and new pipeline products. Pierre Brondeau : So you will see a slightly limited number next year for capital spend. Michael Wherley : That's all the time that we have for the call today. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the FMC Corporation Conference Call. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect.",

All lines will be placed on listen-only mode throughout the conference. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer period. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Wherley, Director, Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Mr. Wherley, you may begin. Michael Wherley : Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Pierre Brondeau, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; Mark Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Here we will review FMC's third quarter performance and provide the outlook for the remainder of 2019. Mark will take an in-depth look at our Latin America business followed by Andrew, who will provide an overview of select financial results, we will then address your questions. The slide presentation that accompanies our results, along with our earnings release and our 2019 outlook statement are available on our website and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call. Finally, let me remind you that today's presentation and discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including but not limited to those factors identified in our press release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's understanding. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion and the supporting materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations and free cash flow, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that earnings shall mean adjusted earnings, and EBITDA shall mean adjusted EBITDA for all income statement references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website. With that I will now turn the call over to Pierre. Pierre Brondeau : Thank you Michael and good morning everyone. FMC continued to deliver strong financial performance in the third quarter and navigated difficult market conditions, particularly, in North America and Europe. This performance is consistent with prior quarters due to our unique blend of balanced geographic exposure, strong sales in specialty crops and the technology advantage portfolio. A good example of how all these elements drive strong growth is our diamide franchise that has grown 35% since we acquired the business two years ago. This growth was enabled by the previously mentioned elements in addition to robust commercial approach that has led to volume demand in previously untapped markets. We believe that our business is well positioned to consistently deliver strong growth. Turning to Slide 3, FMC reported more than $1 billion in third quarter revenue, which reflects a year-over-year increase of 10% on a reported basis and 12% organic growth excluding FX headwinds. This increase was mostly driven by double-digit organic growth in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, France, India, China and Pakistan, as well as, price increases across all regions. Adjusted company EBITDA was $219 million, an increase of 18% compared to recast financial from last year and $19 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Company EBITDA margins were 21.6% - 140 basis points year-over-year despite $42 million in combined headwinds from raw material costs and tariffs. Adjusted EPS was $0.94 in the quarter, an increase of 32% versus recast Q3 2018 and $0.14 above the midpoint of our guidance. The strong outperformance versus our guidance was driven primarily by higher volume and pricing, which led to a $0.125 beat on the EBITDA line. Moving now to third quarter revenue on Slide 4. Q3 revenue growth by 10% versus prior year with volume contributing 8% growth and pricing for another 4% growth. This was offset partially by a 2% headwind from FX. This was the third consecutive quarter that we posted year-over-year price increase in every region of the world. Our growth in Q3 was stronger than expected due to an forecasted demand opportunities. We saw no shift of demand from Q4 as a growth in the third quarter was due entirely to Q3 demand. As expected, Latin America made a 45% of third quarter revenue. Sales in Latin America grew 21% year-over-year or 22% organically, continuing the trend from the first half of 2019. We posted very strong growth across the region, driven by higher volumes and price increases. Our pricing actions more than offset the impact of FX. Demand was high for applications on cotton and sugarcane in Brazil. It is important to note that we continue to monitor channel inventory levels in Brazil, which are well controlled and in line with expectations for this point in the season. Our market access continues to improve in Argentina, which allows us to take advantage of increasing demand for a product, especially for Rynaxypyr insect control and Authority herbicides. Growth in Mexico came from more normal weather conditions compared to earlier in the year. Year-to-date, our sales in Latin America grew 29% organically. In EMEA, herbicide and insecticide demand drove year-over-year revenue growth of 4%, despite another very hot summer and fall. Demand for our new Battle Delta herbicide benefited from a stronger than predicted cereal market across Europe, led by France and Germany. Cyazypyr insect control continue to benefit from new country registrations. Price increases more than offset a full percent FX headwind. Organic growth was 8% in the quarter and stands at 10% year-to-date. In Asia, revenue increased 5% overall and 9% organically year-over-year. Following a strong Q2, India again delivered commercial outperformance driven by demand for insecticides to combat fall armyworm as well as share gains in the rice granule market with the Rynaxypyr based for Terra insecticides. Cyazypyr insect control was also strong on fruits and vegetables. We continue to benefit in India from a new commercial organization structure which we put in place about a year ago. We also had significant revenue growth in Pakistan, driven by strength in the diamide demand and new product introductions. Year-to-date, our sales in Asia grew 7% organically, excluding significant FX headwind across many currencies. In North America, revenue was down 3% year-over-year in a seasonally smallest quarter. As expected, we saw reduced demand for herbicides in the Midwest and Canada as the weather issues this spring resulted in higher channel inventories of those products. This was partially offset by continued price increases and by share gains for diamides for specialty crop applications. Despite the extreme weather related challenges in this region, our year-to-date sales in North America are up 1%. Turning to Slide 5. Third quarter EBITDA was $219 million, a year-over-year increase of 18% compared to recast results from Q3 2018. Price increases in all regions and volume demand in Latin America, Asia and EMEA were drivers of these very strong performance. Looking ahead at the full-year earnings outlook, we are raising full year guidance for 2019. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $4.58 billion to $4.62 billion. Total company adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.22 billion. We are also raising our guidance for 2019 adjusted earnings to a range of $5.80 to $5.90 per diluted share. EPS estimates include the impact of $300 million in share repurchases completed year-to-date through September 30th as well as, an additional $100 million in share repurchases expected in Q4 2019. Fourth quarter revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.17 billion to $1.21 billion, representing 8% growth at the midpoint compared to recast fourth quarter 2018. Total fourth quarter company adjusted EBITDA is now forecasted to be in the range of $300 million to $320 million, representing a 13% increase at the midpoint versus recast Q4. We expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.46 to $1.56 in the fourth quarter, representing an increase of 3% at the midpoint versus recast 2018 and assuming diluted shares outstanding of approximately $130.5 million. Year-over-year EPS growth will be constrained by the very low tax rate in Q4, 2018. Looking at the global market. For the crop protection products, we continue to expect 2019 will be flat on a US dollar basis compared to 2018. We expect the Latin American market to grow in the high single-digit and the North American market to be down in the mid-single digits. We expect both EMEA and Asia market to be flat-to-down low-single digits. Our forecast for the Asian market is slightly reduced due to the strengthening of the US dollar over the past few months. This market forecast does not change our expectation that FMC will continue to deliver financial outperformance related to the market. Turning now to a full-year EBITDA bridge and revenue drivers on Slide 7. The main driver of the improved forecast is volume gains, which now contribute 17% year-over-year EBITDA growth. Pricing actions around the globe are expected to offset about two-third of the combined cost and FX headwinds. Supply from China has improved throughout the year, but some challenges remain. The last of strategic toolers that was inspected by the recent shutdown in China is set to restart its production in two weeks. I will also like to highlight the full-year revenue drivers. We now expect revenue growth of 7% overall and 11% organically. Both the volume and pricing gains have been consistent through the year. As a reminder this full-year growth of - in 2019 follows organic growth of approximately 13% in 2018 on a pro forma basis. Moving to Slide 8. We provide the key drivers for EBITDA and revenue growth in Q4. As stated earlier, we saw no shift in demand from Q4 into Q3. In fact, we raised our Q4 revenue guidance by $15 million at the midpoint, however, we reduced our EBITDA against for the quarter by $10 million at the midpoint, due to higher costs and less favorable FX benefit as compared to our July guidance. The positive combined impact over Q4 EBITDA from volume and price mix is exactly the same as we showed in our prior guidance. Fourth quarter performance will be driven by strong volume growth in all regions. Included in this volume are new product launches, which are expected to deliver about $20 million of total revenue growth of $90 million in the quarter. These launches include Lucento fungicide, insecticide biofungicide in North America. And Cyazypyr insect control in South Africa, Malaysia and Vietnam. Pricing actions are expected to fully offset the FX headwinds at the revenue level. We would also like to highlight the rapid growth of Cyazypyr insect control, which has become our fastest growing molecule and is now our fourth largest by revenue. Forecasted 2019 sales of Cyazypyr insect control are expected to be around $300 million driven by registration in new countries and crops. I will now turn the call over to Mark to take an in-depth look at our Latin America business. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Pierre. Turning to Slide 9. It has been some time since we reviewed our regions in depth. We thought it would be appropriate to start with Latin America, since that is one of our key markets in the second half of the year. It is our largest region by annual revenue and as margins in line with the rest of the world. Over the next few minutes I will walk you through the business and highlight our country exposure, as well as crop diversity. In addition, our review our go-to-market strategies and market shares as well as discuss growth drivers for the coming years. And last of all, I will explain some of the key factors that are driving much higher margins than we had five years ago in this region. In the Latin American North sub region our annual revenue was approximately $130 million to $140 million with Mexico delivering the vast majority of that revenue. In a market that is only grown 1% over the past few years, we have increased our market share to approximately 9%, as we have grown our business by double-digits over the same period. Our route to market is generally through local distribution and retail companies. We have a strong presence in the corn market and we are market leader in several specialty crop markets, where our innovative products help protect fruits and vegetables, that will be exported to the US and Europe. We sell the full range of crop protection products in Mexico, but we have a leading market position in insecticides. Our portfolio is also complemented by a growing plant health business, particularly biologicals, which represents approximately 5% of our business in the country. Our Mexican organization also supports our team in Central America, where we work with distributors in all countries for sales into specialty crops such as bananas. Moving South, we come to the Andean sub-region comprised of Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru. This sub-region is our smallest and least penetrated in Latin America, with revenues of only $15 million to $20 million. We have less than a 5% share of this market, which is mainly focused on a variety of specialty crops including bananas, flowers, rice and avocados. Our growth is coming from new distributor relationships, which we're improving our grow reach and exposure. Turning to the South Cone sub region where we have revenue of approximately $200 million from Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Bolivia and Uruguay. We have a market share of approximately 6%. Argentina is the most significant contributor of revenue in the sub region and in 2019, it is expected to be FMC's fourth largest country globally. Our Argentinean business is focused on row crops with a major emphasis on soybeans, which account for about 70% of our revenue in the country. Over the last three years, we've undertaken a major transformation of the business moving from an exclusive distribution partnership to now, a wholly-owned subsidiary that sells to multiple distribution and retail companies. Today, our sales and technical representatives are present in all the major production areas of the country. Our Authority brand pre-emergent herbicides are market-leading and continue to show strong growth as glyphosate resistance builds across the country. We also sell a broad range of insecticides and fungicides into these markets. Our products are also used on corn, sunflower, wheat and specialty crops, such as the growing wine segment. Chile is an important country for fruit and vegetable crops. Similar to the US, the key to access the Chilean market is to partner with a few large national distributors, a model we have successfully transitioned to over the past few years. Finally, Brazil, our largest country from a revenue perspective. Represents about 20% to 22% of our total company sales and remains an extremely important to our long-term growth plans. We have about 9% market share, which was approximately $10.5 billion in 2018. We've had a direct commercial presence in Brazil for decades covering all the major regions. Today, we have approximately 700 employees in the country, of which 300 are agronomists. These agronomists focus on demand generation, both directly with growers and by partnering with retailers to help growers find solutions for their problems. We have leading positions in the sugarcane and cotton markets, and serve growers and sugar mills either directly or through alliances and cooperatives. We are also one of the top three players in citrus, rice, coffee and tobacco. As we expand our market access, we have seen soybeans and corn become our fastest growing segments. We have developed multiple routes to access these large yet fragmented markets in Brazil. This access enables direct sales to the very large growers in the Cerrado area mainly Mato Grosso and Goias. We also have partnerships with regional retailers throughout the country and long lasting relationships with virtually all the leading cooperatives. These co-op started in the south serving soybean, corn, coffee wheat and sugar crops, but are also expanding into the Cerrado area. They are very important relationships for our growth. As we advance our market access initiatives, we've also paved the way for future launches of new products out of our pipeline, especially for row crops. And finally, we are also a leading player in the biological segment, particularly, bionematicides has quickly taken substantial market share in sugarcane and most recently in coffee, since it was launched for the 2018 growing season. Presence bionematicide was launched at the same time and has grown very fast as a seed treatment on soybean and cotton. Combined Quartzo and Presence bionematicide cover a broad range of crops and provide nematode control both in furrow applications in permanent crops and seed treatment in annual row crops, completely replacing older synthetic chemistries. We have a growing pipeline of new biological products that will allow further growth opportunities. Turning to Slide 10. You can see in the table in the upper left that FMC's Latin American business is expected to grow revenue by about $400 million from $1 billion in 2017 to approximately $1.4 billion in 2019. The map on this page highlights the breadth of coverage we have across the region. In addition to FMC being a much larger company in Latin America than we were a few years ago, we believe we are a market leader in the way we proactively address structural market challenges, particularly in Brazil since 2015. Our disciplined business practices are driving our outperformance and position FMC to continue to thrive in the region. As you may recall, we took four broad actions in the 2015 to 2016 to better position our business in Brazil and to raise profitability. First, we reduced our cost base and restructured our business to better match market conditions at the time. Second, we became more disciplined in our sales process, mainly with sales terms and cash collection. Third, we eliminated sales of low value products from our portfolio, selling only products where FMC was able to achieve acceptable financial returns. And fourth , we significantly reduced the amount of FMC products in the distribution channels. These actions dramatically improve the performance of the business beginning in 2017. When you layer in the significant benefits that came with the recent acquisition from portfolio enhancements to customer access to R&D capabilities and a deeper pipeline, you can understand why we are confident about our potential to continue to grow in this region. As you know, Latin America can be a volatile region in terms of markets and currencies. However, we have put in place several proactive levers to ensure our business growth is sustainable. These include diligently tracking channel inventory on a monthly basis in Brazil to keep it at a low level, implementing a lead hedging program to mitigate FX risk in Brazil. Borrowing in local currency practical to reduce currency exposures. Robust pricing process to quickly react to local currency volatility, building a team of credit specialist to assess credit worthiness of potential customers and to limit sales when necessary. And finally, utilizing more collateral and barter arrangement to mitigate collection risk. All these factors helped to create a Latin American business with earnings margins to be comparable our margins in other regions. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks Mark. Let me start this morning with a few specific income statement items. Interest expense for the quarter was $5.5 million higher than implied by our prior full year guide, primarily due to higher than anticipated foreign borrowings, additional interest resulting from the refinancing completed in September, as well as, slightly higher than anticipated commercial paper balances in rates. Interest expense for the full year is now expected to be in the range of $153 million to $157 million. We revised our expected adjusted effective tax rate for the full year to 14% to 15%, reflecting our updated expectations for earnings by jurisdiction. With this change in full year expectations, the resulting adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was 12.6%. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the third quarter was $131.6 million, down nearly 5 million shares versus the prior-year period, reflecting the benefit of the $500 million in share repurchases we've made over the past four quarters. EPS growth was particularly robust in the third quarter. Lower share count taxes and minority interest more than offset higher interest expense to expand EPS growth to 32% versus the 18% growth in EBITDA. As Pierre outlined earlier, we are expecting very strong financial performance in the fourth quarter with revenue growing 8% and EBITDA growing 13% at the midpoint of our guidance range. Expected EPS growth of 3% is muted by a very low tax rate in the prior-year period, which resulted from a year-end true-up of the full year tax rate last year. Moving the balance sheet and debt. In September, FMC raised $1.5 billion of new debt equally weighted across 7-year, 10-year and 30-year maturities. We use the majority of the proceeds to immediately reduce both term loan debt and commercial paper balances. We will use the remaining proceeds to redeem $300 million in senior notes maturing in the fourth quarter. As all proceeds are being used to pay off other debt this offering will be leverage neutral. However, we successfully extended the maturity profile of our debt at attractive rates. Further, the offering was 4.5x oversubscribed, which is the Company had not been to the bond markets in some time was a strong endorsement of FMC strength in the eyes of fixed income investors. Gross debt as of September 30th was $3.6 billion, up roughly $360 million from the end of June. After adjusting for the $300 million in remaining proceeds from the September debt offering that are held aside for the retirement for - of our 2019 senior notes in the fourth quarter, gross debt to trailing 12 month EBITDA at quarter end was 2.8x. This is above our targeted leverage of 2.5x due to some shifts in working capital across quarters versus our initial forecast and the timing of share repurchases. We continue to expect to see leverage drop to 2.5x or lower at year-end, a level at which we would expect to remain at or below on average through 2020 and beyond. Turning to Slide 11. Adjusted cash from operations was $301 million for the third quarter. Despite strong earnings and collections, cash from operations was somewhat lower than expected due to payables. Payables were negatively impacted in the quarter by purchases made from alternate suppliers to limit the impact of disruptions from Chinese suppliers. Payable terms with our Chinese suppliers are generally longer than the temporary terms with these alternate suppliers. This situation will naturally reverse in the fourth quarter as we rebuild payables with Chinese suppliers and enter into longer-term arrangements with alternate suppliers. Capital spending accelerated in the quarter as expected, while legacy and transformation spending was largely in line with expectations. Resulting in free cash flow before dividends and repurchases of $198 million. We are maintaining our full year guidance for free cash flow of $375 million to $475 million. This implies very strong cash from operations in the fourth quarter, given our cash generation year-to-date and our expectations for capital spending and legacy and transformation costs. Cash from operations will be driven by robust profitability and working capital release, including the expected improvement in payables. We continue to explore a smaller product line acquisition and may accelerate the start of certain capital investments to support the rapid growth of our diamides platform. These opportunities if pursued would reduce full year free cash flow somewhat that they would further reinforce our growth trajectory. We have repurchased 3.7 million FMC shares year-to-date at an average price of $80.95 for a total of approximately $300 million including 1.1 million shares purchased in the third quarter. We intend to be a regular purchaser of FMC shares. Although we have not purchased any shares since quarter-end, we intend to purchase an additional $100 million of FMC shares during Q4, bringing the full year total to $400 million. Our full year EPS guidance reflects the benefit of anticipated repurchases in the fourth quarter, so this benefit is modest given the limited be remaining time in the year. Before turning the call back to Pierre. Let me also give a quick update on progress in implementing our new SAP S4 HANA ERP system . After successful go live in Brazil in July, the third quarter was the first quarter in which we closed with roughly 20% of the Company on the new system. The close was uneventful and our Brazil team is excited about the many new tools and capabilities of S4 HANA. We expect to exit the TSAs in February when we will go live with S4 HANA across the acquired business. The remainder of the Company will migrate to S4 HANA later in the year 2020. The new system will thoroughly modernize our business process environment, delivering meaningful near-term benefits and providing us a platform for driving further improvement in the future. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Pierre. Pierre Brondeau : Thank you, Andrew. In December 2018 we shared a five-year plan with annual sales growth of 5% to 7%, EBITDA growth of 7% to 9% and EPS growth about 10% per year. Based on our guidance for Q4, we expect to deliver at the high end of the range in the first year and expect to meet our objectives in the remaining four years of the plan. We continue our focus of driving strong growth for technology. In 2019, we expect about $16 million over total revenue growth of $315 million will come from new product. Our discovery and new product pipeline are advancing as expected. Two new molecules have moved from discovery to development in 2019 including an insecticide in January and herbicide in October. These are significant steps in advancing products toward commercial launch. We are pleased with the performance of the Company. We delivered another strong quarter and are expecting strong year. Our technology advantage portfolio, geographical balance, crop exposure and diversified product seeing continued to drive our financial outperformance. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Thank you very much for your attention. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead. P.J. Juvekar: Mark, very helpful overview on Latin America. If I look at your Latin American market share. It's all less than 10%. So, that seems like a big opportunity in the future. How do these market shares compared to other mature markets and what - how would you characterize the opportunity there? Mark Douglas : Yes, P.J., I think you're right, when we look at Latin America, we do see continued opportunity to grow and take market share. I think obviously was strong in Brazil in certain segments, as I highlighted, but frankly as we've introduced our pipeline across the region, we see growth opportunities outside of Brazil that will raise our market share, in particular, places like Argentina where frankly, we didn't have great market access. But now we have and we're seeing that accelerated growth, not only on the big soy business, as I talked about, but on some of the more specialty crops as well. I think those margins - sorry those market shares in some of the other regions outside of Brazil are lower than some of our more established markets to be expected, given our market access. So, yes, I mean, I said it in the script that Latin America will be a major driver of our growth going over this five-year plan and beyond. We see no reason that that won't continue to accelerate given where we think portfolio fits. And more importantly, the market access that we continue to build across the region. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Chris Parkinson : You highlight a few implied 4Q cash flow drivers on Slide 11 of your presentation, in fact, strong collections presumably in LatAm as well as some inventory discipline. Just can you highlight on what degree of confidence or general line of sight do you already have into these improvements. And how we as investors should be thinking about these better conversion into next year as well as into 2021, just the key puts and takes. Thank you. Andrew Sandifer : This is Andrew, let me just give you some quick comments on the cash flow for Q4. Certainly collections are expected to be robust in Q4. They'll actually be driven more out of Europe and Asia in terms of the seasonal build receivables - we see build a receivables in LatAm in Q4 with the entry into the new season. So, yes, in terms of line of sight there, we feel very confident in the collection forecast for Europe and Asia. In North America, there is some collections, there's also prepays and rebates systems and puts and takes in the quarter there. I think when we look at inventories, we've been very, very focused on managing our inventories this year. It is a place where we have opportunity as we get better systems and better visibility with our new SAP system to drive further efficiencies. But we feel confident in our inventory forecast for the full year. I think the payable situation, we mentioned in the prepared comments, just some short-term impacts from having to use alternate suppliers with shorter payment terms during the middle of the year, that will reverse as we go into the end of the year. We can see that as we're building payables with our more traditional suppliers in longer term. So all in all, I think, yes, it is a large release of working capital in Q4, but we think we have very good visibility there. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly : I think the biggest question that we're getting from investors now is on the legacy and transformation costs, which were such a huge drag on free cash. Can you help us understand how those begin to roll off across 2020 and 2021? Andrew Sandifer : Hi, it's Andrew again Mark. Certainly understand the questions there, and I think it's a key part of our long-term cash conversion improvement story is managing these legacy and transformation costs. For this year, we've guided legacy and transformation costs of $200 million to $250 million of that, about $100 million of it is true legacy costs, which are some of these environmental and other liabilities that are part of our long heritage is a previously very diversified conglomerate. Those are a very - those are pretty stable, pretty predictable, but they're not going away. Next $150 million which is really the transformation spending, its a combination of finishing the integration of the DuPont acquisition and the work we're doing around the Company to implement the SAP S4 HANA system. Yeah, that's the additional $100 million to $150 million that you see this year. That spending should step down materially in 2020 but will not go away. And then in 2021. I would expect that spending to go to a very low level. As we move to a different phase of more steady-state operation. So when you think about our cash conversion in the way we've spoken about it as a - as a percentage of our adjusted earnings and net income that $150 million in transformation spending relative to the roughly 770 and net income we're forecasting for this year that alone would be a 15% increase in cash conversion for the Company. So, you will see some benefit in 2020, but the most substantial benefit you'll see in 2021. We'll also continue working on working capital improvements and just the growth of the underlying operating cash flow to drive up that cash generation. Operator : Your next question is from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : I was hoping you could provide a little bit of color just on cost trends as we go into 4Q and kind of what that implies into 2020? How raw material costs have been tracking, kind of, some of the impacts of the supply disruptions in China and potentially moving past that and kind of where cost inflation is just an aggregate level is for 4Q and into the first half of the year? Pierre Brondeau : Yes, certainly. I think the dual comment I would make around cost is it has been continuing into the second half of the year maybe beyond what we were expecting at the beginning of the year. As you see on our guidance for EBITDA, it will have adverse costs in the fourth quarter of $40 million with - about the same number for the Q3 EBITDA $39 million. So, all in all, the two together, close to $80 million where we had about $100 million in the first half. So we had a continuation of the cost, mostly due to the channel disruption and some of the toolers shutdown. As we said in our prepared remarks, we expect our last the strategic tooler to be back on stream in a couple of weeks. So, most of the major partners and suppliers will be back on track. So if I think those comments now and extrapolate 2020 and maybe - I'll use that to give you carryovers on 2020. 2020 we believe will be a year of directionally at the global level, a bit equivalent to 2019 but with some differences. I think in 2019 we had Latin America growing very fast in the high single digits. So difficult to expect another year at this level, so we could see Latin America slightly in lower in growth than in 2019. On the other hand, we could see North America seeing better condition and we have a negative mid-single digit for 2019. So we could expect 2020 to be stronger. So all in all, may be slightly slower in Latin America, faster in North America balancing out and they're actually same thing for Europe and Asia. If you look at what we talked about cost. Cost in 2020 will be a tailwind. They will be favorable more versus 2019. That being said they will not be favorable to the extent we're thinking at the beginning of the year because we saw a continuation of those cost into the year - into the second half of 2019 and that will impact the cost of a product into 2020. FX, a bit too early for us to look at where it's going to go next year. If I put all of them together a five-year plan, revenue growth in the 5% to 7%, EBITDA growth in the 7% to 9% and EPS growth over 10% seems to be quite achievable and - for 2020 year. Operator : Your next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : The comments on the Asian market decelerating versus expectation due to foreign exchange. Is that a function of actual decline in takeaway at the end-user or grower level or is that just sort of management of working capital by the intermediaries in the supply chain? Mark Douglas : Yes, Vincent, it's Mark. Bit of both actually. Asia is such a big part of the world that you have different conditions around Asia, I'll give you a quick run around us, as I see it today. Australia, very, very difficult market extremely dry not in good shape at all. Indonesia in much better position somewhat elevated channel inventories, but not everywhere. Monsoons were pretty good in India, we had - we have a very good business in India. Channel inventories at normal levels. China, difficult market in China, a lot going on, a lot of movement going on in terms of companies repositioning themselves. Channel inventory is okay, some areas slightly high. Rest of Southeast Asia very good. Pakistan, very good for us, very good season. So, I think that declined generally as a part of what Pierre said is the currency impacts that we've seen over the last few months, but part, is some of the - some of the actions in some countries to make sure that everybody is on top of their business. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Laurent Favre with Exane. Please go ahead. Laurent Favre : Yes, good morning, bit of a mid-term question from me, please on insecticides. We're hearing a bit more on phase out for use of the organophosphates. And I'm just wondering for you guys, do you see it as an opportunity to grow share in diamides? Or do you think that - those phase-outs are more likely to switch over to Japan than diamides. Thank you. Mark Douglas : Yes, Laurent, some of the product you're talking about, the diamides actually particularly, the Cyazypyr would have a fit in that market, but it is a more of a low value market than where the diamides traditionally would fit. So, yes, there could be an upside, but whether we would want to take it and I don't know at this point. We do have other chemistries though in our portfolio where we're very strong such as the pyrethroids which fit very well. So we do see those organophosphate that are going away, the marketing and commercial teams do see it as a potential upside for us in the coming years. Operator : Your next question is from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : I was intrigued by the comment that the access - the market access to Argentina has been improved. Can you talk about how specifically and what are the implications for 2020 growth and beyond? Pierre Brondeau : Yes, thanks Franck, I'll let Mark any addition, but it's quite a simple situation from a market access for us. We use - couple of years ago we used to hit through a - an exclusive arrangements with a distribution company in which we had an equity participation. So we were not fully running market access and we were very dependent upon a distributor. We broke that relationship and do you have an organization today, which is in direct relation with the - the market in Argentina. So we've changed our structure to a structure, which is much more similar to what we have in other parts of Latin America and Brazil or other countries in the world, which is a direct FMC market access with the larger and maybe more traditional organization. Mark if you want to add anything on this? Mark Douglas : Yes. In addition to what Pierre said Frank, we had that traditional relationship than we bought Cheminova which gave us some market access as well. And then the DuPont assets came along and we had further market access. So we had a very complex situation where we essentially had three organizations that we had to bring together. We've got through all of that now. And in fact, Pierre and I were down in Argentina about three weeks ago and I have to say the growth we're seeing today frankly, I think it will continue to accelerate as we go over the next three-year to five-year period. The team is really uncovering a lot of growth opportunities. And the portfolio fits very well in Argentina. So it's a highlight for us. It's a country that we're focused on. We're investing in more resources, so expect to hear more about it from us. Pierre Brondeau : I think when you think about the question from PJ at the beginning around market share. Clearly, Argentina for us, when you look at the blend of changing market access together with portfolio that is going to be a place where we do have great opportunities in the future. Operator : Your next question is from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joel Jackson : Maybe give a little more color on some of the - where you've got progress right now on possibly expanding diamide production over the next little while. And also, do you have any progress on possibly locking in some customers or competitors on some longer term agreements to produce Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr for them. Thanks. Mark Douglas : So, Joel, just you cut out a little bit. Did you say the diamide capacity? Pierre Brondeau : We received the beginning of your question, we missed the end. Joel Jackson : Yes, just, sorry so, diamide production you talked about possibly expanding more, you have to get a little bit of color on this - maybe give a little bit more into what will decide the timing? And then longer term, have you guys made any progress on locking in some arrangements or some terms that you may lock into for producing Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr for customers and competitors. Thanks. Mark Douglas : Yes, diamides, well we spent the last two years basically, debottlenecking what we - what we acquired. And I have to say the supply chain group of manufacturing have done an excellent job in feeding us more diamides and allowing us to continue that growth trajectory over the last couple of years. We are looking now at what excess capacity do we need to build for our next phase of growth. So, that is not something that's hitting right now, but it is certainly something as we alluded to on the capital front that we're looking at. I think the other - the other aspect of this is what you were alluding to where we talked last time about the relationships that we're building. We are progressing those relationships and I obviously can't - I can't speak to them in detail, given the confidentiality nature. But suffice to say that they are moving forward and we're very pleased with where we are with the breadth of those diamide potential relationships and actual relationships. One thing I would like to add around the growth of the diamides, some of you will remember back in 2018. I talked about, part of the aspect of the growth that we were seeing was the fact that we had about 200 registrations and label expansions that we were looking at that would allow us to increase our market space and allow the growth to continue. Where we are today? Out of that 200, about 100 of those registrations and label expansions are now in place. So, hence you see when we talk about places like Vietnam, like Malaysia, like say Cyazypyr in the Philippines. We now have registrations that we didn't have before, so that naturally opens up new markets for us and accelerates the growth. Something that we've put in place over the last 18 months is not only the fact that we originally had 200 and 100 of those are now real. We now have another 240 registration and label expansions on top of what we had at the beginning of 2018. So, if you think about it in terms of how we see our market expansion different crops, different pests, different geographies that growth will continue to go for the next 5, 10 plus years easily given what we see from a registration and label expansion. Pierre Brondeau : And that's a comment made by Mark relates very well to the comment in the prepared remarks around Cyazypyr being now the fourth largest molecule, really the fastest growing molecule and close with $300 million, great growth potential here. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Steve Byrne : Yes. The two big seed companies have recently rolled out some bundles in the US market where there - they're bundling their seed position with farmers to also drive crop chemical sales and I just wondered if you're seeing any evidence of that the distributor or retail level where there could be a shift over to those chemistries. You mentioned lower pre-emergent herbicide sales in the US in our third quarter. I would assume that's not demand for pounds on the ground product, but channel refilling and whether there is anything going on there with respect to dynamics in the market? Mark Douglas : Yes Steve, it's a good question. First of all, there are programs being rolled out, but nobody knows all the details of them yet. So, it's a bit of a premature - it's a bit of a premature question to say how will it impact. And there are some high level views of what those programs look like. Let's be clear, I mean, we have very, very strong relationships with major distributors in the US. Those major distributors continue to show very strong partnerships with us, given the growth rates that we have, especially around our new technologies. We also have very strong programs in place, the FMC Freedom Pass program in the US has many different aspects to it that allow us to reward both retailers and growers for using our products on various different acres and crops. The advantage that we have, we're not tied to anybody's seeds. You can use whoever seeds you want and we will provide the best chemistry. So, certainly we have seen no impact on those programs this year. And I can tell you, given where the commercial groups are next year with regards to growth of new products and especially on the specialty crops, we don't think that's going to have an impact at all in our business in the US. Pierre Brondeau : I just would like to reinforce what Mark said. Mark and I, we spend a large amount of time with our customers in the US and the big retailers. I can tell you with no doubt the retail world in the US welcome a crop chemical company, which is focused on those product biologicals and chemicals with no seed and which is agnostic to the seed and doesn't bundled product. It's been repeated to us over and over. If anything today, I would say it's one of the strength. The fact that we do not have seeds and one of the driver of growth. Steve Byrne : And any comments on the pre-emergent herbicide sales in the third quarter. Mark Douglas : No, it's pretty much what we expected actually. We knew we had channel inventory there. It's still too early to say how the next season will go. We're not even in discussions yet around what will happen in Q4 and Q1 for that business. I think you know we have class-leading chemistry with our Authority brands and what's more important out of those Authority brands, the very high end of those brands, the ones that have the highest technology they're the ones that are the fastest growing. So, not all pre-emergents are made equal and we do participate across the whole spectrum, but have a lot of products at the very high end. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan : Just wanted to ask about the price mix and the cost bridge. So in 2019, it looks like you got like $156 million on price mix that's your expectation for the full year and negative $185 million on cost. Maybe you can just help us and provide a little bit more detail next year, you see some of the $150 million from TSA and SAP would roll off. I'm curious on the raw side how much of that you would get potentially get back, I know you said it would be less. But how much of that would you get back. And then price mix if you're not getting back as much, do you expect a little bit better performance out off price mix. Thanks. Pierre Brondeau : Appreciate your question because its an important question, but it's a bit too early for us to really state the raw material impact next year. Particularly, the adverse impact it's going to be - we believe it's going to be a tailwind compared to the number we had this year in term of the $180 million cost we were facing. But it's a bit early, we are still digging through the numbers. Looking at the impact of our major total restarting in a couple of weeks. We will have a lots of detail in the forecast at the February call, but difficult to assess that number. We will adjust as we always do. Our pricing strategy to the currency situation and to - and to the cost, we are seeing, but we need another few weeks to be able to see those numbers. Arun Viswanathan : Then just as a quick follow-up. Latin America now 31% of your revenue or so this year, that's kind of ebb and flow. And do you still expect kind of a 25% make up across your regions for each in the ensuing years or will Latin America continue to be your largest region? Thanks. Mark Douglas : Yes, I think you know we often talk about that geographic balance, I think this year obviously Latin America had an accelerated year. So it's, as you said, I think it's 30%, 31%. I would expect over time, it stays in that range. It is one of the largest markets in the world. One of the fastest growing, it's one of the only places on earth where you have more land that can be turned to agriculture mainly from converting pasture land to agriculture in Brazil. So you're obviously going to have that impact. I would say though that longer-term Asia will also continue to grow rapidly, especially for us given our excellent portfolio on fruit and vegetables and the other crops in India and Southeast Asia, especially. So I think you might see a little more balancing with Asia. North America and Europe, I expect pretty much steady as it goes in those sort of ratios. Pierre Brondeau : At any point, any year you could have one region going - sort of taking a stronger position. I think this balances out in over the years. North America, we don't expect the year - next year to be as bad as this year. I mean we think would happen. But really was a very negative year in North America and very favorable situation, Latin America. That could reverse next year at any point. So, all in all, it should balance. As Mark said Asia we should not underestimate the potential we have in India. India is a very large country with us. The portfolio and the new commercial structure we have in place is going to create significant growth opportunities in the future. So, all of these to say that these 25% region over the year should remain in this kind of a range. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Chris Kapsch with Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Chris Kapsch : You did address my question about the dynamics in North America and headed into the 2020 year, sanguine view about prospects. Just I guess, one nuance on that though is, I understand the strong relationships with the channel partners that you referenced is - is it just also just a function of your sort of de minimis relative to the broader market exposure to the row crop and addressing the horseshoe part of the North American market? And just visibility of the competitive dynamic based on channel inventories going into 2020. Any comments on that? Mark Douglas : Yes, it's pretty much as you said, Chris, when you think about it. Soybeans, obviously important to us, but we're not on every acre of soybean where you have strong wheat resistance you're going to see our Authority products. Certainly as you said in the horseshoe California all the way around the south of the East Coast where you have specialty crops. We have a superb portfolio, to fix there and continue to grow. So you're going to have that different type of mix from FMC, which is different to as you said, some of the other companies that have a very large row crop exposure that's advantageous to our distribution partners and retail partners. We offer them products that are very different and a different type of mix. So yes, we do consider North America to be a very, very important market for us with a lot of growth opportunities. Chris Kapsch : And then just one follow-up on Latin America and Argentina, specifically. You had pretty bullish comments about gaining share over time there given better access. Can you just talk about the obviously this recent election that the result with signal a couple of months ago, and the peso was devalued on the preliminary results. Just any influence that has on your operations your ability to execute a growth plan in that country. Thanks. Andrew Sandifer : It's Andrew, Chris, I think, its a good question. I think with Argentina and the market is for our products is US dollar denominated, they are some delays in collections that can create a little bit of FX exposure. But yes, while there would certainly be challenges with future - likely future devaluation Argentina. We think it's quite manageable. It is - the issues around capital controls et cetera are also quite manageable for us in terms of bringing in pretty necessary crop inputs. So it's something we watch very closely, but not something we're overly concerned about at this point. Michael Wherley : All right. That's all the time we have for the call today. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the FMC Corporation conference call. Thank you.",

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Wherley, Director of Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. You may now begin. Michael Wherley : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Pierre Brondeau, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Douglas, President and CEO-Elect; and Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Pierre will review FMC's fourth quarter and full-year performance, then Andrew will provide an overview of select financial results and then Mark will discuss the Company's 2020 outlook. We will then address your questions. The slide presentation that accompanies our results, along with our earnings release in our 2020 outlook statement are available on our website, and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call. Finally, let me remind you that today's presentation and discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including, but not limited to those factors identified in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's understanding. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion and the supporting materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations and free cash flow, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that earnings shall mean adjusted earnings, and EBITDA shall mean adjusted EBITDA for all income statement references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre. Pierre Brondeau : Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. FMC's strong financial performance continued in the fourth quarter, capping an excellent year for the company. Our performance was marked by volume growth across all regions and once again highlighted the benefit of a balanced geographic exposure, the strength of our portfolio and the impact of new product launches. Turning to Slide 3. FMC reported $1.2 billion in fourth quarter revenue, which reflect the year-over-year increase of 9% on a reported basis and 11% organic growth, excluding FX headwinds. This increase was driven by double-digit organic growth in Argentina, Canada, France, Russia, India, China, Indonesia and Pakistan as well as price increases across all regions except North America. Adjusted company EBITDA was $320 million, an increase of 17% compared to the prior year period and at the top-end of our guidance. Company EBITDA margins were about 27%, up 180 basis points year-over-year, despite $28 million in combined headwinds from raw material costs, tariffs, and FX in the quarter. Adjusted EPS was $1.76 in the quarter, an increase of 21% versus recast Q4 2018. The year-over-year performance was driven largely by a $0.34 increase on the EBITDA line and the benefit of reduced share count, partially offset by higher interest expenses. Compared to a most recent guidance, adjusted EPS was also much higher due to very strong operational performance as higher volume and solid cost control drove $0.07 outperformance versus guidance, while much lower-than-forecasted tax rate in the quarter resulted in $0.21 of the beat versus guidance. Moving now to Slide 4. Q4 revenue grew by 7% versus prior year with volume contributing 11% growth, offset partially by a 2% headwind from FX. Overall price was flat as increased rebates in North America offset strong pricing in the other three regions. Given the start of the Southern Hemisphere season, Latin America made up over 40% over fourth quarter revenue. Sales in Latin America grew 10% year-over-year or 13% organically, driven by very strong growth in Argentina and single-digit growth in Brazil and Mexico. Argentina posted significantly higher volumes for a pre-emergent herbicides and soybean. We are very pleased with these results in Argentina. As you may recall, we talked about the significant changes we made to improve our market access in Argentina, which are now delivering on their expectations. As forecasted, following four quarters of very strong double-digit growth, Brazil growth slowed in Q4, but continued to deliver increased volumes. Channel inventories of our product in Brazil remain at normal levels for this point of the season and are well under control heading into 2020. In North America, revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for Rynaxypyr insect control in specialty crops, growth of Ethos XB, the combination insecticides and fungicides for infrared applications and our new Lucento fungicide. Herbicides sales in Canada were also strong. Our overall volume was above what was expected in the quarter, resulting in higher-than-forecasted rebates. These rebates are accounted for on our pricing line, which offset price increases in other regions. We continue to closely monitor channel inventories of our product in the U.S. as we head into the spring. To ensure a reduction of those channel inventories on a year-over-year basis, we proactively sold less of Authority pre-emergent herbicide into the channel in the second half of 2019 than we did in the same period in 2018. In Asia, we had a very strong fourth quarter performance with a revenue increase of 9% and 10% organic growth year-over-year in an otherwise down market. India, China, Indonesia and Pakistan all recorded double-digit growth rates driven by insecticide volumes. Following a very strong Q2 and Q3, India delivered over 20% revenue growth in Q4, driven by rice and sugarcane applications and new product launches. China\u2019s strong revenue growth was driven by diamide demand and fungicide sales in citrus and vegetable applications. In EMEA, sales grew 5% overall, as France, UK, Russia, Italy and Romania, all posted double-digit year-over-year growth. Q4 organic growth in the region was 7% and was driven largely by sales in France and Russia, which more than offset difficult drought conditions that impacted cereal plantings in Central and Eastern Europe. Turning to the fourth quarter EBITDA bridge on Slide 5. You see a $75 million volume contribution, which came from all regions and which drove the year-over-year growth. Relative to our guidance, both volume and cost management led to the strong outperformance. On Slide 6, full-year revenue was $4.6 billion, an increase of 8% compared to the prior year. Excluding FX headwinds of 3%, this represents 11% organic growth. Full-year adjusted EPS increased $0.85 year-over-year or 16%, driven largely by EBITDA growth and the benefit of share repurchase. On Slide 7, you can see that FMC growth for 2019 were well ahead of the crop protection market in every region. These percentages shown are all in U.S. dollar terms. Despite the extreme weather and trade challenges in the year, our full-year sales in North America were up 3%, which was ahead of forecast and 900 basis points ahead of the market. FMC full-year sales in Latin America grew 19%, 600 basis points ahead of the market, and 23% organically. In EMEA, our sales grew 4% in the year, which was 700 basis points ahead of the market, and 10% organically. FMC revenue growth in Asia was 3% on a reported basis, 800 basis points ahead of the market, and 8% organically, excluding FX headwinds across many currencies. Globally, FMC grew 8% in 2019 in U.S. dollar terms versus a flat global market. We believe our outperformance in every region was due to the strength of our portfolio accrued balance, and a strong commercial presence around the world. Moving to Slide 8, where you can see our full EBITDA and revenue drivers. Volume was the main driver of revenue growth, while price increased sales by 3%. Almost 20% of this year\u2019s revenue growth came from 2019 product launches. And our vitality index, which we calculate as the proportion of total revenue coming from products introduced in the last five years was roughly 10% of total sales. The diamide grew in the low-teens in 2019 and the rest of the portfolio, grew in the mid-single digits. On our Q2 earnings call, we outlined our plans to profitably grow our diamide franchise well beyond the expiration of key patents and all the way through the end of this decade via the engagement of third parties. We indicated we are in place or negotiating 15 such commercial agreements. Six months later, we have extended the number of agreements to cover four global partnership and 41 separate local company agreements covering 11 countries. A number of these new agreements are active and commercial sales are occurring. We will continue to expand the franchise through more of these commercial agreements. These partnerships are important and in most cases, allow us to access markets we are not selling into today. They are a key extension of our commercial reach. 2019 adjusted EBITDA of $1.22 billion was up 10% year-over-year despite $228 million in combined headwinds from higher cost and FX. Revenue and the EBITDA growth rate in 2019 both above the high-end of the five-year growth target we provided in December 2018. I will now turn it over to Andrew. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks, Pierre. I'll start this morning with a few highlights from the income statement, then move to the balance sheet, cash flow, and share count. I'll also give a quick update on progress in implementing our new SAP S/4HANA system. Interest expense for full-year 2019 was $158.5 million, $3.5 million above our most recent guidance, primarily due to higher-than-forecasted foreign debt and commercial paper balances. For 2020, we anticipate interest expense between $160 million and $170 million with the increase largely attributable to higher foreign debt balances, particularly where we utilized local borrowings to reduce currency exposures. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the full-year 2019 was 11.6%, 290 basis points lower-than-anticipated. FMC's corporate structure, particularly the principal operating companies that were created as part of the DuPont transaction in 2017, provide FMC with a structurally low tax rate. With this structure, profit outside the United States is taxed at lower statutory or negotiated tax rates than profit in the U.S., resulting in a weighted-average tax rate well below the U.S. statutory rate. To be clear, even at this lower overall rate, FMC does incur a significant amount of U.S. tax on these non-U.S. profits under the Global Intangible Low-taxed Income or GILTI provision. The structural elements to drive our low overall effective tax rate are highly sustainable and we expect a low rate for many years to come. However, the effective tax rate in any period is sensitive to swings and profitability between geographies, most notably the amount of profit earned in the U.S. The significant contributors to our lower-than-expected tax rate in 2019 were lower than forecasted earnings in the U.S. due to the factors in our North America business Pierre mentioned earlier, combined with stronger than forecasted earnings that flowed through our principal operating companies outside of the U.S. Looking ahead to 2020, we expect a full-year tax rate of 12.5% to 14.5% based on our current estimates of taxable earnings by geography. At year-end, gross debt was $3.3 billion, down roughly $300 million from the end of the third quarter. Surplus cash on the balance sheet at year-end was in excess of $225 million due to timing of receipt of end of year payments, which prevented us from using this cash to further pay down debt prior to year-end. Considering the surplus cash at year-end, gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was just under our 2.5x target. We remained committed to solid investment grade credit metrics and expect full-year average leverage to be in line with this commitment in 2020. Moving to Slide 9 and cash flow. Free cash flow for 2020 was $302 million, up $172 million from the prior year. Higher adjusted cash from operations driven by higher EBITDA and lower use of cash for working capital and lower legacy and transformation spending more than offset an increase in capital additions compared to the prior year. We are pleased with the improvements made in trade working capital. Trade working capital as a percentage of sales at year-end decreased 210 basis points to 32.5% in 2019. Free cash conversion relative to adjusted net earnings was 38% for full-year 2019, more than twice the prior year on a like-for-like basis with free cash flow growing 10x as fast as earnings. However, free cash flow came in below the low end of our outlook range of $375 million to $475 million. Two factors largely contributed to this. The first was much slower than expected collection of refunds of value-added and similar taxes, especially in India. The delays were driven primarily by the complexities of operating in multiple SAP and non-SAP systems around the world. The second factor was delayed collections in Pakistan and Indonesia for weather conditions impacted grower liquidity late in the fourth quarter. Both factors are execution related and will reverse. We fully expect to collect this cash in 2020. In the absence of these two factors, our free cash flow for 2019 would have been solidly in our guidance range with free cash conversion of roughly 50% on higher than guided earnings. We know we have more to do to continue to improve free cash flow. Moving to a single instance of SAP S/4HANA this year will give us a different level of visibility across our entire business and will provide us with state-of-the-art tools to continue to drive improvement in working capital and cash flow. Looking ahead to 2020, we're forecasting free cash flow of $425 million to $525 million with free cash conversion from adjusted earnings of 55% at the midpoint of our guidance ranges. We continue to believe we can drive free cash conversion substantially higher over the coming two to three years as we finalize our SAP implementation, ending the period of high cash spending on transformation activity, and as we drive further improvement in working capital performance. We repurchased over 4.7 million FMC shares in 2019 at an average price at $84.73. This included $100 million in repurchases completed in the fourth quarter for a total of $400 million of repurchases in the year. Considering the $210 million paid in dividends, FMC returned over $600 million in cash to shareholders in 2019. We are committed to returning excess cash to shareholders consistent with our long range plan. Further evident to this commitment is the 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend announced in December. We intend to purchase between $400 million and $500 million of FMC shares in 2020. In light of the seasonal working capital build in the first quarter and ongoing product line acquisition discussions, we do not expect to make any meaningful share repurchases in the first quarter, but fully intend to remain a regular purchaser of shares through the rest of the year. Before turning the call over to Mark, let me also give a quick update on progress in implementing our new SAP S/4HANA ERP system. We successfully closed full-year 2019 with roughly 20% of the Company on the new system and are already seeing many benefits. Today, we are going alive across the acquired business, which represents roughly 40% of FMC. This will allow us to exit the Transition Services Agreement at the end of this month, delivering annual cost savings of $20 million, which were incorporated in our earnings guidance for 2020. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Andrew. Moving to Slide 10 and the review of our full-year 2020 and Q1 earnings outlook. We expect full-year adjusted earnings of $6.45 to $6.70 per diluted share, representing an 8% increase at the midpoint. This outlook for EPS does not include the impact of share repurchases in 2020. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $4.8 billion to $4.95 billion, representing 6% growth at the midpoint and 7% organic growth compared to 2019. Total company adjusted EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.34 billion, reflecting 8% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Looking at the first quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.76 to $1.86, representing an increase of 5% at the midpoint versus Q1 2019 and assuming a share count of approximately $131 million. We forecast Q1 revenue to be in the range of $1.23 billion to $1.27 billion, representing 5% growth at the midpoint compared to the first quarter of 2019. Adjusted EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $346 million to $366 million, representing a 4% increase at the midpoint versus the prior year period. Turning now to our 2020 EBITDA bridge on Slide 11. Our EBITDA growth is expected to be driven by volume gains and continued price increases. We should note that we are also expecting to invest about $40 million more on R&D in 2020. This increase is driven by our continued success in moving molecules into development from discovery in 2019. Total R&D spend should be approximately 7% of sales versus 6.5% of sales in 2019 as we continue to expand and progress 22 new active ingredients and eight new biologicals towards commercialization. Tariffs will be higher in 2020 while raw material costs will not materially improve until the second half of 2020. We will realize about $20 million in annual savings as we exit the Transition Services Agreement this month. Foreign exchange is also forecasted to be a headwind in 2020 as the U.S. dollar has further strengthened versus key currencies. However, if you exclude the incremental $40 million in R&D spend, our price increases will cover over 100% of the combined headwinds from cost and FX. I would also like to highlight our revenue drivers. We forecast 2020 revenue growth of 6% overall and 7% organically. Volume is expected to contribute 5% to growth, including about 1.5% from new products launched in 2020 and pricing is expected to contribute 2% growth. These are slightly offset by a 1% headwind from foreign exchange. One aspect of our portfolio management that we do not often highlight is the change in the makeup of our portfolio. As is the case every year, in 2020 we will have an adverse impact from lost registrations on molecules as well as decisions to exit some product lines. This typically represents a drag of about 2% of our revenues and yet in 2019, we still grew volume 8%. These portfolio impacts are factored into our long-term revenue growth targets. Our long-term product strategy of investing in an increasingly sustainable product portfolio requires that we continually replace older chemistries with newer, more sustainable technologies. As part of this effort, as of the end of the year 2019, FMC has stopped selling all carbofuran formulations, including fewer than insecticide globally. Moving to Slide 12 where we will provide the key drivers for EBITDA and revenue growth in the first quarter. First quarter performance will be driven by strong volume growth, including new product launches, which are expected to deliver about a third of our total revenue growth in the quarter. These launches include Authority Edge pre-emergent herbicide for soybeans in the U.S. and Battle Delta herbicide for cereals in Europe. Pricing actions are expected to fully offset the FX headwinds at the revenue level. Shifting to the Global Crop Protection market. We project the total market will grow in the low-single digits in 2020 on a U.S. dollar basis with each region also growing by low-single digits. We forecast Asia will have the highest growth rate, assuming a partial rebound in Australia and more normalized weather conditions across the region. In North America, growth is expected to come from recovery in acreage for row crops, offset by a higher than normal channel inventory levels heading into the year. In Latin America, growth in soybeans and corn are expected to lead the crop protection market in Brazil. In EMEA, growth will be driven by spring cereal herbicides following the challenging winter cereal seeding. I will now turn the call back to Pierre. Pierre Brondeau : Thank you, Mark. Our Company's outperformance in 2019 was the result of a very flexible and agile supply chain, limiting the impact of raw material shortages in the delivery of market-driven technologies that offer exceptional value to growers around the world. We strongly believe that our investments in discovery and development pipeline will continue to fuel long-term growth for the company. In 2020, we will continue to effectively navigate through unexpected challenges that arise such as weather or macroeconomic developments, and we will deliver on the financial targets we set out for you today. We believe 2020 will mark the third year in a row that FMC significantly outperforms the crop protection market in term of revenue growth and EBITDA margins. We expect our outperformance will be driven by broad-based geographic growth, launches of new products and technologies and the continued expansion of diamide franchise as we gain more registration and labels as well as grow via commercial partnerships. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Thank you very much for your attention. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Adam Samuelson : Hi, good morning. How are you? Pierre Brondeau : Good morning. Adam Samuelson : Hi. I was hoping to maybe to dig into the guidance details a little bit and just think through the cost side and you gave some color in the prepared remarks about investments in R&D and raw materials, but maybe just a little bit more color around the moving pieces there? Andrew Sandifer : Sure, Adam. I think if you look at the full-year guidance, we see it many ways, the pattern similar to what we saw last year, but with a less pronounced headwind from costs and FX. On the cost side, you're exactly right. We are \u2013 we have called out. We're increasing our investment in R&D about $40 million year-on-year. So of that $61 million that you see in cost increase for the full-year on our bridge on Slide 11, about $40 million of that is cost increase from R&D spending. If you remove that, we really do have \u2013 we start to see the benefit of the pricing actions we've taken over the past five quarters, where prices and mix ends up covering more than the cost and FX headwinds. I do think we did see continued higher raw material costs in tight conditions going into the second half of last year that as you know \u2013 as they flow through our inventory in the first half of this year, will continue to be a bit of a headwind, and the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against the number of our key currencies. So we do still have some FX headwinds. I will note that those headwinds are particularly heavy in the first half. As we start looking towards the second half, we start seeing much more favorable comparisons on costs and lessening FX impacts. Pierre Brondeau : On the volume front, to talk about growth, I'll jump in. But roughly three big buckets I would say are diamides. We do believe it's going to be broad-based, geographical growth and it's going to be in the low-teens. Think about the rest of our portfolio, non-diamide as in 2019 growing at about 5% and as in 2019, we believe the product we will be launching in 2020 will also bring about 2% growth rate. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That's very helpful color. And then just quickly on the cash flow conversion guidance, the 55%. Apart from the continued investments in ERP and transformation, I mean, what else would it take to get to that medium term target of 70% as we think 2020 versus 2021 and 2022? Pierre Brondeau : Yes. Let\u2019s do one thing. Let me just take a bit the trend from 2018 all the way through 2021 at a high level, and then maybe Andrew, you can go into more detail into the 2019, 2020 number. If you look back at 2018, we had a conversion rate of 18%. In 2019, we generated $300 million of free cash flow, which represent a conversion rate of 37%. Now the $300 million normalized should have been $400 million. We had $100 million miss, purely execution. Got our eyes off the ball on a couple of issues, but the normalized number would have been around $400 million, which is about 50% conversion rate. Looking into 2020. 2020, I would characterize as a year of bit along the same line as 2019. We believe we're going to benefit from higher EBITDA, about 8% growth. But from the cost standpoint, we were expecting about a year-ago to be able to finish SAP implementation in the first quarter of 2020. But there is no way around it. It's a three-year program. It's going to cost $250 million. So we're going to have to go all the way to the end of 2020 with SAP implementation cost. So we're going to have the same transformational cost as we did in 2019. So we believe 2020 will be a conversion rate of about 55%. Now moving to 2021 and that's when you still see, if we go along the line of a five-year plan, another 8% EBITDA increase. But that's when the SAP implementation transformation costs start to significantly lower and that's when, just through this effect, we expect to be around 70% cash conversion from adjusted earnings. So that's directionally how we're going to go from 37% in 2019 to about 70% in 2021. Maybe Andrew, you want to talk a bit more about 2019 and 2020? Andrew Sandifer : Sure. Let me talk \u2013 get a little more specific on that bridge from 2019 to 2020. I think as Pierre referenced, we have about $300 million in free cash flow in 2019. We're guiding an increase in EBITDA of about $100 million, but we'll also be increasing the spending on CapEx, about $10 million year-on-year. And our legacy and transformation costs increased about $20 million year-on-year. So the combination of those factors are \u2013 leave you at about $370 million. The net impact of the reversal of the two factors we called out in the cash flow shortfall this quarter and the impact of change in working capital in 2020 are the rest of the difference to the rest of our guidance range. It gets you up in that $425 million to $575 million. So it's important in that 2020 walk, as Pierre mentioned, we do not see a step down. We actually see a slight increase in legacy and transformation year-on-year, with about a $100 million to $125 million of that being really transformation activity and the remainder being legacy expenses that \u2013 basically transformation being flat to slightly down to prior year in total with legacy going up slightly. So again, that next real big step in cash conversion, we get to a more normalized level this year for how we're operating on a working capital. And then in 2021, we see the step down from the end of the SAP program in the end of the transformation spend. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is open. P.J. Juvekar: Rebates in North America. Is that mostly rebates to retailers based on volume, like a volume rebate or is that more of a competitive action? And in what products is that occurring? Thank you. Pierre Brondeau : Yes, P.J., it just a normal \u2013 it's a normal process which happens. Every year we do the same thing. We have rebates, which are indexed on volume and that's a normal process. There was no specific change in the rates or anything of that kind. It was just a normal year. The only difference looking at the weather condition and the pattern in North America, we ended up a bit stronger in the fourth quarter than we\u2019re expecting. So when we had to look at all of the reserves and rebates, we would have to pay. We ended up having higher rebate to be paid to our customers for the full-year and to be done in the fourth quarter. So it\u2019s just \u2013 we got a little bit surprised by the strength of the market in the fourth quarter versus what we're expecting and that\u2019s because it's purely proportional to volume created a step up in rebates we're not expecting. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Christopher Parkinson : Thank you. So you've done a solid job of evolving the portfolio for both the geographic and crop perspective, which I guess is kind of the key to enabling you to outgrow CPC markets. However, you're still underweight fungicides and kind of overweight insecticides. It seems like you're entering a lot of agreements regarding texturing and the diamides over the long-term, but how should we think about your total portfolio evolution as it pertains to further establishing your presence in fungicides? And is it a coincidence that you mentioned product line acquisition discussions in M&A? Thank you. Mark Douglas : Yes, Chris, you're absolutely right. We are heavyweight in insecticides. I believe, we're the world's leader in insecticide. So we're not disappointed with that profile at all. However, you're right. We do want to increase our participation in fungicides. And really we're doing that in three ways. First of all is our current portfolio, which is limited, but with very, very interesting products. We launched a new product this year or 2019, Lucento in North America. It's going extremely well. To be frank, I think if we'd have had more capacity, we'd have been able to sell more. So there is the notion of selling what we have today. Second to that is what we have in our pipeline, when you think about our discovery and development pipeline. We currently have today five new fungicides in our pipeline, three of which have brand new modes of action not seen before. So we know we have the long-term view, which is very strong from the fungicide perspective. Closer to home, we will be launching in 2021 a brand new fungicide called Fluindapyr. We'll be launching that around the world. That will also add to the growth rate as we go through sort of the second half of our plan. And then third is how we acquire technologies or access to products around the world. We are under active discussions and in fact some of the agreements that we have in place today for the diamides allow us access to various fungicides in different markets. So we pursue in pretty much every avenue we know to really grow that fungicides as fast as possible. But it is a target for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens Inc. Your line is open. Mark Connelly : Thanks. So Pierre, last quarter you talked about Cyazypyr and the pickup we saw there. Cyazypyr has been a sort of a slow and steady success since the DuPont days. Are you seeing that continue? And if it is, what does that say about the acceleration in demand coming this late into growth cycle? Mark Douglas : Yes. Mark, you're right. Cyazypyr was launched later than Rynaxypyr. I would say it is somewhat more of a difficult sell. As we've got our hands around the products. We understand that it has some attributes when it comes to the performance that also has plant health benefits in terms of how a plant responds to Cyazypyr and how Cyazypyr removes the pests. We\u2019ve talked about the size of our business in diamides over 2019. It's about $1.6 billion business. Cyazypyr is growing rapidly, much faster than Rynaxypyr and is in the $350 million to $400 million range going forward. So it's already become a significant molecule. We don't believe at this point that its growth profile is slowing down, certainly not in the near-term. So you can expect us to talk more about Cyazypyr and especially the growth rates as we go forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Your line is open. Frank Mitsch : Good morning and congratulations Mark on being named CEO-elect. Mark Douglas : Thank you. Frank Mitsch : And likewise Pierre, Executive Chair. And I assume taking a little bit more time off, but congratulations to you both. Pierre, you mentioned that over the past six months you've been signing multiple new partnerships. And I'm just curious if you could kind of describe them in a little more detail. I mean, what products are these covering? Are these just covering the diamides geographic? Any more color that you could expand upon this? And then perhaps just give us a sense as to what size of your total revenues you think this may grow to over the next couple of years? Pierre Brondeau : Yes, I'll ask Mark to jump in. The only thing, Frank, I want to say before Mark talk a little bit is, with most of these agreements, we do have secrecy agreement. So we are very limited to what we can say around volume, especially being in an early stage, it would be quite easy to understand who is doing what. And as we said in the script four are global agreement and 41 are local agreements, all of them are diamides agreements. Mark, you want to say a few things that they cover? Mark Douglas : Yes. Frank, they cover both Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr. As Pierre said, we are under pretty tight confidentiality rules here, but suffice to say 11 different countries so far, all major crops and more importantly some crops and markets that we are not active in today with the diamides. So think of it in terms of growth from a market access perspective in various countries around the world. And these are not products that are just straight Rynaxypyr or Cyazypyr. They are mixtures and sophisticated formulations with active ingredients that we don't have access to. So the fundamental purpose here is not only to defend our franchise and grow it over the next decade, but also to expand the pool of where we operate. Think about it this way. The insecticide market is about a $15 billion market. A lot of the older chemistries are going away. And we have about $1.6 billion worth of business with the diamides. We have plenty of room to grow here over the long haul and that is the purpose of what we're doing. Pierre Brondeau : I think what Mark said is, at the end is very important. We do believe those partnerships are going to help us expanding the market penetration of Cyazypyr and Rynaxypyr. Those two molecules are big, but we believe they are far from being at the end of their market penetration. So that's one of the way to do it to complainant all of the marketing and commercial activity FMC has directed. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Laurent Favre with Exane. Please go ahead. Laurent Favre : Yes. Good morning, all. I've got a question on the step up in R&D from 6.5% to 7% of sales. I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit more about what's driving the increase? Is it the underline cost inflation against the existing plan? Is it spending more on discovery, I guess new actives? Is it changing scope on the formulations or is it just a bit of everything? Thank you. Andrew Sandifer : Yes. Laurent, really the $40 million is targeted at two new active ingredients that we moved into development from discovery in 2019. So we now have that run rate cost of spending more money on what is really the most expensive part of the whole R&D cycle, which is development. That's where we spend a lot of money on toxicology, et cetera. So those products are now moving into a phase where for the next three, four, or five years, spending will be increased. 7% of revenue is not something that we see as a problem for us. We actually have phased our R&D so that we should be in that 7% range on an ongoing basis. You should expect to see that number change as we go through the years and the business continues to grow. We will be spending more on R&D as we continue to expand, not only the pipeline of synthetics, but biologicals as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is open. Stephen Byrne : Yes. I was hoping you could comment on whether or not you're seeing any indications of some competitive pricing from any one of the following buckets. One being the inventory, the channel inventory levels Mark that you mentioned in North America being higher than normal, another potential one would be the big seed companies are increasingly bundling crop chems with their seed platforms, another one being increased ecommerce offerings, anything that you're seeing there that \u2013 if you could comment on those please? Pierre Brondeau : Thank you. Listen, first of all, we should know it's a highly competitive market. There is lots of companies in this market who are competing, but at the end of the day, it is a market we are offering in technology matter. So yes, there is competitive actions, but at the end of the day, if you price right the right technology, you can protect your margin. Maybe Mark, let's start the comments about seeds and the bundling and maybe talk about the meeting you and I we had last week with our customers. Mark Douglas : Yes, sure. So let's put it in perspective. You're talking about seed bundling. You're really talking about major row crops in the Midwest of the U.S. And frankly, when you look at that as an overall component of our business, it's not the majority of our business by a long way. And even in the U.S., we have tremendous exposure outside of the Midwest. We don't see the bundling aspect as a competitive threat to us. The meeting Pierre was referencing, Pierre and I and the whole of the North America commercial team, we were with 250 retailers and distribution companies in the U.S. last week. And we spent three or four days talking about the market. Where are we? What's our competitive offering? And I can tell you at no time did we hear that the combination of seeds and chemicals is a detriment to our growth. In fact, we had the opposite. We had the fact that our offerings are offering technology on anybody seeds. It doesn't matter who seeds you buy. Can be an independent, can be one of the big two or three. So for us, we see this as an extreme positive and so do our retailers and so do our distribution partners. So in that sense, no, I don't see the seeds. Combination has been an issue for us. On the last bucket that you had Steve, on e-commerce, we actually see e-commerce is having a place in the marketplace. But frankly, we see it at the low end of the market. It's easy to sell a generic on price. It's not easy to sell a very sophisticated pre-emergent herbicide or a very sophisticated diamide insecticide online. We don't participate in those forums. We will not participate in those forums. Our customers are the people that are offering the service levels down on the ground with the growers. So for us, we're not seeing anything impacting our overall North America business through e-commerce. Pierre Brondeau : I want to repeat what Mark said because that is very critical and it is a strategic decision of FMC. We will not get into the seed business. We do not need to be in the seed business. When Mark talked about 200 customers, it is true. It was 200 to 250 customers. We spent most of the week. I can tell you that to a person, they told us that it's very critical to have a chemical and biological supplier who is agnostic to the type of seed and somebody has the right technology they can use with any type of seed. Our customers are not big fans of bundling or being pushed to use a specific seed with a specific chemical. They need the freedom to choose and we provide that to them. So it is not something we are concerned about. We do believe \u2013 I would even go one step beyond. I think it's a competitive advantage for us to not be in seeds. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Michael Sison : Hey, guys. Nice end to the year and congrats to you both. Pierre Brondeau : Thank you, Mike. Michael Sison : I think you mentioned the non-diamide business is expected to be up mid-single digits in 2020. Can you maybe give us a little bit of color where the growth coming from, new molecules, geographies, new registrations? I'm sure it's a little bit of all of the above, but just a little bit of help there. Thanks. Mark Douglas : Yes. Mike, it is a little bit of all of the above. As Pierre indicated, our legacy portfolio we believe is growing in roughly the mid-single digits. I would say across the board, we're seeing the highest growth rates with the fungicide portfolio that we have, spent a lot of time on growing that around the world, mainly in North America. Certainly the legacy insecticide portfolio is doing extremely well, especially in Latin America where we have some very, very good products that are going into the soy complex. And then we would come to the herbicides, where we see growth in both the U.S. with some pretty sophisticated pre-emergent formulations like Authority Edge that are replacing current technologies that are out there. We see growth in Argentina on pre-emergence, and we also see significant continued growth with herbicides in sugarcane in Brazil. Moving over to Asia. India is a big market for us now and we're offering brand new herbicide formulations that have not been seen before in India, especially for sugarcane. We continue to grow our rice herbicide business in China. So all those pieces that come together, you can see, it's quite easy for us to get into that mid single-digit range. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Your line is open. Donald Carson : Thank you. I want to go back to raw material costs, and your outlook for the year. Pierre, you mentioned that that higher cost last year will flow through inventory in the first half, but once you get through that as you get into the second half, do you see raw material costs coming down? And I know you've recast your supply chain, but is availability out of China a problem now that's perhaps grown with some of the recent shutdowns? Could that have a second half effect on the industry? Pierre Brondeau : Yes. So first of all, let you start with the cost as we are forecasting in our guidance. You are correct. The cost is turning into the second half of the year into positive, which means that most of the adverse costs in our P&L is happening in the first half of the year with a disproportionate amount in the first quarter and then in the second quarter. And then when we get into the second half that's when these costs are improving. From an availability standpoint, where are we today? As you can guess, the issues we had last year, which were due to environmental issues and industrial parks shutting down, those issues are over. I think we are not suffering from any issues there. The thing we're watching, of course, is the impact of Coronavirus. There is no impact of Coronavirus on demand today, as we see it. It is much more an impact on logistics because of parts of the country, which are being isolated or roads which are being blocked or air freight. Today, we have not seen any negative impact on our ability to pay rate so far. We had some issues where we had to find options to get raw materials from a different location, but all-in-all the issues we have been facing, we have been able to resolve them and operate normally. That being said, as you can guess, it's a very dynamic situation. So we do have a team fully focused on that and only doing this day after day, which is watching the flux of raw materials from a place to another to make sure we do have what we need for our growth plan. But yes, it is something we are aware of and carefully watching, but so far so good. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global. Your line is open. Michael Harrison : Hi, good morning. Mark Douglas : Good morning. Michael Harrison : Looking at the one slide you have in there, 13% growth in the Latin American crop protection market in 2019 that seems like a lot. Were there really that many more planted acres or did we see increases in the number of applications? Was this trade benefits? Just wondering if you can help us understand the drivers of that very strong growth in the market itself and maybe get us more comfortable that we weren't just seeing a lot of inventory getting stuffed into the channel? Mark Douglas : Yes. Mike, listen, I think it's a very good observation. I think most people \u2013 when we talk about 13% growth rate, most people put that straight towards Brazil. I think you've got to parcel it out somewhat in the sense that the other regions are growing. Mexico grew in the North and then obviously Argentina has been growing certainly for us, but the market was relatively, I would say, mid-single digits. If you look at Brazil, surface area was planted, it was probably about a 3% increase overall with soy leading the way. We had a very good season on cotton, strong infestation, which obviously helped us, but also the market was up because of that. Cotton is a high usage of pesticides. I would say though that overall I think the market has more channel inventory in Brazil than the market would take. So I think some of that 13% is setting warehouses right now. I'm going to be very frank and tell you that, we talk about this constantly on every call and our inventories are exactly where we want them to be, normal levels across Brazil for the rest of this season and then heading into the new season that comes in at the end of this year. But I do start to watch the channel inventories in Brazil. I think they are higher than normal. Pierre Brondeau : And to compliment what Mark said, and the level of inventory in the channel of FMC products, just to remind what we said in the script, growth was not driven in the fourth quarter for FMC by Brazil. It was other parts of Latin America and a big driver was Argentina. So that is part of the process we have in place to make sure that in Brazil we control channel inventory. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Kevin McCarthy : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Mark, a question for you on insecticides as it relates to some of the regulatory dynamics. With regard to chlorpyrifos, we understand that that chemistry is being phased out in California and Europe. And so my question is whether FMC foresees any opportunity to gain share via substitute chemistry, such as pyrethroids or otherwise? And then second, you mentioned the carbofuran exit. Just wondering if you could address that in terms of opportunity to backfill there, what options you may have in the portfolio? Thank you. Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks Kevin. Yes, chlorpyrifos is a molecule that is, as you said being removed in California. We have very limited sales of chlorpyrifos around the world and we have exited basically all of that business. So for us, we see it as more of an opportunity and you're right. Pyrethroids, especially our bifenthrin mixtures will be targeting those markets. So we'll be looking to grow that. And then on carbofuran \u2013 yes, we do see opportunities for our portfolio to replace what we already have. And obviously if we were planning to exit, we had plans to replace and those plans will be rolled out in Mexico and parts of Asia, Indonesia in particular where we will be replacing our own products with some of the newer technologies. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital. Your line is open. Joel Jackson : Hi, good morning. You did a good job of bridging free cash flow conversion in major buckets in the next couple of years. I just wanted to focus on the 2019 versus 2020 free cash flow conversion. If looking at the roughly $100 million or 12% conversion that is expected in 2020 instead of 2019, it looks like normalized everything, 2020 free cash flow conversion is actually less than 2019 conversion. Is that right? And maybe you could just specifically walk through some of this, but specifically walk through exactly the difference between 2019 and 2020, if that's true. Thanks. Andrew Sandifer : Yes. Joel, I think the free cash flow conversion on a like-for-like is pretty consistent between the two years. What you've got are some puts and takes. We have higher capital additions and higher legacy and transformation spending in 2020 than we did in 2019 to the tune of about $30 million combined. We do see increased cash from operations. Part of that is the recapture of the delayed collections that we saw at the end of Q4. And we also have to acknowledge we're growing the topline, roughly $300 million, $350 million at the guidance point and generating $100 million of EBITDA. It does take some working capital to continue to grow the business. When you think through that walk again, if we take $300 million in free cash flow in 2019, $100 million growth in EBITDA, $30 million headwind from higher legacy and transformation and capital spending, that gets you within $100 million of our guidance point. That $100 million is the rebound \u2013 the reversal of the Q4 factors we've talked about and a very minimal change in working capital beyond that \u2013 very minimal use of working capital beyond that. So it does imply continuing improvements and working capital efficiency. And that's a part of our continued drive to derive and not just waiting for the step down, the transformation spending, but to continue to drive down the working capital use in the business. Michael Wherley : That's all the time we have for the call today. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : And this concludes the FMC Corporation conference call. Thank you.",

Welcome to FMC Corporation's First Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Pierre Brondeau, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Douglas, President and CEO-elect; and Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Pierre will review our first quarter performance, Andrew will provide an overview of select financial results and Mark will discuss the outlook for the rest of the year. We will then address your questions. Our earnings release and today's slide presentation are available on our website, and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call. Please note, we published an updated slide presentation this morning to add one slide on the Fluindapyr acquisition. Finally, let me remind you that today's presentation and discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including, but not limited to, those factors identified in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's understanding. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion and the supporting materials include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations, free cash flow and organic revenue growth, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that earnings shall mean adjusted earnings and EBITDA shall mean adjusted EBITDA for all income statement references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's call are provided on our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Pierre. Pierre Brondeau : Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. FMC delivered another very strong performance in the first quarter, with 9% organic revenue growth. Despite all the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, underlying demand for our products remained very healthy in the quarter. These results were driven by the exceptional work of our global supply chain, operations and commercial teams. Before going into the detail of our Q1 results, we felt it was important to provide a high-level view of the state of our company in this uncertain global economic environment. We are an agricultural sciences company, and our products are critical to the global food supply chain. Since agriculture is considered an essential industry in the countries where we operate, we have avoided significant plant closures and all our facilities are operational. In fact, all our key plants in China operated through the Chinese New Year holiday and continue to do so today. The well-being of our employees is FMC's top priority. Although most FMC employees around the world have been working from home during these last several weeks, we have hundreds of employees who continue operating and manufacturing sites, blending and packaging facilities and distribution warehouses. Besides as well as certain nonmanufacturing locations with limited employees in the office are using a variety of best practices to address COVID-19. This includes the use of facial PPE, social distancing protocols, expanded cleaning procedures and other precautionary measures recommended by leading health authorities. Due to the stay-at-home orders around the globe, our commercial teams use a variety of digital technologies, including workshops, webinars and virtual field days to continue working closely with our customers and generate demand. We successfully mitigated the impact of COVID-19 in Q1. But given the spread of the pandemic in March and increased FX headwinds, we are conscious of potential risks in the rest of the year. Therefore, we have already implemented price increases and cost-saving measures across the company. Mark will describe the potential headwinds as well as the pricing and cost containment actions in more detail later. Turning to slide three. FMC's strong financial performance from 2019 continued in the first quarter against an industry-leading comparison. Last year, our business grew 14% organically in Q1. This year, we reported $1.25 billion in first quarter revenue, which reflects 5% year-over-year growth on a reported basis and 9% organic growth. This increase was driven by double-digit growth in India, Pakistan, France, U.K., Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Canada. Adjusted EBITDA was $357 million, an increase of 4% compared to the prior year period. EBITDA margins were 28.6%, essentially flat with prior year, despite $52 million in combined headwinds from FX and costs in the quarter. Adjusted EPS was $1.84 in the quarter, an increase of 7% versus Q1 2019. This year-over-year performance was driven largely by the $14 million increase in EBITDA, reduced share count and the benefit of a lower tax rate, partially offset by higher interest expense. Moving now to slide four. Q1 revenue grew by 5% versus prior year, with volume contributing 7% growth and price adding 2%, offset partially by a 4% headwind from FX. We achieved higher pricing in all regions. New product launches this year generated 1.5% of the 5% top line growth we posted in Q1, offsetting half of the 3% headwind from products that were discontinued either because of registration cancellations or rationalizations that we have planned for and discussed in our last earnings call. Latin America grew 26% year-over-year and 38%, excluding FX, driven by double-digit growth in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Insecticides were especially strong in Brazil on cotton, sugarcane and soybean and herbicide growth in Brazil was driven by sugarcane replanting. As we have commented for many quarters, we monitor our product in the channel in Brazil very closely. And our channel inventories continue to be at low levels as we come to the end of the season. In Argentina, solid demand for insecticide drove new sales. And in Mexico, fruit and vegetable exports continue to present increased opportunities for our diamide portfolio. In North America, sales increased 3% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for an Rynaxypyr insect control as well as fungicide and our new pre-emergent herbicides Authority Edge. In Canada, our Authority herbicides continue to gain adoption, driven by weak resistance concern. Over the past couple of years, we have invested in upgrading our Authority herbicide franchise to focus on newer, more effective formulations to combat changing with resistance. This has allowed us to reduce sales of less effective older formulations and lower our channel inventories. Post channel inventories in North America continued to improve. And with the new season starting, we do not see a reason for concern going forward. Sales in EMEA grew 1% year-over-year and 4% excluding FX, due to robust demand for newly introduced fungicide and solid growth in herbicides for cereals. We saw growth in over 10 countries and new products drove a 2% increase in overall revenue. Registration cancellations and product rationalizations were a headwind. In Asia, revenue decreased 3% year-over-year, but was flat excluding FX. The decline was driven primarily by foreign currency headwinds and product rationalization as well as COVID-19-related challenges in China, which impacted both supply and demand. These were partially offset by broad-based double-digit growth in India and Pakistan, along with the return to growth in Australia as weather improved. Turning to the first quarter EBITDA bridge on slide five. You see the $40 million volume contribution, which drove the year-over-year growth. We also realized price increases of $26 million against $45 million in FX headwinds. I will now turn it over to Andrew. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks, Pierre. Let me start this morning with a few brief highlights from the income statement. The U.S. dollar strengthened against virtually all major currencies important to FMC during the first quarter, reducing revenue growth by 4%, twice the level we had anticipated when we last gave guidance. It is important to note that the BRL represented only half of the Q1 FX headwinds on revenue, with a broad set of European and Asian currencies accounting for the remainder. As Mark will discuss further when he shares our outlook, we now expect these FX headwinds to continue at an elevated level throughout 2020, with pricing trailing FX impacts in Q2, but catching up during the second half of the year. Interest expense for the quarter was $40.8 million, up $6.3 million from the prior year period, primarily due to the impacts of our third quarter 2019 debt offering and higher foreign debt balances, partially offset by lower term loan and commercial paper balances. With the decrease in interest rates since the beginning of the year, we now anticipate interest expense between $155 million and $165 million for the full year, somewhat better than our prior guidance. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the first quarter was 13.5%, consistent with our expected full year tax rate of 12.5% to 14.5%. Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity. Global credit markets saw significant disruption and volatility in March, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, FMC had and continues to have more than ample liquidity to support our operations. FMC has historically relied on commercial paper to finance working capital. U.S. commercial paper markets are the most cost-efficient source of working capital financing in the world. Additionally, we also have $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that serves both as a backstop to our commercial paper program and as a direct source of borrowing when needed. As COVID became a more clear crisis in the U.S. in mid-March, out of an abundance of caution, FMC drew down $500 million on our revolver to ensure we had sufficient liquidity regardless of near-term volatility in commercial paper markets. However, we continued to place commercial paper to stay active in the market. That market has now returned to more normal conditions. As such, we have reduced our revolver borrowing to $250 million through mid-May when we anticipate taking them to 0, presuming commercial paper market conditions remain stable. Gross debt at quarter end was $3.8 billion, including the $500 million in revolver borrowing. Because of this revolver draw, we had surplus cash on the balance sheet at quarter end in excess of $300 million. Considering the surplus cash, gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 2.8 times at the end of the first quarter, above our targeted 2.5 times annual average leverage and reflecting the seasonal working capital build intrinsic to our business in the first quarter. As many of you may be aware, our maximum leverage covenant was set to tighten from 4.0 to 4.0 times debt-to-EBITDA at March 31 to 3.5 times on June 30. As the COVID crisis became more pronounced during March, we assessed a wide range of potential downside scenarios for the company. We did not see any of the scenarios resulting in greater than 3.5 times leverage as being likely, and we are confident that we have levers that we could pull to further conserve cash if the situation really began to deteriorate. However, again, out of an abundance of caution, we decided to reach out to our bank group to discuss the covenant amendment. Our bank group was very supportive, and we quickly aligned on moving our debt-to-EBITDA covenant to 4.25 times for the remainder of 2020, stepping down to 4.0 times on March 31, 2021, and 3.5 times on June 30, 2021. Moving on to slide six and specifically cash flow and cash deployment. Free cash flow for the quarter was negative $371 million. The primary driver of the variance versus the prior year period was increased working capital which is partially offset by positive cash benefits and other operating assets and liabilities. Net receivables increased on higher sales, partially offset by the catch-up of collections delayed from Q4. Inventories improved somewhat. Payables, however, were significantly lower than the prior year period, which benefited from elevated payables related to delayed site transfers. Looking ahead to the full year, we are maintaining the free cash flow guidance range of $425 million to $525 million. Due to increased uncertainty in the global and business environment, we are taking several prudent steps to reduce cash outflows in 2020, such as deferring discretionary capital investment and aggressively managing the balance of collections and payables to protect our cash position. While we continue to expect to generate substantial free cash flow in 2020, we are temporarily suspending share repurchases until we have a more clear line of sight to normalization of COVID-related disruptions. Our Board remains committed to the dividend, as evidenced by the dividend declaration made last week, and we do not anticipate any change to our dividend policy. We will also continue to fully fund our growth plan, including making smaller technology-driven investments, such as the transaction we announced this morning. Mark will describe this compelling investment in more detail in a few moments. To be clear, our capital deployment policy has not changed. We are only pausing share repurchases given the current environment. Over the mid- and long term, we are firmly committed to returning cash beyond what is required to fund the growth of the company to shareholders through share repurchases and growing dividends while maintaining solid investment-grade credit metrics. Finally, let me also give an update on progress in implementing our new SAP S/4HANA system. At our last earnings call, we were literally in the midst of going live across the business acquired from DuPont, which represents roughly 40% of FMC. That go-live has been extremely successful. This quarter's close was the first quarter end, where we closed with 60% of the company on the new S/4HANA system. Additionally, due to COVID-related workplace restrictions, this closed process was completed with nearly all of our finance team working remotely, reflecting the agility of our organization. We are focused on completing the implementation of the new SAP system across the remainder of FMC by year-end, which will give us a thoroughly modern system across the entire company and will enable further efficiencies in our back-office processes. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Andrew. Shifting to the global crop protection market. We previously forecasted the global market to be up low single digits in 2020. We now project the markets will be flat versus the prior year, due to the various impacts from COVID-19 and the strength of the U.S. dollar. All these forecasts are for the market, not FMC and are in U.S. dollars. We forecast that the North American market will grow in the low single digits, same as we thought three months ago, based on the assumptions of increased acreage for row crops and a recovery in Canada after two years of dry conditions. We expect the market in Europe will grow a little faster than we thought before, but still low single digits, driven by strength in Eastern Europe and in the cereals and corn markets. We now expect the Asian market will be down slightly versus our prior estimate of low single-digit growth, based on the impact we have already seen from COVID-19 in China, India and other countries, in addition to FX headwinds. We also lowered our forecast for the Latin American market significantly, as we now expect it to contract by low to mid-single digits versus slight growth in our prior view. This decline is driven by weaker currencies rather than lower demand. Moving to slide seven and the review of our full year 2020 and Q2 earnings outlook. Factoring in certain potential challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and FX headwinds, the company is widening guidance ranges to incorporate more risk to the downside of our prior guidance. FMC full year 2020 adjusted earnings are now expected to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.70 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 5% at the midpoint. EPS estimates do not include the benefit of any share repurchases in 2020, which the company is suspending, as Andrew indicated. 2020 revenue is now forecasted to be in the range of $4.65 billion to $4.85 billion, an increase of 3% at the midpoint versus 2019 and 8% organic growth. We believe the strength of our portfolio will allow us to deliver high single-digit organic growth, continuing a multiyear trend of above-market performance. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $1.23 billion to $1.34 billion, which represents a 5% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We believe Q2 will represent the most challenging and uncertain conditions related to COVID-19 and currencies. Adjusted earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $1.58 to $1.74, flat at the midpoint versus Q2 2019. We forecast Q2 revenue to be in the range of $1.17 billion to $1.23 billion, which is flat at the midpoint compared to second quarter 2019. Excluding the significant FX headwinds, revenue is expected to increase 5% organically, driven primarily by an improvement in Western Europe, strength in Latin America and new products gaining traction around the world. Adjusted EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $317 million to $347 million, representing a 2% decrease at the midpoint versus the prior year period. Turning to slide eight and full year revenue drivers. Revenue is expected to benefit from 4% volume growth, with the largest growth expected in North America and Asia. New products are driving about 1.5% in total revenue growth, with the largest contribution coming from EMEA. With the significant shift in global currencies, you can see that FX is now forecasted to be a 5% top line headwind. For reference, in February, we were only forecasting a 1% revenue headwind from currencies. However, we expect to offset most of these headwinds with price increases throughout the year. Regarding EBITDA, we're expecting COVID-related impacts to supply chain costs, pockets of demand and global currencies. To help mitigate these, we quickly implemented proactive cost-saving measures to offset approximately $60 million of the anticipated headwinds, in addition to significant price increases. When net out the expected COVID-19 impacts, including currencies, with our cost-saving measures and price increases, COVID-19 could still reduce EBITDA by a range of $0 million to $70 million. Therefore, the midpoint of our current EBITDA guidance is $1.285 billion or $35 million lower than our prior guidance. I should note that if we see the headwinds pushing the net impact towards the higher end of the range, we will implement further cost-saving measures in the second half of the year. Foreign exchange is obviously a critical factor in our outlook. We now foresee an impact of $170 million for the full year, driven by numerous currencies, including the euro, Indian rupee, Indonesian rupee, Brazilian real and the Mexican peso, etc. This broad-based movement is an important factor in the timing for how we will recover price versus FX. In the second quarter, we expect an FX impact of $45 million, with price recovery of $15 million or 33%. This price-to-FX gap is driven by two main elements. First is the relative lack of pricing power in the second quarter in Latin America and specifically in Brazil. This is driven by the fact that it is the tail end of the season in Brazil and historically very little pricing changes are made in the season at this time, as volumes tend to be lower and growers are focusing on the harvest. Second is our approach to the market in Asia. In market significantly impacted by COVID-19, we do not feel that it would be appropriate to increase prices at this time. And as such, we will be looking to recover pricing over the latter part of the year rather than in Q2. Looking at the full year, pricing actions of $160 million are expected to cover approximately 95% of the FX headwind. This change in coverage is mainly the recovery of price in Latin America as we set prices for the new season in Q3, which will reflect the exchange rates we are seeing and is a normal pattern. Pricing recovery in Asia in the latter part of the year is another element, as previously discussed. Supply chain is also an important factor for our outlook, as we have already seen some temporary shutdowns around the world. As you know, we and the industry have been managing plant shutdowns in China over the past two years. And FMC has successfully met the demands of our customers. The same teams that helped us successfully navigate those situations are now very active in managing COVID-19-induced restrictions. In addition, we are taking a conservative approach that we may see pockets of reduced demand due to food chain dislocations and labor availability. Our cost-saving measures will help offset these headwinds. We began implementing them in early March, and we will realize savings in each quarter this year. The cost savings are focused on two elements, SG&A and R&D. We are eliminating or delaying all nonessential expenditures and have frozen hiring. In R&D, we are not canceling any projects, but we are phasing some differently to allow lower cost this year without fundamentally impacting long-term time lines. These cost-saving actions will be temporary. Most of these costs will return in 2021, and we can confidently say that we will not impact the growth of our company. On slide nine, you see the main reason EBITDA is expected to fall 2% in the second quarter, is due to the significant FX headwind as discussed previously. New product launches in Europe, North America and Asia will all contribute to solid overall volume gains in Q2, and we expect organic revenue growth of 5%. Turning to new technologies and our strategic intent to expand our fungicide portfolio on slide 10. Please note, this is the slide we added to the updated deck this morning. Earlier today, we announced a binding offer to acquire the remaining rights for Fluindapyr fungicide for geographies we didn't already control from Isagro for EUR55 million. You may recall us talking about Fluindapyr as one of the first active ingredients coming out of our R&D pipeline. We have been codeveloping this broad spectrum fungicide with Isagro for several years and are set to launch the active ingredient in Paraguay this fall and in the U.S. next spring. With the full global rights, we now believe peak sales will be in the range of $350 million to $400 million, including estimates for Isagro's key European, Asian and Latin American territories. As a carboxamide, Fluindapyr belongs to one of the newest classes of fungicides, targeting a broad range of plant diseases, including Asia soybean rust in row crops, specialty crops and turf applications. Following the launches in Paraguay and the U.S., we expect to launch Fluindapyr in China in 2022, Europe and Argentina in 2023 and Brazil in 2024. We expect to close the acquisition by the end of the third quarter of 2020. Additionally, the second new active ingredient from our R&D pipeline, bixlozone, now branded as Isoflex active is also progressing towards a launch. We recently received full registration for Overwatch herbicide with Isoflex active in Australia and is set to launch in the 2021 winter crop season. It offers a new mode of action for grass weeds in cereals. We intend to launch Isoflex active in all four regions by 2025, and we anticipate peak sales of $450 million to $500 million. Isoflex is an exciting addition to our herbicide portfolio and will serve as a centerpiece to many of our herbicide crop segment and mixture strategies. Finally, in the U.S., we recently received EPA approval for a new diamide-based formulated product. Elevest insecticide allows growers to upgrade the superior residual control of Rynaxypyr insecticide, while keeping the rapid action of bifenthrin. It will play an important role in our plans to expand the diamide franchise. While the U.S. is the first country to receive the registration, we expect to launch this product in all key geographies. Before I close, I would like to highlight FMC's recent recognition as the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care Company of the Year for the third time since 2017. This annual award is the highest ACC distinction for excellence and leadership in environmental, health, safety and sustainability. While FMC has undergone many changes over the past few years, our commitment to operating safely and sustainably remained steadfast. I'll now turn the call back to Pierre. Pierre Brondeau : Thank you, Mark. We realize that forecasting and guiding is a difficult process in such an uncertain environment. Even if the forecast range is broader than what we usually show at this time, we felt that it was important to share our views on the business and markets. Underlying demand for our products is strong, and our ability to recover the adverse impact of FX with price remains intact despite the difficult situation we are facing today. FMC will face challenges through the year, but we believe that our company will continue to adapt quickly to what comes at us and once again, deliver another strong year of growth above the market. Even with the challenges we are facing in 2020, we expect to close two years over a 5-year plan solidly within our long-term target for revenue, EBITDA and EPS growth. This is my last earnings call as CEO of the company. I am proud of the transformation we have accomplished over the last 10 years. FMC is stronger than ever and the transition to new leadership is in place. Thank you for your support, questions and challenges over the years. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Christopher Parkinson : Great, thank you. First of all, Pierre, congratulations. A little bit of a crazy time, but either way, obviously, wishing you the best of luck. And as far as the question is concerned, can you just talk a little bit more about the fungicide acquisition you made this morning? And what the products growth trajectory was before and after your acquisition on a global basis, just given the broader market access? And then also, is it safe to say that FMC is still willing to further add to the fungicide portfolio? Just how should we be thinking about this transaction and as well as just enhancing your competitive positioning? Mark Douglas : Yes. Chris, it's Mark. When we started the work on Fluindapyr many years ago, we've built over the years an appreciation for what we believe this molecule can do. And as we said today, we think we're in the $350 million to $400 million range. Frankly speaking, I think it's closer to $400 million than $350 million. FMC had a view that our other pipeline of Fluindapyr, the ones that we developed together, were in the $250 million range. So you can see we're adding somewhere in the region of $150-plus million of peak revenue with this acquisition. Overall, the fungicide portfolio for us continues to grow. We're doing some interesting things with third parties around getting access to new fungicides. And certainly, as we scale the world and look at what is available, we will add acquisition targets to our list and continue to build out fungicides. I've said for many quarters and certainly the last few years, it is an area for us to build out. It is fast growing. We like where we are. We think we have a very good position, but more to do as we go forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : I was hoping just to maybe just dig a little bit deeper into the revised market outlook. And clearly, FMC is keeping the organic revenue growth outlook that you shared, lowered the kind of global market outlook in USD a little bit. But maybe frame a little bit kind of the areas of strength where you're more encouraged by market traction in the first half of the year and areas that you're watching most closely? And specifically around I guess any color on specialty crops and fruit and vegetables that we hear a lot of issues around labor issues and crops getting rot under and just thinking about the demand outlook in that part of the channel? Pierre Brondeau : Yes. Thank you. I'll ask Mark to go into maybe the details of the crops opportunities. But let me make a statement around a bit where we are in this forecast, how it is built and what we believe the situation is. I think it's important to say that we created the forecast with the intent to be cautious. We are four months into the year and underlying demand for our product today, as we speak, and year-to-date is very strong. So we do not have, at this stage of the year where we are, specific concerns for what has been happening so far. From a logistical and manufacturing standpoint, we had issues like everybody else, but nothing we could not address. So when we build the forecast, we looked at where are the places where we could have issues from a logistical standpoint and where are the places where we could have weaknesses from a demand standpoint. Knowing that in many cases, we've heard about corn, we've heard about cotton. In many cases, those area of weaknesses are balanced by area of opportunities. So we built this forecast out of prudence, we're being cautious. Today, I have to say, first week of May, we are four months into the year. Things are going well, but it's a very fluid situation. So we had to build into the forecast possibly issues which could be coming at us, we had to counterbalance with opportunities. Mark, do you want to go maybe on the details of some growth opportunities? Mark Douglas : Sure. Yes. Adam, as you all know, it's a very complicated marketplace. I'll try and hit some of the highlights and some areas where we're really focused on in terms of where we think we may see a slowdown. Certainly, in the U.S. right now, when you look at the balance of corn and soy, I have to say our pre-emergent business is doing very well, especially with our newer products, such as Authority Edge, which are extremely high performing, not only in the U.S. but also in Canada. I would say wheat is also a positive right now with what we see going on around the world. We have a very strong portfolio of sulfur and urea herbicides on wheat. Sugarcane in Brazil is another area that is actually some people view it as a negative, we actually don't view it as a negative. The big Brazilian producers of sugar are actually benefiting from an extremely weak BRL, which allows them to participate to a greater degree on the world market, obviously, somewhat offset by lower ethanol demand in the U.S. But it was very strong for us in Q1, and we expect to see that continue. The fruit and veg area is somewhere we've been focused on. You know it's an important part of our portfolio. We continue to see growth. A couple of the reasons we see growth. Part of our product launches that we talk about, where we believe we have about 1.5% of growth, a lot of that is coming from new applications in fruit and vegetables. I'll give you an example. We have about 300 new registrations this year across the world for all sorts of different crops, many of those focused on the specialty and niche crops. So yes, when we talk about demand destruction or dislocations in the food chain or labor availability, I would think fruit and vegetables is one of the areas where we're keeping a very close eye on. In other parts of the world, we're expanding into new areas, for instance, in soy, in sugarcane, in particular, in India, where we have new herbicides, we're seeing growth there. So for us, once again, the portfolio is very fragmented. It's well balanced across the world. So we do see areas of lower demand. One of the obvious ones for us right now is cotton. The cotton market is extremely challenged, given where world demand is, given the situation from COVID-19. I expect Brazil will have a lower planted area this year, probably India as well. So we're watching those two places as potentials for lower demand. Adam Samuelson : That color is very helpful. And congratulations, Pierre, on the retirement. That's helpful color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead. PJ Juvekar : Pete, thank you for your help first at Rohm and Haas and then at FMC, and good luck. You commented about getting pricing to offset U.S. dollar strength. Given that there is lack of credit in the system in some areas, particularly in emerging markets amid this COVID impact, would they expect some kind of price concessions? And secondly, are you extending any credit to any of your customers in Latin America or other regions? Pierre Brondeau : Let me start with the pricing question, and Mark, you can go in more detail what we are doing in the second half. But yes, I mean, pricing is a sensitive topic when you are in such a situation. And if you look at the first half of the year, we do have a pricing deficit versus the FX headwind. It is a conscious decision we have made. First of all, as Mark said, it's difficult to recover pricing and FX headwind in Latin America when especially Brazil, when you're at the end of the season. So you don't have a lot of leverage price offset, but we made a conscious decision because of the economic situation to not push too hard on pricing in Q1 and Q2 in Asia or even EMEA, where we had adverse effects. We gave a break to our customers who are prepared in those two regions of the world to take a little bit of a lag in a pricing strategy, and we will be targeting those regions more towards the second half of the year. Brazil is a different situation. It's just a country where pricing and currency, there is a business model. It is built in the business model, and we've been operating quite well in the fourth quarter last year with the BRL close to 5. We've been operating very well in the first quarter this year, with a BRL between 5.5 to 5.7. I think there is a mechanism for it. And when we're going to get into the new season, second half of the year where you are preparing for orders you reset the pricing. And that's just a mechanism which happens. So you're right, it's a bit of a different situation. And that's why we are prepared to take a lag on pricing in Asia and EMEA in the first half of the year and focus to do that in the second half. Mark Douglas : Yes. I think, PJ, to the second part of your question around terms, liquidity is not bad everywhere. A lot of people tend to focus on the stress that the U.S. market has been under for some time. But you look at places like Brazil, where in local currencies, the growers are doing extremely well. So in those particular markets, which are large for us, we're not looking at extending terms. If you look at our DSOs, you will have seen them grow a little bit over the last year. The reality is we're growing in some jurisdictions that have longer natural terms, and that's something that we're willing to accept is obviously profitable growth for us. So a mixture of price and then growth in different jurisdictions causes that DSO to move out a little bit, but it's not something that we're unconcerned with. We're watching very closely. And obviously, we will react to the markets. As the markets move, we will move. And in some cases, we lead the markets, especially on price. PJ Juvekar : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Favre with Exane. Please go ahead. Laurent Favre : My question is on your comments on feeling a bit better about Europe in the market. I was a bit surprised given the weaker euro but also the fact that your peers seem to have only mentioned fungicides as an area where they are seeing strength. And this is not one of, I believe, one of your strongholds. So I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit more about your comments on Europe. Mark Douglas : Yes, Laurent. Yes, we are feeling a little more confident in Europe. I mean obviously, the season has started very dry, although it is raining now in Northern Europe, which is good. Southern Europe has been much better. And even during the extensive lockdown in Italy, our business has been very good. Teams using very different tools to actually sell. We do have new product launches really in herbicides in Europe, which are for cereals. That is a big market that FMC is growing into. So we don't necessarily have to be linked to the market growth for us to grow very well. And then we continue to see an extension of our insecticides, the diamide sales continue to grow in Europe as well. So a combination of herbicides, insecticides and some new third-party fungicides that we're putting in place as well. You're right, we're not very big in fungicides in Europe. So anything we can do there will help boost our growth. I would say that the other piece to that is we're growing in Russia, Ukraine, Eastern Europe, where we've never, over the last two years, had a huge presence, but we put a lot of effort into those countries. The team in Europe is expanding the number of people on the ground, and we are growing in those areas. That also boosts our confidence for our growth in Europe. Laurent Favre : That's great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Congratulations, Pierre. My question would just be on the cost side of the equation, raw material costs, in particular. Obviously, you showed in the full year bridge that they're moving in the right direction. I just wonder if you can contextualize sort of the timing lag that you might be seeing just as crude oils move down, and I assume that some of the chemical intermediates that you buy are going to move lower with it. But what's sort of embedded in that guidance range versus what might happen and sort of provide some help to 2021 as well? Andrew Sandifer : Sure, Vincent. I think looking at 2020, we do still have some modest increase in cost in part. If you remember, cost increases that we see in the second half of last year roll forward into the first half of this year. We are seeing some opportunities for cost improvement with lower petrochemical oil costs. These are really for some of the non-active ingredients, some of the lower value inert kind of things that are part of our formulations. But there's definitely some room there. I would caution not to forget that the cost savings program that Mark discussed earlier in the call directly impacts our cost line. So there's about $60 million in cost savings in the rest of the year that's built into that improved cost outlook. So if you back that out, we actually see an increase versus our prior guidance of about $25 million in costs versus our prior guidance. And that's really COVID-driven costs, additional logistics costs dealing with more just-in-time shipments because of difficulties in managing logistic networks. And that is net of benefit that we're anticipating coming from lower raw material costs. It's hard to anticipate just yet all the way to 2021. But certainly, if we have normalization of global product flows, some of these increased costs that we're seeing due to COVID disruption should fade away, if not be outright gone in 2021. And with the easing of some of the petrochemical inputs and otherwise easing of other disruptions that impacted costs over the past two years, we should also see a tailwind on underlying raw material costs as well. So it's a bit early to dimension fully, but certainly, absolutely, there are some solid tailwinds on the cost side going 2021. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : And Pierre, team Fermium wants to wish you obviously all the best as you move on to the Executive Chairman. I was wondering if you could add a little more color with respect to the products that are not being reregistered or rationalized. I believe you said that there was a 3% negative impact, was that in a I believe that was mainly coming from Europe and Asia. Was that a 2Q comment? Was that a rest of the year comment? Any more color you can give on some of the decrement you're seeing from some of those products rolling off would be great. Pierre Brondeau : Yes, Frank, we're going to go into the detail. I just want to remind what we said at the last quarter. And it's a bit more pronounced this year because there is a specific product, Mark will talk about it, carbofuran. We decided ourselves to discounting you around the world. But every year, when we announce a growth rate, there is a 2% of negative growth due to registrations, which are being lost or to product, we decide not to continue to sell. So it is not a very unique situation we are facing. It's a situation we have been facing for years. Now the difference, bit more pronounced this year because there is a product we decided to stop, which was a bit bigger, and there is more of a concentration on EMEA and Europe than in the past. Mark, do you want to go into more detail? Mark Douglas : Yes. You hit the highlight, Pierre. Carbofuran at the end of last year, we decided to exit that older insecticide. I would say it's a combination of some smaller products and then a couple of big ones this year. Carbofuran, Europe has been hit with the removal of dimethoate, which is another insecticide. Tebuconazole which is a fungicide. Asia also was hit by the carbofuran removal. So when you think about it, it's really related to older insecticides that we're removing out of the portfolio. And I would expect the vast majority of that to occur in Europe as we go through the rest of the year, outside of the carbofuran removal. Frank Mitsch : Thank you. Very helpful. Mark Douglas : Thanks, Frank. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Steve Byrne : Yes. I'd like to drill into the Latin America region, your results there, the last few quarters have outperformed your peers. What is it that you see that you have in your commercialization strategy down there or your portfolio that gives you an edge in that region? Also wanted to ask a little bit about the sugarcane herbicide. You mentioned replanting, that's a multiyear crop. Was there a surge of replanting and therefore, that's maybe not recurring? Just would like to get any details that might help us assess the sustainability of the growth that you're showing down in that region? Mark Douglas : Yes. Sure, Steve. So listen, Latin America, I mean, most people associate Latin America and Brazil with FMC, which is fine. But I think what we've seen over the last two years is a return to growth in many parts of Latin America. We talked a lot about Argentina and how we've restructured the business. Argentina is growing very rapidly for us. We have a very good portfolio that meets the crop needs down there. Good position on pre-emergent herbicides for soy and insecticides with the diamides. In the rest of Latin America, Mexico is benefiting a lot from our portfolio in terms of fruit and vegetables and specialty crops. And then we're returning to growth in many of the Andean countries, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile. So not only are we seeing geographic growth from our portfolio, but then you look at Brazil, we have been very careful in Brazil of how we've grown over the last few years. We talked about being careful on our balance sheet, but we've really focused on in the south, the major co-ops, expanding a position that we really never had until the last couple of years since the acquisition of the new portfolio. We're also now turning our attention where we have major presence in market shares in cotton, in coffee, in sugarcane. We're also turning the portfolio to market access in the north for the soy/corn business. That suits us very well. We're gaining market access there. So we expect to continue to see growth on the row crops in Brazil, which have never really never been a big market for us, and we have a very small, low single-digit market share. One of the things on the sugarcane, the second part of your question is, you're right. Sugarcane is a multiyear crop, and replenishment tends to occur at the 15% to 20% range. Some years higher, some years lower. We are a little higher than normal. But what is happening is the growers are looking for as higher yield as they can possibly get. And therefore, they're using the highest quality products, which will allow that yield to come forward. We have some very good herbicides in market-leading position. So we take more of a share when the growers are looking for higher sugar yields than they would normally do in the past. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly : Pierre, Mark, there really doesn't seem to be any end in sight to the trade war with China. And now with COVID, has your view of China's position in your supply chain evolved further? I'm curious how far along you are in your diversification of sourcing, but also whether you're thinking about diversifying further? Pierre Brondeau : Yes. I think it is something we've been looking at and certainly with the current situation, not something we want to slow down doing. We are of course, China is critical to us, and we're operating lots of payments with partners. China used to be 95% of our raw material and active ingredient supply. Today, it's down to less than 60%. And we are increasing our investment in places like India, like Europe, so North America. So yes, we are thinking, if you think about the next five years, you will see us continue to rebalance our supply between China and the Rest of the World. A couple of calls ago, Mark said, one of his target in not-too-distant future, would be to be in the 30% to 40% coming from China, the rest from the rest of the world. It takes time. Registrations are very important. But certainly, for anything, which is new product we are bringing to the market, we are looking at manufacturing sites, which are very often non-China based. Mark Connelly : What about the MERCOSUR? Mark Douglas : Yes. It's Mark, it's we talk about it a lot. Why don't we put active ingredient manufacturing down into Latin America, especially in the south between Argentina and Brazil. It will be an obvious place to go for us from a demand perspective. The only problem is with a lot of specialty and fine chemicals, you need infrastructure around you. You need close supply of many intermediates that are sometimes not difficult not easy to make. Unfortunately, there is not that chemical infrastructure in the MERCOSUR region. And therefore, we intend to import active ingredients and then formulate and package in Brazil, in Argentina. Mark Connelly : Thank you. Mark Douglas : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov : And I would join everyone in congratulating Pierre. Pierre, in a recent newspaper interview, you were asked about what Mark might be doing different when he succeeds you. And you noted that Mark has been investing in precision Ag. Could you or Mark elaborate on this? Pierre Brondeau : Yes, absolutely. Listen, we went through a transformation. And I would say, Mark and I, we've been working very, very closely with each other for the last five years. So I don't think you should expect a fundamental change of the direction of the company. But if you look back over the last couple of years, Mark has been and his role within the senior leadership team here at FMC has been to push technology, among other things, and he's been the champion for sustainability and precision Ag. So if you think about those three areas, among others, we're in places where he's going to take the company, I believe, to the next level. So precision Ag being one. We're making progress. Maybe, Mark, you want to say a couple of words on where we are and progress we are making? Mark Douglas : Sure. we talked about it in a roundabout way over the last year in terms of what we've been doing behind the scenes. I'm not going to spoil the team's thunder because we have something coming up in the next couple of weeks that will be very public. But we do believe, like many in our industry that from a sustainable Ag perspective, the use of data, the use of forward-looking applications and mechanization has to help the industry. And we want to be part of that. We've invested in that so far. We continue to invest. And you will be seeing something in the next few weeks from us that shows that we're not thinking in the same way as many of our competitors but we are going to do some very different things with products and applications that will allow growers to utilize our products at the right point in time for their applications, therefore, would be much more sustainable in terms of amount of product used and where it is used. So stay tuned. This will be the first move we're making, but we will be making more moves. We have some very, very novel and interesting ideas of where we can take technology, that's not core to our base, but will be enabled by the growers in distribution. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO. Please go ahead. Joel Jackson : Quick question. When would you feel comfortable or what conditions would you need to see to reinstitute the buyback program? Pierre Brondeau : I'm going to let my good friend, Andrew complement my question. But we haven't put a date because we want to see how things are evolving. We were cautious in the forecast. But the company is doing well today. We believe we had no reason to change the forecast. From a cash flow standpoint, we've been going over it day after day after day, we are watching that very carefully. And we today feel very confident around our ability to generate cash flow. Our balance sheet is in good shape. So we do not believe it would be prudent to stay with a buyback program, but I would not be surprised from us as soon as we have more clarity on how the situation is evolving to get back into the buyback. And Andrew said it in his prepared comments, we are committed to returning the cash per the 5-year plan we gave in December 2018. That has not changed. There is no reason to have a prolonged suspension of the stock buyback program. So I would expect us coming in as soon as possible and as soon as we get more clarity around this pandemic situation is going. Andrew, do you want to add a couple of words? Andrew Sandifer : Yes. Sure, Pierre. I think certainly I don't think they're bright lines, Joel, in terms of trigger points. I would say, leverage is a tick or two high where it should be for us to be buying back stock at the moment. But I think the biggest thing is really this uncertain environment that Pierre discussed. We're feeling pretty confident about the cash flow, but our cash flow mix during the year is very strongly positive free cash flow in the second half. The first half is a build of working capital. And just given that uncertainty, I'd like to see more cash in the hand before we get comfortable with the full year cash flow being there to support buybacks. So I think we're well on our way there. We're seeing very good progress with collections in the first quarter, particularly in Europe and Latin America. We continued to put tremendous focus on driving improved collection and through forecasting of collections. But I think we just want to get past all this uncertainty, see the leverage get down back to more into the target range and then recognize a bit of the seasonal pattern of our cash flow, where that really strong cash generation in the second half, a much better base to drive sort of a restart of share repurchase. So more to come as we get more view of the global situation. Michael Wherley : Thank you. That is all the time that we have for the call today. Thanks, and have a good day. Operator : This concludes the FMC Corporation conference call. Thank you.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Wherley, Director of Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Please go ahead. Michael Wherley : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's Second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Mark Douglas, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mark will review our second quarter performance and the outlook for the rest of the year. Andrew will provide an overview of select financial results and discuss sustainability of FMC's tax structure. Following the prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our earnings release and today's slide presentation are available on our website and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call. Let me remind you that today's presentation and discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including, but not limited to, those factors identified in our earnings release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's understanding. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion and the supporting materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations, free cash flow and organic revenue growth. All of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that as used in today's discussion, earning means adjusted earnings and EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms, of which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. At our last earnings call, we forecasted Q2 would be a challenging quarter. Despite this outlook, we delivered solid financial performance and navigated the challenges posed by COVID-19, severe headwinds from foreign currency, very dry weather in Europe and an industry-leading comparison from Q2 2019. Our proactive cost control actions, along with price and volume increases, delivered earnings growth in the quarter. Our confidence in the outlook for the second half of the year has increased, which is why we are raising the midpoints of our EBITDA and EPS guidance and tightening those ranges. Underlying demand for our products remains healthy. And we expect double-digit organic revenue growth in the second half of the year, driven by volume, market access expansion and the full effect of our pricing actions. We also continue to invest in innovation to support and enhance the long-term sustainable growth model we have built at FMC. In the past few months, we announced the launch of our Arc Farm Intelligence Platform and a related agreement with Nutrien to increase the adoption of this technology. We launched FMC ventures with an initial investment in Trace Genomics, and we announced a partnership with Cyclica that will enhance our R&D discovery engine. Let me now turn to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. As we said last quarter, we have avoided significant plant closures and all our manufacturing facilities remain operational. The well-being of our employees is FMC's top priority. Although most FMC employees around the world have been working from home during these last few months, we are slowly bringing employees back to offices and laboratories in locations where health officials have deemed this to be safe. In addition, we have thousands of employees who continue operating our manufacturing sites and distribution warehouses. In all our facilities, we are using a variety of best practices to address COVID-19 risks and following the protocols and procedures recommended by leading health authorities. In Q2, sourcing of raw materials and intermediates was not a significant issue, although we continue to see some logistics challenges and related higher costs. We are seeing some pockets of reduced demand as expected due to food chain dislocations and labor availability. As we commented in May, we implemented cost-saving measures across the company, and price increases to offset the impact of COVID-19 and the related FX headwind caused by a stronger U.S. dollar. Turning to our results on Slide 3. FMC's strong financial performance over the past several quarters continued in the second quarter despite a robust prior period performance. Last year, our business grew 9% organically in Q2. This year, we reported approximately $1.16 billion in second quarter revenue, which reflects a 4% decrease on a reported basis, but 3% growth organically. After removing the FX impact, our business saw double-digit growth in Argentina, Brazil, Australia, Pakistan and Canada. Adjusted EBITDA was $341 million, an increase of 1% compared to the prior year period. EBITDA margins were 29.5%, an increase of 150 basis points compared to the prior year driven by significant cost containment measures and pricing actions. Adjusted EPS was $1.72 in the quarter, an increase of 4% versus Q2 2019. This year-over-year performance was driven equally by the increases in EBITDA, reduced share count and the benefit of a lower tax rate. Relative to our Q2 guidance, however, the $0.06 beat was driven almost entirely by our $9 million EBITDA outperformance versus the midpoint. Moving now to Slide 4. Q2 revenue declined by 4% versus prior year as a 7% FX headwind more than offset growth contributions of 2% from volume and 1% from price. We overcame a 3% volume impact from products that were discontinued either because of registration cancellations or rationalizations that we had planned for and forecasted earlier this year. We should note that 2020 has a higher than normal level of product discontinuations. Latin America sales grew 2% year-over-year and 24%, excluding FX. Pricing actions across the region offset some of the currency headwind, while the underlying volume gains were very strong in Argentina and Brazil. Sales grew fastest in Argentina, driven by herbicide sales for wheat and soybean applications, including Finesse herbicide. In Brazil, sales grew double digits organically, led by continued robust demand for our products on sugarcane including Boral herbicide and Altacor insecticide. Our channel inventories in Brazil continue to be at normal levels as we head into the new season. Mexico sales grew organically but were impacted somewhat by COVID-19-related pressures on the growers that export fruits and vegetables. In Asia, revenue increased 2% year-over-year and 8% excluding FX. Volume growth in India, Australia and Pakistan as well as modest price increases across the region were mostly offset by FX headwinds and some COVID-19-related impacts in India. Herbicide sales, including for the newly launched Authority NXT were robust for soybeans in India. We also continue to see a strong market recovery in Australia with the improved weather and record demand for Hammer and Affinity Force herbicides due to strong broad acre season. In North America, sales decreased 6% year-over-year, driven by our continued focus on drawing down channel inventories of our pre-emergent herbicides following the wet spring last year. Coming out of this summer, we forecast our channel inventories will be in a much better position in this region, which should lead to good restocking at the end of the year. We also saw robust sales of Lucento fungicide in our second U.S. season. Sales in Canada were strong, driven by herbicide blends from our precision pack systems for use on cereals and insecticides to control early season pests. Sales in EMEA contracted 13% year-over-year and 10% excluding FX due to hot dry conditions across Northern and Eastern Europe and Ukraine as well as the expected registration cancellations and product rationalizations. This was partially offset by insecticide growth in Southern Europe for specialty crops. Turning now to the second quarter EBITDA bridge on Slide 5. We had strong operational performance, offsetting a $62 million FX headwind with a $46 million contribution from lower costs, a $16 million benefit from higher pricing and modest volume growth. Moving now to Slide 6. While we've included first half results to highlight the overall performance we have delivered in a very challenging market. We posted organic revenue growth of 6%. On the EBITDA bridge, balanced contributions from volume growth, price increases and cost reductions more than offset the FX headwind. I will now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks, Mark. Let me start this morning with a few highlights from the income statement. FX was a larger than anticipated headwind to revenue growth in Q2 at 7% versus our expectations of a 5% impact. The Brazilian real was more than half of this total, followed by the Indian rupee, Pakistan rupee, Australian dollar, euro and a broad set of other European currencies. While we did take pricing actions in the quarter, we were intentionally less aggressive particularly in countries hit hard by COVID. We continue to expect FX headwinds to remain at an elevated level throughout 2020, with pricing trailing FX impacts for the full year, with prices increasing ahead of FX during the second half of the year. Interest expense for the second quarter was $40.7 million, up slightly from the prior year period primarily due to the impacts of our third quarter 2019 debt offering and higher foreign debt balances, partially offset by lower term loan and commercial paper balances. With the decrease in interest rates since the last quarter, we now anticipate interest expense between $150 million and $160 million for the full year, somewhat better than our prior guidance. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the second quarter was 13.5%, consistent with our expected full year tax rate of 12.5% to 14.5%. Before leaving the topic of taxes, I think it's important to spend a few minutes this morning on the long-term sustainability of FMC's tax rate. Particularly given tax rate impact on our stock valuation on a price to earnings basis as opposed to an enterprise value to EBITDA basis. As many of you have noted, FMC currently trades at a premium to our peers on an EV/EBITDA basis but at a discount on a PE basis. When we completed DuPont Crop Protection transaction in 2017, we aligned the legal entity structure of FMC in such a way that in conjunction with our broad geographic dispersion of sales, led to the advantaged tax rate, which we now benefit from. We believe this will prove to be durable. FMC operates our business through regional hubs in which we have established principal operating companies or POCs. Our POCs own, operate and protect business-critical assets particularly intellectual property, trade secrets and other intangible assets. As a result of this POC structure and our geographic mix of sales, approximately 40% of FMC's overall profit stream flows through jurisdictions where we pay the statutory tax rate on corporate earnings, such as the United States. The remaining roughly 60% of FMC's profit stream flows through jurisdictions where we have made significant investments and commitments and as such, pay an effective tax rate that is below the statutory tax rate. These arrangements are formalized through what is commonly referred to as a tax ruling, which sets the specific rate that FMC pays over a defined period of time, based on the commitments and investments FMC has made in the relevant jurisdiction. We believe with our existing and planned investments, we can maintain or improve upon our current tax rulings, at least through the year 2030, with further opportunities to extend them beyond that time horizon. As such, we are highly confident in maintaining a very competitive tax rate, particularly as compared to peers with very different entity structures and larger earnings streams and statutory rate jurisdictions such as the United States. Over the 2030 horizon, we expect our tax rate to stay in the range of 13% to 16% based on our expectations for geographic sales mix and the durability of our tax rules. Despite our competitive global effective tax rate, let me be clear, FMC pays substantial taxes in the United States, particularly due to the GILTI or global minimum tax provisions of the 2018 tax bill. Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity. Gross debt at quarter end was $3.5 billion, down by approximately $300 million from the prior quarter. Strong free cash flow led to lower short-term financing needs. We also reduced the amount of excess liquidity we maintained due to the heightened uncertainty caused by the COVID pandemic. We fully repaid the revolver draw made late in the first quarter at the height of the pandemic's impact on short-term financing markets. We ended the quarter with over $200 million of surplus cash on the balance sheet. Considering this surplus cash, gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 2.7x at the end of the second quarter, still somewhat above our targeted 2.5x annual average leverage, reflecting the seasonality of working capital and cash flow. We continue to expect leverage to be at or below 2.5x at year-end. Moving on to Slide 7 and specifically free cash flow and cash deployment. Free cash flow for the second quarter was $205 million, up significantly from the prior year period, with very strong collections in the quarter and improved payables. We are maintaining our full year free cash flow guidance range of $425 million to $525 million. With improving confidence in our outlook, we expect to revisit share repurchases at the end of third quarter and at present, anticipate restarting share repurchases during the fourth quarter. Moving next to Slide 8. FMC is making good progress in both improving our free cash flow conversion from earnings as well as growing the absolute amount of free cash flow. As you can see on the left-hand side of this slide, at the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect to improve cash conversion by 18 percentage points compared to last year, while growing cash flow by nearly $175 million. We continue to believe we have substantial headroom to improve further on both free cash conversion and the absolute free cash flow we generate, particularly as we complete our SAP implementation later this year and end the period of high cash spending on transformation efforts. On the right-hand side of this page, you can also see the breakdown of free cash flow generation by semester for last year and this year. Note that the seasonality is very similar in both years with negative free cash flow in the first half of the year and strongly positive free cash flow in the second half, but with improvement in both semesters in 2020 versus 2019. Finally, a quick update on progress in implementing our new SAP S/4HANA ERP system. This was the second quarter in close that we've completed with 60% of the company on the new system, and the closing end went very smoothly. We continue to push forward to complete implementation of the new SAP system across the remainder of FMC by year-end, which will give us a thoroughly modern system across the entire company and will enable further efficiencies in our back-office processes. The most recent implementation phase has gone so well that we are accelerating some synergies planned for 2021 into 2020. We continue to expect total synergies of $60 million to $80 million from implementing the new system, but we now forecast $40 million of synergies in 2020, up $20 million from our prior forecast. We will capture most of the remaining $20 million to $40 million in 2021. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Andrew. Turning to the market outlook for 2020. We now expect the overall global crop protection market will be flat to down slightly on a U.S. dollar basis, which is slightly worse than our previous outlook. The change is driven by a reduced outlook for Europe, where we believe the market will be flat year-over-year versus up low single digits in our prior forecast. Our views on the other regions have not changed. We expect the North American market to be up low single digits, the Asian market to be down slightly and the market in Latin America to contract by low to mid-single digits. All these forecasts are the markets, not FMC and are in U.S. dollars. As such, the Latin American market is seeing the largest headwind from FX. Moving to Slide 9 and the review of FMC's full year 2020 and Q3, Q4 earnings outlook. As I said earlier, we are expecting double-digit organic revenue growth in the second half of the year, driven by both volume and the full effect of our pricing actions. We expect continued headwinds from FX, and to a lesser extent, from impacts related to the pandemic. At the onset of the pandemic, there were numerous contingencies to consider. But after several months of navigating in this environment, we are more confident in our ability to deliver on our 2020 forecast. FMC full year 2020 earnings are now expected to be in the range of $6.28 to $6.62 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 6% at the midpoint and 7% above -- $0.07 above prior guidance. EPS estimates do not include the benefit of any share repurchases in 2020. 2020 revenue is forecasted to be in the range of $4.68 billion to $4.82 billion, an increase of 3% at the midpoint versus 2019 and 9% organic growth. We believe the strength of our portfolio will allow us to deliver high single-digit organic growth, continuing a multiyear trend of above market performance. EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $1.265 billion to $1.325 billion, which represents 6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. For the third quarter, we expect earnings to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.17 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 17% at the midpoint versus Q3 2019. We forecast Q3 revenue to grow 6% year-over-year at the midpoint. Excluding the significant FX headwinds, revenue is expected to increase 12% organically, driven primarily by robust growth in Asia, following a good monsoon season as well as improved market conditions in EMEA and a normal start to the Latin American season. EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $233 million to $257 million, representing a 12% increase at the midpoint versus the prior year period. The third quarter is seasonally the smallest quarter for FMC, which is in line with the quarterly pattern from the past 2 years, as Q3 is not a high season in any of our regions. Guidance for Q4 implies a strong quarter with sales growth of 6% at midpoint on a reported basis and 11% organically as compared with Q4 2019. We are forecasting EBITDA growth of 10% year-over-year at the midpoint. EPS growth is forecasted to be 3%, limited by the large tax adjustment in Q4 2019. Turning to Slide 10 and full year EBITDA and revenue drivers. Revenue is expected to benefit from a 5% volume growth with the largest growth in Asia and Latin America. New products are driving about 1.5% in total revenue growth, with the largest contribution coming from EMEA. FX is now forecasted to be a 6% top line headwind versus 5% in our prior forecast. However, we expect to offset much of this with price increases, totaling 4%. Regarding EBITDA, we will deliver significant cost savings this year to offset the COVID-related impacts to supply chain costs, pockets of lower demand caused by food chain dislocations and labor availability as well as a portion of the FX headwind. This includes the earlier realization of some SAP synergies that Andrew referenced. Foreign exchange remains a critical factor in our outlook. We now foresee an impact of $230 million for the full year versus $170 million in our prior forecast. We increased our full year pricing actions to $177 million to cover over 75% of the full year FX impact. But in the second half of the year, we expect to cover the full impact. Pricing will come from all regions, led by Latin America. Moving to Slide 11, where you see the Q3 and Q4 drivers. On the revenue line, volume and price are expected to drive the top line strength in both quarters. We expect the second half volume growth to be driven primarily by Asia and EMEA, in addition to the overall strength of our diamides business. Regarding EBITDA drivers, pricing is certainly the largest positive factor and volume contributions are also meaningfully higher than in the first half. As my first quarter as CEO, this was certainly an interesting time to start. Q2 was a quarter to focus on execution, cost management, the health of our employees, protecting the balance sheet as well as setting the stage for a strong second half. It was not the time to chase volumes or significant price increases. We are looking forward to the rest of the year as we continue to launch new products, expand our market access and stay aligned with our customers as we collectively manage through these difficult times. Before closing our prepared remarks, I'd like to announce that we will host an Investor Day call on November 17 to provide an update on our R&D pipeline. This will cover some of the topics we had planned to discuss at our Investor Technology Day that was canceled early this summer due to the pandemic. More details will be available in the coming weeks. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And the first question today will come from Mark Connelly with Stephens. Mark Connelly : Mark, conventional wisdom has been that India is going to get its GSP status back before the elections. So two questions. How much has losing that status affected you and is your sourcing strategy going to change materially if it's not backed by the election? Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks, Mark. No, the GST didn't fundamentally impact us when it came in. I think at the time, when it happened a couple of years ago, we did see issues with collections given just the dislocation between the old methodology, which was running across many different provinces and more of a standardized system. So no, don't see any change to our demand. I would say from a manufacturing perspective, we've taken a very broad look at rebalancing the supply chain over the last 4 to 5 years. Consequently, that has meant that we have moved resources out of China into the rest of the world. And one of those destinations has been India. Now at this point, India is very important for us and will continue to grow as we put more manufacturing assets into our own facilities, mainly in Panoli and Savli, but also into toll manufacturing partnerships that we've been growing over the last few years very similar to what we do in China. So I don't see that strategy changing. When you look at the overall economics of moving products out of China, there is obviously a cost impact. However, over the years, that cost impact has declined as not only China costs have increased, but a lot of our partners around the world have got used to making the products that we make and we've improved the processes. So for us it's not so much a question of cost, it is very much a question of surety of supply and quality. So bottom line, for your question, we don't see a lot changing for us with our investments in India. Operator : And the next question will come from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Have you seen your South American customers during the second quarter place more orders for this next crop, their crop inputs than normal when farmers sold their grain in recent months? And if that is the case, do you recognize those orders in the second quarter, or is that just a booking that you hedge and gives you the confidence that you can indicate what you think the currency impacts is going to be in the second half, your guidance is very specific on you can offset the currency drive with pricing, and you've got an estimate of the EBITDA drag? Is that -- does that just imply that a lot of the second half has already been booked? Mark Douglas : Yes, there is a lot in that question, Steve. I think, what I'll do is let me talk about where we see ourselves in Latin America right now. And then I'm going to let Andrew jump in and talk a little bit about our established hedging process that we use for our Latin American business, in particular, in Brazil. You've heard me talk over the last couple of years that we've seen an uptick in early ordering for the forthcoming seasons in Brazil. So I talked about a number of around about 70% of orders in hand in, sort of the early July time frame over the last couple of years. It should be noted that that was really in times of somewhat more stable currency than we have today and that indeed what we'd had in the past. A more normal rate for early July for us and into July is about 50% of the orders remaining for the year are taken for that point. So we already have them in hand. I would say today, we're in the 55% to 60% of orders needed for the rest of the year, slightly behind the last 2 yours, but well ahead of the average for the last 5 or 6 years, I would say. What's driving that? Well, obviously, FX has changed a lot for this year. And basically, it's got nothing to with the season being delayed. We see the weather patterns as being good for a normal start of the season which would mean planting in the late in September, early October time frame. It's more farmers and growers and distribution looking at the exchange rate and pushing out the decision of when to just simply place the order. Now obviously, that FX has an impact on us, and we've highlighted very clearly what we think that impact is. To your second part of the question about receiving an order, when do we book it. We book it when we receive it. Now let me talk about when Andrew can go through the FX hedging process. Andrew, why don't you talk through what we do when we get that order? Andrew Sandifer : Sure. So I think the practice in Brazil, we've had a similar hedging strategy for several years now. As we go through the earlier parts of the calendar year into this time of the year where there's heavy negotiation of terms of orders and pricing etc. with customers. As we get those open orders confirmed, we will hedge a significant portion of those open orders from the time we confirm the order with the customer until we actually ship the product and then recognize the revenue, right? So just to be clear, we don't recognize revenue until we actually ship and invoice the product. But that exposure between the time we come to commercial terms with the customer to the time we actually ship it, we hedge the majority of that exposure during that time period. Once we invoice a customer, ship the product and invoice it, we hedge 100% of the receivable. Hedging, of course, is not free, but that's built into our margin structure in Brazil, and it's been an important part of limiting the impacts of FX volatility on our business. So I say the bottom-line message for us with Brazil around FX, it is a more volatile situation than we've seen in the past several years. Pricing continues to be the first lever that we have to offset those moves in FX, but we continue to follow the same disciplined hedging strategy that we've had for several years now to limit the impact of FX and certainly to increase the ability of the company to deliver on its guidance. Operator : And the next question will come from Chris Parkinson Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Christopher Parkinson : Mark, despite the COVID, your organic pathway still looks pretty solid heading into the roaring 20s here. But can you just offer some additional framework in terms of the volume contribution from diamides versus the past few years, it does appear as size of peers further kicking into gear in a few geographies? And also how should we think about the volume contributions from new registrations and products as we head into 2021? Has there been any change in assumptions since your analyst day? Mark Douglas : Thank you. Strong organic growth as we go into the second half and I sort of touched on it in the script. Asia and Latin America are 2 of the drivers. And then following up behind that is our expectation 1 season in the U.S. and in Canada. From a diamides perspective, growth rates are still in the high single digits, low double digits organically. A little lower than they were last year, but that's not surprising when you consider that in '18, I think we grew something like 25%, then we grew mid-teens in '19. Now we're growing high single digits, low double digits this year to be expected. Those compounding numbers are very large, indeed. From a registration perspective, this year, we talked in the past about having round about 285 registrations and submissions going out through 2026 for the diamides. That was when we put the original plan together back in the early part of 2018. Today, we're at about 350 submissions and registrations. So that number has continued to climb the products that we've got our hands on. This year, we're pretty much on track to where we thought we'd be. We've added about 90 different registrations and label expansions this year, which keeps that growth rate moving forward in that very high, well above market type of number. Operator : And the next question will come from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : So I guess my question is twofold, first, just in the quarter and year-to-date, I mean, R&D has been down. And I'm just wondering if you could give any, I guess, comments and color around the COVID impacts to how you could spend the R&D and the -- just -- is that impacting your research pipeline in any way? And then maybe following on, Chris' question around registrations this year. Has COVID caused any issues in terms of your ability to get kind of all the documentation and trials done for new product registrations to launch into '21, '22? Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks, Adam. First of all, on R&D. When we saw what was happening with COVID and we knew we were going to face headwinds, both from a cost and potential market disruption. We decided to take a broad look at the cost structure of the company, and we put in place roughly $60 million of activities that we knew would reduce costs. Part of that was R&D. Now we were very specific with our R&D organization when we looked at our cost structure. We did not want to slow down any of the mid- to long-term projects where we're investing significant dollars in the development phase, and that is fundamentally where we spend a lot of our time and effort. So it's safe to say that the changes that we've made in R&D, they're more timing than they are anything else. They are not cancellation of projects. They're not cancellation of development activities. It's more looking at your project time lines and pushing out of the first half of the year as far as possible costs. Now we will obviously take a look at that in the second half of the year as well. We've been very clear that we think we have a good view of our demand situation. If for any reason, that was to change, we would be able to, once again, go back to our cost structure, not just in R&D, but in SG&A and look at other levers to pull. Outside of R&D, we looked across the whole company. Every single item of spend, whether it was related to our human resource groups, our legal groups, finance, IT, the commercial activities, global marketing, everywhere, we looked at costs. We looked at what was absolutely mission-critical for the first 3 quarters of this year? And what could we, again, push out rather than automatically cancel? So we've done a good job with that. Yet we still have levers to pull if we should see any situations that get worse than where we are today. The second part of your question is slowdown in registrations. It's interesting. Many governments around the world have been very adept at keeping their organizations running, even though you would expect things to slow down. They actually have not. We've been getting registrations on time. And in fact, we launched a new product this year in the U.S. called Elevest, which is one of our first formulations for Rynaxypyr plus another insecticide. We actually got that registration earlier than we thought, which allowed us to launch this year rather than next year. So to answer your question, Adam, we have not seen any slowdown in registrations that would impact the future growth of the business. Operator : And the next question will come from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Joel Jackson : I wanted to talk about the pre-emerge demand commentary you gave in the U.S. for herbicide. Can you talk about how much of this was just a destocking issue where channel inventories were high? And we had heard some stories a couple months ago that perhaps this year, farmers in the U.S. attempted to apply less pre-emerge. Because last year, they didn't apply as much because of the wet weather, yields ended up being okay. This year, the spring was early, the spring was good. The weather was good, and maybe they tried to get away with lower pre-emerge just like last year. Can you comment on that, please? Mark Douglas : Yes, Joel. Easy answer is, no, that's not what we saw. We did not see growers applying less pre-emergent herbicide this year. What we did see is very much a swing towards the much higher performing, newer products in the portfolio. Weed resistance continues to build in the U.S. and some of the weeds are getting very, very difficult to knock down. So we've introduced Authority Edge, Authority Supreme, which are very high potency formulations for glyphosate-resistant weeds. That end of the portfolio has done very, very well and continues to drive our growth, and we would expect over the next few years that the portfolio shifts to the higher-performing products. The reason we commented on our volumes is very simple. We did not like coming out of last year with higher inventories. So the revenue reductions that you've seen from us in the U.S. are solely around us taking out -- not putting back, sorry, into the channel, the same amount of product that is being used on the ground. So therefore, our channel inventories go down, we're in a much better position as we go into next year. Operator : And the next question will come from PJ Juvekar with Citi. Prashant Juvekar : A couple of questions on Latin America. You had outsized growth in diamide in Latin America, looks like in Argentina, did you gain share in sugarcane there? Was that the main driver and then I may have missed it, but can you just break down the 24% organic growth in Latin America between price and volume? Mark Douglas : So yes, PJ, diamides, listen, the diamides growth is coming from a number of different areas. It's not coming from what you just referred to as sugarcane. We already are the #1 player in sugarcane with a very high market share. So we don't -- we don't necessarily expect to take significant market share in sugarcane. We grow as we introduce new technologically advanced products. That is how we grow in sugarcane, but we've also seen significant growth in soybeans, in citrus, in coffee and in corn, in particular, which is a growing market for us in Brazil. Of the 24% growth, it's really equal between sort of price and volume when you look at where we're going. I don't want everybody to focus on Brazil. I know it's a big market for us, and we like it a lot. But I do have to say the rest of the region is performing very, very well. You heard me talk about Argentina and the growth rates we've seen in Argentina. Our structure has taken us a while to get right, but now we have it right. The team down there is doing a great job. We have a very good, strong portfolio for soybeans, and we also have a very good portfolio now for more of the specialty crops in Argentina. Mexico is a little bit more of a challenge right now. We've seen some demand destruction because of COVID, especially with exports of fruits and vegetables. But overall, that growth is pretty evenly balanced, which is what we like. Operator : And the next question will come from Laurent Favre with Exane BNPP. Laurent Favre : My question is regarding the impact of phase out. Mark, you've just said that there would be more impact in 2020. I was wondering if you could give us a percentage impact on volumes, for instance, for 2020 and perhaps your best guess on 2021? And then related to that, with the new Green Deal and Farm to Fork Strategy in Europe and the 50% targeted reduction in weed cutting from pesticides. I was wondering if you think that this is more of a risk for you? Or whether you think it's more for the, I guess, more generic players? Mark Douglas : Thanks, Laurent. On the discontinued products/loss of registrations, we think it's about 3% of our revenue this year, which is probably double what the average is for us. It's about 1.5% a year. We had a particularly difficult year because we made a very strategic decision at the end of last year to remove one of our oldest insecticides called carbofuran from the marketplace. This is a proactive move, impacted Asia, Latin America, is very deliberate. We have more sustainable products that we can put in place. So it was an obvious move to make, although it hurts the top line. And then we had a couple of other products in Europe that were impacted. I have to say Europe was probably the most impacted region from that 3% number that I just mentioned. You raised a very good point, Laurent, about the Farm to Fork and the European Green Deal. A 50% reduction in all pesticide use in Europe is an enormous number. And I know ourselves and our industry colleagues are very skeptical that, that number can actually be realized. In one way, it sounds like a very large drag on a particularly large part of the market. Yet in another way for the technology-based players that are bringing new, more sustainable chemistries that are targeted, I think it is an opportunity for us because there are still a lot of generics used in Europe that are older chemistries, and not with the same sustainable profile that the newer chemistries have. So we tend to look at it in a slightly different way. We tend to look at this as an opportunity to advance the new technologies into Europe, to have less of an environmental footprint impact, and also really remove older products that are all there, both in our portfolio and in the market in general. Operator : The next question will come from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : And Mark, congratulations on your first quarter as CEO. My question is you talked about -- I understood your comments on being thoughtful about taking price in the COVID environment. You obviously were able to take a lot of cost out at the same time. So just trying to think about as we move through the back half of the year into next year, I would assume you're going to get -- you're going to look to get a little bit more aggressive on pricing into next year. And then also just wondering if some of those costs that came out this year will need to come back in next year. And if those two things are going to offset each other? Or if you think you'll price more than the costs will come back? Or just how we should be thinking about that relationship in our models for 2021? Mark Douglas : Yes. It's a good question, one we're having internally now as we start the very early part of our budget process for next year. Yes, listen, I do think as we raise our prices in the second half of the year, they naturally have an impact on the first half of next year. If you think of the Latin American season, it doesn't stop at the end of Q4. It carries on well into the end of Q1, beginning of Q2. So whatever we do now, will obviously have a beneficial impact as we go into next year. As I said, Asia also will be and are looking at pricing now for the second half of the year, followed by Europe and North America. So I do expect to see pricing being a tailwind as we go into next year. On the cost front, the $60 million of cost that we've taken out of this year, there will be some spring back next year for sure. I talked about pushing back on timing on some projects and some expenditure. Some of that will come back. Obviously, you're going to have the very real tailwind of the SAP implementation, which will lower costs once again. We've already talked about another $20 million to $40 million next year on top of what we've done this year, and we accelerated this year. So net-net, I would say, price as a tailwind. I would also believe that because of the balance of SAP plus how we will manage whatever spring back occurs, I would expect cost to be a tailwind as well next year. Operator : And the next question will come from Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Michael Sison : Mark, just curious on where you have your manufacturing facilities, your raw materials sourcing was an issue this quarter, but you have a lot of your manufacturing in China. Any thoughts longer, can you shift of that around the regions, given your sales would have been more even and just wondering how long of a process would that take if you could sort of move some of your manufacturing around? Mark Douglas : Thanks, Mike. So if you go back, I don't know, 7, 10 years now, time moves on, FMC was probably 90%, 95% dependent on China. We had that very good model that we used to run called an asset light model. We've moved a long way since then. I was looking at some numbers over the last couple of months and I think, we're about 60% sources from China today. Our longer term, mid-term plan is to get that down to 40%, 45%. That will come through investments in India, investments in Europe and investments in part of the U.S. and Mexico. It's not easy in this industry to just pick your products up and move them. The registration process is tied to your point of manufacture. So if you move your point of manufacture, you have to go reapply for a new registration and that can take anything from 2 to 5 years, depending on the jurisdiction that you're in. So you really have to plan for the move. So when I say we moved from 90% to 95% dependent on China to 60%, we've done that over a 4-year time frame and really since the acquisition of Cheminova and the DuPont assets really allowed us to accelerate that because we have our own manufacturing facilities in India, Europe, U.S. now. So you should expect us to see a continuous gradual spreading out of our manufacturing, so that eventually, we're in that 40% to 45% dependency on China, the rest being spread around India, Europe and the U.S. Operator : The next question will come from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Mark, a year ago on this call, you provided a helpful discussion of your long-term growth strategy in diamides, taking those molecules through the various patent expirations around the world. I was wondering if you could provide an update on what's transpired over the last year in terms of your discussions around manufacturing agreements, actions on maybe new formulations and other aspects of that transition? Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks, Kevin. Amazing that it was a year ago that we talked about that. So the plan has been a very robust plan that we put in place for the continued growth of diamides. We talked about a two-pronged approach, which was obviously defense of our significant patent estate and then also the commercial aspects of bringing in other partners to allow them to sell the products. I have to say both pieces are going very well. We've had a number of legal successes in India related to manufacturers of illegal material that we've managed to identify and shut down, which has been very successful. And we will continue that process, both in India and in China and other parts of the world when we see people trying to break our patents or infringe our patents. The second part is related to the use of diamides with our fellow industry players has gone very, very well. We have, as I said before, about 4 global agreements in place today and over 40, what I'd call, local agreements with local companies. They -- some of those big ones are already up and running. Some of the smaller ones are starting a number of them require new registrations, which will take a period of time, but they're well underway in their process. So it's very much steady as it goes. We're on plan. With regard to formulations, we have a lot of work ongoing inside the company. As I said earlier, we just launched a new product in the U.S. which is our first FMC reformulation of Rynaxypyr with pyrethroids, very specific to U.S., but we have a number of those activities under way, and I would expect those formulations to come out in the next 2-3 years, as we gain the registrations because they're new types of technology. So overall, Kevin, it's a very good question. I think we're very much on track and we continue to grow these technologies very much, well above the market. Operator : And the next question will come from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : Let me add my congrats to the start of your reign. This year you launched the Arc Farm Intelligence Platform and notably have trials underway with Nutrien. I was wondering if you could give us some insight as to how that's progressing and what are your overall -- overarching thoughts for how this new platform can impact FMC? Mark Douglas : Thanks, Frank. Yes. The Arc platform really was and is a first in the industry. It is a predictive model for insect pressure. We were very careful in thinking this through in how we would go to market. And we are going different ways to market in different parts of the world. Obviously, the Nutrien agreement is one of those activities. It's a very specific crop, brassicas in California, it's not a particularly easy crop to grow, and it takes a lot of time and effort. And we believe using something like Arc, which is a predictive in terms of what pests and when they'll come, which will allow the growers to be much more optimal in terms of how they think about spraying. It is the first of what we will consider a series of technologies that will blend into the Arc platform. I see it as both defensive and offense in terms of how we could gain market share. But equally, how we defend our market share. We are the number one provider of insecticides in the world. So we have some franchises that we wish to defend. Arc will allow us to do that from a very sustainable perspective, using the right product at the right time, allows you to use less product, which is good for the grower, good for us in the sense that we defend our business. But once people get used to that, they're willing to expand the portfolio of products that they buy from FMC, and we're already seeing that. We actually see that with another technology that we have, which is called 3RIVE 3D which is our application of pesticides in soil during planting via what is essentially a patented shaving foam. It uses tremendously low amounts of the product and low amounts of water. The growers that are using that in the U.S. for corn are actually now acquiring more of FMC's portfolio as they get used to that type of technology. So we see these very targeted precision applications has been a boon to our growth and bringing more sustainable chemistry and technology to the marketplace. Operator : And the next question will come from Michael Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Michael Harrison : Mark, I was wondering if you can provide some examples of areas where SAP is helping to enable you to run more efficiently and with the acceleration of some of these benefits, are you more confident in delivering on the high end of that $60 million to $80 million of eventual synergies? Mark Douglas : Mike, great question. I'll let -- since Andrew is running the project in FMC. I'll let him talk about where we see the benefits. Andrew? Andrew Sandifer : Yes. Great. Thanks, Mike, for the question. Look, SAP really is the plumbing we run all of the business processes of the company on. So it's substantially a platform we run the back office. We have seen tremendous efficiency improvements as we've gone live on the new system, allowing us to leverage shared service centers rather than broadly distributed fragmented workforce. With the experience from transitioning off the DuPont TSA to bringing that work into our own systems, we are able to do it at a substantially lower cost than what we were paying to DuPont. And the acceleration we're seeing this year, what we're being able to do is we're being able to run more efficiently and actually take headcount reductions, some through attrition earlier than what we had planned with the full go-live of SAP in our -- the rest of FMC at the end of the year. So that $20 million in additional benefit we've been able to capture this year as hard savings that will continue and roll over into '21 and thereafter. That -- the additional savings, the $20 million to $40 million, I think we're highly confident in that range. Could it creep up to the -- above midpoint of that certainly. Some of the questions will be just timing. It will take some time during the year 2021 to implement that next wave of improvements as we get the full company on the full SAP platform. So that -- part of that will be a timing, what's run rate for the year versus what we actually get into the P&L next year. But we're very, very confident that we will be able to run, if you think about all of the business process, the finance close process, how we do planning, budgeting, how we buy things, how we plan and run our supply chain, all of those things that are run through the enterprise resource planning system. The degree of efficiency we can get by moving to a modern system that was designed and built for an agricultural sciences company rather than a collection of systems that were designed 30 years ago for a variety of different businesses. I don't also -- I don't know, just very briefly, also make sure everybody thinks as well. It's not just the efficiencies we get by taking some of the cost out of the back office. We'll also get some very new and much more updated analytical capability and tools and visibility on things like working capital. Where the way our systems are stitched together today, it limits our ability to drive as aggressively to the kind of efficiency improvement we'd like there. So we certainly see the new capabilities and the increased visibility by having all of the business in a common platform. It's being very helpful in our efforts to continue to drive working capital efficiency as well. Operator : And the final question today will come from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Great. And if I can ask a question on cash flow. It looks like you're going to be converting about 56% of your adjusted earnings to free cash, and it's about 37% of your EBITDA guidance at the midpoint. How should we think about if there's any discrete items that maybe could push cash flow up higher and then that conversion rate higher next year? Where do you see that going over time, I guess? And if you do see that going higher, how would that affect your kind of capital allocation. I mean, could we see -- you talked about $1.5 billion in buybacks at your Analyst Day a couple of years ago, maybe could we see some upside to that? Or would you be deploying [indiscernible] Mark Douglas : Great. Andrew, why don't you? Andrew Sandifer : Yes. Thanks, Arun. A lot in that question, but let me try to hit most of those points. Certainly, yes, we continue to guide free cash flow conversion in the mid- to high 50% percentage points this year. It's moved around a little bit as we changed our earnings guidance for the year. We've maintained free cash flow guidance throughout and still expect to be at that midpoint around $475 million. We're pretty confident at this point in that range. Obviously, a lot of things that can move. There are large items in working capital that move in the fourth quarter. In particular, with prepayments that we receive in the U.S. business, for example. But we have increasing visibility and sense of confidence as we go through the end of the year in terms of that cash flow number. Yes, as we think about the cash flow improvement trajectory, when we laid out our strategic plan at the end of 2018, we set a goal to take free cash flow conversion up in the 65% to 75% range. We think we can get well into that range in the next year to 2 years. 70% is very much within reach. That's being ahead of the plan that we've laid out initially moving faster there. The big couple of movers as we go into 2021. First, we will be finishing the SAP program. This period of high-level of cash spending on transforming our portfolio that we've gone through essentially comes to end and the $100 million to $125 million in cash spending we'll make this year largely goes away in 2021, becomes a tailwind on free cash flow. There's always timing issues and fluctuation in working capital, but we think there'll be continued improvements in working capital. And as we go, particularly as we get, as I've mentioned in the previous answer -- previous question, as we get better tools with the new SAP system, we have high confidence in our ability to drive further working capital efficiency as we continue growing. And then the third piece is just simply, we do have some nontrivial legacy liabilities. They're pretty stable. They will shrink as a percentage of the income over time. So they become a smaller and smaller drain on percent free cash flow conversion. I do want to be careful not to excessively focus on free cash flow conversion. It's an important metric for us. But that absolute amount of free cash flow that we could generate, we expect that -- to continue growing that. To your -- the last part of your question, that's really what allows us to have the funds to either buy back shares, increase the dividend or make inorganic investments in the business. That's where we'd expect to see continued solid growth. And it ties to our capital deployment policy, which has not changed. It's simply been paused because of COVID, which is we're going to fully fund the growth plan, take advantage of some opportunistic, small inorganic opportunities than anything else -- any other cash that's left over after our -- staying at our targeted leverage level, goes back to shareholders in the form of either higher dividends or through share repurchases. It's exactly what we've done in the first two years of the plan. We have $600 million in share buybacks and almost $350 million in dividends returned to shareholders since we launched this strategic plan in December 2018. We have currently about $600 million in remaining authorization on our existing share repurchase authorization. And we would expect to revisit that with the Board as soon as that's exhausted. So I'd say, really no change in our capital deployment policy and just we are going to continue to focus on driving more and more cash flow out of the business and maintaining discipline with how it's deployed.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call for FMC Corporation. This event is being recorded and all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today\u2019s prepared remarks there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Wherley, Director of Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Please go ahead sir. Michael Wherley : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Mark Douglas, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mark will review our third quarter performance followed by a review of our business in Asia and the outlook for the rest of the year. Andrew will provide an overview of select financial results. Following the prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our earnings release and today's slide presentation are available on our website and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call. Let me remind you that today's presentation and discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including, but not limited to those factors identified in our earnings release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's understanding. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion and the supporting materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations, free cash flow, and organic revenue growth all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that as used in today's discussion, earning means adjusted earnings and EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark. Mark A. Douglas: Thank you, Michael and good morning everyone. The third quarter was an exceptional quarter for our company. Even in the face of persistent challenges posed by COVID-19 and severe headwinds from foreign currencies, we grew our revenue by 15% organically, EBITDA by 20%, and EPS by 30%. This performance highlights our portfolio strength, balanced geographic and crop exposure, as well as a sharp focus on execution and cost. On the latter point, as we progressed through the quarter, we saw the Brazilian season was getting off to a very slow start due to hot, dry weather, which in turn made it difficult to get the pricing we had planned to offset the FX headwinds. To counter this situation we aggressively managed costs in the quarter and we're able to achieve the strong overall performance.  Let me now turn to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our business. As we said last quarter all our manufacturing facilities and distribution warehouses remain operational and fully staffed. The majority of FMCs other employees continue working from home, but some have returned to certain offices and laboratories where permitted by local authorities. We have had zero COVID-19 transmissions in our facilities and continue using a variety of best practices to address risks. While we saw very strong demand for our products in all four regions of the world in the quarter, there were pockets of demand reduction related to the pandemic. This impacted certain cotton and fruit and vegetable markets. We expect this level of localized disruption to continue in the fourth quarter and potentially into 2021. Following the outperformance in Q3 with our outlook for Q4, we are raising the midpoint of our EBITDA, EPS, and free cash flow guidance and tighten these ranges. Underlying demand for our products remains healthy, supplemented by market access expansion, new registrations, and an increasing impact from our pricing actions as we enter Q4.  Turning to our Q3 results on Slide 3, we reported nearly $1.1 billion in third quarter revenue, which reflects a 7% increase on a reported basis and 15% organic growth. After removing the FX impact, our business saw double-digit growth in India, Australia, Pakistan, Brazil, Germany, Italy, and Canada. Adjusted EBITDA was $263 million, an increase of 20% compared to the prior year period. EBITDA margins were 24.2%, an increase of 260 basis points compared to the prior year, driven primarily by cost control measures. Adjusted EPS was $1.22 in the quarter, an increase of 30% versus Q3 2019. This year-over-year performance was driven mostly by the increase in EBITDA, while much smaller impacts from D&A, interest expense, tax rate, non-controlling interest, and share count largely offset each other. Similarly, relative to our Q3 guidance, the $0.12 beat was driven almost entirely by our $18 million EBITDA outperformance versus the midpoint. Moving now to Slide 4, Q3 revenue increased by 7% versus prior year, despite an 8% FX headwind as higher volumes contributed 12% to growth and pricing another 3%. In Asia, revenue increased 16% year-over-year and 19% excluding FX partially due to favorable weather conditions in both India and Australia. Sales in India grew over 20% organically as the good monsoon drove demand from growers of rice, soybeans, pulses, sugarcane, and fruit and vegetables in the south and central markets. Herbicide sales in Australia were up over 50%, led by cereals and canola. Pakistan also grew in double-digits, driven primarily by insecticides in rice and corn. In North America, sales increased 8% year-over-year, driven by increased planted areas in soybeans, corn, and rice as well as continued market expansion of our fungicide Lucento and Rhyme. Sales in Canada were robust, driven by cereal [ph] herbicide blends from our patented PrecisionPac technology as well as insecticides. We broke a record in Canada this year for acres using PrecisionPac products. Elevest, the formulation based on Rynaxypyr insect control and bifenthrin is doing very well in its first launch year.  Heading into the winter our U.S. channel inventories are in better position compared to a year ago, which should lead to good restocking later in the fourth quarter. Sales in EMEA increased 10% year-over-year, and there was no FX impact. We saw strong demand for Rynaxypyr insect control applications for specialty crops, as well as Battle Delta herbicide for cereals, particularly in France and Germany. Latin America sales grew 1% year-over-year and 18% excluding FX. Grower sentiment is strong but the season started very slowly due to hot and dry weather in Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. Pricing actions across the region offset some of the currency headwind, although we expect pricing to have a larger positive impact in Q4 than it did in Q3. In Brazil, sales grew double-digits organically, led by our growth in the soybean market. Due to the late start in Brazil, channel inventories are higher than normal for this point of the year for us and the industry. We fully expect this will be worked down as planting catches up now that the rains have returned. Mexico sales grew organically, but was still impacted somewhat by COVID-19 related pressures on the growers that export fruit and vegetables. Sales in the Andean zone grew significantly as conditions in that submarket improved.  Turning now to the third quarter EBITDA bridge on Slide 7. We had very strong operational performance and a $70 million contribution from volume, a $34 million contribution from lower costs, and a $26 million benefit from higher pricing, more than offset an $86 million FX headwind. The volume contribution was double what we had forecast, partially due to the robust market growth in India and Australia. In addition, stronger than anticipated volume growth in Brazil was also a key driver. However, this did drive an increase in the FX headwind in the quarter. We had significant cost savings in the quarter, well above guidance given on our last call. Approximately 8 million of the $34 million cost savings you see on this bridge are costs that were delayed into Q4. We had excellent cost discipline, including additional accelerated SAP synergies.  Taking a step back now, we'll turn to Slide 6. As we did for Latin America last year, I'm going to highlight a region where we are seeing significant growth. Asia may be the most diverse of our four regions and therefore it is the most complicated to understand. We are currently the fourth largest crop protection chemical provider in the region, with sales of around $1.1 billion in a $16 billion market for about a 7% market share. This region is the most seasonally balanced of the four mainly because it has significant markets in both the northern and southern hemispheres. We've managed the Asia business in five sub regions with India and North Asia significantly larger than the other three, but we do have aggressive goals to grow in all of them. Not surprisingly, rice makes up about 35% of our sales in the region. In addition, fruits and vegetables are a large and diverse set of crops spread across all countries. Our crop diversity in Asia provides numerous opportunities to grow, and it also mitigates the risk of our results being overly impacted by a poor season in any single crop. Similarly, our geographic mix in the region is also very diverse.  Moving to Slide 7 for a look at how our Asia business has expanded since 2014. We had made two large acquisitions since then, Cheminova in 2015 and the DuPont Crop Protection business in 2017. Through these acquisitions we added a large active ingredient manufacturing plant in India and two active ingredient manufacturing plants in China, along with several formulation plants, R&D labs, and field trial sites across the region. Total sales were about $350 million in 2014 while this year we expect to be about 1.1 billion. This is in part due to a fundamental restructuring of our India business which we implemented in 2018 that enabled increased market penetration and efficiencies that improved profitability significantly.  I will walk through some of the sub region highlights to provide color on the crop diversity, country exposure, and recent commercial activities we have in the region. The five sub regions include Australia and New Zealand, South West Asia, North Asia, ASEAN and India. In the Australia and New Zealand sub region, our annual revenue is about $100 million to $130 million in a $2 billion market. Our market access model is via large distribution of retail companies supported by our own sales groups. Australia is predominantly a cereals market, we are therefore very excited to be preparing for our launch of IsoFlex Overwatch Herbicide in 2021 crop season. Earlier this year we began engaging retailers with a large scale demonstration plot program. IsoFlex is a new mode of action in cereals and it delivers high performance on leads that are developing resistance to the other herbicides in the marketplace. The Southwest Asia sub region encompassing Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Myanmar is the smallest market of the five. But our annual revenue of approximately $110 million to $140 million equates to a market share of approximately 30%. In Pakistan, we have a unique market access model comprised of FMC owned retail outlets selling our full range of products. This model has facilitated our growth to be the market leader. We see rapid Rynaxypyr insect control expansions for sugarcane and corn applications.  Moving to the North Asia sub region which includes China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan, we have annual revenue of approximately $290 million to $320 million in a $9 billion market. In Korea we successfully launched Accudo biostimulants in 2019 for use in fruits and vegetables, and we are preparing to launch two new microbial bio pesticides later this year. In Japan, we are seeing strong demand for diamides, particularly in the rice nursery box segment. In China, the market is highly fragmented. Our business is focused on rice and fruits and vegetables. Due to the customer fragmentation we go to market via local distribution and retail companies.  The ASEAN sub region includes Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Singapore. In all these countries, we work through local distribution and retail companies. This is especially important in the large Indonesian market, given its fragmented geographical nature. In 2020, we also expanded our market access to additional parts of Indonesia, similar to what we have done in India. In this sub region, we have an annual revenue of about $110 million to $140 million in a $2 billion market. We see stronger Rynapyxyr insect control sales for rice, as well as growth of cyatapyr [ph] on fruits and vegetables driven by little extensions.  Moving finally to the India sub region which generates approximately $370 million to $400 million in annual revenue for us. On Slide 8, we take a deeper dive into this $3 billion market, which has significant structural opportunities for agricultural growth. To start it has more arable land than any other country in the world. In fact, India has 30% more arable land than China and nearly twice as much as Brazil. This presents incredible growth opportunities for FMC with our very strong footprint and market penetration. You can see in the center of the slide that yields are very low in India, driven by low usage of crop inputs. On rice, for example, India's yield per acre is half of that of Brazil and less than a third of the yield in China. On corn India's yield is half of that of Brazil and less than 20% of the yield seen in the U.S. The market is dominated by small growers who do not have the scale to mechanize their operations. That being said, there are meaningful growth opportunities as these small growers recognize the benefits of investing more in crop inputs.  Moving to Slide 9, India today is about a $3 billion market for crop protection, and we see market growth of 6% through 2025, taking the market to nearly $4 billion by that time. Insecticides make up about 45% of the market today, with herbicides and fungicides about 20% each and plant health biologicals making up the remaining 15%. As you can see on the right side of this slide, the crop mix is similar to that of the Asia region with rice and fruit and vegetables making up nearly 60% of the market. In a market that is highly fragmented by both geography and a multitude of crops there are, as we said, significant opportunities to grow. In India, we have a unique market access model. We have exclusive distribution with five major companies that are supported by sales and marketing resources to drive geographical and portfolio growth. This model is currently under expansion as we look to service all of the Indian market. FMC has developed commercial initiatives in India to expand our market share. This includes crop and geographic expansion of our diamide brands such as Coragen and Ferterra, as well as eight new herbicide and fungicide launches since 2018 that are expected to drive sales of $70 million by 2023. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew D. Sandifer: Thanks, Mark. Let me start this morning with a few highlights from the income statement. FX was a larger than anticipated headwind to revenue growth in Q3 at 8% versus our expectations of a 6% headwind. The Brazilian Real was the vast majority of this headwind, followed by the Indian rupee, Argentinean peso, Pakistan rupee and Turkish lira. We took substantial pricing actions and were able to recover about one third of the FX headwind in the quarter. We continue to expect FX headwinds to remain at an elevated level throughout 2020, with pricing covering about half of the FX headwinds and revenue in the year. Interest expense for the third quarter was $35.5 million, down $6.1 million from the prior year period, benefiting from lower term loan balance outstanding, lower LIBOR rates, and lower foreign debt balances. These are partially offset by higher bonds outstanding following the debt offering we completed in the prior year quarter. We now anticipate interest expense between $150 million and $155 million for the full year. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the third quarter was 13.5%. We now expect our full year tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 14%, with the midpoint consistent with the tax rate through the first three quarters of the year. Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity. Growth at quarter end was $3.2 billion down $300 million from the prior quarter, with strong free cash flow leading to lower short-term financing gains. We continue to carry some excess cash due to heightened uncertainty caused by the COVID pandemic. Gross debt for the trailing 12 month EBITDA was 2.5 times at the end of the third quarter or 2.4 times if you consider the nearly $175 million of surplus cash on the balance sheet. This is consistent with our targeted annual average leverage of 2.5 times or less. Moving on to Slide 10 to cover cash flow and cash deployment. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $315 million, up more than 50% from the prior year period. Adjusted cash from operations was up $75 million, with growth in trade working capital more than offset by higher EBITDA, lower change in other assets and liabilities, and lower cash interest. Collections continued to be strong in the quarter, surpassing our expectations. Capital additions were down $27 million consistent with our updated expectations for full year investment. Legacy and transformation spending was down $15 million due to timing of expenses and ramp down of our transformation efforts. For the nine months ended September 30th, free cash flow of $148 million is nearly $230 million higher than the prior year period. Change in other assets and liabilities, lower cash interest and taxes, lower capital investment, as well as growth in EBITDA above growth in trade working capital all contributed to the year-on-year improvement.  As we look to year end we are raising our full year free cash flow guidance to a range of $475 million to $525 million, an increase of nearly $200 million at the midpoint versus the prior year period. We anticipate deploying more than $170 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. We paid $57 million in dividends on October 15th, plus the $65 million acquisition of the remaining rights to the fungicide Fluindapyr in early October and expect to repurchase $50 million of FMC shares. We resume share repurchases at the beginning of October and have completed $20 million of repurchases today. By year end we will have deployed nearly $350 million of free cash flow while maintaining excess liquidity throughout the pandemic. This includes the $115 million being deployed in Q4 on the acquisition and share repurchases, as well as the nearly $230 million that will be returned to shareholders this year via dividend. Moving next to slide 11. FMC is making good progress in both improving our free cash flow conversion from earnings, as well as growing the absolute amount of free cash flow we generate. As you can see on the left hand side of this slide, at the midpoint of our increased guidance range we now expect to improve cash conversion by 21 percentage points compared to last year, while growing cash flow by nearly $200 million. We continue to believe that we have substantial headroom to improve further on both free cash conversion and the absolute free cash flow we generate, particularly as we complete our SAP implementation and in the period of high cash spending on transformation efforts this year. On the right hand side of this page, you can also see the breakdown of free cash flow generation by semester for the last year and this year. Note that the seasonality is similar in both years with negative free cash flow in the first half of the year and strongly positive free cash flow in the second half. So an improvement in both semesters in 2020 versus 2019. Finally, a quick update on progress in implementing our new SAP system. Our final Go Live is underway as we speak with the remaining 40% of FMC moving on to the new system this month. Following this Go Live we will have a single modern system across the entire company for the first time in our history, which will enable significant efficiencies in our back office processes. As we prepared for this final Go Live, we've accelerated more synergies that were planned for 2021 into 2020. We continue to expect total sentences of $60 million to $80 million from implementing the new system, but we now expect to capture $50 million in synergies in 2020 with the remaining $10 million to $30 million to be achieved largely in 2021. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark. Mark A. Douglas: Thank you Andrew. Turning now to overall market conditions. With only a couple of months left to go in 2020, we continue to expect the global crop protection market will be flat to down slightly on a U.S. dollar basis although our view on the regions has changed slightly. The outlook for Europe continues to worsen following a hot, dry summer, and we now believe that market will be down low single digits year-over-year, that is flat in our prior forecast. Offsetting this, we expect the Asian market to be up low single digits versus our prior forecasts have been down slightly due to much better weather conditions in India, Australia, and ASEAN. Our forecast for Latin America and North American markets are unchanged, a down to low mid-single digits and up low single digits respectively. All these forecasts are for the market not FMC and are in U.S. dollars.  Moving to Slide 12 and the review of FMC full year 2020 and Q4 earnings outlook. As I said earlier, we are raising our guidance for the full year. We are still facing significant FX headwinds and impacts on both cost and demand from the global pandemic. But the underlying demand for our products and our ability to control costs led to our improved outlook. FMC full year 2020 earnings are now expected to be in the range of $6.45 to $6.57 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 7% at the midpoint and $0.06 above prior guidance. The $50 million in share repurchases planned for the fourth quarter will not impact our full year share count as the buybacks are too late in the year to alter the math for the EPS calculation.  2020 revenue is forecasted to be in the range of $4.72 billion to $4.78 billion, an increase of 3% at the midpoint versus 2019 and 9% organic growth. We believe the strength of our portfolio will allow us to deliver high single digit organic growth, continuing a multiyear trend of above market performance. EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $1.295 billion to $1.315 billion, which represents a 7% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Guidance for Q4 implies a year-over-year sales growth of 5% at the midpoint on a reported basis and 10% organically led by continued strength in Asia in addition to the global strength of our diamides business. We are forecasting an EBITDA growth of 8% year-over-year at the midpoint. EPS growth is forecasted to be flat year-over-year, limited by the large positive tax adjustment in Q4 2019.  Turning to Slide 13 and full year EBITDA and revenue drivers. Revenue is expected to benefit from 6% volume growth with the largest growth in Asia and Latin America and a 3% contribution from higher prices. FX is forecasted to be at 6% top line headwind. We have raised our EBITDA guidance by 10 million at the midpoint reflecting the outperformance in Q3 while recognizing the delay of 8 million of costs into Q4. We now expect a higher contribution from volume growth and we are also generating higher cost savings as well as earlier realization of some SAP synergies. We now forecast an FX headwind of $247 million for the full year versus $230 million in our prior forecast. On a EBITDA basis, we now expect pricing to cover over 55% of the FX impact of the year and pricing will come from all regions led by Latin America.  Moving to Slide 14, where you see the Q4 drivers. On the revenue line, pricing and volume are expected to drive the top line strength and regarding EBITDA drivers pricing will have a larger impact in Q4 than it did in Q3. To wrap up we executed very well in the quarter, both from an external perspective in driving demand across all regions, but also importantly internally by focusing on cost control and delivering critical activities that will drive our future performance. This includes preparing our Go Live of SAP, continuing to drive our R&D pipeline forward, and keeping priority capital projects on track. Q4 is an important quarter for cash and we are focused on cash generation as well as demand generation. We remain confident in our ability to drive above market performance once again. With that, I'll now turn the call back to operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question today will be from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Christopher Parkinson : Great, thank you very much. So on free cash flow conversion front, there's still a few moving parts but they're definitely in the right direction, just given your more stringent definition, can you just give us an update on some of the key initiatives you're mentioning, as well as some low hanging fruit which still exists for 2021 and even 2022, just anything that could further assist us in the pathway to over 80% conversion eventually? Thank you. Mark A. Douglas: Sure, yeah. Let me just give a couple of high level comments before I jump in on the details. You know, one of the one of the reasons you're seeing us move our free cash flow conversion and ultimately the dollars is the reason -- I think one of the primary reasons is the focus we've placed on cash as an organization. I think it's important to note that all the executives and senior managers now have a free cash flow component in the long-term incentive rewards for the company. And I do believe that that has helped change our view of free cash flow and how we go about delivering that for the company. So that's an important backdrop for everybody on the call of how you think about us driving not only earnings, but also free cash flow. Andrew you want to talk about a couple of the drivers there. Andrew D. Sandifer: Sure. Thanks, Mark. I think certainly strong quarter and year-to-date on cash flow for us this year and that very strong focus that Mark is talking to you see that in the way we've been able to manage the growth of working capital in particular. Also it has been benefited by some deferral of cash tax items under the CARES Act and lower cash interest based on the refinancing and lower rates that we've seen. As I think about free cash flow from a big picture perspective, I think Chris, to your opening comment and certainly just at the levels that when FMC is talking about free cash flow, we're literally talking about the cash that is left over to either pay dividends, buy back shares, or make small acquisitions like the Fluindapyr fungicide acquisition that we closed in October. Everything else is built into that number, all of the legacy liabilities, all of the investment that's required to continue growing the business. So we really are driving towards what we have in terms of free cash flow that can be deployed. As we looked at 2021 certainly we fully intend to take advantage of the new SAP system which will give us some new tools and a much better visibility into working capital, continue to drive working capital improvement. But structurally speaking and certainly we're spending over $100 million this year in cash to finish out the SAP implementation and finalize all of our transformation efforts resulting from the acquisition of the DuPont business. That $100 million is a tailwind to cash flow going into 2021. And all those other moving parts, CAPEX is a bit lower this year so there might be -- certainly should expect a bit of a pickup in CAPEX next year. The legacy portion should be relatively stable. And then the other remainder will be driven by our effectiveness and organic growth and driving that increase in growth and take the cash flow. So I think people should continue to expect that we show progress on that trajectory and we think that business should be in the 70% to 80% in the mid-term, above that in the long-term for a free cash flow conversion. Certainly [indiscernible] steal too much thunder, I'm going to grab a few minutes at our upcoming Investor Day in two weeks. Although it's largely focused on R&D, we'll spend a few minutes to talk about cash flow, cash conversion, and capital deployment policies in that event, as well as. Christopher Parkinson : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question will be from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead. P.J. Juvekar: Yes, hi, good morning, Mark and Andrew. You had a big impact of FX in Latin America. There was negative 17%. Can you go back to your hedging strategy, I know that you have an elaborate and well thought out hedging strategy, your hedges orders come in, can you just kind of describe that, are you trying to hedge revenues, net income, and just talk us through that and what happened in the quarter? Thank you. Mark A. Douglas: Yeah, sure. P.J. I will let Andrew talk about the details of the hedging policy, which we talked about on a couple of calls previously. I do think that overall when you have these types of movements, whether it's short-term volatility or a long-term movement in the currency, price is the most effective weapon for closing that FX gap. I mean, hedging obviously helps. It is important for us to understand what we believe the performance of the company will be and hedging allows us to do that. It is complicated, make no mistake. But I think we do a pretty good job of managing that exposure, that it really comes down to the commercial groups to manage the price lists and how they move price in any one jurisdiction. Andrew, do you want to talk about the hedging policy? Andrew D. Sandifer: Sure. Thanks, Mark. I think that our hedging policy, our hedging program is all designed around increasing the probability of being able to deliver against our guidance and just the expectations that we set. There's no hedging program that can protect you fully from year-on-year changes in currency at any kind of economic basis. So we're not trying to go to zero FX impact, we're trying to maintain an FX impact within a range that we can manage through the rest of the P&L, through the pricing actions and businesses we have. Our hedging approach has been pretty well in place for several years now as we start from anticipation of sales with time to get guidance through entering in commercial terms with customers, through the time we actually issue an invoice and create a receivable and allow the specific tools and levels that we hedge out and each part of that life cycle. We have a very high coverage all the way up to 100% once we have a receivable on the books. Looking at Q3 specifically, when you look at what we guided coming into the quarter, we expected an EBITDA of about $60 million headwind from FX and ended up being about $86 million headwind from FX. Part of that is it again, no hedging program covers 100% of the movement. And there were some movements beyond from what we anticipated. But the real driver was we ended up seeing some opportunities to grab more business and the mix of business in Latin America being more heavily denominated in BRL than what we had forecasted. So with that higher volume of BRL denominated sales, each one of those sales brings with it an increased amount of FX headwinds. So the real delta in the quarter was the impact of higher volumes and again, I think we're happy with the way the hedge program is performing. Again, it doesn't take all the risk off the table, it never can but it does help us increase our ability to manage the performance of the company, to meet the expectations that we're setting. Operator : And the next question will come from Laurent Favre with Exane BNP. Please go ahead. Laurent Favre : Yes, good morning. My question is on pricing in these two parts, the first one maybe could you talk about the I guess same to the point earlier around the bridge, why do you think you came a bit late to this game in some Q3 pricing plus 3 versus plus 6 but more importantly, how do you feel about pricing going into Q4 and 2021 in terms of inventories, especially in the Northern Hemisphere? Thank you. Mark A. Douglas: Yeah, thanks Laurent. Let's take the first one. First, the Q3 pricing. I said it in the script and we certainly saw this, as we rolled through Q3 into Q4 the Brazilian market was extremely stressed. We probably think that market was delayed by about 30 days in terms of planting. It was just so hot and dry, unprecedented weather. That causes all sorts of frictions in the channel as you can imagine. And our ability to move price to the degree that we thought it was just not as we had planned when we gave guidance in early August. So we responded to that. We had opportunities in the marketplace, especially in the soy complex to go and move volumes, which we did very successfully, but we didn't get as much price.  Now, what does that mean going forward? Well, certainly the price lists going forward for Q4, we are at a higher level because that's already been negotiated, so we do have confidence in the price that's going forward. But, we covered about 55% of the total impact of FX in the year. It's going to take us through part of next year and all the way into the next beginning of the next season in Brazil to recover the rest of that, assuming that FX stays where it is today. You just don't recover those sort of increases in one season. It is just too much. And you can't expect the grower to absorb that. We will continue in Latin America to push price as we go through this season. And also we're looking at price and we'll be looking at price in the other regions as they come into their new season in 2021. So expect us to be on this all the way through next year. And then we'll wait and see where we get to in Q3 next year for the 2021-2022 season in Latin America.  On the other part of your question, Laurent was channel inventories. I'll give a quick run around the wall because I'm sure other people have that same question in mind. In North America, particularly in the U.S., we feel we're in much better shape than we were a year ago. We were very explicit as we went through this year, the fact that we felt following the very poor year in 2019 in terms of weather, that we had more pre-emergent herbicide channel inventory than we would like. And that was the case. We've been very diligent in drawing that down this year, and we feel very confident that the levels we're at now are average levels where we can compete from a channel inventory perspective. And it should bode very well for a good restocking at the end of this year, getting ready for the U.S. season in Q1. In Europe I believe channel inventories are high. Not everywhere, but just given the weather conditions, especially in northern Europe, I expect that herbicide, some herbicides, some insecticides, and certainly fungicides will be high in Europe. It's something we're going to have to watch out for as we go into the next season, starting in Q1.  In Asia, I think India is in good shape. Monsoon was very, very good. So a lot of draw-down of inventories there, not that they were particularly high. ASEAN has improved a lot. Indonesia is looking much better now, more average for us. Australia has really got back on track. Excellent season given the drought we've seen the last two or three years. So Australia's good. I would say more inventory than we would like in China. For those of you that watch the situation, there was significant flooding during this season which did reduce demand. So we think China is a little heavy on inventory. And then moving down to Latin America, obviously Brazil is the major focus there. Right now inventories are high, but that's got nothing to do with how we feel about the market growth. Sentiment is very strong. We expect acreage to increase. Once again, local prices are strong. So the market is very buoyant. It is just purely a delay in the usage of products at this point. Put it in perspective for you, I can tell you we always look at how much we are selling and what the market can take, and we have not sold more than the market can take in Brazil. So we feel very confident that once the pricing really gets going, which is now, the rains have arrived, that Brazil will be in much better shape as we end the season. Laurent Favre : That\u2019s it, thank you. Operator : And the next question is from Steven Byrne with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Stephen Byrne : Yes, you did guide in India was very interesting, and it seemed that the Indian government was pretty supportive of Ag, they subsidized crop prices and fertilizers. I was curious to your view as to whether there is any kind of a structural reason why crop chemical use is as low as you highlight. The distributors that you use there, do they provide any agronomic advice similar to what Gingeta [ph] is rolling out in China or might you consider expanding your retail network that you have in neighboring Bangladesh or India, is that a possibility? Mark A. Douglas: Yeah, I think you know, Steve, thanks for the question. Listen, I think it is such a fragmented market that that whole complex of offering advice and developing the market itself has been slow to uptake. I think the value of the goods now are getting to a point where the growers see the impetus for improving both the fertilizer usage, crop protection, the seed quality. They're exporting more from that market. So therefore, there is more of an incentive to invest. We certainly from an agronomic advice given the fact that our four distributor partners, plus the sales and marketing force that we have there do give agronomic advice to the growers to help them improve their yields and educate the growers on what is happening. I don't see us going to a model where we have fancy stores in India. There's a difference between the Pakistan market and the Indian market. The Indian market is just so much bigger and more fragmented. We did a lot of business prior to the DuPont acquisition through small retailers and I can tell you, a lot of people focus on the P&L for the business but when you're going direct to retailers in places like India, you have to have a large balance sheet to support that. And we felt that was not the right way to go. So we took the five distributor model and expanded it. But I don't see us going to FMC stores in India. I don't think that's the right model for us in that country. Stephen Byrne : Thank you. Operator : And the next question is from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. So I was hoping Mark, Andrew this year\u2019s reflection a little bit year-to-date and what was implied in the guidance is pretty clear across the FMC continuing versus the global crop protection market. Just to get your kind of view on kind of the key drivers and the sustainability, whether it's just product, it's geographic exposure, and of your channel inventory and business units, how you think about your growth versus the market this year and kind of the sustainability of that? Mark A. Douglas: Yeah, thanks. So a couple of things. First of all, just the way you think about our business, and I know we talk about this a lot, but that geographic balance and the crop balance is very important. Plus the fact that, if you think about the size of our business, we're roughly almost $5 billion in a $58 billion market. We have a 9% market share, 8% to 9%. There is plenty of room for FMC to grow. We don't need the market to be growing mid-single-digits for us to grow at mid-single-digits. I think the whole area of how we're expanding our franchise and I'm not just talking about the diamides, I'm talking about the pipeline of products that is coming, the crops that we have. You know, I've talked before about the number of registrations that we continue to add to our portfolio, which drives that future growth. You think about products this year, we have about $70 million of new revenue from products that were launched this year. So, that's what -- 1.5%, almost 2% of revenue growth just from products that we're launching without the rest of the portfolio moving into new crops. So, that geographic expansion is very important. Not only are we seeing that in India as we've been very deliberate in moving out to certain parts of the country where we've not had presence, we're doing it in Indonesia, we're looking at our China business in terms of which provinces we need to expand into, and then surprisingly enough we're still doing it in Brazil. We are looking at market access in different parts of Brazil, how do we take more share with the quality of the portfolio? So it's not one silver bullet. There are a number of components that we have to keep working on to continue to drive this outperformance of the market. And we strongly believe we can continue to do that. Adam Samuelson : Great, thank you so much. Operator : The next question is from Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly : Thank you. I was hoping we could come back to the pricing question for a moment. You've obviously got a pretty amazing record of offsetting FX costs in Brazil over time. And it doesn't look difficult this time with how strong farmers are. But your discussion of Asia, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how pricing is evolving in that market given that so much of that market has a historical bias towards generics and pricing has been difficult there in the past? Mark A. Douglas: Yeah, thanks Mark. You could see when we talked about the FX impact, Andrew highlighted the BRL was one of the major impact, but there were a number of other currencies there, most of them in Asia. We do move price and have moved price in Asia this year, not as robustly as Brazil, given the size of that market. But we do get price. I think what you got to think about in terms of the generic side of this business, you look at our business today. If you think about third party products, which for us are essentially how you think about the generic -- how we think about generics. That's probably only about 5% of our total portfolio. So competing with generics is one thing, when you compete with the same technology, competing with what we call value in use. So the value that the grower gets from using your products through either removing a pest to improve yield or productivity, that's where the real core of the business is. It is that value that the growers wish to protect. And think about it, generally prices are looking better. I know people always focus on soy and corn in the U.S. markets or in the Brazilian market. But where we are around the world, rice prices are not particularly bad. Sugar prices are not particularly bad. Fruit and vegetable prices are moving all over the place, given the demand has changed due to COVID. But generally speaking, growers in Asia now are looking at being more profitable and therefore are willing to spend on the higher quality inputs that drive that yield and profitability. So we think of it that way rather than the generic market itself. Mark Connelly : So, thank you. Operator : And the next question will be from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just to get back to the Asia or India discussion a little bit, just wondering, sort of as you look at the growth plan there, how much of it is just going to come down to continuing to penetrate your existing molecules versus is there going to be and I don't want to front run your R&D day either but, is there going to be a story about some new products that are going to have good applicability there or is there also, maybe an M&A role up opportunity in the region that might make sense or is it a bit of all three? Thank you. Mark A. Douglas: Yeah, it's a bit of the first two not necessarily the last one I think. Yes, we do have geographic expansion and also crop expansion in India. Those fruit and vegetable markets themselves are highly fragmented. So, we've talked before, as I said, about the registration profile and how we're increasing that. India plays a significant role in getting our products onto more crops in different parts of the country. Certainly, I'm not going to go into all the details of the pipeline. I'm going to do that in two weeks. But yes, the pipeline has applicability in India. I also think there are some agronomic changes going on that we see that are benefiting us. I'll give you an example. In Brazil, the sugarcane business is highly mechanized. In India, it is not yet there are labor shortages. So in Brazil, we are a leading provider of herbicides for the sugarcane market. We're now building a pre-emerging herbicide business in sugarcane in India, which is a brand new market. It used to be manually controlled and now they're using -- starting to use pre-emergent herbicide. That's a great example of the market that didn't exist a few years ago that is now growing rapidly and we can transfer technology and knowhow from Brazil to India. And in fact, in the past -- in the past few years, we have had India sugarcane growers go to Brazil to see the difference between the agronomic practices. That's all investment that allows us to continue to expand our market share and our market growth. Operator : Thank you. And the next question will be from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead. John Roberts : Thank you. Maybe just to give us a little bit of preview of your technology day. Sounds like they're having good success in the combinations of the diamides, maybe you could comment what percent of that diamide sales are currently in combinations and what would you think that will be a few years from now? Andrew D. Sandifer: Yeah, John we don't actually break out what are straight products versus what are formulated products, but certainly we are having success. We talk about the Elevest we just launched. We've got a couple of others coming this year. I don't think it will ever make up the vast majority of ourselves into this space but certainly as we fragment the market and some of the partners that we're working with, as they look at the sales they are also likely to have a mixture of products that they will do. So it may not be that FMC has those mixture partners, all those formulated products, but our partner companies will have. So you will see a growth in that type of -- part of the market but we might not necessarily have that ourselves. We will have some, obviously, because we're working on that but I think the general market itself will continue to fragment with more formulated type products. John Roberts : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : Yeah, good morning folks and an impressive results here in the third quarter. So as I look at your results for this year and the guidance for the fourth quarter, it really looks like things are accelerating in the back half of the year. So that naturally gets my mind thinking about the first half of next year and some of this accelerated growth in your results in the back half of this year, on a run rate basis probably implies a pretty good first half of 2021. Am I thinking about that correctly, how would you handicap kind of the kind of the run rate heading into next year? Mark A. Douglas: Yeah, you can't -- Frank, you can't necessarily say that the first half of next year is the same as the second half of this year purely because you look at our growth rates in Q3 and especially in Q4, Latin America and Asia in particular play a significant role. Well, that Asia business is not necessarily as big in Q1 or Q2, it is not far off but certainly Latin America is much lower in Q1 and Q2 than Q3 and Q4. So I think you got to be careful in that and that we never look at the business sequentially. It's not something we do because we look at it from a seasonality perspective. Now, do we have traction? Yes, obviously we do, given the market growth rates. But we're right in the middle of our budgeting process at this point. Just to give you sort of a broad view of the market itself, because I don't have FMC\u2019s internal numbers yet. But broadly speaking, you know, the market this year is down low single digits. I would expect the market next year to be sort of flattish. I think Europe should improve if the season is anywhere near normal and everywhere else is kind of looking a little stronger. Latin America is looking a little stronger. I expect Asia will too. The U.S. market, with prices for soft commodities where they are today, China continues to buy, the U.S. market should look a little better next year we'll see. And then you've got -- our long range plan, we pegged top line growth of 5% to 7%. Here we are through our second year, we're right in the middle of that range from a two-year growth rate perspective. People should be thinking of FMC delivering in that 5% to 7% range and 7% to 9% for EBITDA going into next year. I don't have the exact number, but certainly our long range plan through 2023 is on track. That's how you should be thinking about it. Operator : Thank you and the next question is from Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov : Oh yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to size the pricing versus a tax opportunity into next year. From your 2020 bridge it looks like you're under recovering about 100 million of EBITDA, is that roughly equivalent to what you expect to catch up next year? Mark A. Douglas: Difficult to say at this point Aleksey. We are certainly working with Latin America, Asia to look at where we're going to be on pricing. We haven't built that model out yet. But you're right we have recovered about 55%. We got about $100 million of pricing to go. It all depends on what happens to FX, does FX stay where it is given where the election is, does the dollar strengthen or weaken after the election, all those things come into play. So, I think it's a little early to say there is a $100 million tailwind in pricing going into next year. Operator : The next question is from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joel Jackson : Hi, good morning. Mark, you and your team have been engaging with investors more on ESG the last few months, maybe you can share some of the feedback you've heard, maybe some of the changes you might make and things you might do or your outlook or your strategy from these conversations externally and internally? Thanks. Mark A. Douglas: Thanks, Joel. Yeah listen, it's a subject that is very close to my heart. I passionately believe in sustainability and a company like ours where the marketplace that we operate in, I think there are tremendous opportunities for us to position FMC as a sustainable company and a leader in this space. You will have seen we made an announcement in October. We've now put in place a chief sustainability officer. We are restructuring parts of the company to put that under our sustainability office. For me, it ties so closely into the technology platform that we have and we'll talk about that in two weeks time at the Technology Investor Day. I think the feedback we're getting is there is an appetite and a discussion around the types of chemistries that get used, the latest technologies, the more targeted technologies that are softer in chemistry. The biological approach to crop protection is also gaining a lot of traction and the combination of the two types of chemistries together. And then there is the whole the carbon footprint of companies that come into play, how we think about our waste and our utilities, they're all part of managing the company and with the expectations of the various stakeholders that we have. So I do see it as an important aspect. You will see more from us. And, we're putting out some pretty ambitious goals for sustainability for the company that we will be reporting on a regular basis. So more to come from this area. Operator : Thank you. And our final question will come from Chris Kapsch with Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Christopher Kapsch : Yeah, good morning. Fairly straightforward one and sorry if you have touched on this already. But, there's been some incremental costs associated with these disruptions from COVID supply chain expediting getting, I guess, your product closer to your customers, ahead of time to maybe even some working capital drag. So, I'm just wondering if you see that normalizing into the 2021 season and if so what kind of opportunity from either a cost saving standpoint year-over-year or squeeze little cash out of working capital? Thanks. Mark A. Douglas: Yeah, you're right. We have had that drag on costs. I think we said earlier on in the year it was about $20 million of drag. Frankly, I don't see that going away in the near-term. When you look at what is happening in Europe today in terms of sort of the second wave, we have already been extremely proactive ahead of the next season of moving material to local warehouses distributed throughout Europe rather than the lower cost model where you use centralized warehousing. We are very cognizant of the fact that things are changing in Europe. So we've been very proactive in putting those products out into the marketplace where we know they're going to be needed and we have more of an opportunity to move them around that entails cost. Now, that cost was built into this year so I do -- I just expect it to kind of roll forward. I don't think you'll see a tailwind from that. Given where we are certainly Q1 is going to look very similar to Q4 I think. And if we see that wave growing elsewhere, we'll do the same thing in terms of logistics costs, moving products around, etcetera. So we're very much at the forefront of this. We're very proactive. We learned a lot over the last couple of years and we're applying those learnings. But they do come with an added cost. Michael Wherley : Thanks for all the questions. I'd like to remind you about our Investor Technology Update Call on November 17th to provide an update on our R&D pipeline. That's all the time we have for the call today. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : This concludes the FMC Corporation conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Wherley, Director of Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Please go ahead. Michael Wherley : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Mark Douglas, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mark will review our fourth quarter and full year performance, and provide our outlook for 2021 and the first quarter. Andrew will provide an overview of select financial items. Following the prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our earnings release and today\u2019s slide presentation are available on our website and the prepared remarks from today\u2019s discussion will be made available after the call. Let me remind you that today\u2019s presentation and discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including but not limited to those factors identified in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today\u2019s understanding. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today\u2019s discussion and the supporting materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations, free cash flow and organic revenue growth. All of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that as used in today\u2019s discussion, earnings means adjusted earnings and EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. A reconciliation and definition of these terms, as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today\u2019s conference call are provided on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying the fourth quarter was an unusually difficult one for our company and we are disappointed in our earnings results. We exceeded the midpoint of our guidance on EPS and EBITDA for a long stretch of quarters, principally because of the strength of our portfolio and our geographic balance, combined with strong execution in the face of extreme weather events and significant industry specific supply chain disruptions. This quarter was an anomaly and we will be as transparent as always to explain what happened. We experienced significant logistics and supply chain constraints in the U.S., reduced demand in the U.S. on some lower value herbicides, lower demand in Brazil and Argentina following the drought-related delay to the start of the season and products that were held up in Argentine customs. On the positive side, we saw strong growth in EMEA and once again broad growth in Asia. We had a very strong quarter from a cash flow perspective, which led to full year free cash flow of $544 million, an 80% increase over 2019. We also posted very solid 2020 overall results despite numerous challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic and $280 million in revenue headwinds from foreign currencies. Our organic revenue growth was 7% and our 2% EBITDA growth shows how aggressively we manage costs and implemented price increases to offset as much of that FX headwind as possible. The guidance for Q1 reflects our view of the environment in Brazil, as well as continued logistics and supply chain disruptions occurring around the world. We believe these COVID impacts are perhaps as severe as at any point over the last year. In addition, our very strong Q1 2020 makes this quarter year-over-year comparison a particularly difficult one. All of FMC\u2019s manufacturing facilities and distribution warehouses remain operational and fully staffed despite the ongoing pandemic. However, one of our U.S. toll manufacturers was disrupted in Q4 because of COVID-related staffing issues, illustrating just one of the ongoing business risks during the pandemic. We successfully completed the implementation of our new SAP system in November. We now have a single modern system across the entire company for the first time in our history, which is enabling significant efficiencies in our back office processes. And finally, we gave a thorough technology update to investors on November 17th, highlighting the increasingly positive impact in new synthetic and biological active ingredients will have on our business over the next decade, and the ways in which we are driving to be the leader in crop protection innovation. We plan to launch seven new active ingredients and four new biologicals this decade, which we expect will contribute a combined $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion in incremental sales by 2030. We recently announced a new collaboration with Novozymes, a world leader in enzyme discovery and production to research, co-develop and commercialize biological enzyme-based crop solutions for growers around the world. This adds to research collaborations and partnerships signed in 2020 with Zymergen and Cyclica, and continues our trend of investing in new and innovative technologies that will enhance our long-term competitiveness. Turning to our Q4 results on slide three. We reported $1.15 billion in fourth quarter revenue, which reflects a 4% decrease on a reported basis and 2% organic growth. Despite those headwinds, we posted double-digit sales growth in Asia, led by India, China, Japan and Australia. And in the EMEA with double-digit growth across a broad set of countries. Adjusted EBITDA was $290 million, a decrease of 9% compared to the prior year period. EBITDA margins were 25.2%, a decrease of 150 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings were $1.42 per diluted share in the quarter, a decrease of 19% versus Q4 2019. This year-over-year decline was primarily driven by the decrease in EBITDA, an increase in tax rate compared to the very low tax rate in Q4 2019 and slightly higher D&A, partially offset by lower interest expense and lower non-controlling interest. Moving now to slide four. Q4 revenue decreased by 4% versus prior year, driven by a 5% FX headwind and a 3% volume decrease. Price increases contributed a positive 4% impact and offset 80% of the FX headwind, the highest in the past few quarters to deliver a positive 2% organic growth. Volume growth in EMEA and Asia was more than offset by weakness in North America and Latin America. Sales in EMEA increased 45% year-over-year and 42% organically. We saw particularly strong demand for Rynaxypyr insect control applications for specialty crops, as well as herbicides for cereals, especially in France, Spain, Russia and Germany. We also had significant growth in the U.K. as customers secured orders in advance of Brexit. In Asia, revenue increased 11% year-over-year, driven by broad volume growth in India, China, Japan and Australia. India saw a strong demand in rice and pulses in the south and in sugarcane in the north in addition to the growth from our recent market access expansion activities. Last earnings call, we highlighted India as a key pillar of growth in Asia and the strength we saw in Q4 exemplifies this potential with India growing over 25% organically in the quarter. China saw a robust demand for diamide insecticides and fungicides on fruit and vegetables. Growth in Australia was driven by demand in herbicides for cereals and oilseeds, while Japan\u2019s strength came from a variety of insecticides. Moving now to Latin America. Sales decreased 9% year-over-year, but grew 4% excluding significant FX headwinds. Pricing actions across the region offset about 50% of the currency headwind in -- at the earnings level in Q4, substantially more than in the prior two quarters. The Brazil season was delayed by at least 30 days due to hot dry weather and this delay meant many numerous crops misapplications that will not return. The drought persisted throughout Q4, resulting in lower than expected decline across many crops and it also impacted Argentina and other countries in the region. For Latin America overall, we estimated the drought reduced sales by about $30 million. In Argentina, we also had about $10 million of products held in bonded warehouses that was not released by customs officials in a timely manner. Although, these factors reduced Q4 growth in Argentina, 2020 was still our best year ever for the country. In North America, sales decreased 34% year-over-year, roughly $40 million of this decline was due to supply chain disruptions, including COVID-related factors associated with logistics and a toll manufacturing partner, impacting our ability to meet demand late in December. An additional $30 million of the decrease was due to reduced volume and some lower value pre-emergent herbicides. Our newer herbicides such as Authority Edge, Authority Supreme and Anthem MAXX continue to add value and grow well. We should also note our biologicals business had a very strong Q4, with sales up in all regions by at least a high-teens percentage, including very strong sales of Quartzo in Brazil and successful launches of Accudo in EMEA and At-Plant and MSDS [ph] in South Korea. Turning now to the fourth quarter EBITDA bridge on slide five. We had a $50 million contribution from higher pricing, which was nearly double what we realized in Q3. We also aggressively managed costs to offset nearly all the $30 million year-over-year headwind we had had anticipated. However, the FX headwinds were more severe than expected and the light volume misses in North America and Latin America were too large to overcome. Moving to slide six for a view of our full year results. We reported $4.64 billion in revenue, which reflects a 1% increase on a reported basis and a 7% organic growth rate. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.25 billion, an increase of 2% compared to 2019 even with nearly $270 million in headwinds from FX. EBITDA margins were 26.9%, an increase of 40 basis points compared to the prior year. 2020 adjusted earnings was $6.19 per diluted share, an increase of 2% versus 2019. This increase was driven by the increase in EBITDA, as well as lower interest expense and lower share count, offset partially by a higher tax rate compared to the very low tax rates in the prior year and higher D&A. Turning to slide seven for some of the drivers behind the full year revenue growth. Overall, volume contributed 4% to revenue growth, while price increase sales by 3%, about $50 million of the 2020 revenue growth came from product launches within the year. In Asia, sales increased 6% year-over-year and 9% organically. Market expansion and share gains in India coupled with a very strong market rebound in Australia were the primary drivers. Our diamides were in high demand throughout the region in 2020, as we continue to grow in specialty crops such as rice and fruits and vegetables. Sales in EMEA grew 4% versus 2019 and 6% organically. Demand was driven by diamides on specialty crops, Battle Delta herbicide on cereals and Spotlight Plus herbicide on potatoes. Latin America posted a 1% year-over-year revenue growth, but high single-digit volume growth and solid price increases led to 17% organic growth. Brazil had robust demand for our products for soybeans and sugarcane, while there was reduced demand acreage for cotton. North America sales decreased 8%, as we had channel destocking in the first half and then a tough Q4 as described earlier. Of note, the Lucento fungicide launch had a strong second year and Elevest insect control had a good launch year. Moving to slide eight where you can see our full year EBITDA bridge. Volume contributed 9% to the growth, while a combination of stringent cost controls and price increases offset 70% of the impact of foreign currencies. Turning now to slide nine and a look at the overall market conditions for 2021. We expect the global crop protection market will be up low-single digits on a U.S. dollar basis. Commodity prices for many of the major crops are higher and stock-to-use ratios have improved compared to this time last year. All regions are seeing some benefit from better crop commodity prices, while the impacts from COVID on crop demand appear to be lessening. Growth in Asia was expected to be in the low to mid-single digits driven by India, Australia and ASEAN. Favorable weather should contribute in many countries. The weather-related recovery in Australia is expected to continue. The other three regions are each projected to grow in the low-single digits. Growth in the Latin America market will be strengthened by price recovery from FX headwinds from 2020 in Brazil, continued strength in the soybean market and increase of fruit and vegetable exports from Mexico and more normal weather patterns that are forecasted across the region. In the EMEA market, we are seeing a solid market for cereals and specialty crops, which should be helped by improved weather in several parts of the region. The market in North America is projected to have a firm foundation from crop commodity prices, but we are seeing a trend of distributors and retailers looking to strategically reduce their own inventory levels. The specialty crop market is stable, but a more significant change in demand will depend on the pace of the economic recovery. Taking all the above into consideration, we view 2021 as a more positive ag macro environment than we did this time last year. Having said that, we are all too well aware of the potential disruptions that COVID and weather could cause in any one quarter. Turning to slide 10 and the review of FMC\u2019s full year 2021 and Q1 earnings outlook. FMC full year 2020 earnings are now expected to be in the range of $6.65 per diluted share to $7.35 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 13% at the midpoint. Consistent with past practice, we do not factor in any benefit from planned share repurchases in our EPS estimates. 2021 revenue is forecasted to be in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, an increase of 8% percent at the midpoint versus 2020 and 9% organic growth. We believe the strength of our portfolio will allow us to deliver this organic growth, continuing the multiyear trend of above market performance. EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $1.32 billion to $1.42 billion which represents a 10% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Guidance for Q1 implies year-over-year sales contraction of 7% at the midpoint on a reported basis and 5% organically. We are forecasting an EBITDA decline of 15% at the midpoint versus Q1 2020 and EPS is forecast to be down 18% year-over-year. Turning to slide 11 and full year EBITDA and revenue drivers. Revenue is expected to benefit from 7% volume growth, with the largest growth in Asia and a 2% contribution from higher prices. FX is forecasted to be a 1% top line headwind. We are expecting growth -- broad growth across all regions. Asia has the best overall fundamentals, but we are also seeing the benefit of better weather in Europe, strong soybean outlook for both Latin America and North America, and a cotton recovery in Brazil next fall. Because of these factors, we are expecting a very strong second half of 2020 -- 2021 relative to the first half. New products such as Overwatch herbicide in Australia based on our Isoflex active and Xyway fungicide in the U.S. are expected to make meaningful contributions. And we are also launching Fluindapyr fungicide in the U.S. for non-crop applications. We are forecasting a strong year for each of our product areas. In addition to continuing strength of Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect controls, insecticide growth is also expected to come from products such as Talisman, Hero and Avatar. Herbicides should see growth in several of our top brands including Authority, Gamit, Riyata [ph] and Spotlight Plus in addition to the Overwatch launch. And growth in fungicides is forecasted to be driven primarily by the Xyway launch in the U.S. Our EBITDA guidance reflects strong volume and pricing benefits, offset partially by increases in R&D spending, as well as the reversal of some of the temporary cost savings from 2020. We are forecasting a $14 million increase in R&D to bring us to a level of funding that keeps all projects on a critical path to commercialization. Additionally, we are making growth investments in our pharma intelligence and other precision ag initiatives, new product launches like Overwatch, as well as FMC Ventures. We are also expecting some supply chain cost increases including logistics and pockets of raw materials. These headwinds will be partially offset by the realization of the final $15 million of SAP synergies, which will give us accumulative SAP synergies of approximately $65 million. Moving to slide 12 where you see the Q1 drivers. On the revenue line, volume is expected to drive a 6% decline, while a 1% contribution from higher prices largely offsets the FX headwind. We expect the benefit of approximately $25 million in sales from Q4, supply and logistics delays to be captured in Q1. This is about half of the Q4 impact. In the U.S., this mistiming limits what we can recoup and in Argentina ongoing customs delays in releasing products could cause us to misapplication windows. There are several headwinds in Q1 revenue that more than offset the flow through from Q4. First, we are facing a particularly difficult comparison in Latin America where sales increased 26% year-over-year and 38% organically in Q1 2020. Brazil\u2019s cotton business was very strong for us a year ago. This will not be repeated this season as cotton acreage is down 15%. In EMEA, we are facing continued headwinds from discontinued registrations and the $15 million in Q4 sales related to Brexit that would normally have been sold in the first quarter. Regarding EBITDA drivers, reduced volume is the biggest factor, while pricing is forecast to offset the FX headwind. Costs are expected to be higher by $12 million, driven primarily by the increased R&D investments we mentioned earlier. With that, I will now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks, Mark. Let me start this morning with a few highlights from the income statement. FX was a 5% headwind to revenue in the quarter, as expected, with the impact of higher than anticipated local currency denominated sales in Brazil offset in part by a modest tailwind in the Eurozone. For full year 2020, FX was a 6% headwind to revenue. The Brazilian real represented the vast majority of the FX headwinds in 2020, followed by the Indian rupee, Pakistani rupee and a broad number of non-euro currencies in EMEA. Pricing actions offset slightly half of the currency headwinds in the year. Looking ahead to 2021, we expect a more stable FX environment, with only a slight headwind of revenues. We will continue to take pricing actions in Brazil to recover the FX impacts from 2020. But overall pricing will be somewhat dampened by price volume choices being made in our Asia business to drive higher growth. Interest expense for the fourth quarter was $34.2 million, down $8.7 million from the prior year period, benefiting from lower debt balances and lower LIBOR rates. Interest expense for full year 2020 was down $7.3 million from the prior year, with the benefit of lower interest rates, partially offset by changes in debt outstanding. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for 2020 was 13.7%, well within our expectations and up from the very low 2019 rate, due to shifts in the geographic mix of taxable earnings and interrelated impacts on the U.S. minimum tax from foreign earnings. The tax rate in the fourth quarter was 14.4% to true up with the full year actual rate. Tax was a headwind to earnings in the quarter due to the very low tax rate in the prior year period. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 12.5% to 14.5% in 2021 similar to 2020. Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity. Gross debt at year end was $3.3 billion essentially flat with the prior quarter, with nearly $600 million of cash on hand. We chose to hold cash on the balance sheet in advance of the seasonal working capital build we see in the first quarter to avoid having to take on as much commercial paper in the beginning of the New Year. As such, gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 2.6 times at the end of the year, while net debt-to-EBITDA was 2.3 times. We are comfortable. We are in the right leverage range given the excess cash at year end. We do not expect to carry this level of cash on a steady state basis going forward. So you should expect cash balances to decline through the coming year. Moving to slide 13 and a look at 2020 cash flow and the outlook for 2021. Free cash flow for 2020 was $544 million with free cash flow conversion from adjusted earnings of 67%, both metrics up 80% from the prior year period. Adjusted cash from operations increased by about $170 million in 2020, with growth in working capital more than offset by lower non-working capital factors and increased EBITDA. Capital additions were down $60 million due to project delays and deferrals related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Legacy and transformation spending was down $14 million with relatively stable legacy spending and transformation spending lower as we completed our SAP implementation. We anticipate full year 2021 free cash flow to be in the range of $530 million to $620 million, an increase of 6% at the midpoint, with free cash flow conversion of 63% at the midpoint. Growth in adjusted cash from operations, and reduced legacy and transformation spending are expected to be partially offset by a significant year-over-year increase in capital additions. This increase in capital additions comes as we catch up on projects that were delayed or deferred in 2020 due to the pandemic. Turning to slide 14. We are pleased with our strong free cash flow growth and improvement in free cash conversion. There are number of moving parts in our 2020 cash flow results and 2020 outlook that merit some further discussion and we will help better explain this trajectory. 2020 free cash flow benefited from a planned real estate assets sale that will not repeat, as well as the unforecasted delay of a lump sum environmental liability payment we expected to be paid in December. Excluding these impacts, 2023 cash flow would have been about $500 million and cash conversion about 62%. Similarly, 2021 free cash flow is negatively impacted by the timing shift of the environmental liability payment. Adjusting for this timing shift, 2021 free cash flow would be about $600 million and cash conversion of 65%. So, on a more comparable basis, free cash conversion steps up from 38% in 2019 to 62% in 2020 and 65% in 2021, getting closer to our 70% to 80% target range for 2023. I note that this view of cash flow, we have not made any adjustments for the abnormally low capital additions in 2020 or the catch-up to a more normal level in 2021. But this shift is in large part the reason why cash conversion steps up more slowly in 2021, as the increase in capital additions largely offset the step down and transformation cash spending from the completion of the SAP program. You should expect the capital additions continue in a similar range to 2021 for the next several years to support our organic growth including new capacity to support new active ingredient introductions. Equally as important as growing our free cash flow is the discipline with which we deploy it. As you can see on slide 15, we continue our balanced approach to cash deployment. We are fully funding our organic growth and making modest inorganic investments to enhance our growth. We are then returning the excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, while keeping debt at our targeted leverage levels. In 2020, we deployed nearly $350 million of cash flow, while maintaining excess liquidity throughout the pandemic. We deployed $65 million to acquire the remaining rights to the fungicide Fluindapyr. We paid nearly $230 million in dividend and we repurchased $50 million in FMC shares in the fourth quarter. In 2021, we expect to accelerate cash deployment. We are planning to repurchase between $400 million and $500 million worth of FMC shares in the year, with purchases in every quarter of the year that more heavily weighted to the second half. We expect to pay dividends approaching $250 million and we will continue to look for attractive opportunities to make additional modest inorganic investments to complement our organic growth and expand our technological capabilities. I\u2019d like to close with a final update on our SAP S/4HANA ERP system implementation. We had a successful last Go Live in November and are now operating on a single thoroughly modern system across the entire company thoroughly modern system across the entire company for the first time in our history. The Go Live went better than expected and we have smoothly transitioned to operating the company and closing the books in the new system. Our new SAP system has enabled significant efficiencies in our back office processes. We captured over $50 million in synergies in 2020 having moved aggressively to accelerate $30 billion in planned savings from 2021 to 2020. We now expect to deliver $15 million in SAP-enabled synergies in 2021, the benefit of which is reflected in our full year guidance for a total of $65 million in synergies from implementing the new system. There will certainly be additional efficiency gains in 2022 and beyond, as we further leverage this generational investment in our business process infrastructure. But we will drive them as part of our business as usual efforts to gain leverage on back office costs as we continue to grow the company. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Andrew. We had a number of issues in late Q4 that we are having to address. We do not expect all of them to be resolved in Q1. We do, however, see these issues as transitory and are focused on ensuring we can mitigate supply chain risks and continue to expand our market growth opportunities. As you can see from our robust 2021 guidance, we are confident that 2021 will be another year of strong revenue and earnings growth for FMC. We continue to renew our portfolio, launching two new important products in Q1. We continue to invest in our R&D pipeline and we remain fully committed to bringing new sustainable technologies to our customers. Our overall agenda on sustainability continues to advance with the recent appointment of our first Chief Sustainability Officer and through new partnerships like the one recently announced with Novozymes. We plan to return about $700 million to shareholders this year through dividends and buybacks. And finally with our 2021 growth rates above the long range plan, we remain firmly on track to deliver our five-year plan commitments. Before I close, I\u2019d like to highlight the press release issued yesterday regarding Pierre Brondeau\u2019s retirement as Executive Chairman effective April 27. I very much appreciate his leadership and look forward to his continued involvement as Non-Executive Chairman. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Chris Parkinson : Hey. Thank you. To start, many of us have interpreted as a fairly cautious 1Q guide. You are maintaining your organic revenue growth despite some challenges. You won\u2019t provide -- you won\u2019t prided yourself on geographic balance and crop diversity. So, can you sit on the two to three highlights with growth this year? It seems like you are construct -- basically constructed on H1 and still cautious optimistic on certain regions in emerging Europe. So, any color to help us bridge and help investors sense weaker than expected 1Q versus what should be characterized as still a fairly strong year? Thank you. Mark Douglas : Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Listen, it\u2019s fairly obvious when you look at the release that what we have. We have a weak Q1 yet a very strong full year. And certainly from our perspective, when we look at what is going on in Q1, it does bear some relationships to what is happening in the second half of the year. And I will give you some color on that. First of all, when we talk about some headwinds in the quarter, you look at what is happening in Europe. We have headwinds from loss of registrations. It happens all the time. It just so happens that about 50% of the total revenue that is lost in the whole year occurs in Q1 in Europe and that\u2019s just purely down to the types of products that are sold in Q1 and the timing. So that\u2019s one element that that\u2019s somewhat unique. I think the second one is really all around Latin America. We highlighted in the script that we had a very strong cotton business last year and it really was strong and this year it is lower. The acreage is down. We do have some lingering effects from the drought and missed opportunities. But that all rolls together very importantly and it\u2019s something we -- that we didn\u2019t highlight in the script but something that operationally we are managing very carefully. We are watching and managing inventories in Brazil very carefully. There is no way you go through a fourth quarter like we did with 30 days delay. I mean, put that in perspective. Soybeans take 110 days to grow. We had a 30-day delay. Now that means that some sprays get missed. Those products were already in the marketplace. They didn\u2019t get used. We have told you many times that we manage inventories very carefully. We see that our inventories are elevated. They are nowhere near as bad as they were five years ago. But the industry is elevated as well. We are making a decision in Q1 to deliberately sell out of inventory and make no mistake we are selling nicely in Q1. EDI, our business on the ground is actually up year-on-year, but we are not replenishing those inventories. Why are we making that decision now? Because it makes the second half of the year and our position in the marketplace much stronger. We still want to recover price. We didn\u2019t fully recover all the price in 2020. This reduction of inventory puts us in a much better position to get price increases in Q3 and Q4. Allied to the fact that we already see today that the industry is moving on price. There are many more companies signaling to the marketplace with lessons that are public that they are moving on price. We are doing the same. So it\u2019s very deliberate. We could make a decision. We could sell and have a more normal Q1 in Latin America and particularly in Brazil in Q1 or we can reduce the sales today, sell out of inventory and have a much stronger season \u201821, \u201822. I think there are some other facets as well to the second half that we should highlight. Our growth in Asia is weighted towards the second half of the year. You have already talked -- we have already talked about India a couple of times over the last calls. India is very strong in Q3 and Q4. We expect that to continue. We have talked about investing in India to get us better market access in underrepresented regions of India. That continues and will bear fruit as we go through this year. A lot of different crops involve there, rices, pulse, sugarcane, fruit and vegetables. More importantly, as our market access grows, we are growing our herbicide portfolio as well, introducing new mixtures especially sugarcane, corn and soybeans. So India is expected to continue that very strong growth path in the second half of the year. Allied to the fact that, in the ASEAN region, we are seeing much better conditions in Vietnam and Thailand as we drive our rice business and our fruit/vegetables business. We are seeing Indonesia with much better weather conditions and again very similar to India, growing our market access in Indonesia to geographies where we are not present today, once again, insecticide sales and herbicide sales on a variety of crops. And then in China, we see continued momentum as we develop our Rynaxypyr and diamides business in China. And then, lastly, not only do we expect Brazil to be stronger in the second half given the moves we are making. Other parts of the region are doing very well for us. We continue to expect Argentina will grow. Our crop exposure is getting better. The portfolios we are introducing are better products there. In North America, frankly, with what happened in Q4, we should have a much easier comp in terms of our volumes. So we see that as a very key driver in Q4. And then, in Europe, we expect a strong Q3 on cereal herbicides. We are developing a nice position on cereal herbicides. You have heard me talk about Battle Delta. That\u2019s a product that\u2019s growing well. We had a very weak Q3 last year due to weather on cereals. So this year we expect much better conditions. You put all that together, you can see why we are much bullish for the whole year, but you can see why we have a very different profile, Q1 through Q3 and Q4. I know that\u2019s a very long answer to a very simple question, but I think it\u2019s worth getting it out there, because I am not surprised you asked that question first, Chris, but the reality is, we are setting ourselves up for a very strong second half of the year. Chris Parkinson : No. That\u2019s very fair. As always thank you for color, Mark. Operator : Thank you. And the next question will be from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Mark Douglas : Good morning. Adam Samuelson : Maybe following up on some of the color, Mark, you just gave in response to Chris, which is incredibly helpful. Just thinking about kind of how the fourth quarter played out. There was, I mean, you came short of kind of where the initial guide had been by about $55 million on EBITDA and I just want to clarify that the expectation is, given the timing you don\u2019t necessarily get most of that back in 2021? And again -- and then maybe additional kind of, Mark, color that there was some dilution to distributors reducing inventory in North America and maybe just elaborate on that point a little bit would be helpful? Thank you. Mark Douglas : Yeah. Thanks, Adam. Yeah. Listen, the first piece, I think, was saying, we are getting out of the materials that we had supply chain disruptions through. We are getting about half of that back in Q1. The reality is, listen, it\u2019s a competitive world. Customers want to place orders. You deliver material. If you missed the delivery, some customers will wait, some won\u2019t. And the reality is we did lose some sales. We consider that transitory. We don\u2019t expect that to happen in Q4 next year. The team -- the commercial team will be working hard to recoup that position and we are very confident that the products that we have to deliver then will deliver. I think the comments on distributors and retailers in the U.S. We have watched this evolve over the last year or so. And as growers have faced lower income supply chains of being squeezed all, and I think, frankly, I think, many of us at our point in the value chain and distribution and retail are paying much closer attention to working capital. So the comments we are making are more broad based and it\u2019s something we are aware of. We will work with our customers under these circumstances. It\u2019s what we do, but we are highlighting it out there because we believe it\u2019s a facet for the industry that needs to be highlighted, because everybody\u2019s talking about strong commodity prices and how everything\u2019s going to grow rapidly in the U.S. That may well be true in certain segments. But let\u2019s not forget there is a value chain here that needs to make money and the balance sheets are important to many of our customers and that will get managed appropriately. So that\u2019s why we made that comment, because we do see that trend of an increased focus on working capital and balance sheets. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. If I could just sneak in a quick follow up. As we think about pricing over the course of the year, I guess, on one hand there\u2019s some carryover pricing from the actions in Brazil and South America that you took in the second half. But it seems like the pricing side of things is going to be more back half weighted as well, I that perfect? Mark Douglas : Yeah. I mean you think about we are entering once we hit Q3 we enter a whole new season in Latin America. That\u2019s clearly where we are looking to recover most of the lag that we had in 2020. It\u2019s normal. It happens from year-to-year. But we are very confident that we will get it. We do have pricing in the first half of the year. We have about a third of the total for the full year. It\u2019s in the first half to the second half. But really it follows the seasons and Latin America is the big season. I like to some pricing in Europe as well, but mainly Latin America. Adam Samuelson : All right. That\u2019s really helpful. I will pass it on. Thank you. Mark Douglas : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Stephen Byrne with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Stephen Byrne : Yes. Good morning. So, Mark, you are 2021 outlook is at a low-single digits increase in most regions, your own organic revenue growth is near double-digit, high single-digit. I am curious to hear your view or on directionally how do you think about those estimates changed in the last six months. If we roll back six months, near month futures for corn, soybeans, wheat and cotton were all significantly lower. Corn may not be a big crop for you, but it\u2019s nearly doubled in that much time. How would you say that is affecting the use of crop comps in 2021? Is this potentially increased application rates that would be driving that low single-digit market growth or is this potentially more tolerance to higher pricing that\u2019s driving that, just curious to hear your views on the impact crop commodity prices? Mark Douglas : Yeah. Thanks, Steve. I think our view over the last year has become more optimistic as we have gone along. We have been forecasting for the last few years sort of a flattish type market, and frankly, we have been pretty close to where the market has really finished up. You can tell by our organic growth rates and on revenue growth rates that we are above the top end of our five-year plan sort of numbers. So we do consider it a good year. Clearly, when you when you have strong commodity prices like we see, growers are going to spend money to protect the crops. They want the highest yields therefore they get the most value. So I think it\u2019s going to be a combination of a couple of things. Price recovery in Latin America, as I said, is going to be important. The good news is Brazilian growers, Argentinean growers, the Mexican fruit and veg growers, they are all in much better shape than they were 12 months or 18 months ago. So they are feeling confident. We do expect to see acreage increase in Latin America on top of the good prices, so soy should be increased. We would expect cotton to bounce back quite considerably next year. So I think it\u2019s going to be a more of a combination impact of price in Latin America and then really maximizing our customer\u2019s ability to get the highest yields by using the better products. And frankly that\u2019s why our diamides -- one of the reasons our diamides has been doing so well around the world is the fact that they do enhance yield and allow the growers to get that productivity. So bottomline for me, Steve, I think, we are more confident than we were 12 months ago. These growth rates are higher than we would have had 12 months ago for 2021 and we are confident that our grower\u2019s customers are going to be looking for the best solutions to improve yield. Stephen Byrne : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steve Haynes : Hi. This is Steve Haynes on for Vincent. I just want to ask the question on some of the COVID-related costs that are coming back. Can you quantify how much is coming back and maybe what the risk might be in either direction to that number? Mark Douglas : Yeah. When we look at where we are today and we think about that $19 million of cost that we have year-over-year, we think roughly about $25 million to $30 million is really what we would call COGS increases. I was very deliberate in my comments that we do see disruptions and logistics costs that are higher than they have been at any time. You can go and look at any of the data out there and look at shipping rates. Shanghai to Rotterdam a year ago was about $1,700 a container. It\u2019s now $9,300 a container. That is a real increase that we simply don\u2019t control. We can try and mitigate it as much as possible. But there are real logistics costs out there that are starting to flow through many industries and this is not peculiar to our industry or even FMC. We hear about it and see about it in many of the industries. I think the other piece is, we are starting to see some raw material and active ingredient increases coming out of China. It would appear that parts of China and particularly the north have had supply constraints due to pockets of COVID and those are starting to ripple through. So we have been very careful on raw material costs, but we do believe we will see higher raw material costs not across the Board, but in pockets through 2021. So that\u2019s how we kind of get to that $25 million to $30 million increase. It\u2019s not broad based. It is more pockets of activity. But I do think you are going to hear more about it as more people get into the year and talk about their cost structures. Operator : And our next question will come from Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly : Mark, I was hoping you could give us an update on your diamide licensing and partnership projects. You have a whole lot of those. And also on what your capacity expansion plans and maybe tell us how your diamide portfolio performed in 2020? Mark Douglas : Yeah. Sure, Mark. So, on the first one with the diamide third-party relationships, they are continuing to evolve. I think the last time I gave you an update we said we had about 40 to 41 agreements around the world. That number is up to about 50 today, so commercial teams are continuing to develop those local relationships, as well as some of the global relationships that we have. Diamide has grown very strongly as you and everybody else knows. Last year, I think, we finished just north of $1.8 billion in revenue in size, up from an initial $1.1 billion when we acquired the business. We -- I think the business grew in the mid-to-high single digits last year, closer to the high-single digits. On an organic basis, it would be even higher than that. We just don\u2019t track it at the product level. So very successful. The registration side of this, I have talked about in the past and it continues to evolve. When I think about 2020 between Cyazypyr and Rynaxypyr, we had over 70 brand new registrations in the year and that is essentially driving you into new geographies. I think there\u2019s something like 21 brand new crops added with those registrations. So those are crops that we have never been on before. So you can see why we keep that registration portfolio very close to half, because that\u2019s one of the key drivers, not only do we have to keep the market access going, but we also have to get those brand new registrations. So from our perspective, we track it very closely. I could give you -- I will throw you some numbers out that that you may find interesting. In 2018, we had 106 Cyazypyr registrations around the world. We are now at 173 and then when you look at Rynaxypyr, we had 170 in 2018. We are not 250. So people often ask why does that matter? It gets you new access. It gives the commercial groups new markets to go sell against older chemistries that are out there. So I expect that growth rate to continue as we have said for many years as we go forward. At some point this year, probably, in the August call or, yeah, probably, the August call we will give more details around the third-party relationships, where are they going, what do they encompass. I think we always ask to our investor community. We talked about it in sort of a high level term. I think it\u2019s time now that we have over 50 of these in place that we have to start giving some more granularity here. Mark Connelly : Super helpful. Thank you. Operator : And the next question will be from Laurent Favre with Exane BNPP. Please go ahead. Laurent Favre : Thank you. Good morning, all. Mark, I have got a question on the phase outs. I think, historically, you have talked about 1% to 2% impact for a full year. I was wondering if 2021 is expected to be much bigger than that. And also can you talk a little bit about, I guess, the product categories, is it all in Europe for instance and any color on that would be helpful? Mark Douglas : Yeah. Thanks, Laurent. We are forecasting about 2% headwind due to registration losses. Interestingly enough this year, last year was heavily focused on Asia and parts of Latin America. This year it\u2019s roughly split 50/50 between Europe and Latin America. It\u2019s a combination of some older insecticides and some older fungicides/herbicides. Nothing that\u2019s really big, not like when -- in 2019 when we removed carbofuran, which was the bulk of what we saw the impact last year. This is more a myriad of smaller products. Some is deliberate on our side, cleanup of the portfolio, reducing that portfolio impact. But frankly there\u2019s no major one. It\u2019s -- I would probably say, six or seven different compounds spread across that 2%. I think that\u2019s a fair rate. We have talked about roughly on average about a 1.5% drag due to registration or deliberate actions by ourselves. The last couple of years are pretty close to that 2% range. We don\u2019t have a good view yet of 2022. Our regulatory team will be telling us what that looks like. But I think for your modeling, you should plug in about 1.5% to 2% sort of drag going forward on a longer term basis. Laurent Favre : Okay. So it\u2019s almost 4% for Q1 then? I guess that fit you all [ph]\u2026 Mark Douglas : Okay. Yeah. Laurent Favre : \u2026 or anything else? Mark Douglas : Yeah. It\u2019s much higher in Q1, because about 50% of the European impacts, which is roughly half of the 2% is in Q1. So it\u2019s a bit of a higher lumpiness in Q1 than it would be the rest of the year, Laurent. Laurent Favre : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joel Jackson : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Mark Douglas : Good morning. Joel Jackson : Just a couple of questions. So, Mark, you talked about the missed opportunity -- I think you talk what the missed opportunity to cotton in Brazil. Can you elaborate on that? Is that not just acreage shift, did you miss some business or some share on cotton in Brazil? And then also are you seeing more generics pressure or generic pressure, I guess, in North America, how is that playing into your forecast? Mark Douglas : Yeah. You are right on cotton, Joel. Cotton is not necessarily missed opportunity. It is lower acreage. The missed opportunity I was referring to was more on the soy complex and some other crops because of the drought. Cotton is purely around just, you know, 15% acreage reduction is an enormous reduction in cotton in Brazil. So, hopefully, that clarifies that for you. On generics, yes, I have to say, I think, at the low end of our pre-emergent business, we are seeing more generic pressure and our North American team makes decisions on an annual basis that they want to compete in that low end or are they continuing to focus their marketing efforts on the high end. Obviously, this year, we decided we were not going to go take volume at low margin. It didn\u2019t suit what we wanted the business to look like. It wouldn\u2019t have helped our inventories. That\u2019s for sure. So we decided to focus on the high end, Authority Supreme, Authority Maxx. And actual fact, it really suits where the market is going, because as weed resistance builds, it is the tougher to control weeds that the growers are willing to pay the high premiums for to allow you to get rid of those weeds. The older formulations, the more, how shall I say it, simpler less sophisticated more generic formulations are not actually performing in those fields. So, for us, it\u2019s quite a natural lifecycle progression to move away from those generic products. Elsewhere in the portfolio, I would say, the generic pressure is probably as normal as it\u2019s always been. Pre-emergent, we highlighted it because we felt it was a significant event in the quarter and it needed to be talked about. The positive to take from that is our formulation expertise moves us forward with new products that allow us to continue to take market share at the high end. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Michael Sison : Hey, guys. Good morning. Mark Douglas : Good morning. Michael Sison : Mark, you gave a -- you do a nice job giving us the adjusted EBITDA bridge for 2021. It looks like you will need about $180 million 2Q to 4Q. So when you think about that $180 million, how much of that is seemingly within your control? You have got some new products coming out. Maybe a good portion of that is the diamides? And then where do you think -- how much is at risk from sort of pest pressures and weather and stuff like that? Mark Douglas : Yeah. Mike, listen, I mean, when we forecast forward, we tend to forecast what we call normal conditions, so that would be normal weather, normal pest pressures. I mean, obviously, the further out you forecast the more variance there could possibly be. But today I would say, there is obviously two pieces, volume and price. I would say right now, we are feeling very good about the price piece given what we are seeing in Latin America and the marketplace. From a volume perspective, also very confident given the fact that a lot of the growers are in much better position than they were 12 months ago and you shouldn\u2019t underestimate the psychology of farmers. That is a very important aspect to how they think forward, how they will prepare for a strong season and what that means for us to feed that value chain as we get into the season. So obviously, listen, both price and volume, we don\u2019t ultimately control. They are part of the marketplace. But I feel very confident that given where the business is positioning itself, the new product growth, the continued growth of diamides, our ability to move price, which we have shown as we went through last year we gathered each quarter, it was higher than the last and we eventually ended up in not a bad place at all especially in Latin America. So just think of it in terms of I would say normal risk, yes, weather will play a part as well a pest pressure, but we are forecasting it to be normal and pretty confident of that forecast. Operator : And thank you. The next question will be from Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Michael Piken : Hi. Good morning. I just had a couple of questions in terms of just thinking broadly about kind of the trajectory of your EBITDA margins over the next several years. How much of the growth do you see coming from price mix improvements versus kind of the information of SAP and if in fact the cost increases from China or the costs of some of the raw materials increase. How confident are you in your ability to kind of hold or preserve margins in that type of environment for 2021? Thanks. Mark Douglas : Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Listen, at the end of the day, when you think of our long range plan 5% to 7% topline, 7% to 9% bottomline, we actually do that on a non-adjusted FX basis, i.e., it\u2019s essentially a volume plan and if FX goes against us, we will move price and that will adjust. I think the confidence you should have in 2021 relays itself, here we are three years into our plan and we are right in the ranges where we should be. Despite the fact that in 2019, we had something like $115 million of headwind on cost and in 2021 we had about $270 million, $280 million headway on FX, yet here we are still in the middle of our plan range. So, it\u2019s very -- it should give you a lot of confidence that we know how to manage these. Yes, you can have dislocations in a quarter obviously. But if you think about \u201819, \u201820, \u201821, that\u2019s a very strong track record of delivery with almost pretty close to, if not more than $400 million of headwind over this three-year period. Andrew, do you want to talk about costs. Andrew Sandifer : Sure. Look, Mike, I think, there\u2019s a -- as we have talked about for quite some time, it\u2019s a combination of both the faster growth of higher value products, higher margin products, as well as SG&A leverage, both from SAP synergies and just also from other leverage and growing the business. And on that you have seen that trajectory. We were at a 25.9% EBITDA margin in 2018. Grew that -- expanded that by 60 basis points in 2019 expanded another 40 basis points in 2020 in the face of the cost and FX headwinds Mark described. And at the midpoint of our guidance this year we are expecting to expand margins another 50 basis points. So the next couple of years it is still that balanced story between SG&A leverage and mix improvement that will allow us to keep driving up that trajectory. Year three of the five-year plan we are 150 basis points of margin expansion against the goal of $250 million to $300 million. So particularly in light of the headwinds we faced we feel like we are exactly where we need to be on that trajectory and we feel very confident about continuing on it. Operator : Thank you. And the final question will come from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Kevin McCarthy : Good morning, everyone. Mark, I was wondering if you might elaborate on two items that you called out. First, the Brexit related boost to sales in EMEA in the fourth quarter? And then second, the tolling issue that you cited in North America, can you talk a little bit about the nature of that tolling relationship? What the magnitude of the hit was and the extent to which it may or may not be extending into the first quarter, please? Mark Douglas : Yeah. Sure, Kevin. So, yeah, Brexit, we have a strong business in the U.K. We sort of think about it in terms of a roughly a $15 million to $20 million a swing between Q4 and Q1 on a revenue basis. I have to say what when we put the plans in place with our customers, I was skeptical that it would be needed. But given what we have seen in the U.K. and Europe with regards to freight logistics, I am very pleased we actually did that. I know it makes Q1 look a little worse but the reality is I am glad we did it. On the second piece with the toll manufacturing relationship, it is a toll manufacturer that we have used for many years. They were in a particular hotspot related to COVID and simply could not get staff and could not make the products that we needed in the timeframe that we needed it. We are making some adjustments to our network to obviously help mitigate some of that. We are not seeing that reoccurring in Q1. Frankly, most of that business occurs in Q4 from a tolling perspective anyway, so you wouldn\u2019t really expect it to see. I think what it highlights for us is, we do a very good job of mitigating raw material intermediate movements around the world where we might have issues. Of course, we do employ like many other companies many toll manufacturers and we really do have to -- we have to pay attention to every single one all the time. This one we did not have the right communication flow and obviously we paid a price for that. You can rest assure that we have learned the lesson there and it will not be happening again either there or anywhere else. And then -- and the second piece of that was, the logistics element, there was a lot of logistics issues in Q4 that we had to overcome. Some of it was related to lack of drivers in parts of the world, we have seen that in the U.S. and some of it was related to more warehousing. But the reality is the toll manufacturers was the big piece. Michael Wherley : That is all the time that we have for the call today. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the FMC Corporation conference call. We thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Wherley, Director of Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Please go ahead. Michael Wherley : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation\u2019s first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Mark Douglas, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mark will review our first quarter results and provide our outlook for 2021 and the second quarter. Andrew will provide an overview of select financial items. Following their prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our earnings release and today\u2019s slide presentation are available on our website and the prepared remarks from today\u2019s discussion will be made available after the call. Let me remind you that today\u2019s presentation and discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including but not limited to those factors identified in our earnings release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today\u2019s understanding. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today\u2019s discussion and the supporting materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations, free cash flow, and organic revenue growth. All of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that as used in today\u2019s discussion, earnings means adjusted earnings and EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. A reconciliation and definition of these terms, as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today\u2019s conference call are provided on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results were in-line with our guidance and expectations. Revenue and earnings were down, as forecasted, though earnings were modestly above the midpoint of our guidance. We continue to expect a good second quarter and a strong full year. We had two important product launches in the quarter; Overwatch herbicide based on our Isoflex active in Australia and Xyway fungicide in the U.S. Isoflex is one of 11 new active ingredients we plan to launch this decade. Both launches have exceeded our expectations and have delivered approximately $50 million of Q1 sales. In March, we announced an important agreement with UPL to toll manufacture Rynaxypyr insect control in India and to distribute products based on the active ingredient in select markets. In the future, FMC will supply Rynaxypyr active to UPL for use in product formulations developed and marketed by UPL around the world. This agreement is the next step in growing our important diamide franchise and accelerating FMC\u2019s long-term plans to expand the franchise in diverse geographies and crops with differentiated formulations. It also reaffirms the strength of our patent portfolio that protects our diamide franchise, far beyond just the composition of matter patents. We returned over $135 million to shareholders in the quarter through our recently increased dividend and share repurchases. Our guidance for Q2 indicates an expected return to mid-single-digit growth on the topline, with slightly lower earnings growth because of higher costs compared to Q2 2020. These higher costs are principally related to increases in raw materials and logistics. Additionally, we will be spending more on SG&A and R&D compared to the abnormally low spend in Q2 2020. I\u2019d like to take a moment to provide a COVID-19 update on our business. All our manufacturing facilities and distribution warehouses remain operational and properly staffed. Our research laboratories and greenhouses also have continued to operate throughout the pandemic. While many of FMC\u2019s other employees continue to work from home, plans are in place to resume in-office operations where permitted by local authorities. Finally, we are all aware of the challenges India is facing with significant increases of COVID cases across that country. Last week, FMC announced it will donate seven pressure swing adsorption oxygen plants to hospitals across five states in India to help address the rapidly increasing demand for medical oxygen. This program focuses on rural areas where we are providing further community support. Turning to our Q1 results on slide three, we reported $1.2 billion in first quarter revenue, which reflects a 4% decrease on a reported basis and a 5% decrease organically. As planned, we saw slower sales in Brazil as we drew down channel inventory levels in the country, as well as the shortfall in EMEA due to Brexit-related sales that occurred in Q4 2020. In North America, we saw very good demand based on strong fundamentals in row crops and commodity prices, offset by a shift of diamide third-party partner sales to Latin America. In Asia, double-digit sales growth in Australia, Japan, and our ASEAN sub-region drove revenue performance in that region. Adjusted EBITDA was $307 million, a decrease of 14% compared to the prior-year period and $2 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. EBITDA margins were 25.7%, a decrease of 290 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings were $1.53 per diluted share in the quarter, a decrease of 17% versus Q1 2020, but also $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance range. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by the decrease in EBITDA, partially offset by lower interest expense. Moving now to slide 4, Q1 revenue decreased by 4% versus prior year, driven by a 4% volume decrease and a 1% pricing decline. Foreign currencies were a modest tailwind in the quarter on the topline. Sales in Asia increased 18% year-over-year and 13% organically, driven by double-digit growth in Australia, Japan, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. We had strong Overwatch herbicide sales for cereals, and sales of our diamides were robust for fruit and vegetable and rice applications. Insecticides also performed well in Indonesia, helped by our recent expanded market access in that country. Improved weather helped sales across the ASEAN sub-region. EMEA sales were down 4% year-over-year and 8% organically. We had strong sales of diamides and other insecticides and fungicides, but these were more than offset by headwinds from the Brexit-related U.K. sales in Q4 that we described a quarter ago as well as discontinued registrations. In North America, sales decreased 8% year-over-year. Our herbicides business grew double-digits, partially due to the timing of some sales that shifted from Q4 to Q1, as well as the continued strength of Authority Edge and Authority Supreme herbicides. We also had a strong launch in the U.S. of Xyway fungicide for corn and Vantacor insect control for specialty crops. These were offset primarily by a shift of diamide third-party partner sales from North America to Latin America, as one of our key partners adjusted the way it purchases from FMC globally. This was simply a move of purchasing location and not a change in demand. Excluding this shift, our North America sales were up low-double digits. Moving now to Latin America, sales decreased 22% year-over-year and 13% organically. As a reminder, we were facing a particularly difficult comparison in Latin America, where sales increased 26% year-over-year and 38% organically in Q1 2020. Brazil\u2019s cotton business was very strong for us a year ago, which did not repeat this season, as cotton hectares were down 15%. We also proactively reduced channel inventory of FMC products, as planned in Q1, improving our inventory situation in Brazil. Our Andean Zone sub-region continued the momentum from 2020 with double-digit sales growth. Turning now to the first quarter EBITDA bridge on slide five. EBITDA in the quarter was down $50 million year over year due to a very strong Q1 2020 comparison. Volume headwinds in Latin America and EMEA were partially offset by new product launches in Asia and North America. In Latin America, we focused on reducing channel inventory to set ourselves up for a much stronger pricing environment in the second half of 2021. Cost headwinds were slightly higher than expected, while FX headwinds were far lower than in the prior four quarters. Turning now to our view of the overall market conditions for 2021. We continue to expect the global crop protection market will be up low-single-digits on a U.S. dollar basis. Relative to this time last year, commodity prices for many of the major crops are higher and stock-to-use ratios are much improved. All regions are seeing some benefit from better crop commodity prices, while the negative impacts from COVID on crop demand appear to be modest. The only change to our regional forecast is that we now forecast mid-single-digit growth in the EMEA market, versus low-single-digit growth before. This improved view is due to the strengthening of currencies in that region, relative to the U.S. dollar. Market growth in Asia is still expected to be in the low- to mid-single-digits, driven by India, Australia, and ASEAN countries, while growth in the North American and Latin American markets is still projected to be in the low-single-digits. Basic crop fundamentals remain strong; however, our overall forecast for the total crop protection market remains low single-digit growth due to signs of supply chain constraints in the industry, as well as modest channel inventory overhang for the industry in certain countries. Although Brazil and India are facing significant increases of COVID cases, we are not seeing signs that this is impacting their respective agricultural markets at this time. This is, however, something we are continuing to watch closely. Turning to slide six and the review of FMC\u2019s full year 2021 and Q2 earnings outlook. FMC full year 2021 earnings are now expected to be in the range of $6.70 to $7.40 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 14% at the midpoint. This is up slightly versus our prior forecast reflecting the share count reduction from our Q1 share repurchases. Consistent with past practice, we do not factor in any benefit from future share repurchases in our EPS guidance. Our 2021 revenue forecast remains in the range of $4.9 to $5.1 billion, an increase of 8% at the midpoint versus 2020, and 8% organic growth. We believe the strength of our portfolio will allow us to deliver this organic growth, continuing a multi-year trend of above-market performance. EBITDA is still expected to be in the range of $1.32 billion to $1.42 billion, representing 10% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Guidance for Q2 implies year-over-year sales growth of 6% at the midpoint on a reported basis and 5% organically. We are forecasting EBITDA growth of 1% at the midpoint versus Q2 2020, and EPS is forecast to be up 3% year-over-year. Turning to slide seven and full year EBITDA and revenue drivers. Revenue is expected to benefit from 6% volume growth, with the largest growth in Asia and a 2% contribution from higher prices. FX is now forecast to have no impact on the topline. We continue to expect broad growth across all regions, and a very strong second half of 2021. New products, like Overwatch herbicide, Xyway fungicide, and Vantacor insect control, are already making meaningful contributions. We are also planning to fungicide in the U.S. for non-crop applications later this year. We expect new products to contribute $400 million in revenue this year. This includes all products launched since 2018. We are forecasting strong growth in each of our product categories in the year. In addition to the continued growth of Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect controls, we expect growth from other key insecticide brands in our portfolio including Avatar, Hero and Talisman. Our herbicide portfolio is also expected to grow led by brands including Authority, Gamit, Spotlight Plus and Overwatch. Xyway is expected to lead growth of our fungicide portfolio, building on the successful launch of Lucento fungicide a couple of years ago. Our EBITDA guidance reflects significant volume and pricing benefits, offset partially by increases in R&D spending, the reversal of some of the temporary cost savings from 2020, as well as increases in raw materials and logistics costs. As we stated in February, we are forecasting an increase in R&D to bring us to a level of funding that keeps all projects on a critical path to commercialization. We are taking cost control actions to limit the net cost headwind to an incremental $10 million versus what we showed in February. We also intend to offset the higher raw material costs with an additional $10 million in price increases, which will come primarily in the second half of the year. Moving to slide eight, where you see the Q2 drivers. On the revenue line, we are expecting positive contributions from all categories; volume 4%, pricing 1%, and FX 1%. We are expecting solid sales growth in Asia, EMEA and Latin America. Asia growth is expected to be broad-based across the region, with particular strength in India, Australia and China. Growth in EMEA will be driven by improved crop conditions for cereals and sugar beets. Latin America growth should be supported by improved conditions in both Brazil and Mexico, and a continuation of strong growth in the Andean Zone. We see good conditions in North America for row crops and a positive outlook for our new products. Regarding EBITDA drivers, positive contributions from volume, pricing and FX more than offset the increased costs, which we previously discussed. Turning now to slide nine, with the guidance for Q2 and the full year on record, we would like to also show the implied forecast for the second half. We have a very strong outlook for H2 and let me outline the key drivers for that growth. We forecast year-over-year revenue growth of 15% in the second half, driven by five main elements. First, our expectations are strong for the U.S. and Brazil, following our weak Q4 2020 performance in those countries. Second, price increases, primarily in Brazil, with contributions from numerous other countries, will help offset the FX headwind from last year and the higher costs from raw materials this year. Third, new products will continue to be a major factor; Overwatch herbicide in Australia, Xyway fungicide, diamide formulations Elevest and Vantacor and Fluindapyr fungicide for non-crop applications in the U.S. and Authority NXT herbicide in India. Fourth, improved crop fundamentals, cotton in Brazil is the most obvious to us, as growers have indicated a 15% increase in hectares for next season, and we also expect a strong Q4 in North America and Latin America, driven by the good fundamentals for soybeans and corn. And finally, fifth, improved market access and expansions into new geographies and crops. This is having a significant impact in Asia with recent initiatives in India, Indonesia, Philippines, and Vietnam all forecast to drive high growth rates. Our guidance also implies 30% year-over-year EBITDA growth in the second half of the year. Much of that will come directly from the volume and pricing growth I just described, but we also expect to limit the raw material and supply chain cost headwinds with sustained cost discipline in other areas. I will now turn it over to Andrew. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks Mark. Let me start this morning with a few highlights from the income statement. FX was a modest tailwind for revenue growth in Q1, at 1% versus our expectations of a 2% headwind, as the U.S. dollar weakened against many currencies with the notable exception of the Brazilian Real. Interest expense for the first quarter was $32.4 million, down $8.4 million from the prior year period, with the benefit of lower LIBOR rates as well as lower foreign debt and lower term loan balances, partially offset by higher average commercial paper balances. We continue to anticipate interest expense between $130 and $140 million for the full year. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the first quarter was 13.5% as anticipated, and in line with our continued expectation for a full year tax rate between 12.5 and 14.5%. Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity, gross debt at quarter end was $3.6 billion, up over $300 million from the prior quarter with the expected seasonal build of working capital. Gross debt to trailing twelve month EBITDA was 3.0 times at the end of the first quarter, while net debt to EBITDA was 2.7 times. Both metrics were above our targeted full year average leverage levels due to the seasonality of working capital. We expect this will improve throughout the year and we will return to target levels by year-end. Moving on to slide 10 and cash flow and cash deployment. Free cash flow for the first quarter was negative $354 million. Adjusted cash from operations was similar to the prior year period, with improved working capital offset by changes in non-working capital items and lower EBITDA. Capital additions were somewhat higher as we ramped up spending following deferral of projects last year due to COVID. Legacy and transformation spending was substantially better, with the completion of our SAP program. We continue to expect to generate full year free cash flow within a range of $530 million to $620 million, with the vast majority of this cash flow coming in the second half of the year. We returned $137 million to shareholders in the quarter via $62 million in dividends and $75 million of share repurchases, buying back 696 thousand shares in the quarter at an average price of $107.73 per share. We continue to anticipate paying dividends approaching $250 million and repurchasing $400 to $500 million of FMC shares this year. And with that, I will hand the call back to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Andrew. Our Q1 financial performance was in line with our expectations. We are now focused on delivering against our full year forecast. COVID-19 continues to be a factor to watch, and we are closely monitoring raw material and supply chain costs. We remain confident in our full year forecast that builds upon the new technologies and improved market access that are driving our growth. The market demand for our most recent product launches is important, as it confirms the strength and value that our innovative R&D pipeline delivers to growers. We expect this momentum to continue to accelerate over the coming years with launches of new active ingredients and products as well as outcomes from technology partnerships we have established in the past year. Finally, we remain committed to our cash deployment plan. We are on track to deliver more than $700 million to shareholders this year, building on our trend since 2018 of improving cash generation and returning excess cash to shareholders. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. So, I was hoping to maybe dig in a little bit on price and cost, and you made some modest adjustments to the full year outlook that kind of netted to unchanged. But I'm trying to think about kind of what you're seeing maybe on a gross level in each of those buckets. It seems like both raw material inflation has been accelerating pretty meaningfully. Logistics is a challenge for many across the industry, and some of your peers do seem to be taking some more aggressive price action than what's implied in your guidance. And so I'm trying to just reconcile all those pieces and think about how that leads to you competitive position this year and there's either more pricing opportunity or carryover cost inflation into next year, just thinking of all the different moving pieces. Mark Douglas : Yes, Adam thank you. I'll start off, and then I'll let Andrew talk a little bit more about some of the cost actions and items that we got on the agenda in front of us. Listen, you're right. I mean, supply chain costs and raw material costs, and it's not just the cost element. It's actually availability that is causing some of that inflation that we're seeing. We are raising prices, and we have raised price last year. We're raising price this year. Most of it will come in the second half because of the way it's falling, although we did raise price in North America in Q1, and we didn't get as much price as we thought we would get in Latin America. We were very clear that we were focused on drawing down inventory, and we've very successfully done that. We continue to do that as we enter Q2, but I feel very good where the inventory levels are. That is boding well for our ability to move price in the second half. And as you just alluded to, the industry itself is moving because, certainly, FMC is not the only one facing these pressures, everybody is. So Andrew, do you want to talk a little bit about some of the cost elements and how it's flowing through the P&L? Andrew Sandifer : Sure, certainly. Thanks. Adam, as you noted, it's a modest adjustment in terms of what net hits the EBITDA bridge for cost and increased to $100 million headwind for cost on a full year versus $90 million when we gave initial guidance in February. The increase in raw materials and logistic costs is substantially more than that $10 million. We are taking additional cost control actions across all of our spending, whether it be in plant level spending in COGS or in SG&A and R&D, really continuing the strong discipline we've had throughout the pandemic to partially offset some of that increase in raw materials and logistics inflation. So certainly, the underlying increase in raw material and logistics cost is much more than the $10 million. But again, we'll be taking some very aggressive actions to continue maintaining cost discipline to offset that. Net-net, we look at that $100 million increase year-over-year, and directionally speaking, about $40 million to $50 million of that is really raw material and logistics cost increases. Another $30 million to $40 million of it is a return to more normal R&D spending levels. Some variability there based on how we do the exact execution of certain project expenses in that range. And the remainder is increases in SG&A against an artificially low 2020 when we run very extreme controls throughout the COVID pandemic. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Laurent Favre from Exane BNP. Please go ahead. Laurent Favre : Yes, good morning all. Mark, I've got a question on the UPL agreement and what it means for the earnings trajectory. I think back when you did the Technology Day, you refrained from talking about financial performance post 2023. I was wondering now, with this agreement and all the other agreements you've been able to do over the years, are you feeling more confident that you can avoid an earnings pressure from the diamide patent cliff after 2023? Thank you. Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks Laurent. Yes, fundamentally, I mean, we made a statement in February that in -- probably in the August call, we're going to do a deep dive. The August call is when we generally deep dive on one aspect of the business. We are going to do another deep dive on the diamides and the impact of all the programs we've put in place, whether it's defense from a legal perspective, where we've been very successful over the last year in litigating against people who are thinking about or trying to move around our patents in India and China to the whole third-party relationships. And I'm sure I'm going to get a question, so I'll head it off. On the third-party relationships, we have five global relationships now, UPL being the latest one. And we have 41, 42 now local relationships. We have 12 more that we're in discussions with that will probably be put in place sometime this year. So, we continue that expansion. And in August, we'll talk about the scale of this, how we see it growing. It's obviously very successful because we've been working on this since 2017 when we acquired the assets. It's been put in place. It's been driven regionally and globally. So, we'll put in place a program where we'll show you how big it is, how it's growing. The bottom-line, I do believe that in 2023, we will probably be at the very high end, if not above the high end of our expectations for diamides. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mark Connelly from Stephens. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly : Thanks. Mark as you launch these new products and they become an increasingly important part of the growth over the next couple of years, I was hoping you could give a sense of how well those launches are performing against your expectations, whether you see a need to adjust your go-to-market strategy or what you're learning. And along with that, can you tell us more about the market access initiatives? Because some of those countries that you listed are pretty challenging places for U.S. companies to do business, but really attractive CP markets. Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks Mark. Listen, it's a very good question, one that we've been working on a lot over the last couple of years, which is obviously the new technologies, the new products. Let me give you some numbers to sort of put this in perspective for you. I just said that $400 million of this year's revenue growth is coming from products that we've introduced since 2018. We usually take a five-year look at this, but 2017 was a very strange year for us because we made a major acquisition, so we've kind of set in the clock at 2018. Of that $400 million, $180 million is growth that are coming from products that were launched in 2018. So, it's real growth this year year-on-year. Of the $180 million, $100 million is coming from products that were launched this year, such as Vantacor, such as Xyway, such as Overwatch. So, you can see that, think about it, this year, we're projecting an 8% growth rate. 4%, so almost half of that overall growth is coming from new products, and that's exactly the trajectory we want to see. And we expect that to continue as these major launches start to gather steam. So, the products we've launched this year will obviously add to next year and continue for five years under this metric. I think it's a very important aspect that people are overlooking. I mean, we obviously focus on the diamides, and they continue to grow very well for us, will in the future as we bring on more partners. But you've got to remember, we're introducing brand-new products into spaces that we've never participated before, for instance, Xyway. It is a systemic fungicide for corn in the U.S. We've never had a fungicide for corn in the U.S. It's a large market, and it's one that we can now go and exploit because the technology is so different. That's the growth algorithm that we're running. To your second point, Mark, on market access, we have invested over the last couple of years in more basic salespeople, boots on the ground, in the field, in places like Indonesia and India, Vietnam, the Philippines. These are all, as you just said, very, very attractive markets, but they're very local markets. You have hundreds and thousands of small retailers and distributors that need to be promoted to. You only do that by having more people on the ground. So, we continue to invest in that. Then you've heard me talk over the last few quarters about how important the growth in Asia is. Well, it's coming not just from the portfolio; it's coming from our market access expansions, which were not slowing down, even as we go through the COVID-19 pandemic. So, it's a very good picture from a new product introduction standpoint. And don't forget, overall, new products, generally speaking, have a higher margin than products that are discontinued out of the portfolio. So, as Andrew has talked about many times in our five-year plan, we have a 300 basis improvement in EBITDA margin. Not only is that related to the investment in SAP and how we run the company, it is also related to the new products we're introducing and how that mix changes over time. Mark Connelly : Super helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead. John Roberts : Thanks. Mark, you indicated that you didn't think COVID in India and Brazil would affect customers there, but you had a supplier issue in the fourth quarter related to COVID. And India is a huge active producer, and they've got actually a large global producer there as well. Do you think there'll be production issues that will be disruptive to the industry that might affect maybe the next quarter? Mark Douglas : Yes. John I'm not so sure it's the next quarter. It's been there for a while. I just alluded to the fact that it's not just the cost. It is availability. These things come and go as places get hit. We've not had our own facilities go down, but our procurement and supply chain groups are working hard behind the scenes to source alternate raw materials where somebody goes down because of a COVID impact. So, they're there. They're very real. It's not just India. China has also had issues, not necessarily related to COVID, but other areas of manufacturing. So yes, it's something that we're very focused on. The supply chain groups and procurement groups work closely together. It's not something that you can predict, so the key is to make sure that your demand forecasts are as solid as they possibly can be so that you can procure forward as much as possible. And don't forget, our supply chains are long in nature. From the moment an active ingredient is manufactured to it getting through to a distributor or to a retailer and to a grower, that's a six to eight-month supply chain. So, it is a very, very complex area that takes a lot of managing. John Roberts : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : Hey, good morning folks. Mark, I'm trying to understand a little bit of arithmetic with respect to the shift in the diamide third-party partner, shifting from buying out of North America to Latin America. I believe you said that North American sales were down 8% year-over-year. However, if that shift had not occurred, it would have been up double digits. So, then the expectation is that Latin America would have seen that sort of level of increase. Obviously, you were doing some pruning in your inventories there and so forth. But what was the net impact in Latin America or maybe it's a seasonal shift. Can you enlighten us a little bit there? Mark Douglas : Yes, it's about $30 million, Frank. You can do the math. The numbers are out there. I might as well say what it is. It's about a $30 million swing from North America to Latin America. It occurs in the quarter. It's recognized in the quarter, so it's not something that changes any other part of the year. And listen, it's something I'm going to talk a lot more about as we go forward in August. As our diamide business gets much bigger and our third-party relationships get bigger, we don't control that demand. So it is going to move on us at times, and this is just one example. It doesn't mean to say that the overall company has lost any business. In fact, it's all good growth. It's just moved from one region to another because our third-party companies procure at different points in different regions. So, it's really as simple as that. It's not complicated at all. Frank Mitsch : Got you. So, just to be clear, so the Latin American revenues of $203 million would have been $170 million, absent this shift. Mark Douglas : Yes. Give or take, yes. Frank Mitsch : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Steve Byrne : Hi Mark. Your competitor yesterday highlighted a couple of insecticides that they have withdrawn production. I don't know whether that has any opportunity benefit for you on your insecticide platform. And maybe a more general comment about your outlook for new product development. When you look at regulators around the world that are discontinuing registrations, is there a particular vertical that looks like there could become an increasing void in active ingredients? And has your pipeline reflect that longer-term opportunity, perhaps more so with your biologicals? Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks Steve. With regards to the first part of the question, yes, there are some opportunities for us to replace the product that's being removed. Diamides would potentially take some of that market share. It all depends at what price point and what particular crop that is on. But yes, the team is looking at what upside there is there. I think from a general regulatory perspective, whether it's a fungicide, a herbicide or insecticide, they're all under regulatory scrutiny as they always have been. We just did a recent study where we looked at the insecticide overall market. So, when we think about the classes of chemistry that are out there, I do think there are -- some of the older chemistries that are going to come under pressure, and that's going to give great opportunity for things like the diamides, especially diamides and mixtures for different pests, and that's where I think we're going to see significant growth with some of our competitors in terms of how we're supplying product to the partners and how they will grow. So, I'm not really focused on whether it's a herbicide or its insecticide. We know the regulatory environment is getting more stringent. And as I've said before, for a basic R&D producer, that's not necessarily a bad thing because with a robust pipeline like we have, we're bringing the latest technologies to marketplace, which, generally speaking, because of the environmental regulations that we have today, our better chemistries, they're more targeted, they are softer in nature, that leads itself to the second part, which is the biologicals. And our biological program is really heavily focused around fungicides. Secondary is the insecticide area. We don't really have anything yet in the herbicide space. But we do see that growth in our biologicals business. That biological business is now just north of $100 million in revenue. It is growing in the very high double digits, and its EBITDA margins are strong. And we have good products coming in, in the near future from the pipeline. So, you will see us talk more and invest more in the biological space going forward. Steve Byrne : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Harrison from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Harrison : Hi, good morning. You mentioned that Europe was the only region where you were increasing your expectations or your market outlook. My understanding is there is a drought going on in France. How much exposure do you have in France? Maybe talk about your expectations for the weather impact in Q2 and the rest of the year in broader EMEA as a region. Thanks. Mark Douglas : Yes, Mike, the reason we increased it is mainly because of FX. It's just a U.S. dollar translation. You're absolutely right. It's not necessarily a drought. It's been very cold in Northern Europe. The season is probably delayed about three weeks, maybe even a month, and that's a lot at the beginning of the season. We're watching it very carefully. The South doesn't tend to be so impacted, so the whole specialty crop area through Spain, Italy, all the way across Greece and into Turkey. But certainly, France and Germany, we're watching very closely at this point, U.K. as well. It is -- it's not what we predicted, so it's something that we saw last year, actually. The drought occurred at the same time last year. It's just part of the climate change that we're seeing in the very short term, that the weather patterns are moving on it. The good news is in our European business, we do have a very diversified portfolio, and we have been growing in many of the smaller countries. I've mentioned Romania before. I've mentioned Greece. I've mentioned Turkey, which is becoming a much bigger market for us. So, I think having that distributed model across many countries helps. But yes, it is delayed and it's something we're watching. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Joel Jackson from BMO Capital. Please go ahead. Joel Jackson : Hi, good morning. We're seeing a lot of food -- we see a lot of food and food ingredient companies start to explore the idea around sustainability and farming and look at whether they'll start grading the grain ingredients across that they buy and the sustainability practices that those firms follow and maybe even down the road, and we're early, paying lower or higher premiums to the pricing they pay. Can you talk about -- are you having some discussions now as a crop into producer about some of the different crop protection products and other things that you offer and how that might factor into sustainability scores of farmers and play into this whole nascent dynamic? Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks Joel. Well, listen, the food chain is something that, obviously, we pay close attention to. Our global marketing group and our sustainability group have various relationships throughout that food chain. I would say in the future, we've talked many times about our sustainability index that we use for our research programs. I think a tool such as that as we go forward is going to be important to show the environmental impact that we have on the food chain in terms of the types of products we're selling, whether it be from a water usage, in manufacture or residual levels in use, those are all important elements. They're not necessarily, at this point in time, driving forces for revenue, but I wouldn't disagree with you that they won't become more important discussions as we go forward. And for us, we're happy to have that conversation. Because of the strength of the pipeline and the way we're developing those products, we believe there are advantages to have those discussions around the most efficacious products that have the lowest residues and especially in the biological space because that's where I can see biologicals playing a very important role. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Michael Piken : Yes. Good morning. I know that you've kind of held your guidance for kind of low single-digit percentage volume growth. And yet, we're looking at crop economics for a lot of row crop farmers and other farmers around the world getting a lot stronger. At what point do you think we might see the trajectory of the growth rate for the industry go up? And what factors need to come into play for the industry to maybe grow at a faster rate over the next couple of years? Thanks. Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks Mike. Yes, we are projecting that growth rate in the low to mid-single-digits. That's higher than we've projected over the last few years, and we were reasonably spot-on with our projections in terms of flat markets over the last couple of years. I obviously think that over the longer haul, if commodity prices stay where they are, then, yes, we should fundamentally see some uplift in the marketplace going forward. I think, this year, obviously, it's come, and we see -- I think the supply chain side and the raw material side is what's weighing on our view of the world. I think growers, as you say, are obviously in a much better place. I'm more concerned about ability to supply products that are needed at certain times in the marketplace. I think if prices stay like this into the next year and we start to get through the COVID crisis, and that manufacturing frees up and supply chains free up a little more, logistics become freer, then, yes, I think maybe next year, we might see FMC giving you a guidance that's slightly higher than where we are today. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Mark, you mentioned that supply constraints -- supply chain constraint is something that lowers industry growth this year. Do you think it follows that maybe the market is somewhat undersupplied versus demand and that could impact growth in 2022 positively? Mark Douglas : No, I don't fundamentally think so. I think the supply chains will be writing themselves as we go through this year, so I'm not concerned about significant supply constraints across the broad industry. Do I think there'll be pockets of constraints? Yes, more than likely. But that's what we have today, and we're working through it. So, I would hope that next year, it becomes a little easier on the supply chain and procurement groups for all the companies involved. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Kevin McCarthy : Good morning. Mark, I was wondering if you could comment on inventory levels in Brazil as well as the expected price inflection that you anticipate for the back half of the year and your degree of confidence in moving prices higher in that market. And then secondly, on Brazil, how much more volume might you anticipate with soybeans in the teens versus single-digits? If you look at history, is there any sort of rule of thumb or experience on that cross-price elasticity? Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks Kevin. Listen, on the inventory side, I can certainly tell you from FMC's perspective, we're in very good shape with all the activities that we've put in place. So I think the industry is generally getting better as well. We'll see as we exit Q2 and think about Q3 and Q4 as we enter the 2021, 2022 season. But yes, from FMC, we're in very good shape. Very happy with what the team's done. I know it's been painful for everybody involved, but it was the right thing to do. From a growth -- from our perspective, our market share on soy is reasonably low in Brazil. So when I talk about the second half of the year, and I said expectations in the U.S. and Brazil not only from a weak Q4 that we had, but generally speaking, from good crop fundamentals, soy is somewhere where we're growing. We're growing on insecticides for stink bug control and that's not with diamide. That's with other insecticides in our portfolio. A couple other brands that I mentioned here on Talisman, they are major growth products for us. So, I do believe, and fundamentally, I think most people would agree, that with higher crop prices, many growers are willing to invest in the best technologies to protect those crops. And that's one of the premises we're taking forward as we think about soy in the next season coming up in 2021, 2022. I also think that there is an opportunity on fungicides. We're gaining access to a new fungicide in Brazil that will be used on soybeans. That will help us as we gain a more broader footprint there. And then the third piece around Brazil is sheer market access. We're inking some deals as we speak, getting ready for the next season going forward with major distributors where we're increasing our market access to those distributors to sell the product. So, a backdrop to your question is, do we think we can do more with higher crop prices in soy in Brazil? The answer is yes, and it is one of those drivers for our strong second half. Kevin McCarthy : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Mark, wondering if we could talk a little bit about in North America what you're seeing in the horseshoe with specialty crops against fourth quarter and 1Q to sort of how you're expecting that to develop over the balance of the year. Mark Douglas : Yes, we are seeing it developing well, actually, and our growth has been very good, especially with the diamides and some of the new fungicide applications that we put in there. I think a watch out that I would say and the team has made this local to me is labor constraints, especially in the California areas, getting people into the fields, into the packing stations. It's something we're watching. It's not been a disruptor yet, but we're always trying to look around the corner. But fundamental growth is good. I have to say that, generally speaking, with the specialty crops and fruit and vegetables around the world, we have seen a very good growth, especially in Asia. Many of the countries in Asia are improving their inputs into many of the specialty crops, whether it's chilies or pulses in India. Mexico is doing well, a lot of exports from Mexico, so the Mexican specialty crop business is doing well. And I'm expanding a little bit outside of North America and the horseshoe, but the reality is the markets are intertwined in terms of demand. So, generally speaking, yes, very good, but one watch out would be labor in the U.S. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dan Rizzo : Hi guys. This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Thanks for taking my question. So, could you just provide more color on the labor shortage that we're hearing about from others is affecting you guys and to what extent? Mark Douglas : Yes, it's not really affecting us; it's more at the grower level. Many of the crops are picked by hand. The packaging stations that are on the farms are heavily labor-intensive. In many cases, it's just the case of getting the labor into the facilities. COVID, obviously, had a major impact on that. Hopefully, we're coming towards the end of that, but it is something that we're very cognizant of and are watching. Operator : Thank you. The final question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm just curious on Brazil and Latin America. You called out some challenges in cotton. How do you see that market kind of evolving over the next couple of quarters? Is it really dependent on kind of a full reopening and better textile environment? We're kind of hearing that that's already going on. And then also, maybe you can also comment on some of the customs issues you face in Argentina, if those are fully resolved or not. Thanks. Mark Douglas : Yes, I'll take the last piece first. Yes, the issues in Argentina, as I said at the last call, we were changing some of our supply chain manufacturing, formulating routes. Those are in place. So, yes, that's behind us at this point. When it comes to cotton, two things are happening. First of all, we're thinking forward to the 2021, 2022 season. We're already seeing raised prices for the next season, and that's something that we're driving, gives us a lot of confidence as to the previous question on price in Latin America. So, not only are prices moving, but more importantly, hectares are increasing. 2020 to 2021 cotton hectares in Brazil were down about 15%, maybe a little bit more. We're actually seeing that rebound now on the back of better cotton prices, lower stock to use ratios around the world and, frankly, more people buying clothes as we come out of the pandemic and the demand for cotton going up. So, this year has been a tough year for us on cotton, hence, the Q1 that we've had. But we're very, very confident that as we go into Q4 and Q1 later this year and 2022 that we'll see that rebound. And the signs are already there for us. Michael Wherley : Thank you. That is all the time that we have for the call today. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes the FMC Corporation conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Wherley, Director of Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Please go ahead. Michael Wherley : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation\u2019s second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Mark Douglas, President and Chief Executive Officer; Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Zack Zaki, FMC\u2019s new Director of Investor Relations. Mark will review our second quarter results, provide our outlook for 2021 and discuss our diamides business. Andrew will provide an overview of select financial items. Following their prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our earnings release and today\u2019s slide presentation are available on our website, and the prepared remarks from today\u2019s discussion will be made available after the call. Let me remind you that today\u2019s presentation and discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors including, but not limited to, those factors identified in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today\u2019s understanding. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today\u2019s discussion and the supporting materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations, free cash flow and organic revenue growth, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that as used in today\u2019s discussion, earnings means adjusted earnings and EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms, to which you may refer during today\u2019s conference call, are provided on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Michael and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results, revenue up 8%, EBITDA are up 2% and EPS up 5% year-over-year, or slightly ahead of our guidance. These results were fundamentally driven by volume, reflecting robust demand for FMC products around the world. Innovation continues to be a catalyst for growth. New products introduced in the last 12 months contributed $30 million in sales growth in the quarter. And our plant health products including biologicals posted Q2 sales growth in the high teens. We continue to expect a very strong second half of 2021, driven by robust volume growth. We have lowered our full-year earnings guidance due to the continued acceleration of raw material, packaging, and logistics costs. We will go into this in more details later. I'd like to take a moment to provide a COVID-19 update on our business. All our manufacturing facilities and distribution warehouses remain operational and properly staffed. Our research laboratories and greenhouses also have continued to operate throughout the pandemic. We are resuming in office operations where permitted by local authorities. And in June, we introduced flexible work arrangements to facilitate the return of all our staff to our headquarters in Philadelphia, as well as some other locations in adherence with local guidelines. We continue to have zero transmission of the virus in our facilities. But I want to acknowledge that we have lost employees to the pandemic and our employees have also lost family members. Thankfully, that number of affected employees has been small. Our thoughts are with employees that have been impacted directly by COVID-19. And we are thankful for everyone who continues to work safely at FMC. Turning to our Q2 results on slide 3, we reported $1.2 billion in second quarter revenue which reflects an 8% increase on a reported basis and a 4% increase organically. Asia and Latin America posted the largest growth at 20% and 15% respectively. Our fungicides grew over 50% in the quarter driven by the Xyway launch in the US and fungicides represented 8% of total sales in Q2 versus 5% of our sales in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $347 million, an increase of 2% compared to the prior-year period and $2 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. EBITDA margins were 28%, a decrease of 150 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact of continued and accelerating cost headwinds. Adjusted earnings of $1.81 per diluted share in the quarter, an increase of 5% versus Q2 2020 and also $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance range. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the increases in EBITDA and lower interest expense. Moving now to slide 4, despite the unfavorable weather conditions in several regions, Q2 revenue increased by 8% versus the prior year driven by a 4% volume increase and a 4% tailwind from foreign currencies. Pricing was essentially flat year-over-year. Sales in Asia increased 20% year-over-year and 13% organically driven by double-digit growth in India, Australia, Indonesia, and Pakistan. Insecticides contributed the greatest growth including Altacor for cotton and herbicide sales were also very strong driven by share gains in India for soybean and sugarcane applications as well as robust sales in Australia. In Latin America, sales increased 15% year-over-year and 12% organically. Mexico and Colombia each posted double-digit growth driven by strength of our products and specialty crops. We also had a shift of diamide partner of the sales to Latin America from North America similar to what occurred in Q1, which boosted the year-over-year growth rate. EMEA sales increased 3% year-over-year, but declined 3% organically as FX was a significant tailwind in the period. Diamides grew well and we saw strong sales of herbicides for cereals and sugar beets. However, this wasn't enough to offset the late start of the spring which resulted in lost applications for the FMC portfolio that will not be regained during the season. In North America, sales decreased 7% year-over-year and 8% organically. Similar to Q1, the year-over-year sales decline in Q2 was due to the shift of diamide partner sales from North America to other regions. Excluding revenue from our global diamide partnerships, our US and Canada crop business grew greater than 20% driven by an approximate $25 million contribution from two new products, Xyway Fungicide and VANTACOR insect control for specialty crops. Turning now to the second quarter EBITDA bridge on slide 5. EBITDA in the quarter was up 2% year-over-year due to the volume contribution of $42 million, largely offset by a $35 million cost headwind. The cost headwind continues to be driven by increases in raw material, packaging and logistic costs. And the very modest reversal of some of the temporary cost savings from 2020. Pricing was essentially flat versus prior year. Turning to our view of the overall market conditions for 2021. We now expect the global crop protection market will be up mid-single digits on a US dollar basis, which is slightly higher than our prior forecast and the most bullish we've been on the overall market for the past few years. The reason for the change is our view that the Latin American market will now grow in the high single digits versus low single digits before. Basic crop fundamentals remain strong, especially in that region. We continue to anticipate mid-single digit growth in the EMEA market, low to mid-single digit growth in the Asian market, and low single digit growth in the North American market. Turning to slide 6 and the review of FMC\u2019s full-year 2021 and Q3, Q4 earnings outlook. FMC full-year 2021 earnings are now expected to be in the range of $6.54 to $6.94 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 9% at the midpoint. This is down $0.31 at the midpoint versus our prior forecast. Consistent with past practice, we do not factor in any benefit from future potential share repurchases in our EPS guidance. Our 2021 revenue forecast remains in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, an increase of 8% at the midpoint versus 2020. EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $1.29 billion to $1.35 billion, representing a 6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. This is a $50 million reduction at the midpoint compared to our prior forecast, due to continued acceleration costs for raw materials packaging and logistics. This includes spending more to procure certain raw materials and intermediates from alternate sources, where there is limited availability at our preferred suppliers. Despite dry and cold conditions in certain parts of Brazil during Q2, we are bullish for the second half in Latin America especially for soybeans and cotton. In Brazil, our channel inventories are at more normal levels for this point in the season following the actions we took in Q1 this year. And we already have received nearly 70% of the orders needed to deliver our full year forecast in Brazil. Guidance for Q3 implies year-over-year sales growth of 8% at the midpoint on a reported basis and 7% organically. We are forecasting EBITDA growth of 5% at the midpoint versus Q3 2020. And EPS is forecasted to be up 7% year-over-year. Guidance for Q4 implies year-over-year sales growth of 20% at the midpoint on a reported basis with no FX impact anticipated. We are forecasting EBITDA growth of 35% at the midpoint versus Q4 for 2020. And EPS is forecasted to be up 46% year-over-year. It is worth noting that about half of this growth is going to be driven by the return of business we missed in Q4 2020 due to supply chain issues in North America and weather impact in Latin America. Turning to slide 7, and full year EBITDA and revenue drivers, revenue is expected to benefit from 6% volume growth, a 1% contribution from higher prices, and a 1% benefit from FX. We continue to expect broad growth across all regions except EMEA and a very strong second half of 2021. We have raised our forecast for 2021 revenue contribution from products launched in the last 12 months to $130 million from $100 million before. This includes launches of Overwatch herbicide, Xyway fungicide as well as Vantacor and Elevest insect controls. Our EBITDA bridge shows an increase of about $50 million in the expected impact from costs versus our May forecast. We continue our cost control actions to limit the net cost headwind. As we stated throughout the year, the R&D spending in our forecast is what is needed to keep all projects on a critical path to commercialization. But this year-over-year increase will be closer to $20 million rather than the $30 million to $40 million we had previously indicated as we limit overall cost increases. Relative to our prior guidance bridging May, we raised the anticipated volume contribution and lowered our benefit from pricing to reflect our decision to take volume with our high margin portfolio. Moving to slide 8, where you\u2019ll see the Q3 and Q4 drivers. On the revenue line for the third quarter, we are expecting a 6% contribution from volume, 1% contribution from price and 1% benefit from FX. We had a very strong revenue outlook for Q4 driven by five main elements. First, we forecast a strong recovery for our US and Brazil businesses following the weak Q4 2020 in those countries. This contributes about half of the total growth in the quarter. Second, new products will be a major factor. The Xyway Fungicide, new diamide formulations and Vantacor, fluindapyr fungicide for non-crop applications in the US, Overwatch Herbicide in Australia and Authority NxT herbicide in India. Third, strong crop fundamentals. We expect a strong Q4 in North America and Latin America driven by good fundamentals for a variety of crops. In Brazil, this includes cotton, as growers have indicated a 15% increase in hectares for the upcoming season. Fourth, improved market access and expansion into new geographies and crops. This is having a significant impact in India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Eastern Europe and Russia. And finally, fifth price increases will help offset the FX headwind from last year and the higher cost from raw materials this year. and the higher costs from raw materials this year. We are already holding orders for Brazil and US that are at a higher year-over-year prices. Much of our forecasted Q4 EBITDA growth will come directly from the volume and pricing growth I just described. Although we are seeing a large increase in costs in Q4 on a year-over-year basis, we are taking actions to reduce SG&A and R&D to offset a portion of the raw materials supply chain costs headwinds we are facing. I will now turn the call over Andrew. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks Mark. Let me start this morning with a few highlights from the income statement. FX was a stronger than expected tailwind to revenue growth in the quarter at 4% versus our expectations of a 1% tailwind as the US dollar weakened against all major currencies relevant to FMC. Interest expense for the quarter was $32.6 million, down $8.1 million from the prior period driven by the benefit of lower LIBOR rates and lower foreign debt balances. With continued low-interest rates, we now expect interest expense to be between $130 million and $135 million for the full year. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the second quarter was 13.5% as anticipated and in line with our continued expectation for the full year tax rate. Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity. Gross debt at quarter end was $3.8 billion, up roughly $200 million from the prior quarter. Gross debt at trailing-12-month EBITDA was 3.2 times at the end of the second quarter, while net-debt-to-EBITDA was 2.6 times. The difference between gross debt and net debt metrics is much larger than usual this quarter as we had significant cash that we were not able to return to the United States prior to quarter end. We are exploring repatriation alternatives for this cash in the third quarter. Both leverage metrics were above our targeted full year average leverage levels due to seasonality of working capital and will improve through the remainder of the year. Moving on to slide 9 and cash flow and cash deployment. Free cash flow for the second quarter was $204 million, essentially flat to the prior-year period. Adjusted cash from operations was lower than the prior year period in large part due to timing changes of certain tax payments. Inventory was higher reflecting the accelerating cost of raw materials, as well as increased inventory levels particularly of diamides as we prepare for a very strong second half. However, the growth in inventory was offset by increased payables. Capital additions were somewhat higher as we continue to ramp up spending following deferral of projects last year due to COVID. Legacy and transformation spending was down substantially with the benefit of the completion of our SAP program. With the reduction in our outlook for full year EBITDA, we are similarly adjusting downward our expectations for free cash flow to a range of $480 million to $570 million with the vast majority of this cash flow coming in the fourth quarter. Our outlook for adjusted cash from operations has weakened further in EBITDA driven by somewhat higher than expected working capital due to shifts in timing of sales to the latter part of the second half of the year, which will shift some collections into the following year, as well as higher inventory driven partially by elevated raw material costs. Our outlook for capital additions, as well as for legacy and transformation, have improved slightly. We returned the $87 million to shareholders in the quarter via $62 million in dividends and $25 million of share repurchases, buying back 212,000 shares in the quarter at an average price of $118.10 per share. Year-to-date, we returned $224 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. For the full year, we continue to anticipate paying dividends of roughly $250 million and now expect to repurchase a total of $350 million to $450 million of FMC shares this year. With the outlook for repurchases down slightly, reflecting the lower EBITDA guidance. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Andrew. Today, we'll provide an update on the progress of our diamide growth strategy. Since we launched FMC as a pure play agricultural science company, diamide has been a core part of our business. Our next appearance [indiscernible] have grown to be almost 40% of FMC sales today. Turning to slide 11 and some basic data on the insecticides market, which has grown by 83% from 2007 to 2019 and there's approximately $17 billion in value today. Following the broad crop protection market drop in 2015, insecticides have grown 2% per year. We expect this to accelerate in the next decade to about 3.3% compound annual growth rate. As higher value technologies take more share from older insecticides that are being phased out by regulators. We believe by 2030, the insecticide market will expand by about $7 billion versus 2019 to $24 billion in total. Moving to slide 12, we show the year-by-year revenue of the major insecticide active ingredient classes from 2014 through 2019 as reported by AG Bio investor and the respective share gains and losses over the period. FMC diamides or [indiscernible] make up well over 80% of the entire diamides class which includes a few other smaller active ingredients. Our diamides have grown to be about 10% to 11% of the total insecticide market and the total diamides class has gained 2% share from 2017 to 2019 to reach 13% of the total insecticide market. Conversely, organophosphate and Conversely, organophosphates and neonicotinoids have lost overall share. Turning to slide 13, we show the geographic breakdown of our $1.8 billion in diamide sales in 2020. This is all Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr sales and includes FMC sales of branded products and sales to our partners. Asia makes up nearly 40% of our diamides business today with North America a little over 25% of the sales and EMEA and Latin America between 15% and 20% each. FMC diamides have grown well above the market in all regions since we acquired them in 2017. On the right is the crop breakdown for our diamides. It should be no surprise that fruit and vegetables and rice make up about 50% of our current revenues. This is why the diamides are so strong in Asia since that market is about 30% rice and 30% fruit and vegetables. Turning to slide 14 and our diamides commercial strategy which we've discussed many times over the past two years. We have long-term supply agreements with five key multinational companies including the UPL deal we announced in March of this year. We also have 50 local agreements in various countries. And we have another 15 potential agreements currently under discussion. These agreements are helping significantly expand the market for our diamides. Our partners give us access to customers we do not currently serve. They also have access to certain active ingredients that can be formulated with our diamides to expand the market beyond what FMC has access to. The $1.8 billion diamide revenue in 2020 was roughly 60% through our own commercial activities, which we label as FMC branded on these charts, and 40% through our global and local partners. Since we acquired these products, our diamide growth has been evenly split between FMC branded business and sales through our partners which demonstrates how complementary these two routes to market are. We've been very deliberate in driving our growth through our partnership model. The success of this model is shown by the fact that the company EBITDA margins expanded 100 basis points from 2018 to 2020 even as these partners were growing significantly confirming this strategy is not margin dilutive. The other aspect of having sales to partners represents $700 million of our annual revenue can add more volatility in timing of demand. As such, revenues can be impacted by shifts in partner demand across the geographies and in time periods. We have structured the contracts with partners to have extended duration. Many of the agreements go through the end of this decade and some go beyond that timeframe. Moving to slide 15. There are several highlights of how we have grown our FMC branded portion of our diamide sales. New formulations, new registrations, label extensions and improved market access will drive growth not only for the diamide, but for all FMC active ingredients. Earlier this year, we launched the novel patent pending Vantacor formulation in the US which has already exceeded our original forecasts. Vantacor provides a much higher concentration than prior and executed formulations offering improved mixing, less packaging, and an improved sustainability profile. We see compelling opportunities in several crops and plans to launch Vantacor around the world including Australia where we have just received regulatory approval. We will continue to introduce other new mixtures and innovative formulations in all regions with 11 more launches expected by 2026. We are also developing new products offerings for our patented PrecisionPac and 3RIVE 3D systems which are expected to launch during the next five years. Furthermore, we continue to expand our Precision Agriculture Platform with additional services provided to growers and dealers through Arc Farm Intelligence. Moving to Slide 16, where we provide an update on our registrations and label extension strategy for our FMC-branded Diamides. A product registration from regulators is required in every country where we wish to sell. And each specific crop to be treated must be further approved by the regulators in that country. Every product use approved by regulators equals a new slice of addressable market. Today, we have approximately 2,700 approved uses across all products based on Rynaxypyr and 1,100 across all products based on Cyazypyr. We currently have 600 regulatory submissions under review and another 230 that we plan to submit to regulators from 2021 to 2025. We anticipate nearly 600 of these will achieve regulatory approval in the next five years. Moving to slide 17 and the Diamide Patent state, Rynaxypyr is covered by 21 patent families with a total of 639 granted and pending patents. Together with Cyazypyr active-related patents, we have over 30 patent families and close to a 1,000 granted and pending patents filed in 76 countries worldwide. Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr are complex molecules to produce. We have patents in many of these steps, and several of these intermediate processes patents run well past the expiration of the active ingredient composition of [indiscernible]. The fastest route to market for a competitor to enter the market for generic Rynaxypyr or Cyazypyr is to register their product by relying on FMC\u2019s product data. To do so, they will also be required to demonstrate that their products has the same profile as FMC\u2019s Rynaxypyr or Cyazypyr. To meet these stringent regulatory requirements for such a difficult to manufacture molecules, the AIs will have to be made the same way we are making it, which is protected by our FMC process making it, which is protected by our FMC process patents. Our patent portfolio includes extensive coverage of key intermediate chemicals, commercial and alternative manufacturing processes, mixtures and formulations. Slide 18 and 19 show the patent timelines for the top five markets. Taking into account our patents and regulatory requirements. We do not expect to see sales by a legitimate generic competitor that uses the approved manufacturing process, which would rely on our Rynaxypyr product data before 2026 in Europe, Brazil, India and China and 2027 for the US. Using that same approach for say as Cyazypyr on slide 19, we do not expect to see sales by legitimate generic competitors until 2026 for Brazil, China and India, 2027 for Europe and 2028 for the US. It is important to note the process and intermediate patterns are critical as it is extremely difficult to produce these compounds without these intermediates. Moving to slide 20, we are confident that our patent portfolio is enforceable. This is evident in a recent favorable injunction restraining NATCO in India from making or selling any product containing Rynaxypyr. Notably, the court also ordered NATCO not to use our patented processes to make Rynaxypyr. We anticipate that this is the first of many successful enforcements of our diamide process patents. To-date, we have enforced our patents and obtained preliminary injunctions or settlements against six infringers in India and we have commenced litigation against four infringers in China. Beyond patent enforcement, we've also had a variety of other successful court decisions that support our strategy. For example, we have obtained an injunction against the Brazilian regulators to respect our Rynaxypyr data exclusivity, which will postpone action on all generic Rynaxypyr applications filed while our data exclusivity was still in force. This effectively delays their registration approval by years . In addition to our legal strategy, we've also adopted a comprehensive regulatory advocacy strategy that includes notifying regulators about companies that do not have permission to produce. As a result of these efforts, multiple countries have decided not to accept applications for registration of Rynaxypyr products prior to the active ingredient\u2019s patent expiration. And others have decided to require additional data and proof of legitimate manufacturing rights in the source country as part of the application process. So, to recap on the diamides, first, the insecticide market continues to grow and our diamides will continue to take share. Second, our partner strategy is accelerating the growth of diamides and smoothing the transition to a post-patent business later this decade. Third, our partner state is strong and will remain in place for a long time. Fourth, we are successfully depending on our patents and will continue to enforce our IP. And fifth, diamides will continue to be a meaningful contributor to FMC\u2019s growth throughout this decade and beyond. To conclude our prepared remarks, despite the continued headwinds from costs, we continue to deliver excellent volume growth around the world driven by the significant success of new product introductions as well as an increasingly robust market. Our mid- to long-term growth story is firmly rooted in the strength of our current portfolio, the diamide expansion we just outlined and the significant growth we anticipate from our new product pipeline over the next decade. As you've seen in the press release earlier this morning, we announced our target to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2035. This is a bold step for our company and reflects our deep commitment to sustainability. And, finally, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Michael Wherley for his commitment to FMC over the last eight years and wish him great success in his next career move. I'll now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Steve Byrne with BMO. Please go ahead. Steve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. And just a shout out to Mike. We appreciate all the help over the years. Mark, I wanted to drill in a little more on the diamide outlook. I appreciate the detailed update on the IP strategy and partnership and so forth. But we'd like to hear your views about the competitive landscape.. What are the primary products by region or crop that you can comment on that the diamides are really down in the trench competing with? And the reason I ask is that the biggest bucket is the neonics and the top two in that category are being banned by Europe. And I don't know whether you think that could spread to other regions. And then in our next big bucket is the organophosphates and the number one in there is [indiscernible] and we think the EPA could ban that in the next two weeks. And so, whether that could expand as well, I would like to hear your view on that. But more importantly, what are those actions mean for the competitive landscape for your diamides? Mark Douglas : Yes, Steve. Thanks for the question. I think you're hitting on something that I think you're hitting on something that I sort of touched on in the script when I said that part of the growth of the future of the diamide is going to be how that insecticide landscape changes. And you're right, neonics are under pressure; organophosphates, some of them are certainly under pressure; and some of the pyrethroids as well. So when you look at those major classes of chemistry, we do believe that either the diamides as they are built today and formulated today will take share in certain parts of the world from all of those three classes. But more importantly, I think the way we're going to formulate and our partners are formulating these products, I think you'll also see that accelerated market share gain against those three classes of chemistries. And, by the way, there are other chemistries out there as well that are older. Those are just happens to be the big ones. So part of the growth is going to be that share gain. And we've already seen that. You can see that the diamides are growing strongly as some of the other technologies are declining. I don't see that slowing down. In fact, for everybody that watches this space, you can see the regulatory environment is getting tougher and tougher. That bodes well for the diamides. And, frankly, for the next set of insecticides that we will launch over the decade out of our new pipeline. So, very strong growth expected. And, yes, some of it will be against those different types of classes of products. Operator : Our next question will come from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : So I was hoping to maybe dig a little bit on the revised outlook and maybe, A, provide -- if you can provide a little more color on some of the sources of incremental cost headwind that you're seeing and kind of the risks or likelihood that that actually will leak further into 2022. And then corollary to that is the pricing actions that you\u2019re taking which on a net basis, it seemed a little bit more modest than you might have thought a few months ago. And really looking back over the last couple of years when I look at price, FX, and cost kind of all three FMC that that's still on a multi-year basis still a full negative numbers. So, just help us think about how you would frame that on a go-forward basis and how maybe the approach to pricing for cost and FX maybe needs to evolve if at all beyond 2021. Mark Douglas : Yeah. Thanks, Adam. There's a lot wrapped up in that question. I'm going to try and tackle it with a few different angles because there's a few things that are connected here. First, when you look at what we've said on the cost side, in our February guide, we had about $90 million of negative cost. And we're now up into the 150-plus-million-dollar range. As we've gone through the first half of the year, we've continued to see that many of our raw materials from not only a cost standpoint but from an availability standpoint which ultimately does drive the cost have started to increase and not slow down. This started with the wave of the commodity changes that we saw due to various issues around the world whether it was the Texas freeze or other things in China. And that has now spread into the intermediates and the fine chemicals. So, we're seeing this wave continue through the business. And we took the decision without procurement groups and the commercial groups with what we saw coming, we felt it was the most prudent way to forecast the rest of the year from a higher cost perspective. So, we see the second half of the year cost is significantly higher than the first half. We had about a $55 million cost headwind in the first half of the year. We\u2019ve got approximately a $96 million to $100 million headwind in the second half. Now you have to put that in the context of what is happening in the overall marketplace in terms of volume. If you look at our volume growth, we have increased our volume expectations for the year on the back of very good demand for our portfolio. And we're seeing that pretty much across the world. I would say, the only exception is Europe from what we saw in Q2. But certainly, Latin America and North America, we're seeing that volume demand. And the way our portfolio is built because of the high EBITDA margins as a drop through, we have now taken the decision that it is actually better for us to take advantage of that robust market, go and get volume rather than get price. Now, it's not to say price is not moving. It is. We have roughly a $37 million to $40 million price advantage in the second half of the year. Most of that comes in the fourth quarter as we roll into the North American and Brazilian seasons. That's where you're going to see the most price. So you put all that together. You can see, we're making some strategic decisions. We know we can take volume at high margin. So we're going to do that rather than go for the price, although we are going for price in two parts of the world. The other part of your question was, what does that mean for 2022? Well it's very early right now, but think of it in this context. The way FMC manages its inventory and the costs flow through as we have essentially a six-month delay in the costs hitting the P&L. So the costs that we incur in the first half, impacts the second half of the year. The costs that will incur in the second half will impact in the first half of 2022. I don't see costs going down in the second half of this year. That means, we are likely to have similar cost structure in the first half of next year. However, if we look at the way this curve is shaping out it may well be that the first half of next year, the costs start to come down and we would see the benefit in the second half of next year. So it is going to be a very much a year of two halves. To what degree? We don't know yet. We are right at the very beginning of our budget process. So we'll have more clarity as we get into the fourth quarter on that. But that's kind of how we're thinking about this from just a high level flow of costs into 2022. Adam Samuelson : Okay. All right. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Operator : Our next question will come from Laurent Favre with Exane BNP. Please go ahead. Laurent Favre : Thank you and good morning, all. Mark, I've got a question, I have 10 questions on but just for one. On slide 13 and 14, I was wondering if you could talk about how you guys think about the focus areas for FMC branded diamides and the power [ph] in terms of areas of incremental growth. So i.e., therefore, geographies or crops. Are there areas where you think you can drive the growth better than the partners and vice versa? Can you elaborate a little bit on that, please. Mark Douglas : Yeah, sure. So if you think about -- if you think about the Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr, you look at the chart, the donut chart on slide 13 on the far right-hand side. We've given a breakdown of our diamide sales by crop. It's very different for Cyazypyr. Cyazypyr is almost 100% fruit and vegetables, at this point in time. So for Cyazypyr, which is growing very quickly. It's now just north of $300 million in 2020. It\u2019s growing well this year. I think the fruit and vegetable market for Cyazypyr has a long way to go. When you think of the size of that business not only in Asia, but in places like Mexico where we're growing strongly, we're seeing Cyazypyr take share. I think the other aspect that I would highlight is that a lot of our business today is not in brand new formulated products. It is in the active ingredients that's formulated to be used. Our partners and does now are branching out with pretty sophisticated formulations that take us into new spaces. So it's not just a crop perspective, it's a pest spectrum. For instance, our Elevest formulation in the US. It is a Rynaxypyr plus bifenthrin which is a pyrethroid. The pyrethroid gives you very fast knockdown of insects. So you have a different mode of action which enhances the use of the Rynaxypyr. It's those types of activities that not only FMC is doing, but many of our partners are now formulating and getting registrations for formulations that we don't have. So I think of it as the fruit and vegetable market. I would say expansion in Asia, parts of Latin America, and then I would also say Eastern Europe, Mid East, Africa for Rynaxypyr as well. So you can tell by the way we think about this. There's an awful lot of growth left in and not only how we formulate the products, but the geography and the crop and the pest aspect. I hope that helps a little bit, Laurent. Laurent Favre : Thanks, Mark. And as a follow-up to Steve's question, you should think about the long range forecast on neonics and organophosphates market share losses. I mean, would you assume that on average, that 1% share gain for diamides is directionally correct on average for the next well through the end of this decade? And I appreciate the linear progression but\u2026 Mark Douglas : Yeah. You\u2019re right. It's not going to be linear. I mean, you have products that lose a registration. So in any one year, you could have an acceleration of other products, replace them. Certainly, when I think about where we are today in that 12% to 13% range, over the next decade we should be adding another 300 to 400 basis points of market share as the market grows. So you don't only take in the current market, you're taking growth in the extended market. And that's one of the reasons why we see this robust growth. And it's not just FMC that sees that robust growth. Our partners see it too. That's why they're investing early to get into this molecule ahead of patent expiration as we go through the decades so that they can build their positions and take share in these other chemistries as well. Operator : Our next question will come from Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go to. Mark Connelly : Thank you. Mark, you sound very bullish on LatAm despite the disappointments we've had in the last year and whether that doesn't look all that great. And I know Latin America is more than Brazil corn and soy. But can you help us understand how the pieces down there are fitting together this year and where the risks are if the weather stays disappointing? I'm thinking from an FMC portfolio perspective, how different is this year actually shaping up than last year when Brazil did disappoint? Mark Douglas : Yeah. Thanks, Mark. So you're right. We tend to focus on Brazil, but let's be clear, we have some other large pieces of business that are growing very rapidly in Latin America. And I would single out Mexico, where we're seeing extremely strong growth on all the fruit and vegetable complex as well as on corn, not just with the diamides, but with our other herbicide products as well. And as we grow our -- start to grow fungicide portfolio, Argentina is becoming a very important country for FMC. We're well north of $200 million in revenue. Our portfolio fits very well there from a insecticide and herbicide for the soy complex. So we see Argentina growing very well. And then I singled out a couple of the Andean countries as well. They're small but they're growing very well for us. And they're high value because it's again a fruit and vegetable market. For Brazil itself, I made the comment in the script that we have over 70% of the orders in hand for the -- to deliver our full year expectations in Brazil. That's probably, I would guess, about 15% more than we had at this time last year. So already we can see that the growers themselves are much more bullish on expectations. Think about the comment that I made about the cotton growers already telling us that we're going to see a reversal in cotton acres. We're going to see approximately 15% more than we saw last year. And you look at the latest forecast, it's forecasted that for the first time Brazil will plant more than 40 million hectares of soy. That's up 3% to 4% on the prior year. We're growing our applications on soy especially with insecticides and strangely enough, not the diamides; our other insecticides that are very good on piercing pests such as stinkbugs. So you put all that together. We are very bullish on Latin America. The situation feels very different to last year. Now, if there is a weather issue, you know what, that's going to impact everybody. It will impact us at some point. We'll deal with that as we go through the year. But the indications are right now that the weather in Brazil and Argentina should be more normal than it was last year. Operator : Our next question will come from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Hi. Thank you. I'm just trying to tie together the volume versus price discussion, as well as the increase in the sales from the new products to -- and maybe they don't have anything to do with each other, but where is the incremental $30 million of new product sales? Are there particular geographies that, that's coming from or is it widespread? And is it -- those sales that were -- what we\u2019re determining the decision to be more focused on volume rather than price? And if that's the case, why did that impact the price decisions on sort of the Heritage portfolio? Mark Douglas : Yeah, there's a couple of things there, Vincent, that they\u2019re not necessarily obviously joined together. For instance, the new products sales that you see, we register that in volume, where you look at our full-year chart. So, it's mixed in with all the regions, it\u2019s not separated out. Those new products essentially North America very, very strong growth in North America. We're also seeing growth in Asia and a little bit in Europe, but I would say this season, with the types of products, North America, the US in particular and Australia with the herbicide launch of Overwatch. Those new products did not influence our decision to go and get volume on other parts of the portfolio. That is occurring naturally in terms of the new product introductions. And unless you remember, some of those markets, in fact, most of them are markets where we're not cannibalizing ourselves. Overwatch Herbicide is a brand new market for us. It is a serial herbicide, the first one we have. It's brand new market space for us. So, we're not cannibalizing and it's not impacting the rest of the portfolio in terms of how we think about volume demand. We have requests for volume across our portfolio whether it is pre-ermergent herbicides in the US, whether it is getting ready for the fungicide launches in the US. So it's more broad-based than the new products. I wouldn't mix them up -- I wouldn't mix them up like that. And then you know what, we have extremely high incremental value. When you look at the dropdown from a volume perspective, it's very high for us right now. So that also helps us make that decision, go get the volume. Operator : Our next question will come from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mike Sison : Hey, good morning guys and good luck to you, Mike. Mark, just wanted to revisit 2022. I know it's way early to give specific guidance but I guess you reduced the outlook for this year by $0.30 or so, price cost and doesn't seem like we should just add that back as we head into 2022. So what's the best way for us to think about the growth algorithm into 2022 assuming we don't just add back the $0.31 and try to get to a realistic number for next year? Mark Douglas : Yeah. I'm glad you said it that way, Mike. I think, listen, importantly for us we are right on track through our five-year plan. And we've had significant headwinds during the year, during the period from 2018 to today. Yet we're still growing in that 5% to 7% top line range. I would model on a 5% to 7% top line next year. Yes, costs will potentially look different. Pricing may look different depending on how much price we get versus our plan this year and also into the first quarter of next year where we'll be raising prices again. I would simply model on that 5% to 7% range and then we will give more guidance as we walk through the end of this year. Probably in the November call, we'll start to give you a little more clarity. And then in the February call, we'll give you the actual numbers. But I would stick with that 5% to 7%. There are so many moving pieces. I mean, think about it, at the EBITDA line, we had $600 million of FX and raw material costs since 2018, yet we're right on in the range of our five-year plan. So, it just shows the resilience of the portfolio, our crop and geographic mix, and our ability to offset what our enormous costs that have flown through the organization. Operator : Our next question will come from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : Hey, Mr. Olympian, great working with you. All the best to you, Mike. I was just curious, Andrew, if you wanted to talk about the buyback program. It looked a little light in 2Q. What should investors be expecting there? Mark Douglas : Yeah. Thanks, Frank. Look, if you look at our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a high level of cash. And I mentioned, it\u2019s in my prepared comments, we have some cash and some overseas subsidiaries who weren\u2019t able to get back to the US this quarter, which has sort of limited our ability to buy back at the pace we might have anticipated. When you look at the timing of that movement, as well as just the timing the generation of cash, I think you should expect that our -- the pace, the sequence of our buybacks is this year is much more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. We will be -- we're looking at alternatives to bring that cash back to the US here this quarter, but not clear of the exact timing. But that $350 million to $450 million buyback range for the full year very much in reach It just will be a bit more backend loaded in Q4 than what we'd initially anticipated. Operator : The next question will come from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joel Jackson : Hey. Good morning. Just to go back to kind of the 7% to 9% growth algorithm five-year plan, Mark and I appreciate all the color you've given already on the call, but, I mean, in light of your comments, do you have a lot less confidence in the EBITDA growth algorithm targets versus -- it seems like you've got strong comps within top line. And what process are you going internally now to sort of reassess the mid- and long-term EBITDA growth target? Mark Douglas : Yeah. Listen, I have absolutely no wavering on our targets whether it's the top line or EBITDA. I mean, think about our latest guidance for this year. We're growing EBITDAR at 6% this year. And that's pretty close to our 7% to 9% despite $150 million of headwinds that we were not expecting when we started the budget process last year. So no, Joel, I think when I look at the portfolio of the company and the growth opportunities and I am very encouraged by the $130 million of revenue from products put in the marketplace this year alone. We have about $400 million of sales this year that have come from products that we've launched over the last three years. So that growth algorithm is very much in place, plus the fact that those products have higher margin than our general portfolio and the products that are dropping off the other end are at a much lower margin. So I have no reason to believe that the EBITDA projections of 7% to 9% are not unrealistic at all and we are certainly as confident as we were when we put the plan together. So, yeah, very much in that range. Operator : Our next question will come from Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Mark, in your chart, you showed that FMC\u2019s diamides products represent about 80% of the class. How do your products compared to the 20% that are sold by your competitors? How do you think competition between those 80% and 20% buckets will evolve as the overall class grows? Mark Douglas : Yeah. Well, listen, I think the fact that we're over 80% of that class and those products have been around for a while tells you that the growth algorithm for what we have. The products are different. I mean, when you look at Rynaxypyr, it has just unbelievable residual activity versus the other diamides that are out there. They may be in the same class of chemistry, but they're not the same chemistry. And that's important when you look at things like residual pest spectrum, etcetera. So we do see our products continue to outpace the rest of the diamides that are in there. And, let's be honest, there's only three or four of them from different companies. I expect our growth rates will continue and that 80% number will go up over time. Operator : Our next question will come from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead. John Roberts : Thank you. During the quarter, the diamide partners\u2019 geographic shift reduced the US sales. Did it benefit ex-US by an offsetting amount? And if so, could you give us the ex-US numbers excluding the partners? Mark Douglas : Yeah. It did, John. I think the amount is roughly about $50 million to $60 million. And it's not -- it wasn't like Q1 exactly, where it all went to one region. It did go to a couple of regions. But certainly, the growth rate in Latin America without that would have been very high single digits versus the 15% that we showed on the chart. So, there is an offset in Latin America, a little bit in a couple of the other regions. But I think that's how you should think of it, $50 million to $60 million, most of it in Latin America; a little bit in the others. Operator : Our next question will come from Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead. Mike Harrison : Hi. Good morning. Wanted to ask a couple of questions on the Europe. First of all, you noted the weather issues and kind of the slower start to the year. Obviously, we've seen a lot of pictures out of Europe. So, do you think the weather situation could worsen as the year progresses? And then the deregistration impacts this year, is that a fairly normal pace of a volume headwind or that worse this year than you would normally see in Europe? Mark Douglas : No, it's about -- I'll take the second part first, Mike. It's about the same. It's about 150 basis points of revenue. Most of it is in Europe, a little bit in Latin America as well. I've kind of normal -- we kind of muddle about 1.5% drag on revenue through the registration elements that flow every year. It can go as high as 3%. We had one year where it was 3%, but that was a deliberate action by us. I would expect it to be in that 1.5% range as we go forward. From a weather perspective, yeah, the spring was certainly late and cold which impacted us. We are seeing increased pest pressure now with the weather as it is which is good from an insecticide perspective. The fall is very important The fall is very important for autumn applied herbicides for cereals. We'll see if the weather is good there then that certainly helps Q4. But I've talked about this year and how we're not expecting a lot of growth out of Europe. And I think that's a fair way to look at Europe this year given the weather issues. I don't think we're being too bullish on Europe. Now, next year, if weather improves, we have a more normal season, we should see a good uptick in Europe next year. Operator : Our last question will come from Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Michael Piken : Yeah. Just a question on the diamide business and thanks to the color. With respect to the sales that you make to your partners, is it fair to assume that it's at a competitive margin? I know you guys showed the chart on your margins have gone up as the sales through the partners have gone up. But are the margins generally pretty competitive? And if so, I mean, what's the net benefit of selling it yourself versus just relying on the partners to sell the product? Thanks. Mark Douglas : Yeah, Mike. So, from our perspective, the way the contracts are written, they have to be advantageous for the partner who has to make money in the markets they're in and it can't be dilutive to us. And that's how we view it. So from an EBITDA margin perspective, these products are equally as important as the branded products that we sell. They gain access and what they're financially extremely attractive to us and financially attractive to our partners. So we have that win-win. But obviously don't disclose the margins of these products or with our partners or ourselves. Suffice to say that we're very happy with the financial performance of our partner growth. But obviously, our partners keep growing. So they're also very happy with the financial performance as well. Michael Wherley : That is all the time that we have for the call today. Thank you, and have a good day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. This will conclude the FCM Corporation conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

A reconciliation and definition of these terms, as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Zack. And good morning, everyone. FMC delivered record third quarter results. We grew our revenue by 10%, EBITDA by 12%, EPS by 17%, and importantly, expanded our EBITDA margins despite continuing cost pressures. Performance in the quarter was driven by broad-based volume growth and price increases. New products introduced in the last 12 months continued to gain momentum. And we are now forecasting sales from these products to account for more than 1/3 of our revenue growth this year. In addition, FMC's plant health business had an excellent quarter with 40% year-over-year growth led by biologicals. Looking ahead, we continue to expect a strong finish to the year driven by high-margin volume gains and accelerated pricing actions, as well as a robust global market backdrop. I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge our operations and procurement teams for their contribution to our third quarter performance. The supply chain and logistics challenges highlighted in our last earnings call continued to disrupt AgChem and other industries around the world. FMC was able to meet the strong grower demand for our products in a timely manner. Thanks to the work of these teams.  Let me also briefly comment on COVID-19 's impact on FMC. All our manufacturing facilities and distribution warehouses remain operational and properly staffed. Our research laboratories and greenhouses continue to be fully active. And we have resumed in office operations in many parts of the world. FMC continues to follow all guidance given by local authorities. Turning to our Q3 results on slide 3, we reported $1.2 billion in Third Quarter revenue, which reflects the 10% increase on a reported basis, and a 9% increase organically.  Growth was broad-based with 11 of our top 20 countries posting double-digit growth in the quarter. We had strong growth in all product categories led by greater than 20% growth in herbicides. This was partially offset by registration losses in EMEA and Latin America. Adjusted EBITDA was $293 million, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year period. And $18 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. EBITDA margins were 24.6%, an increase of basis points compared to the prior year, driven by mix improvement, as well as operational discipline and price increases in all regions. Adjusted earnings were $1.43 per diluted share in the quarter. An increase of 17% versus Q3 2020. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by an increase in EBITDA with the benefit of share repurchases and lower interest expenses, largely offset by other factors. Relative to our Q3 guidance, the $0.12 beat was driven almost entirely by EBITDA. Moving now to slide 4. Sales in Asia increased 20% year-over-year and 19% organically driven by strong diamines sales across the region, as well as pricing actions.  In Australia, we had a successful launch of VANTACOR insect control, which is the new higher concentration formulation of Rynaxypyr active. VANTACOR is applied to specialty crops such as chickpeas. The Australian market also benefited from positive grower sentiment, favorable weather conditions, and strong insect pressure. India had another growth quarter, despite an erratic monsoon, which resulted in dry spells in parts of the country. India's growth was driven by dynamite sales in rise, as well as continued expansion of the rest of our portfolio, leveraging our strong market presence.  In Latin America, sales increased 11% year-over-year and 9% organically, driven by double-digit growth of insecticides in Brazil and Argentina as well as pricing actions across the region. Corn, soy and cotton, were the key crops driving growth in the quarter. This is a direct result of our strategy to improve market access and increased penetration of our technologies, particularly in the Brazilian soybean market. July is another good example of this. Sales nearly doubled compared to this time last year as we leveraged our enhanced market presence. On health products grew approximately 50% in the region, led by biologicals and seed treatment.  Latin America was impacted partially by registration cancellations and rationalizations of products in the quarter. EMEA grew revenue 12% and 10% organically, driven by strong demand for our herbicides and diamine s across the whole region, despite headwinds from registration cancellations. Among others, Russia, France, Germany, and the UK grew double-digits in the quarter. Demand was especially strong for herbicide applications in cereals and oil seed rate. South Africa, double-digit sales in the period compared to the previous year, driven by the continued penetration of diamines, mainly on citrus and top fruits. This is a great demonstration of the untapped potential in new markets for our diamines.  Our U.S. and Canada branded business grew greater than 20% driven by strong demand for our diamines and fold herbicide applications, as well as, pricing actions. VANTACOR had a successful introduction in the U.S. where it is used to target one pest in a range of crops, including soybean, corn, and cotton. The VANTACOR launch was timely and welcome by growers who are battling extended fall armyworm pressure from the southern markets up through the middle of the country. Overall, North America sales decreased 6% year-over-year and 6% organically due to the continued shift of diamine global partner sales in the quarter from North America to other regions, as we have described in previous calls. Moving to slide 5, despite continuing supply issues across the industry, FMC 's third quarter revenue increased by 10% versus prior year, driven by a 9% contribution from volume. Gross prices increased 1% in the quarter as our most recent pricing actions went into effect. EBITDA in the third quarter was up 12% year-over-year, primarily due to broad-based volume gains. We also had a $12 million contribution in the quarter from price increases as invoice to customers. The benefit of our pricing action was masked in the quarter by some favorable rebate and other adjustments in the prior-year period that did not repeat this quarter. Cost continues to be a headwind, however, the total amount incurred in the third quarter was less pronounced than previously projected, mainly due to timing. We still expect second half cost to be consistent with previous guidance.  And FX was a $10 million tailwind in the quarter. Turning to slide 6, before I review FMC's full-year 2021 and Q4 earnings outlook, let me share our view of the overall market conditions. We continue to expect the global crop protection market will be up mid-single-digits this year on a U.S. dollar basis. Breaking this down by region, we continue to anticipate high single-digit growth in the Latin American market, mid-single-digit growth in the EMEA market, low to mid-single-digit growth in the Asian market, and low-single-digit growth in the North American market. We are raising FMC's full-year 2021 earnings guidance to the range of $6.59 to $6.99 per diluted share.  A year-over-year increase of 10% at the midpoint, reflecting the impact of share repurchases completed year-to-date. Our 2021 revenue forecast remains in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, an increase of 8% at the midpoint versus 2020. EBITDA remains in the range of $1.29 billion to $1.35 billion, representing 6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Guidance for Q4 implies year-over-year revenue growth of 19% at the midpoint on a reported basis, with no FX impact anticipated. We forecast EBITDA growth of 29% at the midpoint versus Q4 2020. An EPS is forecasted to be up 41% year-over-year. Approximately 3 quarters of the EBITDA growth is driven by the return of business missed in Q4, 2020 due to supply chain disruptions in North America and weather impact in Latin America. Turning to slide 7, and full-year EBITDA and revenue drivers. Revenue is expected to benefit from 6% volume growth, a 1% price contribution from higher prices, and a 1% benefit from FX. We anticipate continued strong volume growth led by Latin America, North America, and Asia. We have increased our forecast again for revenue from products launched in 2021. These sales are now expected to contribute $140 million in year-over-year growth up from our last forecast of $130 million and our initial view of $100 million. Pricing actions in Q3 will come to new to accelerate in Q4. We will continue to raise prices across all regions going into next year. Despite the shift of costs from Q3 to Q4, estimates for full-year cost headwinds have not changed since our detailed comments in the last call. This is why our full-year outlook remains unchanged. Moving to slide eight, and our full-quarter drivers. Revenue is expected to benefit from strong volume gains. In Brazil, the strength of soft commodity prices to projected increases in planted areas, as well as, good weather conditions, are all leading to a good cadence of incoming orders and give us confidence in our expectations for a strong Fourth Quarter. In the U.S., channel inventories are normal for this time of year.  Our new product launches are gaining significant traction and market sentiment supports our expectations for a robust Fourth Quarter. As I noted earlier, we have also moved on price increases with higher prices already in effect in the Brazilian and U.S. markets. Similar actions are underway in other countries across the globe, such as Australia, Russia, France, Mexico, and Argentina. And you should expect us to continue raising prices through the year-end and well into next year. Cost increases are consistent with our guidance for the second half. We continue to pursue cost improvement opportunities and remain vigilant with our cost controls, all without impacting our R&D pipeline, or growth trajectory. I will now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks, Mark. Let me start this morning with a few highlights from the income statement. FX was a modest tailwind to revenue growth in the quarter as expected, with the U.S. dollar weaker against many key currencies, most significantly in Latin America with the strengthening of the Brazilian reais and the Mexican peso. Interest expense for the quarter was $33.1 million, down $2.4 million from the prior-year period, driven by the benefit of lower debt balances and lower LIBOR rates. We continue to expect interest expense to be between $130 and $135 million for the full year. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the third quarter was 13.5% as anticipated and in line with our expectation for a full-year tax rate between 13% and 14%. Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity, gross debt at quarter-end was $3.4 billion down roughly $400 million in the prior quarter. Gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 2.7 times at the end of the third quarter, while net debt to EBITDA was 2.5 times. Both metrics improved sequentially. Though still slightly above our targeted full-year average leverage levels, we expect to be at target leverage levels at year-end. Moving onto slide 9 in cash flow and cash deployment. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $300 million. Adjusted cash from operations was lower than the prior-year period, largely due to our decision to build inventory to help manage continued supply chain volatility, and to be prepared to fulfill strong demand in the fourth quarter and in early 2022.  Capital additions were somewhat higher as we continue to ramp up spending, following the deferral projects last year due to COVID. Nearly 50% of this year's capital addition support capacity expansion. Legacy and transformation spending was down substantially with the benefit of the completion of our SAP program and lower legacy spending. We are maintaining our expectation for free cash flow in a range of $480 million to $570 million with continued expectations for seasonally strong cash flow in the fourth quarter. We returned $262 million to shareholders in the quarter via $62 million in dividends and $200 million of share repurchases. Buying back 2.1 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $95.26 per share. We have now repurchased just over 3 million shares this year, reducing our share count by nearly 2.5% since the beginning of the year. Year-to-date, we have returned $486 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. For the full year, we continue to anticipate paying dividends of roughly $250 million and to repurchase $350 million to $450 million of FMC shares. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark. Mark Douglas : Turning to slide 10, I want to provide an early look at the key dynamics underpinning our planning process for next year. We view 2022 as another year with a good micro environment, obviously, notwithstanding the impact weather can have on any single quarter. We expect the soft commodity pricing momentum will carry into next year with global demand for crops remaining healthy. As a result, we are assuming the overall crop protection market will grow in the low to mid-single-digit range next year on a U.S. dollar basis. FMC's growth will be driven by broad-based volume gains across our portfolio, pricing actions reflective of cost increases, continued expansion of diamine volumes in existing and new markets and further penetration of new products Andrew Sandifer : and expansion of our market access in underserved geographies. We expect cost pressures this year will persist well into 2022 as the industry grapples with global supply demand imbalances, structural changes in China's industrial policy and energy supply, tight ocean freight capacity, and labor cost inflation. Taking all this into consideration, our current early thinking would suggest year-over-year revenue growth of 5% to 7%, EBITDA growth of 7% to 9%, and EPS growth at over 10%. In line with our long-range plan. We will share more detailed guidance for 2022 in our February call. To conclude our prepared remarks, the second half of the year is playing out as we forecasted. Mark Douglas : We executed very well in the quarter, not only from an external perspective in driving demand and pricing across all regions, but also importantly, internally by fulfilling that demand with products in a timely manner under challenging supply chain conditions. The only change in the second half is a timing shift of costs. And hence we're not changing our full-year guidance. The overall crop protection market fundamentals are positive and we remain confident in our ability to deliver our fourth quarter forecast. I'll now turn the call back to the Operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. And the first question will be from Christopher Parkinson, from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Christopher Parkinson : Great. Thank you. So, given all the challenges FMC and everybody else in the industry is facing, on both raw material, supply chains and now transportation logistics, here today, where we stand, can you just give us an update on the market -- as the market ads into 2022 regional price initiatives and how you're ultimately poised to combat these challenges. Thank you. Mark Douglas : Thanks, Chris. Look to unpack that. Christopher Parkinson : Sorry. Mark Douglas : When we look at the market today and some of the dynamics that we've outlined in studies as we look forward to 2022. Why don't I take a look at the cost elements first and just what are we seeing? I think from a raw material perspective, raw materials are still staying high. But more importantly, it's not just the cost here is the supply side that is causing. I would say the most sleepless nights as we go through the end of the year.  I think we're starting to see some of the very large commodities come back a little bit, such as propylene and ethylene, which we believe will help the pricing and packaging because we've seen tremendous accelerations in packaging costs. I don't think that's necessarily going to help with the supply side in terms of how long it takes to get packaging that has been a big problem for us on many other people this year. I think the specialty chemicals continue to be disrupted. We are obviously seeing much higher prices in that area, but we're also seeing continued disruptions out of China. Andrew Sandifer : A lot of people hear the latest news around the energy controls that we've seen in many of the major producing provinces. We don't see that going away particularly quickly. There are now diesel constraints in China related to the amount of fuel they have. So that's potentially going to constrict movement of goods within China that can -- that could cause us problems as we go into next year. And then I think the last one really is freight.  We continue to see tightness in ocean freight. I noticed a couple of the big ocean freight companies have released earnings and said, don't expect that to change as we go through mid-year, next year into the second half of year, next year, we would agree with that. We think ocean freight is going to remain tight and availability will be somewhat -- somewhat spotty.  So, I think the environment is pretty much what we expected with the exception of the potential for further disruption in China in Q1, as we go through Chinese New Year, as we go through the Winter Olympic shutdowns, we are planning for all of that, obviously. We've known about that for some time, but that doesn't mean to say there won't be disruptions. I think my view has changed from our August call where we talked about the potential softening of raw material prices and availability in the second half of the year. Mark Douglas : I'm somewhat less confident of that now given how we're seeing things develop, so I'm taking a little more of a conservative view on raw materials and cost and availability as we go through our planning process. What does that mean for us from a demand perspective? Well, as I said in the script, demand is good. No mistake, Ag is pretty robust around the world. Our growth was very consistent across all regions.  I think we'll see that continue next year. Soft commodity prices are robust, we see good demand for fruit and vegetables and specialty crops around the world, which frankly is the vast majority of our portfolio. On the pricing front, we have been much more aggressive in moving prices in the second half of the year that's starting to bear fruit now. I think you've got to remember that the agricultural industry is a specialty chemical industry in general, and we certainly -- we sell on value. This is not selling propylene or ethylene where prices move quickly. Now there are parts of the industry like the non-selective herbicides that do move quickly, they are tend to be more formulaic, more generic. We don't participate in those markets. However, having said that, we have put mid-single-digit price increases into many countries in the world. They have been accepted and the orders are flowing at the new levels. We will take a look in Q1 of pricing again, see where raw materials are and we will continue to move price in tandem to regain the cost impacts that we've seen over the last 12 months. So rather aligns to what was a long question, but hopefully you get the flavor of how we're thinking. Christopher Parkinson : I apologize, but I appreciate the color. Thank you very much. Operator : And the next question comes from Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joel Jackson : Hi, good morning. I'm just going to speak into -- I just want first clarification, Mark. When you -- I think I heard you say you expect 10% EPS growth in 2022 right now. EPS, for you guys usually doesn't include share buyback. So, is that using $6.79 midpoint for this year, excluding buybacks, you get in the second half of this year and buybacks next year to get the 10%?  And the other question I want to ask was following up on Chris's question, if you look into the first half of the year, even Q1, so you've had where you had a bit of margin expansion in the third quarter and your guiding to a little bit of margin expansion in the fourth quarter. So, would we expect -- you expect to have margin expansion also in Q1, in the first half of the year? Mark Douglas : Yeah. Joel, let me take the first one -- the second piece first, and then Andrew can answer the share account question. Yeah, listen, when you look at our margins, you are right, in the second half of the year we have started to improve the margins again, we've been on that track for the last three years. We do know that we're going to see higher raw material costs in the first half of next year. However, pricing is kicking in. And then don't forget, you've got the impact of the new products that we're bringing to market.  We are on the track to sell about $140 million of new product launches this year, from products launched this year. They tend to be at higher margins, so that takes to -- that starts to improve your margin. Q1 last -- this year was a low quarter for us. I would expect Q1 margins to look a little better than they did in Q1, 2020 and then continue that normal trajectory that we have of improving margins as we go through the rest of the year. Obviously, I'll caveat that with saying, whatever happens to raw materials and the pricing balance as we go through the year. Andrew, do you want to comment on the share count and the EPS? Andrew Sandifer : I think Joel's absolutely right. When we give indications of EPS growth, that does not include any benefit from share repurchases. We haven't yet have it completed. So, we're assuming and that look forward for next year of 10% EPS growth that's just reflecting aggressive EBITDA change in items between EBITDA and Net Income and the benefit of the share repurchases that we are doing in 2021. We've done 300 million to-date. Not all of which do you get that benefit in share count in the year that you do it.  That feathers in over time in the weighted average share count calculations. So again, that 10% EPS outlook for next year, and look, we're still working to budget is not firm, but we certainly know nothing is built into that assuming benefit of any additional share repurchases in '22 as is consistent with the way we've provided guidance in the past. Joel Jackson : Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Steve Byrne with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Steve Byrne : You guys thank you. Mark, can you talk through how you distribute your products in the distribution channels in Brazil? I ask because we understand there have been some changes in that channel. We have the formation on some big farmer buying groups. All of Syngenta selling through their own stores and some consolidation at the independent. So, is any of that making it more challenging to get price? And or is that comment you've made a quarter ago about going after volume over price, has that changed now? Mark Douglas : Yes, Steve, let me talk about Brazil and maybe I can tackle your very last comment there. What I actually said, and I think there was some confusion here, I said there were opportunities for us to take volume around the world with our high profitability products which we were doing. We were increasing prices then, and were not foregoing price for volumes. I just want to be perfectly clear. You can see that in Q3, you can certainly see it in Q4, and you'll see it next year.  Price is a very important mechanism of how we move against cost in FX, we continue to utilize that, but volume is also very important to us. In Brazil, taking the second piece on Brazil, there are three main channels to market in Brazil. First of all, there are the co-ops, which are very dominant in the south, very large farmer owned co-ops that service the marketplace. In the north, in the mid, you do have some co-ops, but you also have distribution and retail. So, you have large distribution and some locally-owned retail.  And then [Indiscernible] is direct to growers. That occurs really where you have very large mega growers, mainly in the matter [Indiscernible] area in by year, especially formulated around soy, corn, and cotton. So those 3 -- those are 3 pretty big defined channels. I think you're right in your assumption and your statement that there are changes occurring in the Brazilian distribution market. There is nothing that we would say would change the way we view the market. We actually sell through all 3 different groups, direct to grower, distribution/retail and through the co-ops.  We don't see that changing in certainly in the mid-term, given that the market is so large and there is so much fragmentation, especially through the distribution and retail channels that we don't see some of the changes out there impacting our ability either A, to grow the portfolio with the new products we're introducing, or B, to get price in Brazil. Steve Byrne : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead. John Roberts : Thanks, and nice quarter. It looks like you're expecting 4% price in the fourth quarter in prices accelerating upward, I think so. How do I square that with the 5% to 7%, 2022 revenue growth? Will revenue growth be primarily price in 2022? Mark Douglas : It will be a mixture, John. Obviously, you see where we are in terms of the mid-single digits. We do continue to see volume expansion as we go through next year. I think the 5 to 7 is a rough number today. As we said, once we get through all our analysis of where the volume flows out, we'll see where that sits. And then we will see what price ends up at the end of the fourth quarter and how that plays out for either a future price increases in Q1 and Q2 as we go through the year. But it's too early to make that delineation between what's exactly price, what's exactly volume, and exactly how much of the top line is going to grow 5 to 7. John Roberts : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Adam Samuelson, from Goldman Sachs. Please, go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mark, I was hoping that I'll come back to -- I think it came up in Steve's question from the comments on the second quarter call about maybe leaning into the volume growth on your higher-margin products. I think the comments were directed more around some emerging markets in Asia and India specifically.  And I guess, just -- can you give any thoughts or updates on how you think you're doing or success of that in terms of gaining or trying to get some new market share for some of those active ingredients. And I guess in that context, you listed a whole bunch of countries where you're putting in price actions, in the fourth quarter or they're already in place and maybe it was purposeful, maybe it wasn't but I didn't hear India on that list. And so just any kind of clarification or comments there. Mark Douglas : No, I think listen. I mean, when you have a 9% to 10% top-line growth, you're obviously doing something right in the marketplace, whether it's moving your price, and or gaining market share in certain parts of the world. I think both of those pieces play out. India has had a good quarter for us. We grew in India despite the fact, and I think I put this in the script, the monsoon was very spotty in India. There were some markets, particularly the soy market, was impacted by very dry weather.  We are moving prices all across Asia, including India. The specialty markets in India are very good for us. The diamine portfolio continues to grow well, taking share from some of the older chemistries out there that we talked about on the last call. And I would say Southeast Asia is also very strong in terms of how we're growing. And then last but not least in Asia, is Australia. Australia has been a very good market for us with the launch of our new Isoflex Herbicide, but also the VANTACOR insecticide the first launch was there in Australia as well.  So, price is pretty much across -- I only gave a couple of examples of countries, but we've moved price and are moving price pretty much in every country in the world as we move through the end of the third quarter into the fourth quarter. So, you should certainly see that benefit starting to play out as we move into early next year. Adam Samuelson : I -- I appreciate the [Indiscernible]. Thank you. Operator : And the next question will be from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Kevin Mccarthy : Good morning. Mark, I was wondering if you could speak to the cost shift from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. If I look in slide five, it appears as though costs came in $23 million lower than you had previously anticipated, and you'll have to back half unchanged. So, $81 million is the expectation apparently for 4Q. Maybe you just kind of help us understand what is going on there, and if the $81 million perhaps conservative given the experience in the third quarter? Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks, Kevin. It's a pretty simple move actually in terms of what we saw in costs. There's two main elements and I'll talk about them both high-level and Andrew, if you want to talk about one of the pieces. You can split it 50-50, essentially. We had some SG&A and R&D expense that we thought would fall in Q3 when we originally forecasted the second half of the year. And it didn't -- it's going to fall in Q4, so we're seeing about half that change really due to some R&D project work, as well as, some SG&A expense that we built with the Q3. And then the second half is really just how some costs have flown through our income statement. And Andrew, do you want to talk about that from just a pure procurement perspective? Andrew Sandifer : Sure. Look, I think as Mark said, its April\u2019s driver between SG R&D spending timing, as well as COGS increases. And it really is essentially a cost mix issue in terms of what sold and what came out of inventory this quarter versus what we had initially modeled when we gave guidance. So that costs we are seeing in our inventory and certainly in the step-up of inventory, you see year-on-year and sequentially on our balance sheet, you can see evidence of that higher costs are sitting in our inventory.  It just flows through the P&L a little more slowly than we had anticipated when we gave guidance. That $80 million headwind -- $81 million headwind for the second half still feels like the right number for us, There are these things that are being spent on R&D or around a lot of field trial investments, other things that are part of supporting our long-term development pipeline, SG&A spending will be a part of supporting the sales growth. And then the COGS again, it's sitting in inventory. It just hasn't flowed through yet through the P&L. So, with a strong volume growth in Q4, you'll see that. Kevin Mccarthy : Perfect. Thanks very much. Operator : And the next question will be from Vincent Andrews, from Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Maybe Mark, you could discuss or compare and contrast the South America and operating environment looks a lot healthier this year versus last year, just given the much better start to the planting season, which generally pretends to good news for the second crop and so forth. So, we also have higher coffee and sugar prices. So are you seeing better demand than maybe anticipated a few months ago when we didn't know how that was going to play out. And are you more optimistic about 1Q or sort of 4Q, 1Q as result? Mark Douglas : Yes, thanks, Vincent. Listen, Latin America, you're right. I mean, the planting season is underway. It's much better than it was last year. The rains came at the right time. Last year we had very dry drought weather which impacted the industry. This year we're not seeing any of that. I think on the back half as you just said, very good commodity prices and a lot of people concentrate on soy and corn. But you highlighted sugar is very high $0.19 is a good number for sugar. Coffee is high. More importantly for us, cotton is high as well. And if you remember, early in the year we talked about how we were thinking about the cotton business acreage declined in the '21 to '20 season by about 15%.  We're expecting and we're seeing that coming back as we said earlier in the year so the '22, '21 season will be very robust; price is high, demand coming back after COVID. So, all of that is very positive. I would say, don't focus just on Brazil. Argentina is also a very important market for us now. It is well in excess of $200 billion. I think it's our fourth largest country now in the world. We have a good portfolio on soy and cereals in Argentina. Denmark, it is also moving in the right direction better than it did last year. And then the rest of the region not to be missed for us is Mexico. Mexico is a very important country for our specialty products on specialty crops. We do a lot of business on corn, on fruit and vegetables. There is tremendous business for us on avocados, those types of high-value commodities. Mexico is growing well, season is going well there, the weather conditions have been good. So yes, I would say overall, Latin America feels much more robust than it did this time last year, and that's how we felt it would play out, and so far, so good. Operator : And the next question will come from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mike Sison : Hey, good morning, guys. Can you maybe talk about diamines heading into '22. Any -- what type of growth do you see; you got some new products there and then maybe how much of that growth could come from the new -- the licensing agreements that you've had set up over the last couple of years? Mark Douglas : Thanks, Mike. Yes, diamine, so we've talked in the past about our growth algorithm and how we're in the 9-high single-digits, low double-digits range, year-in-year-out. I would expect that type of number next year as well. We are seeing traction with all the agreements that we put in place. We're not going to split out on a regular basis. The -- what we selling to the partners versus what we sell ourselves. But periodically, we'll give an update on how that's playing out, but the growth is good. I think you highlighted 1 area which is the new formulations, the VANTACOR launch that we put in place.  This is a very, very novel formulation. It is much higher concentration. Therefore, it's easier to use. It's very easy to disperse in other mixers as growers use it. We've already seen tremendous traction in the 2 countries we've launched. There'll be more countries launched next year on VANTACOR. We expect that new formulation to cannibalize and grow the market for us. So, some of the old Rynaxypyr formulations will disappear, and VANTACOR will continue to take that business, but also grow the overall market share. And then there's some other things we have planned next year for product launches. So, diamines continue to be successful.  I think a lot of people who think about the diamine is focused on Rynaxypyr. We're also seeing a lot of growth on Cyazypyr. It was launched slightly behind Rynaxypyr. It has a slightly different mode-of-action. It covers a different crop spectrum. And we're now starting to see that product really move on the specialty crops. We're seeing a growth in -- seeing significant growth in Europe, parts of Asia, really the two markets we're focused on. So, we like the prospects for Cyazypyr. It's not to say that for Rynaxypyr doesn't continue to grow, it does and it will do. But I think Cyazypyr over the next couple of years will come into its own. Mike Sison : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And the next question will come from Mike Harrison from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Harrison : Hi, good morning. You noted that the North American business would have been up around 20% or more if we adjusted for the diamine partner sales. Can you talk about some of the underlying drivers in that North American business for the second half, if there's some inventory restocking going on from share gains, or are we really just lapping some of the disruption that we saw in the prior year. It seems like there are a lot of moving pieces and I was hoping you could help us parse those out. Thank you. Mark Douglas : Yes. Certainly, Mike. You won't really lap until we get through Q4. We did not have a good Q4 in North America last year, so really you will see that lapping occurring in Q4. Now, I think that -- listen, the real energy in our North American business is how we are changing the portfolio. You've heard us talk in the past a lot about our preemergent herbicides, the authority brands, which really were a bedrock of how we grow our North American business. Overall, our preemergent business, while still growing, is shrinking in terms of parts of the portfolio. Our business is actually accelerating because of the new products we're introducing. We introduced Lucento last year, which is a more specialty fungicide. We launched Xyway another fungicide for us. A new area, it's an in-ground fungicide for corn applications where we've never participated before. So that's a market that is a very large market. We have some very unique technology with Xyway. And in its first year, it far exceeded our expectations and we have big growth plans for 2022 season.  And then you have the insecticide launches, Elevest and Vantacor in the U.S., which are targeted more towards the specialty crops. So, the growth you're seeing in North America is nothing to do with restocking, etc. It is all to do with how the portfolio is shifting, a new products are accelerating our growth. So, we do feel very good about what we expect next year in North America. The market itself is robust, so as you're launching products into a robust market, you should get that good growth and we're seeing that now. Operator : Thank you. And the next question will be from Chris Kapsch from Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Chris Kapsch : Yeah. Good morning. Thank you. Just peeling back, the onion a bit more here and no pun intended, but on the challenges in and around the raw material and packaging sourcing, despite all the focus on these challenges across the broader industrial sector, and while you are certainly incurring higher costs, you guys were able to deliver pretty good, organic growth in 3Q and applied the implied organic growth for 4Q remains intact.  So, in other words your volumes don't seem to be -- have been constrained all that much despite the disruptions. So just wondering, is that a fair characterization? And also, just looking for more color here. Do you think you're simply doing better than the rest of the industry or does this reflect maybe a more -- your more balanced geographic footprint, whereas the challenges may have been more acute in North America? But just some more color on that, and then I had a follow-up. Mark Douglas : Yeah, listen up. I don't want to make it sound like it's easy because it is not. And every Company in this pace is going through the same things, we face similar disruptions. It maybe in different parts of the portfolio for different people. But I think we all have inherently the same fundamental issues that we're dealing with. Now, we do have a pretty good network around the world. Our reliance on China has dropped dramatically over the last 5 to 7 years. I think today we're at about 45% rely on, on all intermediates, fine chemicals, and active ingredients.  That's way, way lower than it used to be for the traditional FMC AG business when I joined way back in 2012. So, I think that's one aspect. We have lost sales over the last 6 months in terms of looking at the portfolio and where we couldn't deliver but I think with a strong portfolio, we did correct our inventories as we went through this year. We have built inventories, and Andrew can talk about the impact on working capital there.  But I think we've tended to weather it rather well, but make no mistake, I think we've left revenue out there that somebody else has probably picked up. It's not significant, it's in the 10's of millions of dollars, but it's still business that we could've had that we've missed. So, we're not immune to this by any means, and I expect that to continue as we go into next year. Andrew Sandifer : Sorry? Chris Kapsch : Now, the follow-up, and you touched upon this a little bit mentioning you're dependent on China being down the 45%. Seems like you've maybe gotten a head start on this -- maybe relative to the broader industry, based on some rolling blackouts years ago and then an active ingredient -- and active ingredient plant in China being adjacent to that explosion, maybe a couple of few years ago now. So just wondering on just your thinking on strategy for supply chain going forward, should we expect you will continue to diversify further? Just what is the thinking in that regard with respect to juxtapose against your strategic growth imperatives. Thanks. Mark Douglas : Yeah, listen, we've been on a strategy for the last at least 5 years, almost 6 years since we bought the Cheminova assets back in 2015, of really diversifying our supply chain and manufacturing footprint. That continues for the new molecules that we're adding capacity right now. We're adding capacity in Denmark, and in India. And we will continue to expand that active ingredient footwork through our own -- footprint through our own operations. We have active ingredient manufacturing in the U.S., in Puerto Rico, in Denmark, in India. 6 years ago, we never had pretty much any of that. So, we really have changed our strategy to be more diverse, to have more points of manufacture. We make sure that from a registration basis, which frankly it is the long pole in the tent here. It's getting your registrations. We do when we registered -- when we manufacture new products, we make sure we have two or sometimes three different sources of manufacturing point so that we have that ability to move our manufacturing around the world based upon our registrations. I'm not so sure we're any different to some of the people out there, there are some people who are more dependent on China, some people who are less. I feel good about where we are today.  I don't think you're ever going to get out of China, it's impossible. Just the size of the Chinese chemical industry in the specialty chemicals that come out of there, you will always be dependent on an intermediate or a fine chemical. The real issue for you strategically, and especially for us is how do you de -risk that to a point where you're more comfortable with it? And we're getting close to that. We're not quite there yet, the next couple of years we'll move it even further, but I think we're on the right track and certainly, it's being paying dividends for us. Chris Kapsch : Thanks for the color. Operator : The next question will come from Arun Viswanathan (ph) from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a nice quarter there. I guess the first question is just on COVID. Last year you had some impact, North American Logistics in Q4. I would imagine that potentially there had been some impact as well in Asia more recently. Could you verify if that's the case and then also maybe in Latin America, what you're experiencing as it relates to COVID down there. Thanks. Mark Douglas : Yeah. Thanks, Arun. Listen, there are 2 real impacts. 1, is your ability to supply and then 2, is what's happening on the demand side. On the supply side, look, I think we've got used to working in an emergency mode over the last 3 or 4 years. We've had -- somebody just said earlier, we had explosions in China that we've had to deal with, environmental policy changes in China, then we've got COVID and all the freight issues and manufacturing issues related to that.  I don't think there's been anything in the last 6-month period since we had our last call where anything's fundamentally changed from a supply perspective. It's not that there are non-issues out there, there are. The energy power issue in China is certainly causing disruption, and we'll see how that plays out once we get into the winter time.  From a demand perspective, we don't often talk about this, but I would say, certainly in the third quarter, maybe late in the second quarter. I would say the only part of the world where we saw demand issues was Southeast Asia. There was more lock-downs there in Vietnam, parts of Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, than any other part of the world so we did see --we did struggle getting into the marketplaces than we saw some demand destruction, not significant. Brazil, not an issue. Many of the growers are well-prepared for this growing season. They have a lot of personnel on-site. Vaccination rates are actually pretty high in Brazil and growing constantly. So, we feel better about Brazil from a COVID perspective, going into the '22 season than we did going into the '21 season. So yes, disruptions there. It's not significant at this point, I would say it's at the level where we've been dealing with it and we'll continue to deal with it. Arun Viswanathan : Okay. Thanks for that. And as a follow-up, maybe I can just ask about cash flow. So, as you move into '22, what are some of the buckets that you would envision, that could push that 525 or so, midpoint for free cash flow, but higher, is working capital, a potential leverage just given the cost inflation that you've experienced this year? Thanks. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks, Arun it's Andrew. Look, I think you're hitting on some of the conversations we're having right now as we're going through the budgeting process but some big strokes for you. Certainly, for free cash flow growth, '22 versus '21. First and foremost, is driven by growing the profitability of the business. So, EBITDA growth will be a big contributor. Working capital? Yes. Our long-term vision is to drive better working capital efficiency.  For 2022, we're going to have to balance that a bit with having a bit more safety stock in the system because of the level of volatility that we have in the supply chain right now. And you certainly see that on our Balance Sheet for -- where we ended up at September 30th of this quarter with a big increase year-on-year on inventory, which is both, as you noted, cost inflation. But also, some conscious choices to hold a little extra inventory in certain product lines where we've had some volatility in the supply chain. I would say at this point, we haven't worked through all the implications for 2022 of working capital yet.  But I think our long-term trajectory is, yes, to continue driving improvements in working capital to contribute to free cash flow growth. And if you look at the other 2 lines, the other 2 big buckets below that, on capital additions, I think we continue to have an expectation of somewhere about $150 to $200 million a year being the right pace, particularly with a significant portion of that going to capacity expansion to support new products, and as Mark described with our strategy to disperse our production base and have active ingredient manufacturer, in particular the new ingredients, outside of China. And then finally on the legacy and transformation, the transformation piece, we're basically done.  We finished our SAP implementation at the beginning of the -- the end of last year, final cleanup in the beginning of this year. There's no big transformation spending on the horizon. And there's no fundamental driver of growth in legacy spending. They'll -- certainly a year-to-year volatility and just timing and lumpiness about some of that spend but not fundamental growth. Those are the key elements. I think it's premature to give him any more extensive color on where free cash flow could be other than absolutely looking to continue to push growth of free cash flow and free cash conversion as we move forward with the business. Thanks. Operator : And the final question today will come from Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Michael Piken : Good morning. Just a question in terms of the buying behavior of your customers. Are you seeing a change in their attitudes towards wanting to procure more inventory and being a little bit less price-sensitive in this type of environment? And then secondarily, if you do have customers that are looking to make purchases, are you willing to extend more credit for them to get inventory in place or how are you handling if there are any timing shifts? Thanks. Mark Douglas : Listen, I don't think we're seeing a fundamental shift of how distribution retail or direct growers buy. I think there is an acknowledgment out there in the marketplace that in some cases for products that are absolutely needed. It's not just the price, it's availability. So, there's certainly a desire for people to make sure that as they enter their season, that they have material available. Doesn't mean to say that we FMC, we're not seeing a tremendous amount of what I would say forward buying in Q3.  All the growth was related to products that went on the ground in that quarter. So, think about full herbicide applications in Europe on cereals same thing in North America, insect pressure in North America early in the quarter was strong. So those types of things are what are driving the growth. It'll be interesting to see how the market evolves for the U.S. as we go into the buying season, which is effectively now getting ready for the season. I do think that recognition is strong that, some materials are not going to be available in the quantities that are needed.  And some people are going to miss out on that. So, price, in certain areas, is always important, but in others where it's high value and you absolutely need to protect those crops, then yes, I do see people buying to make sure that they've got product in that channel, in their warehouse when they needed. But we'll see how that develops through the fourth quarter into the first quarter. We may see similar behavior as we go into the European season, which really kicks off in Q1. Zack Zaki : Alright, thank you. Thank you for that Mark. That is all the time that we have for the call today. Thank you. And have a good day. Operator : And thank you. This concludes the FMC Corporation Conference Call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning everyone and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call for FMC Corporation. This event is being recorded and all participants are in a listen only mode. [Operator Instructions] At this time I'd like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Zack Zaki Director of Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Please go ahead. Zack Zaki : Thank you, Jamie and good morning everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Mark Douglas, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mark will review our fourth quarter performance as well as provide an outlook for full year 2022 and the first quarter of 2022. Andrew will provide an overview of select financial results. Following the prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our earnings release and today's slide presentation are available on our website and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call. Let me remind you that today's presentation and discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including but not limited to those factors identified in our earnings release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's understanding. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion and the supporting materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations, free cash flow, and organic revenue growth, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that as used in today's discussion, earnings means adjusted earnings and EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website. With that I will now turn the call over to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Zack and good morning everyone. Despite being one of the most challenging operating environments that we can remember FMC delivered strong financial performance in the quarter. As previously indicated, we set Q4 up to be a very strong quarter by taking deliberate actions earlier in the year. In Q4, we grew our revenue by 23%, EBITDA by 30%, and EPS by 52%. And importantly, expanded our EBITDA margins by approximately 150 basis points, while confronting continued cost pressures, supply disruptions, and emerging currency headwinds. North America and Latin America contributed significantly to our growth in the quarter. Not only regaining lost sales from the prior year period, but also driving above-market growth with volume and price. New product launches continued growth of our biologicals platform and strong pricing gains contributed to the expanded profitability in the quarter. Acreage increase in key geographies and robust soft commodity prices created a positive backdrop for games. Rising input costs, inconsistent raw material availability, increasing logistics expenses, long lead-times for ocean freight, labor cost inflation, and researching currency headwinds are some of the key challenges we faced in 2021 and we are prepared to navigate them again in 2022. Building on the positive sentiment in the ag market, we expect to drive growth this year through a combination of volume expansion and strong price increases across all regions. Turning to Q4 results on slide three. We reported $1.41 billion in fourth quarter revenue which reflects a 23% increase on a reported basis and 25% organic growth. This increase was driven by strong volume growth and pricing gains across all regions as well as double-digit revenue gains in the US, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, France, Russia, Germany, India, Australia, and Indonesia. Growth was broad-based across all of our product categories led by herbicides, insecticides in the plant health business both grew more than 15%. Adjusted company EBITDA was $377 million an increase of 30% compared to the prior year period. Company EBITDA margins were 26.7%, up approximately 150 basis points year-over-year despite steep headwinds in the quarter from cost inflation. This margin expansion was driven by mix improvement and strong pricing gains in all regions, especially North America and Latin America. Adjusted earnings were $2.16 per diluted share in the quarter, an increase of 52% versus Q4 2020. The year-over-year gain was primarily driven by an increase in EBITDA, while a lower than projected tax rate as well as share repurchases also contributed to the results. Moving now to slide 4. North America posted an all-time record quarter for the region with 80% revenue growth versus the fourth quarter of 2020. Adjusting for lost sales in the prior year period, the region still grew over 30% driven by strength in selective herbicides, higher prices, new product launches and continued market expansion of Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr. Our US business has made great progress in revitalizing its portfolio with more than 20% of the quarter sales coming from products that were launched in the last five years. Revenue in Latin America increased 30% year-over-year driven by volume and price increases. Growth in the region was led by strong performance in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. Brazil experienced robust market conditions with acreage increasing for several crops, especially, soy, cotton and corn. We grew our business in these key crops driven by Talisman and Hero Insecticides for stint mod control. We also saw strong growth in specialty crops mainly coffee and fruits and vegetables. And finally in Latin America, diamides, herbicides, fungicides and plant health each grew at least 25% or more in the quarter. In EMEA, our branded business grew 9% driven by diamide and herbicide volumes as well as price increases partially offset by the weakening of the euro. Growth was driven by our diamide brands such as Coragen for corn and top fruit applications as well as herbicides for use on cereals, potatoes and sugar beet. Overall, EMEA sales decreased 8% year-over-year and 7% organically due to the shift of diamide global partner sales in the quarter from EMEA to Asia. In Asia, revenue was down 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 primarily due to weather challenges in a number of countries most notably China. Australia grew more than 40% in the quarter driven by the continued momentum of our launches including Vantacor insect control based on Rynaxypyr and Overwatch Herbicide based on our Isoflex active. Agronomic conditions remain positive in the country and a strong start to the summer cropping season resulted in very good demand for our diamides for rice and cotton applications. India a key pillar of our Asia business delivered greater than 10% year-over-year revenue growth driven by demand for our portfolio in rice and pulses in the South and in sugarcane in the north. Turning to slide 5. EBITDA in the fourth quarter was up 30% driven by volume and price increases in all regions. Let me remind you that FMC's definition of the volume driver, includes quantity growth, mix improvement and the financial benefit from new launches. Volume was up $184 million in the quarter driven by selective herbicides in the US insecticides for fruit and vegetables in Mexico and insecticide sales for corn and soy applications in Brazil. Price is up $47 million with pricing actions in all regions. The biggest pricing gains were from the US and Latin American countries with mid single-digit increases. We expect similar pricing actions in other geographies as we approach the new seasons. Raw material, logistics and packaging costs remain elevated contributing to the $112 million in cost headwinds. FX was a $32 million negative factor in the quarter primarily in Latin America. Moving to full year results on slide 6. We reported $5.05 billion in revenue, which reflects a 9% increase on a reported basis and 8% organic growth. Approximately, $400 million in sales came from products launched in the last five years. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.324 billion an increase of 6% compared to 2020 even with over $180 million in cost headwinds. We continue to deliver industry-leading EBITDA margins of 26.2%. 2021 adjusted earnings was $6.93 per diluted share an increase of 12% versus 2020. This increase was driven primarily by the EBITDA increase as well as lower interest expense, improved tax rate and a lower share count offset partially by higher D&A. As Andrew will detail in his remarks we delivered record cash flow of $713 million in 2021 an increase of 31% over the prior year period. And our cash conversion of 80% for the year was also an all-time record. I have mentioned the excellent growth of our Plant Health business a number of times. So before moving on to 2021 and Q1 earnings outlook, let me quickly share more details on this business which includes FMC's biologicals platform. Moving to slide 7. FMC's Plant Health business is approximately $220 million of revenue today and consists of our biologicals' crop nutrition and seed treatment technologies. Biologicals can be used to improve nutrient uptake, while providing insect control, disease protection and improving yields. At the same time, these technologies generally have reduced residue and more favorable environmental profiles when compared to synthetic alternatives. These characteristics make the Plant Health business, an integral part of FMC's commitment to sustainable innovation. Regulatory pressures around the world, resistance management challenges, as well as evolving food chain requirements and some of the factors driving double-digit market growth for biologicals. FMC's Plant Health business has demonstrated margin accretive growth at approximately 1.5x to market over the last five years. We entered the biological space in 2013 with a small acquisition and a strategic alliance with Christian Hansen. In 2016, we established the headquarters for Planet Health at our European Innovation Center in Denmark and most recently entered into a collaboration with Novozymes to reset or develop and commercialize enzyme-based crop protection products. We've also made early investments in emerging technologies such as pheromones with Bio-Thera and peptides with MicroPet through FMC Ventures. We utilize a tenant business model for Plant Health with a dedicated R&D center in Copenhagen specialized contract manufacturers and an integrated downstream commercial organization that leverages our synthetic crop protection market access throughout the world. All four regions are actively growing the FMC biologicals portfolio with Asia and Latin America making up 2/3 of the current business. Our plant health business is targeting a goal of $500 million in sales by 2025, driven by our internal pipeline, external partnerships, as well as a strategic M&A. Moving to Slide 8 and FMC's growth outlook. We are projecting 7% top line growth in 2022 with gains across all four regions, leveraging the full breadth of our synthetic and biological portfolios as well as price increases. New product growth is anticipated to accelerate in 2022 with approximately $600 million in sales coming from products launched in the last five years. This would represent more than 11% of our total projected sales, as well as a 50% increase from the category versus 2021. Our North American business will drive the growth of recently launched products such as Zawar fungicide for corn and Vantacor insect control targeting an pests in a range of crops including soy, corn and cotton. Biologicals and other plant health products are expected to grow double digit due to new registrations. We currently announced in-season price increases in the US and expect pricing momentum to help offset cost headwinds. In Latin America, we expect growth across the whole region driven by a range of insecticides, including Diamides, as well as selective herbicides and biologicals. We anticipate acreage to remain supportive in our key crops of soy, corn, cotton, sugarcane, as well as specialty crops. Significant market expansion opportunities still exist for Colombia, Peru, Paraguay and other Latin American countries in which we remain underrepresented. Our Diamide product line is particularly suitable for specialty crops in these countries. Pricing will be a key lever in the region to help offset cost and FX headwinds. We are also launching Onsuva fungicide based on our Fluindapyr active in Argentina and Paraguay this year. Onsuva is an innovative broad spectrum fungicide targeting diseases in soy and peanut crops. Our Asia business is expected to grow across several countries driven by Diamides new products and biologicals. India will continue to be an important market for our Diamides as well as the broader portfolio, especially in sugarcane, rice and specialty crops such as pulses. Australia is expected to continue its growth trajectory with recent launches including Overwatch herbicide which targets annual ryegrass and select broadleaf weeds on cereals and canola and new registrations in Asia will drive double-digit growth for our plant health products. We expect to continue expanding market access in countries such as India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia. And FX volatility will be important to watch especially in India and Pakistan. Finally, the EMEA business is projecting volume growth across the region led by Spain, Germany, the UK and Middle East and African countries. Cyazypyr brands such as Benevia, Berrima and XRL will continue growing volumes on vegetables, top fruit, olives and citrus. The Mexico brands such as Coragen are projected to grow in cotton and corn. Herbicides including Spotlights Plus which is used for desiccation and potatoes are expected to grow in the UK and other countries in the region. Biologicals and other plant health products will also maintain their growth trajectory. In terms of new launches, we are introducing a herbicide for grass weed control in wheat and barley in new countries in the region. Registration losses will be a headwind similar to the magnitude of previous years. And FX volatility is projected to be a headwind with the Euro, Turkish Lira and other currencies weakening against the US dollar. Turning to slide nine and FMC's cost outlook. With respect to the cost of goods sold, we continue to see elevated costs across our supply chain. Higher input costs are driven by inflationary pressures, as well as the lack of availability. Logistics remain tight with ocean, air and ground transportation costs at elevated levels. Packaging costs also remain high and availability remains tight. However, we are seeing initial signs of price alleviation. Overall, we expect supply chain-related challenges to persist through 2022. We have better visibility into costs for the first half of the year and we'll have a clearer view of the second half once we move through the second quarter. Increased SG&A investments are anticipated to be driven by commercial expansion activities, especially in support of recently launched products and market access opportunities, as well as labor cost inflation. R&D spend will grow as we continue to advance our discovery and development pipelines. Overall, SG&A and R&D spend will be maintained in line with historical ratios and managed closely. Turning to slide 10 and the review of our full year 2022 and Q1 financial outlook. We expect full year revenue in the range of $5.25 billion to $5.55 billion, representing 7% growth at the midpoint compared to 2021. Adjusted EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $1.32 billion to $1.48 billion, reflecting 6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect adjusted earnings of $6.80 to $8.10 per diluted share, representing an 8% increase at the midpoint. This assumes a share count of approximately 127 million and does not factor in the benefit of any potential share repurchases in the year. Looking at the first quarter, we forecast revenue to be in the range of $1.22 billion to $1.34 billion, representing 7% growth at the midpoint compared to first quarter 2021. Adjusted EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million, representing a 6% increase at the midpoint versus the prior year period. We expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.90, representing an increase of 11% at the midpoint versus Q1 2021 and assuming a share count of approximately 127 million. Moving to slide 7. I want to highlight some of the potential factors that could drive our results to either end of the guidance range. For the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA guidance, we are assuming input costs remain elevated and any further inflation is mitigated. If cost inflation becomes more severe and cannot be mitigated through further price increases or internal efficiencies in the calendar year, our results would trend towards the lower end of the guidance. Alternatively, realizing mid to high single-digit price increases and/or easing of FX headwinds would drive our results towards the high end of the range. Weather events and supply disruptions are variables, which would also influence the final outcome. Turning to slide 12 and full year revenue and EBITDA drivers. Again in 2022, strong volume expansion and price increases across all regions will drive revenue growth. FX volatility is expected to be a negative factor in our outlook. Our EBITDA guidance reflects the benefits of high incremental margin volumes and price increases, partially offset by cost and FX headwinds. Moving to slide 13 and the Q1 drivers. On the revenue line, volume growth is expected to continue, especially in North America and Latin America, where momentum is strong. As noted earlier, we've already announced in-season price increases in the US. Price increases in all regions will be an important driver for the quarter. We're anticipating FX headwinds principally from European currencies. Regarding EBITDA drivers, long supply chains in the ag chem industry, provide us some visibility into costs. And so far inflationary pressures have not subsided and remain at elevated levels. The higher costs driven by raw materials that we saw in the second half of 2021 will continue in the quarter, as well as growing FX headwinds that will partially offset the EBITDA benefit from high-margin volumes and price increases. Overall, we are forecasting year-over-year EBITDA growth of 6% in the quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks, Mark. Let me start this morning with a review of some key income statement items. FX was an unexpected headwind to revenue growth in the fourth quarter, principally driven by late quarter volatility in the Brazilian real and to a lesser extent by the euro. For full year 2021, FX remained a modest tailwind overall with the late year currency volatility more than offset by tailwinds in major European and Asian currencies. Looking ahead to 2022, we see increasing FX headwinds. A significant shift in our expectations as compared to the initial outlook for 2022, we provided on the November call. For the first quarter of 2022, the headwinds are primarily in Europe, driven by the euro and the Turkish lira. For full year 2022, we anticipate broad-based FX headwinds, as the US dollar is now expected to appreciate against nearly all currencies of importance to FMC. Interest expense for the fourth quarter was $33 million, down $1.2 million versus the prior year period. Interest expense for full year 2021 was $131.1 million, down $20.1 million versus the prior year, due to lower US interest rates and lower foreign debt balances. In 2022, we expect full year interest expense to be in the range of $115 million to $135 million, with higher short-term interest rates in the US, offset by the benefits of the refinancing completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for full year 2021 was better than anticipated at 12.7%, driven by a more favorable mix of earnings in the fourth quarter across our principal operating companies. The fourth quarter effective tax rate of 10.8% reflects the true-up to the full year rate relative to the 13.5% rate accrued through the third quarter. For 2022, we estimate that our tax rate should be in the range of 13% to 15% with the increase driven by certain provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that are effective beginning in 2022. Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity. Gross debt at year-end was $3.2 billion, down roughly $200 million from the prior quarter. Gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 2.4 times at year-end while net debt-to-EBITDA was 2.0 times. Both metrics are below our targeted full year average leverage levels, as intended given our higher leverage earlier in the year. We expect to maintain full year average leverage in our targeted 2.4 times to 2.5 times gross or 2.3 times to 2.4 times net ranges in 2022. As I briefly mentioned a moment ago, we refinanced the $700 million outstanding balance on our 2017 term loan as well as $300 million in senior notes that matured this month, with a new $1 billion term loan in November. The new term loan has improved pricing which will reduce our interest expense by approximately $8 million in 2022 compared to 2021. We continue to believe pre-payable debt like the new term loan provides valuable flexibility in our capital structure. Moving on to cash flow on Slide 14. FMC delivered record free cash flow of $713 million in 2021, up more than 30% versus the prior year. Adjusted cash from operations was up more than $100 million compared to the prior year. Significant improvement in working capital and higher EBITDA were only partially offset by growth in cash used by non-working capital items. Receivables net of rebates, vendor financing and advanced payments was the primary driver of improved working capital, supported by improved accounts payable. I note that advanced payments from customers were very strong in North America, as were collections around the world in the fourth quarter. Higher inventories were a headwind to operating cash flow, driven by our choice to build inventory to help manage continued supply chain volatility and if you prepare to fulfill strong demand in early 2022, as well as reflecting higher input costs. Capital additions and other investing activities of $114 million were up $26 million compared with the prior year as we continue to ramp up spending following deferral of products in 2020 and to support continued growth. Capital additions came in meaningfully lower than anticipated, as we were unable to spend at our targeted levels in the fourth quarter, due to changes in project timing and in the availability of materials and contractors. Legacy and transformation spending was down substantially, due entirely to the completion of our SAP program. Overall, free cash flow conversion from adjusted earnings was 80%, an all-time high for FMC. This strong cash flow supported equally strong cash return to shareholders of nearly $650 million in 2021. We repurchased 3.95 million shares in 2021, over 3% of shares outstanding at the beginning of the year, at an average price of $101.14. We also paid $247 million in dividends. Looking ahead now to free cash flow for 2022 on slide 15, we are forecasting free cash flow of $115 million to $735 million in 2021, a range reflecting not only the range of potential EBITDA outcomes Mark discussed earlier, but also uncertainty around a few critical assumptions. Underlying this forecast is our expectation of adjusted cash from operations of $750 million to $910 million, flat to 2021 at the high end of the range. Growth in working capital is anticipated to more than offset EBITDA growth with a modest tailwind from non-working capital items. Working capital growth reflects our current expectations of a return to more normal advanced payment levels in North America, among other factors negatively impacting net receivables in 2022. We expect to further continue to ramp up capital additions as we expand capacity to meet growing demand, especially for our new products that are seeing rapid gains. Legacy and transformation, however, is expected to be a tailwind with somewhat lower legacy spending and essentially no transformation expense expected in 2022. With this guidance we anticipate free cash flow conversion of 66% at the midpoint. To put our 2022 free cash flow guidance in perspective, let's move forward to slide 16. The left side of this slide shows free cash flow trends since 2018. As you can see, FMC has made tremendous progress in both the absolute dollars of free cash flow generated as well as the conversion of earnings to cash flow. And as we've said before, the definition of free cash flow we use is very comprehensive. It's essentially the cash that is left to pay dividends, buyback stock or make inorganic growth investments. As such, there are a number of factors in cash flow from year-to-year. The crop protection industry is working capital-intensive. So year-to-year swings in working capital drivers like advanced payments can move our cash flow from one year to the next. Additionally, other cash items like taxes, environmental payments, et cetera can be lumpy. So as we get to a more sustained level of cash conversion we believe it's important to look at trends over several years rather than focus exclusively on a single year's results. If you look at the three-year rolling average trend for cash conversion, you can see FMC's performance has stepped up nicely and is maintained at above our targeted 70% through 2022 at the midpoint of our guidance. As discussed, there are some specific drivers that could depress free cash flow conversion somewhat in 2022. But we fully expect free cash flow conversion to be above 70% in 2023 and that we should sustain 70% to 80% free cash conversion on a rolling three-year basis over the long-term. Equally as important is improving our free cash flow is the discipline with which we deploy cash. The chart on the right side of this slide, show our cash deployment for 2019 through 2021, with essentially 100% of our free cash flow having been returned to shareholders through dividends and buyback. As you saw in our earnings release last night, FMC's Board of Directors has authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, confirming confidence in our ability to sustainably generate strong cash flow in 2022 and beyond and reiterating our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders. In 2022, we anticipate continuing to strongly reward shareholders with dividends of around $270 million and share repurchases of $500 million to $600 million, a return of more than 100% of our free cash flow in the year at the midpoint of our guidance range. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thanks Andrew. FMC's performance in 2021 was the result of strong volume and pricing gains as well as overall favorable market backdrop. Our operations and procurement teams worked hard to overcome persistent supply chain and logistics challenges that continue to disrupt the global economy. We expect 2022 will be another year of volatility. From a cost standpoint, second half input costs are somewhat unclear at this time. We are closely monitoring any potential COVID-related impacts particularly in China as well as potential logistics issues around the world. However, it's important to recognize that these 2022 challenges are set against the backdrop of solid agricultural market fundamentals and strong demand for our industry-leading products and technologies. We remain confident in our 2022 guidance and another year of healthy growth, driven by pricing new and recently launched products from our synthetic and biological portfolios, appropriate cost controls and continued investments to expand market access and broaden our technology platforms. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Thank you. Operator : Yeah. And ladies and gentlemen, at this time we\u2019ll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Laurent Favre from BNPP. Please go ahead with your question. Laurent Favre : Yes. Good morning all. Compared to the early look three months ago, it looks like your view on fundamentals is slightly more positive but the view on the supply chain offsets that and then you have currency on top to bring the overall number down. Is that the right interpretation? Have you seen anything on the ground that would limit your ability to have further pricing if you had further incremental inflation? Thank you. Mark Douglas : Yeah. Thanks Laurent, Fundamentally, no, nothing more broad-based than FX has changed since we communicated in early November. If you think about the markets themselves, the markets are pretty healthy. Soft commodity prices are high. You've got soybeans in the 15 range. You've got corn at six-plus, cotton is high, sugar is high. So the backdrop is generally positive. The only change we see is really FX. And that is something that occurred late in the quarter and our latest view is, obviously, to be a headwind as we go through this year. The rest of the projections that we have whether it be volume growth or pricing trends are pretty robust. I mean, the way we're thinking about our model for this year is that our pricing increases will more than offset our cost increases through the year and that our volume increases will more than offset any FX, as well as investments in SG&A and R&D and that's how we get to the midpoint where we are. But Lauren really the only thing is FX that\u2019s different. Andrew, do you want to comment on FX at all? Andrew Sandifer : Sure. I think look as mentioned in the prepared comments, it really was a spike towards the end of the quarter and the BRL. And just adjusted expectations when we looked at like everyone else the third-party sources on forward-looking expectations for currencies where we are seeing anticipated weakening of number of currencies against the US dollar, particularly BRL, RMB, euro and Indian Rupee, which are probably the four most impactful currencies for FMC. So certainly like all these things this could change during the year. But based on what our forward curves are right now and our expectations, we do expect a meaningful headwind from FX in 2022. Laurent Favre : Thank you. And if I can have a follow-up on Plant Health. It looks like you've got a pretty bullish 2025 target of more than doubling sales in four years. How much of that target relies on M&A as opposed to market growth and product launches? Mark Douglas : Yeah. There is some M&A anticipated in that $500 million from where we are today in 2021 at 220 [ph]. But I have to say when we talk about double-digit growth, we're talking about significant double-digit growth. We've introduced a lot of products around the world over the last few years. Our biological pipeline is robust. I think we have four or five brand new products coming out of that pipeline. So the market I would say is very open to biologicals much different than it was five, seven years ago when we first started this journey. When I think about traveling around the world and talking to growers, we mentioned that Asia and Latin America in particular Brazil and Mexico are perhaps the leaders in terms of adoption of biological and crop nutrients. We see that on the ground. I go to many customers, obviously, not over the recent times. But we get a lot of questions about what biologicals are coming? How can I use them? How are they different? How do they help resistance? How do they help me as I think about selling products into the food chain? Those are all aspects that are driving that biological platform. So I actually think the $500 million is well within reach when I look at the underlying fundamental organic growth. Now, of course, along with that comes investments and we are investing at a higher rate in terms of R&D for this business than we are for our synthetic businesses, mainly because the cost is high but the revenue is building. But also more importantly from what I would call an educational aspect, we have to educate people -- our people how to sell these products. We have to educate growers how to use them. They're different but they definitely have a place in this market. And we see them as being expansions to our portfolio, not necessarily cannibalistic in terms of taking our business away from our own synthetics. Laurent Favre : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Adam Samuelson : Hi. Thanks, good morning, everyone. Mark Douglas : Good morning. Adam Samuelson : So, I guess my first question just thinking about kind of the underlying kind of market outlook and you gave kind of a framing that market outlook hasn't fundamentally changed at least on the volume side from where you would have been a few months ago. I guess, I'm just trying to think about where you think channel inventories kind of ended the year and the headwind tailwind that that might present to the volume opportunity. Certainly, seems like a pretty constructive crop price and farm income environment. Certainly, good momentum on the new product side that seems to be accelerating. And so I guess, I'm just trying to calibrate, if we should -- the scope for volume upside over the course of the year? And if so where do you think kind of, which regions kind of would be outperforming and underperforming at the corporate level? Mark Douglas : Yes. I mean listen from a volume perspective, I mean you look at the last quarter, we grew volume over 20%. So I mean there's obviously -- there's very strong demand out there. Thinking about your comments, there's a lot wrapped up in what you asked. I think from a market demand perspective, it's very strong all over the world. I mean when I think about channel inventories today, frankly, I have very few concerns from where I sit at FMC.  There are pockets in India, following the spotty monsoon that we had last year but they're not significant. Brazil, we have -- from FMC's perspective, we got absolutely zero concern, from North America and probably the other way around when it comes to channel inventories. I'm more concerned that there is not enough material there. Europe, not really a problem at all. So channel inventories frankly, in our own internal conversations has not really come up much in the last quarter. Demand has come up. Demand is very, very strong. We certainly -- we believe we missed sales in the quarter. I can't quantify it. But I would also say, we picked up sales as well through people who also had problems. So it's a very, very dynamic market. But when you have a backdrop of such high soft commodity prices obviously, there is scarcity in some key raw materials and intermediates. I think that creates a solid demand for the market and we've seen that and we've taken advantage of it where we can. And when we think about a 7% top line growth that's going to be probably double where the market is in 2022. So we feel very good about the growth that we have and it's broad-based. It's pretty much coming from every region. It's coming from the herbicide portfolio, our fungicide portfolio in the US is growing, with our new addition of Xyway, which is a really good brand new systemic fungicide for corn applications. So overall, very robust. The pipeline is working well. The investments are there. It's a good scenario for FMC going forward. Adam Samuelson : That's really helpful color. And if I could just follow-on I'm just thinking about pricing. Is there any -- you obviously put in some pricing in North America most notably, Latin America. Is there any product or region where pricing might be a bit more challenging to achieve? Are you seeing any areas where there's a bit more -- less market receptiveness to pricing actions? Mark Douglas : Not overall Adam, we've moved pricing in all regions. We've moved pricing on an as-needed basis and that's very, very different to traditionally, how this market moves. When we talk about in-season pricing, we're doing that in different parts of the world. We highlighted the US but it's not just the US. So you will -- you should expect us to see, us move price as we go through the year, as needed, as we get more clarity on the raw material position and availability. I don't think there's anywhere in the world where we're not moving pricing obviously, there's different degrees given the portfolio and the value that you bring. But quite frankly, there's not a lot of choice here. The price increases that we receive from our suppliers and from intermediates you can see the impact of costs in the fourth quarter and in 2021. They're significant and they have to be remediated. So I think, we certainly have the desire to move price and we are all over the world. Adam Samuelson : That's really helpful color. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you, you. Operator : And our next question comes from Chris Parkinson from Mizuho. Please go ahead with your question. Chris Parkinson : Thank you very much. Mark you sound pretty good this morning. I just want to ask a pretty simple question. I mean what's with the width of the guidance range particularly reconciling some of the constructive global commentary the outlook as well as your scenario analysis on page 11 of the PowerPoint? Mark Douglas : Yes. Thank Chris. I'm glad it sounds good. Actually after the quarter that we have, we should sound good. Listen the range is wide for a reason. I've been in the chemical industry for 35 years and I have never seen an operating environment like this. It's not as if it's one pocket of a raw material. It is across the board whether it's commodities whether it's specialties whether it's fine chemicals it is logistics challenges. They're all there all together. Obviously, when we look at the world, we start to think about what could the ultimate upside be and what could the ultimate downside be? It does not mean that on that slide that we think 1,320 at the bottom end of that range is something that we're planning for. We're absolutely not. We're planning for 1,400 and we're planning to deliver more than 1,400 if we can. Now, some things will have to go our way. We'll have to achieve more pricing the volume side will have to accelerate. FX will perhaps moderate. But those are the types of decisions we make. So, people shouldn't be surprised that we've put out a wide range. I mean you can look at some companies in our space and in the general chemical space. They haven't even guided. That tells you the challenge out there for companies like ourselves where we're very broad-based in terms of what we buy and what we move around the world. Don't read into that broad range that we have concerns that the 1,400 is not achievable. That's the number we're aiming for. That's what the organization is built to deliver. Chris Parkinson : All right. So, you're telling me Pierre had it easy. Fair enough. Real quick 2022 when you're breaking everything down and you had some great commentary on new products the biological portfolio even some stuff on the diamides. When I look at that 7% and think about the midpoint in terms of the incremental year-on-year absolute dollar contributions, can you just give us some additional color on the diamides as well as the new product penetration as well as some of the launches some of those things that are kind of rolling out of your the R&D portfolio? So, just how should we be thinking about that growth contribution from FMC-specific sources versus your presumption of natural market contributions? Thank you. Mark Douglas : Yes. So, I think we commented in the script that products launched in the last five years will contribute $600 million of revenue in the year. That's versus $400 million in 2021. So, you can see that acceleration of the portfolio. I think what is most pleasing for us is we see the diamides continuing to grow in that mid to high single-digits depending on the year, that keeps rolling through. We see that year in year out since we acquired the products. I think what's most important for listeners is the rest of the portfolio and the new products that we're bringing in are also growing in that mid to high single-digit number. So, you can see that the portfolio is getting more balanced. When I think of products that we launched in 2021 within 2021 I think it was about $120 million of revenue in the year. So, that's very healthy. This year is somewhat less than that just because of the mix of types of products we're introducing. I think we're in the $50 million to $100 million range, but again very healthy. So, you should expect to see that number continue to climb. Especially as we go through the 2023-2024 period, we have some big active ingredients that start to get launched then. You will see that number accelerate as we go through the end of the decade. And if you remember, we've talked about the development pipeline delivering something north of $2 billion by 2030 of new sales, that's still very much on track for us. Chris Parkinson : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. Could you just give a little more color on what your FX assumptions are at the midpoint for the first quarter and the full year? And if you just want to tell us what you think the headwind is or what rates you're assuming? And I recall that you generally have some at least modest amount of hedging going on to try to smooth things out. But if you could just give us some guideposts so that as we can as the year progresses and the rates move around we have a better sense of whether it's trending for or against you. Andrew Sandifer : Yes. Vince it's Andrew. I would say this in the first quarter, it's really European currencies that are challenged. The euro is the largest headwind and the Turkish lira volatility not a huge -- Turkey not a huge country for us, but the magnitude of the movements have been pretty substantial. And to your point, we do systematically hedge currencies. We don't hedge 100% that's not economic. So obviously, there's a portion of it that's 100% exposed. And it does depend a bit on how far things move. Not really an anchor I can give you on rates. I would just say, look at the year-on-year comparisons for rates is at least giving you an indication of the relative impact to us, if currencies were to improve in our favor during the year. But I think as we look for the full year horizon, certainly all of the forecast and forward curves we see a generalized strengthening of the US dollar. Q1 again is much more of a European currency issue. But as you get through the full year, we're looking at all of the major currencies that we -- that are important to FMC really showing some headwinds. It is -- obviously, it's just the beginning of February. We'll see how the rest of the year plays out. But from a reference point, I would just look at the year-on-year change that will give you the best record for the rate that will give you the best ability to gauge what might be an improvement for FMC. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And then I think Mark, you mentioned on the supply side one of the risks would be China and obviously with the zero COVID policy there they've so far largely managed to avoid Omicron. But can you remind us, how much exposure you have to Chinese suppliers on the raw material side of the equation and sort of what flexibility you have in place, if they do have a disruption? Mark Douglas : Yeah. So we've talked about this in the past. If you think about going back past 2015, we were probably 95% dependent on China. We had a strategy that was linked to China low cost for manufacturing. Obviously, through the acquisitions we've made over the last seven years, we've become a very different company in terms of manufacturing our own active ingredients and reliance on China. I would say today, we're probably in the 40% range in terms of dependency on China. Not unusual for a company our size. It's very difficult to totally remove China from the equation and you simply wouldn't want to do that anyway. There is a balance that you often need. We spent a lot of time over the last few years reregistering products around the world so that we have two or three sources of manufacturing. Whether it be India, parts of Europe or even parts of Central America now with Mexico thinking about manufacturing there. So we're much more balanced in terms of our sourcing of manufacturing. I think the whole lockdown process in China is something we're watching very, very closely, mainly because it can be extremely short-term disruptive i.e. from one day to the next it can impact you. So having that balanced network has allowed us to serve our customers very well over the last I would say 18 months. Vincent Andrews : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead with your question. Steve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. Mark, you mentioned you thought inventory levels in the US were low, but you had really strong sales. I was just wondering whether the shortness of glyphosate in the last couple of quarters might have pulled some sales from the first quarter into the fourth. Was there any of that just almost with the channel being almost hysterical about not having access to products. Was there any of that going on? And can you comment about your pre-emergent platform in the light of concerns out there about whether or not diamide might be available for use over the top. Is that beneficial to you? Mark Douglas : Yeah. I think -- well, listen I mean, I would say the following. If you look at our growth numbers in projected in Q1, we're at that 7% range. That's a very healthy number. I would say customers, whether it's distribution or retail around the world in the US, obviously people are concerned with supply. I mean there's no way you wouldn't be in this industry and not be concerned with it. But frankly speaking, as we went through the quarter, at the end of the day, we will focus on both Q4, Q1, Q2, Q3. So you're getting ready for a season as you think about it, the volume is there. I don't think it's excessive at this point, certainly not in North America. We have seen changes in terms of our pre-emergent portfolio. We do have some of the leading products in the marketplace in terms of efficacy for glyphosate or dicamba resistance. I do think, we've picked up some business there. But it's actually, it's not just that type of herbicide that we've seen. We've seen other herbicides around the world start to pick up, because of that glyphosate shortage or glyphosate price increase. I'm not suggesting that, it's going to fundamentally alter the profile of FMC, but it is a nice business to pick up as the pressure is on those types of products for cost increases. But to the broader question, look at our growth in 2022. We're at 7% that doesn't suggest to me that there's been a lot of what you call pull forward. We don't see it to that degree at this point. The business is very robust. Steve Byrne : Thank you. You mentioned the need to educate growers and I'm sure that is a challenge for a new mode of action or even a concept like a biologic. Is there anything that you're doing that has helped you accelerate growth of new products, where it's not just educating they have to try it. Do you need to put out lots of field trials? Do you have to give growers a couple of years of free access just to try this new stuff anything that's particularly effective for you on this? Mark Douglas : Yeah. I think, listen you raised a very good point, Steve. I mean, we have 24 different research stations around the world, and the biologicals are consuming a significant amount of trial time. We do take growers to the farms around the world. We're also spending more on social media in terms of allowing growers live access to those trials, so that, they can see without traveling. I think that's been a major boon for us in helping people understand, look, these products do work. They do work under extreme conditions. They do improve yield and productivity. I would say, the social media aspect of communication for our agronomists and our technical sales force has certainly helped. And you're right. We've been trialing these products for many years. People want to see two, three years of data, before they'll start to try them on their farms. And we're coming through some of that early work now and we're starting to see the benefits with that high double-digit growth. Steve Byrne : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi Research. Please go ahead with your question. Patrick Cunningham : This is Patrick Cunningham on for P.J. Good morning everyone. In the \u2013 we've talked a lot about biologicals, but in the presentation I noticed a reference to Precision Ag. Do you kind of have an update on where you guys are at with that? I know, you had your mobile farm intelligence platform. I mean, are there any other investments you're looking to make? Which parts of the value chain do you hope to play in Precision Ag? Thanks. Mark Douglas : Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. Yes our Arc farm intelligence is gathering a lot of steam. Last year was particularly good for us in terms of how we launched in many countries. We're in 21 different countries now. I think we have 13 different spectrums that we forecast for growers. That is \u2013 it is a growth platform for us. We are the world's leader of insecticides. So this is a steep growth for us. We will continue to roll out farm Arc intelligence around the world for a myriad of crops lots of specialty crops, but also now starting to look at some of the bigger row crops especially in Latin America. Through our Ventures group, we are actually investing in other areas of interest to us, whether its drone applications whether it's automated spraying or CN spray type applications. So FMC Ventures is becoming a very important platform for linking not only to R&D, but linking to the Precision Ag. We have also \u2013 when we think about our own portfolio, we have a very unique system that's patented called 3RIVE 3D, which is an in-ground application, reduces the amount of water used significantly. It's doing very, very well in the US, mainly for corn applications, but we're now looking to take that to Latin America in particular Brazil and Argentina. I would say, the fundamental premise that we have for Precision Agriculture is whatever you do, it has to meet an unmet need of the grower. If the grower doesn't have that need, it doesn't matter what your technology is or how it looks on an application, the grower will not use it. And I think being focused like we are without trying to be all things really has an advantage for us and linking that to our portfolio of new technologies really works. Patrick Cunningham : Great. Thank you. Mark Douglas : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. Joel Jackson : Hi. Good morning. If we go back to slide 11 in the sensitivity analysis of bull and the bear and the base cases, do you think it's fair -- like how would you view the percentages of the bull versus the bear case. And the reason I ask is it seems like the bear case would be a very difficult situation to occur. When the market shrinks, you've got very limited price increases and huge inflation that you can't catch up price. So that would seem to be a very difficult case. Like is it fair that the bull case seems more likely in the bear case? Mark Douglas : Yes, it's a good question, Joel and we debated this slide a lot before we put it out there. I think it is a good slide to put things into context. I do agree with you. I mean to be at the bottom end of that downside, the world has to basically collapse on you. I do think there are opportunities in pricing. I do -- offsetting that though as I said costs are unsure going into the second half. So we'll see how that plays out. As Andrew said, FX is volatile today. It might stabilize it might not. We'll see. I'm hesitant to go above the midpoint. The midpoint is there for a reason. It is the highest probability we see at this point. But I take your view that the upside it could happen, it's probably more likely than the downside let's say that way. That's about as far as I'm prepared to go. Joel Jackson : Okay. Thank you for that. And then on slide 12, I don't know what we call the Chevron of the arrows just showing the drivers being mixed volume price currency on 2022. 7% revenue growth so price mid single-digit you're showing the Chevron of the arrows being larger for volume mix and launches versus price or being similar if you net of FX. But that would seem to then lead to better than 7% revenue growth. So can you help me understand covering the Chevron there? Mark Douglas : Yes. Yes. Okay. I will do. Listen let me give you how we think of it today forget the Chevrons, just think of it this way. You've got sort of low to mid-single market growth think of it that way. You've got mid single-digit price. You've got a volume growth that's probably slightly above the mid single. You've got FX which is a negative coming out you are a low single-digit. You've got low single-digit rationalization probably in the 1% to 2% range is pretty normal for us. And then you've got some price that's already built into that market growth. Remember that they're not two separate things which will go against you gets you into that -- the market growing in that low to mid single-digits and is growing at 7%. That's how we think about it today. Joel Jackson : Thank you. Mark Douglas : Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Please go ahead with your question. Frank Mitsch : Good morning, folks. Mark you did a nice job of outlining how FMC will be outpacing the industry. I was just wondering if we might be able to level set? And if you could offer I guess on slide 8 the -- your outlook for the industry overall in 2022 in terms of industry growth in each region? Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks, Frank. Generally speaking I think we're a little lower than we were in November when we talked about sort of mid single-digit. We're probably in the low to mid single-digit. Now the only reason for that is how we're viewing FX because we think of the market on a dollar basis obviously FX around the world impacts us. When I think about the regions I would say the regions that I see with the most growth are likely to be North America with a mid single-digit growth. I also think Asia will be good sort of in that mid single area. And then I would say just thinking about Europe probably low single-digit mainly because of the FX impact there. And then Latin America, sort of, low to mid single-digits. That's how we sort of view the world today. Frank Mitsch : Fantastic. And speaking of Europe in terms of your own business you flagged some registration losses that obviously continue. I was wondering if you might be able to discuss the expected year-over-year impact in terms of the products coming off registration and being discontinued 2022 versus 2021? Andrew Sandifer : Yes. It's just slightly over 1%, Frank. Frank Mitsch : Terrific. Thanks so much. Andrew Sandifer : Yes. It's mainly Europe and a little bit of Latin America. Frank Mitsch : Great. Thank you. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks, Frank. Zack Zaki : All right. Jamie. Operator : And our next question. Zack Zaki : Jamie, we're going to cut off the questions. We're out of time. Thank you very much. That's all the time that we have for the call today. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today's FMC Corporation Conference Call. We thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.",

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you Zack, and good morning everyone. Before I move into details on our results, I\u2019d like to take a moment to provide an update on FMC\u2019s position related to the war in Ukraine. In mid-April, we announced the decision to discontinue our operations in Russia and exit the country completely, making FMC the first crop input provider to exit Russia. We could not ignore increasing reports of potential war crimes, human rights abuses and other atrocities committed in Ukraine. Our values as a company do not allow FMC to operate and grow our business in Russia. Furthermore, as the war continued and new sanctions and counter-sanctions were levied, FMC\u2019s ability to conduct business in Russia had become unsustainable. Our cross-functional team continues to navigate the extraordinary logistics and supply chain challenges in Ukraine and other parts of Eastern Europe. FMC and our employees raised nearly $300,000 for charities supporting the Ukrainian people and families in need. Our hearts and thoughts remain will all Ukrainians and especially our FMC colleagues and their families. Turning to FMC\u2019s performance in Q1, we delivered strong results driven by robust volumes and solid pricing actions across all regions. We grew our revenue by 16% organically, EBITDA by 16%, EPS by 23%, and importantly expanded our EBITDA margins by approximately 60 basis points while confronting a variety of supply and cost challenges as well as increasing currency headwinds. With disruptions impacting several agricultural inputs, we believe some of our Q1 sales were accelerated from Q2 as customers looked to secure supply in advance. Given this context, our guidance for Q2 combined with Q1 actuals implies 11% revenue growth and 8% EBITDA growth for the first half of the year compared to the first half of 2021, which is much more front-loaded than prior years.  Latin America and North America contributed greatly to our success in the quarter, supported by elevated commodity prices, acreage increases, and historically low stock-to-use ratios for several crops. Sales from products launched in the past five years increased by more than 50% in the quarter compared to the same period last year, demonstrating the strength of our technology pipeline and product portfolio. The global plant health business also continued its growth trajectory with biologicals growing 15% year-over-year. Last year, we announced our goal to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2035. We recently achieved the first milestone towards that goal by submitting 2030 emissions reductions targets to the Science Based Targets Initiative. These targets include 42% absolute reduction in direct emission from FMC\u2019s own sources and indirect emissions from purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling, also known as Scopes 1 and 2, as well as a 25% absolute reduction in all indirect emissions that occur in the value chain, otherwise known as Scope 3 emissions.  An incredible amount of rigor went into developing these targets with our sustainability team conducting an exhaustive review of all factors contributing to FMC\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and quantifying those emissions across the entire value chain. We will publish our 11th annual sustainability report in the coming weeks, and we look forward to speaking more on this topic in upcoming calls. Turning to Slide 3 for our Q1 results and keeping in mind my earlier comment about shifts within in the first half, we reported $1.35 billion in first quarter revenue, which reflects a 13% increase on a reported basis and 16% organic growth. We had double-digit growth in all product categories with fungicide showing the greatest growth year-over-year at 20%. Biologicals grew 15%, continuing the momentum of our plant health business. Regional growth was driven by strong volume gains in North America and Latin America as well as high single digit price increases in all four regions. FX was a headwind to top line growth in EMEA. Adjusted EBITDA was $355 million, an increase of 16% compared to the prior year period and $30 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. EBITDA margins were 26.3%, an increase of 60 basis points compared to the prior year period.  Cost inflation continued to be a challenge and at a higher rate than anticipated, so we moved price more aggressively in all regions to offset these increasing headwinds. We have also been active in managing our SG&A costs, some of which shifted from Q1 into Q2. FX was a headwind to EBITDA. Adjusted earnings were $1.88 per diluted share, an increase of 23% versus Q1 2021 and $0.18 above the midpoint of our guidance range. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by an increase in EBITDA with the benefit from lower share counts and lower interest expenses largely offset by higher minority interest and taxes.  Moving now to Slide 4, Q1 revenue increased by 13% versus prior year, driven by an 8% volume increase and an 8% pricing gain. Foreign currencies were a headwind of 3% in the quarter on the top line. In North America, strong commodity prices supported robust demand for inputs. Sales increased 30% year-over-year with broad-based growth across all indications and for a variety of crops, such as tree fruits, nuts, vines, corn and soy. In the U.S., we grew with Rynaxypyr brands such as Vantacor and Altacor in fruits and vegetables. Xyway, our unique in-furrow fungicide continues to gain significant momentum while providing season-long protection for corn from foliar diseases. Sales of biologicals almost doubled in the U.S. led by Ethos XB for corn and soybeans. Ethos XB is a unique combination of a synthetic insecticide for seedling insect protection with biological microorganisms that have fungicidal properties.  Our Canadian business had a record quarter driven by lower channel inventory of insecticides and strength in cereal herbicides. We also successfully launched Coragen MaX, which is the new higher concentration formulation of Rynaxypyr active, targeting pests on corn, dry beans and several other crops. Other 30% of FMC\u2019s branded sales in North America this quarter came from products which were launched in the last five years. Moving now to Latin America, sales increased 31% year-over-year led by Brazil and Argentina, driven by volume and price increases as well as a 6% FX tailwind driven by the Brazilian real. Colombia, Peru and Ecuador also grew double digits in the quarter. In Brazil, we grew our herbicide brands, Aurora and Gamit on soy, corn, sugarcane and coffee. We also grew our insecticide brands, Talisman, Hero and Coragen on soy, corn and cotton. FMC continues to reap the benefits of a strategy to improve market access and increase penetration of our technologies in the Brazilian soybean market.  Sales in EMEA grew 11% versus prior year, excluding currency headwinds. Results were driven by strong price increases across the region as well as demand for Rynaxypyr-based brands, Coragen and Altacor for corn, and herbicide brands, Express and Pointer for sunflowers. Registration losses and product rationalizations were largely offset by new product launches in the quarter. Over 10% of branded sales in the quarter came from products launched in the last five years. FX was a significant headwind in the quarter, resulting in flat year-over-year revenue growth. Sales in Asia were up 2% versus first quarter last year and up 5% organically. The increase was driven by pricing actions and strong performance in Australia and ASEAN countries, offset mainly by a reduction in Indian rice acres. Approximately 15% of branded sales in the quarter came from products launched in the last five years. Turning now to first quarter EBITDA on Slide 5, EBITDA was up 16% year-over-year driven by pricing and volume gains which were partially offset by cost and FX headwinds. Price was up $94 million in the quarter with high single digit increases implemented in all four regions. It is important to note that our pricing actions were taken to offset the sustained cost inflation we\u2019re experiencing across our supply chain. Raw material, energy, logistics, packaging and labor costs remained elevated and contributed to the $62 million cost headwind in the quarter. FX was a $16 million headwind in the quarter with weakening European currencies. Overall, EBITDA margins expanded 60 basis points in the quarter. Before I review FMC\u2019s full year 2022 and Q2 earnings outlook, let me share our view of the overall market conditions. We continue to expect the global crop protection market will be up low to mid single digit percent on a U.S. dollar basis. Breaking this down by region, we expect Latin America, North America and Asia to be up mid single digits while EMEA is now expected to be down low single digits. The war in Ukraine may further reduce market growth in the EMEA region. Commodity prices for many of the major crops remain elevated and stock-to-use ratios are near historic lows, creating a favorable backdrop for crop protection products. FX is projected to be a headwind for EMEA and Asia markets on a U.S. dollar basis. Turning to Slide 6 and the review of FMC\u2019s full year 2022 and Q2 earnings outlook, despite the volatile supply and geopolitical environment, we remain confident in our ability to deliver solid growth in 2022. FMC\u2019s full year revenue is forecasted to be in the range of $5.25 billion to $5.55 billion, representing an increase of 7% at the midpoint versus 2021 driven by volume and price growth in all regions, partially offset by currency headwinds. Full year adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $1.32 billion to $1.48 billion, representing 6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. This will be achieved through pricing actions and strong volumes; however, rising costs and supply disruptions will continue to be significant headwinds to EBITDA. 2022 adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $6.70 to $8 per diluted share, representing an increase of 6% year-over-year at the midpoint. Consistent with past practice, we do not factor in any benefit from future share repurchases in our EPS guidance. Discontinuing our Russia business does not change our full year earnings expectation at this time and it will take some time for us to assess the full financial implications for our exit. For reference, however, our Russian operations made up approximately 1.5% of global sales in 2021. Guidance for Q2 takes into account the shift of some sales from Q2 into Q1 as customers across many countries placed orders in advance to secure supplies during these uncertain times. Given the current industry dynamics, it is possible we will see the same phenomena occur with future orders moving into Q2. Q2 guidance implies sales growth of 9% at the midpoint, EBITDA growth of 1% at the midpoint, and EPS growth of 2% at the midpoint year-over-year. Turning to Slide 7 and the updated range of 2022 EBITDA outcomes, the market backdrop is supportive with FX limiting crop protection growth to low to mid single digits. Pricing actions and strong market demand have offset quickly rising costs so far; however, volatility persists due to renewed COVID related shutdowns in China, energy cost inflation in Europe, and ongoing disruption of global supply chains and logistics. FMC continues to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner despite these disruptions, but reliable supply is coming at an increased cost. We do not expect to see any cost relief through the remainder of 2022. EMEA and Asia have experienced FX headwinds only partially offset by the positive currency impact in Brazil. In addition, our decision to exit the Russian market and the impact of the war in Ukraine are new considerations.  Turning to Slide 8 and full year revenue and EBITDA drivers, strong volume expansion and price increases across all regions will drive revenue growth. FX volatility is expected to be a negative factor on our full year revenue outlook. In terms of crop mix, we expect roughly half our sales to come from specialty crops such as fruits and vegetables, sugar, rice and cotton. Almost 40% of our sales are expected to come from corn, soy and cereals such as wheat. FMC\u2019s crop diversity is a long term competitive advantage since we\u2019re not over-indexed to any single commodity.  Our EBITDA guidance reflects strong demand for our existing portfolio and new products as well as mid single digit price increases. These benefits to EBITDA are partially offset by substantial cost headwinds as well as investments in SG&A and R&D. Moving to Slide 9 and Q2 drivers, on the revenue line volume growth is expected to continue along with price increases in all regions that will start to lap some of the increases taken last year. We are anticipating FX headwinds to continue principally from European and Asian currencies. We also expect to see impacts from our decision to exit Russia beginning in the second quarter. For EBITDA, positive drivers include volume, especially for new products and pricing actions. The benefit from these drivers will be largely offset by elevated raw material, packaging and logistics costs, as well as some SG&A costs that shifted from Q1 into Q2. FX-related headwinds are also expected to persist, especially in EMEA. Turning to Slide 10, with the guidance for Q2 and the full year on record, we would like to also show the implied forecast for the two halves. Revenue forecast for the first half of 2022 indicates 11% growth over the first half of \u201921. Implied revenue forecast for the second half of 2022 indicates 4% growth over the prior year period. This is consistent with the stronger pricing actions and significant volume gains achieved in the second half of last year, especially in the fourth quarter of 2021. EBITDA forecast for the first half of 2022 indicates 8% growth over prior year period, driven by strong demand and pricing actions, offset by cost and FX headwinds. Our guidance also implies 4% year-over-year EBITDA growth in the second half of the year. This results in a more front-weighted outlook for EBITDA growth compared to last year. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks Mark. I\u2019ll start this morning with a review of some key income statement items.  FX was a headwind to revenue growth in the first quarter, as expected, driven by weakness in European currencies, particularly the Turkish lira and euro. The Brazilian real was a tailwind in the quarter offsetting modest weakness in several Asian currencies. We continue to anticipate FX headwinds for the remainder of \u201922 as the U.S. dollar is expected to appreciate against many currencies of importance to FMC. Interest expense for the first quarter was $29.9 million, down $2.5 million versus the prior year period primarily due to the refinancing activity completed in the fourth quarter of last year. For full year 2022, we now expect interest expense to be in the range of $125 million to $145 million, an increase of $10 million at the midpoint compared to our prior guidance, driven by more rapid increases in U.S. interest rates than previously anticipated.  Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the first quarter was 14%, in line with our continued expectation for a full year tax rate in the range of 13% to 15%.  Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity, gross debt at quarter end was $3.8 billion, up roughly $600 million from year end. Gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 2.7 times at the end of the first quarter, while net debt to EBITDA was 2.5 times. Both metrics are slightly above our targeted full year average leverage levels as expected, given the seasonal build of our working capital. We continue to expect to maintain full year average leverage in our targeted 2.4 to 2.5 times gross, or 2.3 to 2.4 times net ranges.  Moving onto cash flow on Slide 11, first quarter free cash flow of negative $664 million was in line with our expectations for this point in the year and reflects the strong seasonality of our working capital. Adjusted cash from operations was down more than $300 million compared to the prior year, driven by higher working capital partially offset by improvements in non-working capital items. Strong sales growth, higher application of customer prepayments, and lower payables were key drivers in increased cash consumption from working capital.  Capital additions and other investing activities of $55 million were up $16 million compared to the prior year as we continue to increase spending to catch up on deferred projects and to invest in our growth. Legacy and transformation spending was down primarily due to the absence of spend on our SAP program, which was completed last year.  For full year 2022, we continue to forecast free cash flow of $515 million to $735 million. Adjusted cash from operations is flat to the prior year at the high end of our guidance range, limited by working capital growth. Capacity increases especially to support our new products that are seeing rapid growth will drive higher capital additions. We continue to expect legacy and transformation to be a tailwind with somewhat lower legacy spending and minimal transformation expense expected in 2022. With this guidance, we anticipate free cash flow conversion from earnings of 67% at the midpoint.  Our capital allocation priorities remain : first, fully funding organic growth and pursuing inorganic growth through technology and market access M&A, then returning excess cash to shareholders through our growing dividend and share repurchases. We continue to anticipate strongly rewarding shareholders in 2022 with dividends of around $270 million and share repurchases of $500 million to $600 million. We paid dividends of $67 million during the quarter. Given our cash flow and leverage, we did not repurchase any shares in the first quarter. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call back to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you Andrew. Our first quarter performance in combination with the guidance to Q2 reflects FMC\u2019s ability to mitigate cost increases through pricing actions and to fulfill robust demand and the challenging supply conditions. Our new product introductions continue to gain momentum with over 30% of expected full year revenue growth coming from products introduced in the last five years. Our global plant health business continue its impressive growth trajectory led by biologicals. 2022 is proving to be one of the most challenging years, even considering all we\u2019ve had to manage since 2019. Our continued success stems from our strong customer focus, the way FMC\u2019s cross-functional teams are overcoming headwinds, and finally the strength of our robust technology and new product pipeline. All these attributes will serve us well through the remainder of the year. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question today is from Vincent Andrews at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Vincent. Vincent Andrews : Thank you very much. Mark and Andrew, the 8% pricing in the quarter in all regions was extremely strong - it was almost twice what we\u2019d been anticipating, and I think it compares versus 4% in the fourth quarter. What did you do differently in this quarter, if anything, to get that strong pricing achievement so quickly, and if you could also comment whether there\u2019s any mix in that 8% number or just what mix would be in general. Mark Douglas : Yes Vincent, thank you. Mix for us resides in volume, so what you\u2019re seeing in price is all actual price invoiced to the marketplace. Listen, I think we\u2019ve been very clear as we went through the second half of last year, we started moving price in North America actually in Q2 and then raised in other regions as we went through the year. I think you can see that in our results as pricing continued to build. What we realized as we were going through Q4 was that costs were going to come in significantly higher than we had forecasted internally as we entered 2022, so we made the decision that not only would we raise prices in markets that were active at that point but also getting ready for other markets around the world, so what you saw was really a broad-based move by FMC across pretty much every country to really drive price in anticipation of costs, and you could see that in the quarter - pricing was higher than costs in the quarter. It\u2019s not going to look like that in every quarter as we go forward.  If you will recall, we did say that we expected price to offset COGS impact of inflation and availability throughout the year. We still maintain that. What you should see through our results, though, is that our pricing is much higher than we anticipated because that impact of the supply disruptions and cost in general is still flowing through the business, so we need that cost - make no mistake, and the commercial groups are very active in the marketplace. If we continue to see disruptions in costs, we will continue to move price. I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s very important not only for FMC but for the industry in general. Things are not getting better out there. When I think about what we\u2019re seeing, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen the full impact of COVID yet in China, all the lockdowns that we see. We\u2019re having supply disruptions in China probably as bad as they\u2019ve been in the past. What worries me more is the logistics out of China, the amount of freight that is trapped in the major ports in China. Just the amount of freight--ships that are stuck outside China suggests that that wave is yet to come, so we\u2019re getting ahead of the curve. I think that\u2019s the right thing to do. Pricing is the main tool. Now, that\u2019s not to say we\u2019re not managing costs internally - we alluded to that in the call. We did move SG&A lower through actions that we took. Some of that flowed into Q2 from our forecast, but then you look at the first half, it\u2019s a very strong first half. Vincent Andrews : Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Laurent Favre from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead, Laurent. Laurent Favre : Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Mark, it\u2019s really related to your market assessment, and I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, I guess, volumes including mix, so really intensity of use. Are there reasons why you would not expect a higher intensity of use, more spraying, but also can you talk maybe about the risk of down trading with farmers being so squeezed on all sorts of input costs, including fertilizers. Thank you. Mark Douglas : Yes, thanks Laurent. When you look at the market today, we view the market obviously as a positive backdrop - soft commodity prices are high, stock to use ratios are very low, almost at 10-year lows in some cases, so we know many of the regions that are entering their planting seasons now are going to plant as much as they possibly can. Allied to that is the fact that to get the most yield, you will want to use the best products.  Now, one thing that is often misunderstood is pricing is not necessarily related to value. Generics sell on price. We sell on value, so the usage of our products enables greater productivity and yield gains than you can get with other types of products, and that\u2019s proven to be true as we\u2019ve gone through numerous cycles. When I think back to 2008 and 2009 in this business, the ag business performed extremely well - why? Because people want to get the highest yields they can and they tend to use the best technologies to do that. We\u2019re seeing that with demand for our products. Think about the comments I made about--you know, we\u2019re going to have $600 million of revenue this year from products introduced in the last five years. That tells you that the newer products are the best ones to use to get that yield. We don\u2019t see people reducing sprays at this point. We think applications will continue as normal. Remember, if you have insect pressure, you have a choice to make - you either remove the insects or you lose your crop. That\u2019s very important when it comes to actual usage of products. Our backdrop is positive, we believe the markets will continue like this certainly this year and probably into next year as well. We don\u2019t see anything on the horizon that will change that, so from our perspective, it is making sure that we can get those high quality newer technologies to the marketplace certainly in the right time frame, given all the disruptions we\u2019re seeing. Laurent Favre : Thank you. As a follow-up on pricing, you mentioned you\u2019re lapping some increases from last year in the quarter, but last year in Q2 I think your pricing at group level was flat as it was in Q1 last year, so I was wondering maybe could you talk about specific areas, either geographically or in terms of product categories, where we should expect this slowdown in pricing into Q2? Mark Douglas : Yes, in the U.S. we started to raise prices last year in Q2, so it should be a little more muted as we go through Q2 and then certainly into Q3 and into Q4. Latin America is not really an impact in Q2, a small amount, but you\u2019ll see that much more in Q3, certainly in Q4. Really, I would focus on North America in Q2 on price; everywhere else will be catching up as we lap ourselves in Q3 and Q4. Laurent Favre : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector from UBS. Josh, please go ahead. Josh Spector : Yes, thanks for taking my question. Just on the comments about China and the logistics and supply risk, wondering how you\u2019re thinking about the potential risk this time versus a couple of years ago and perhaps what\u2019s changed to maybe limit the volume impact on your side or mitigate some of the cost pressure. Mark Douglas : Yes, thanks Josh. Listen, the playbook is pretty similar for us. Procurement and supply chain work hand-in-hand basically on a daily basis to understand the flow of goods, and you have to remember, you obviously read about the major lockdown in Shanghai but I believe something like 330 million people are in lockdown all over the country and that\u2019s changing day to day, so we\u2019re navigating day to day movement of goods from one facility to another or movement of goods to ports and out of the country. That\u2019s not dissimilar to what we\u2019ve been doing over the last two to three years in China. We are seeing more congestion at the ports given just the amount of lockdowns, so it\u2019s a case of not just manufacturing the products in China or getting the mediates or fine chemicals, but then getting the product out of China. That\u2019s where we\u2019re keeping a very close eye on what is happening with logistics. We\u2019re using different ports to traditional ports that we would use. We are using more air freight to get product out in time. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything what I would call different to what we\u2019ve managed over the last two or three years, but the intensity is certainly higher than it has been as we have gone through Q4 and into Q1. Josh Spector : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from PJ Juvekar from Citi. PJ, please go ahead. Patrick: Hi, this is Patrick coming on for PJ, thanks for taking my question. Just a question on diamides-- Operator : PJ, please confirm your line is not muted. Patrick: Hello, can you hear me? Operator : Unfortunately we can\u2019t hear anything from your line, so we will have to move to the next question. The next question comes from Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Joel, please go ahead. Joel Jackson : Hi, good morning. Mark, I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but last quarter we talked about Slide 7, which is your upside and downside scenarios and would you think that you\u2019re leaning more to the upside or the downside. I think you said leaning more to the upside. What I see now on the upside is to get to the upside scenario at $1.4 billion, you need to have higher price increases than what you would have thought a few months ago. Can you maybe talk about that a little bit? Mark Douglas : Yes, sure Joel. Listen, we\u2019re anchored on $1.4 billion of EBITDA for a reason - it is the highest probability we see for the results for this year. It is a range that we\u2019ve put in place and it\u2019s there deliberately. The world is not simple right now and I think everybody knows that, but certainly when we were together on the February call, we had this view and we haven\u2019t really changed it. In fact, if anything, with the Ukraine war situation, it has probably got worse from that perspective, plus the COVID-19 lockdowns in China are worse than they were before, so you can see rationally why we kept the range wide. It doesn\u2019t mean to say that we\u2019re still not anchored on the 1.4 - we are. You\u2019re right - if things were to move to the upper end of this range, we would have to see a better mix, even more pricing than we\u2019ve got today, and costs perhaps mitigating themselves with less FX impact. That\u2019s a lower probability than where we are at 1.4. Also equally is a lower probability of the 1.32 at the low end of the range, and we have to believe that things would get so severe that we couldn\u2019t offset that by a price or that the market demand weakens because of significant weather issues in regions. I think the upper end is a low probability but so is the low end - that\u2019s why we\u2019re anchored on that 1.4 at the middle. When you see what we put there around the market growth, the strong demand, they\u2019re all relevant. We are getting the mid single digit price increases. Costs are elevated - we see that, but we are mitigating that. FX is a headwind, but once again we\u2019re mitigating that with volume, which we have said we always would do, and then we\u2019re trying to manage those supply disruptions. The only new one there is Russia and Ukraine and we\u2019re managing that, so you can see why we still kept the range wide, but there is a lower probability at each end of that range and a much higher probability in the middle. Joel Jackson : Okay, and then secondly here, when I look at your margin guidance, you had a bit of margin expansion in Q1 and then you\u2019re modeling--then your [indiscernible] guiding to some pretty tough margin contraction in Q2, some of the lowest margins you\u2019ve had in a long time. Then Q3 and Q4--for Q2, sorry. Then for Q3 and Q4, you\u2019re guiding to maybe modest margin contraction. Can you sort of help bridge that a bit - expansion in Q1 year-over-year, then pretty sizeable contraction in Q2 and kind of modest contraction for the second half of the year? Andrew Sandifer : Yes Joel, it\u2019s Andrew. Let me take that one. Look, I think Mark commented earlier, we moved price very aggressively in Q1 because we see this continuing surge of cost inflation, so we probably--you know, we did have a stronger comparison and a positive comparison between price and cost, overall cost, not just COGS in the first quarter that will not carry through the full year. I think you also have to remember that Q1 of \u201921 was a relatively weak quarter for us. It was a down quarter in revenue which, given the fixed costs we have in SG&A and R&D, resulted in a weaker comparison for margin, so while we\u2019re certainly pleased to see a positive EBITDA margin comparison Q1 \u201922 versus Q1 \u201921, just given the magnitude of price movement to offset costs we\u2019re talking about, the mathematical dilution of margins is pretty substantial. If we dollar for dollar offset cost increases with price increases, we\u2019re going to have a reducing percentage margin - it\u2019s just math, and you see that effect get more and more pronounced as you get into the latter part of the year, continued very high levels of cost increase, but then offsetting that with very strong price increases. Unfortunately, that net-net is on a percentage margin dilutive. The pattern you\u2019re seeing is not unexpected. We do expect to see tougher comparisons on the EBITDA margin percent in the second half, but I do think it speaks well for the long term future here, which is eventually costs will level off. I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re in a position to call a bend in the curve. As Mark\u2019s highlighted, there\u2019s certainly a number of uncertainties particularly around logistics and ocean freight coming in and out of China at the moment that don\u2019t suggest that we\u2019ve reached the bend in that curve yet, but there is a bend that will come and with the stickiness of pricing in our industry, that will be the opportunity to see percentage margin begin to expand and recover. But for the rest of this year, I think that the formula is clear - we price aggressively, we move to offset COGS inflation, we use volume and mix to offset FX as well as any investments in our SG&A and R&D growth, and overall deliver what we believe to be a very strong full year performance in very challenging times. Joel Jackson : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Christopher Parkinson : Great, thank you so much. When investors take the time to actually parse out the growth rate for the diamides and biologicals perhaps at a lower base, and then subtract just the annual registration losses, what\u2019s your current assessment of the remainder of the portfolio, so kind of the other core products as well as some new launch products, and what are you most excited about for 2024? Perhaps an alternative way of asking that is just how do you generally characterize your aggregate growth contribution from more environmentally CPC formulations versus the past few years? Thank you. Mark Douglas : Yes, thanks Chris. The diamides are growing pretty much as we\u2019ve said they would grow - they\u2019re in the high single digits. We saw that in Q1, we\u2019ll see that through the rest of the year. When you look at our overall growth rates for the year, you can see that the rest of the portfolio is also growing strongly. Plant health, we talk about a lot because the biological investment there is going really, really well. I would say that when I think about on average of, what, somewhere around 7% revenue growth, the rest of the portfolio is growing in that mid single digits-plus and the new products that we\u2019re introducing are growing much faster than that. We have about a 1.5% drag on the portfolio just because of registration losses. It\u2019s been a little lower in the first half of this year, it might be a little lower than that full year, maybe 1% range, but it\u2019s about the right place to be. You can see that the portfolio overall is performing very well. I talked about the $600 million of revenue from the products in the last five years, but I think it\u2019s the growth rate of that that\u2019s occurring. It was $400 million last year, it\u2019s $600 million this year - that means we got $200 million of brand-new growth, so that\u2019s what we should be focused on and that is coming from not only the big products that we launch, whether it\u2019s a fluindapyr fungicide or an Isoflex herbicide, those are the bigger products that are in the multi-hundred million dollars range when they reach their peak size. What often gets overlooked is the amount of work we do on brand-new formulations that come to market every year. Last year, I think we had something like $170 million, $180 million of products introduced within the year. It\u2019s slightly less than that this year, but it\u2019s still substantial. Don\u2019t underestimate the value that that brings. Those products are new, they are coming to market at higher margins so you\u2019re improving the mix, so it\u2019s all three things for us. It\u2019s the core, it\u2019s the local formulations that we do in our research facilities around the world, it\u2019s the very large pipeline products that come through, and obviously the diamides continue in that high single digit range. Christopher Parkinson : Got it, and just a very quick follow-up. Mark, before everything that\u2019s happening with the war, the EU was actually evaluating a host of chemistries, and there were one or two of them that are in terms of environmentally, let\u2019s say friendliness or lack thereof, and two of them and one in a particular is a direct competitor of the DiaMark portfolio. How is your team assessing the potential opportunity for the diamides based on the potential for further regulatory actions? It seems like it\u2019s already benefited, it has been benefiting you over the last several years and potentially will benefit you, but what are you updated thoughts on that and how that could potentially further contribute to that portfolio\u2019s growth? Thank you. Mark Douglas : Yes, look - as we think further forward on the diamides, not only are we growing ourselves, our new partner sales are growing nicely as well, roughly at the same rate that we are internally to FMC. Obviously we\u2019re taking new products into new markets with new registrations, our partners are doing the same, but we are taking market share in insecticides with the diamides. When you look at some of the older chemistries, whether it be the neonicotinoids or whether it be the carbamates, and now some of the other chemistries also coming under pressure - in fact, some of our own chemistries coming under pressure, we\u2019re losing registrations of Indoxacarb in Europe this year, which is a great molecule but doesn\u2019t fit the profile for the EU. That churn is happening in the industry and we are taking advantage of that. We expect that to continue. It is one of the growth drivers for the diamides as we look forward for the next 10 years. That will not slow down; in fact, you could argue the replacement of older technologies will accelerate as we go through time, especially in jurisdictions like Europe, so it is a positive for us. We see it that way and we have taken advantage of it, and we\u2019ll continue to do so. Christopher Parkinson : Great, thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question is from Tony Jones at Redburn. Tony, please go ahead. Tony Jones : Thanks everybody, thanks for taking my question. You talked about cost inflation should be peaking and reversing at some point, but when we look at the industry, in the past we\u2019ve seen some companies give back prize. What\u2019s your expectation from an FMC perspective, because the portfolio today is very different than last time we were in a period of cost inflation, so any thoughts on that would be really helpful. Thank you. Mark Douglas : Thanks Tony. Listen, you heard me comment earlier about the fact that we sell value, and that\u2019s something that we have always done and will continue to do. When you look at some of the chemistries in this space, they are very commoditized and almost index-linked - you can think of the non-selective herbicides, which move up very quickly and they move down very quickly. Our portfolio historically has never done that, and you could argue that with the portfolio as it is today, it is even less likely to move quickly. It\u2019s taken us a while to get to this point. We didn\u2019t recover all the costs last year. Our intent I when we come out of this cycle that our margins will have in fact improved because of all the efforts that we\u2019ve put in place with regards to SAP, etc. Our plan over the long haul is to make sure that these prices are sticky by selling the value aspect of the portfolio. We don\u2019t have the non-selective herbicides, we don\u2019t have that large generic portfolio, so we do not expect to have that large swing in prices when we come through the other side of this. Tony Jones : Thank you, that\u2019s really helpful.  Just a really quick follow-up, can you indicate the rough additional SG&A costs, maybe absolute terms moving from Q1 to Q2, just so we can make it accurate in the model? Thanks. Mark Douglas : Andrew, do we have that absolute number? I don\u2019t think we do, do we? Andrew Sandifer : We don\u2019t. Look Tony, I would say that I think our SG&A as a percentage of sales was probably a bit light in Q1 relative to what you should expect in Q2. Tony Jones : Thank you. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Michael, please go ahead. Michael Piken : Yes, good morning. Just a question regarding some of the costs of the active ingredients themselves. I totally understand the logistical-- Operator : Michael, we\u2019re unable to hear you. Can you please check your line\u2019s not on mute? Michael Piken : Yes, can you hear me now? Hello, can you hear me? Operator : Unfortunately we can\u2019t hear anything from Michael\u2019s line, so we\u2019ll move onto the next question. Your next question is from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Arun, please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan : Great, thanks. If I look at the EBITDA growth in \u201922, it looks like if we use the $1.32 billion that you did last year, you\u2019re about-- Operator : Arun, your line is now open for your question, please proceed. Arun Viswanathan : Yes, I\u2019m speaking. You can\u2019t hear me? Can you hear me now? I\u2019m here. Hello? Operator : Yes, we can hear now. Please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan : Okay, great. It looks like you\u2019re guiding to about 6% EBITDA growth at the midpoint in \u201922, and understandably there\u2019s a lot of challenges that you guys have detailed on costs and so on and uncertainty. But when you look out into \u201923 and \u201924, do you expect to get back into a 7% to 9% EBITDA growth rate, and potentially even at the upper end of that just given some of the replacement that has to go on for lost production out of Ukraine? How should we think about the new outlook for FMC, should it be within the range that you provided in the past back in your \u201918 investor day? Mark Douglas : Yes, thanks Arun. Listen, next year is the last year of our five-year plan. We\u2019re tracking well on revenue, right in the middle of the range. We are slightly below on EBITDA, but as Andrew and I were discussing the other day, since \u201918 through \u201921, we\u2019ve had over $600 million of costs and FX headwinds and we\u2019re only just slightly below the lower end of the range. Look, I\u2019m not going to guide \u201923 - it is way too early to guide \u201923, but there\u2019s no reason to believe that if the situation starts to normalize, that we wouldn\u2019t be in that 7% to 9% range. We\u2019re obviously not going to cover the gap that we\u2019ve had over the last couple of years, so we will likely end up somewhere at the low end of that range at the end of the five-year plan - commendable results, to say the least, given everything that we\u2019ve had, and frankly this year\u2019s cost and FX is higher than we\u2019ve seen at any point of the last five year in terms of this plan, so we\u2019re swimming against a very strong tide and right at the edge of our range. We do feel that the company has performed well since 2018 on both metrics. After 2023, we are going to be putting together a new long range plan. Whatever timeline that takes, we will make that decision. We would expect to come out with a new long range plan towards the end of 2023, where we\u2019ll be public with where the company is going over what time frame, but for now we\u2019re just sticking with where we are and obviously that 7% to 9% EBITDA range is what we\u2019d be aiming for for next year. Arun Viswanathan : If I could ask a follow-up to that, is there any discrete items, whether it be the deals that you guys have signed for partnerships or maybe some fungicide M&A, or anything like that that you could point to that could help us understand and frame the longer term growth possibilities? Mark Douglas : I think from a portfolio perspective, I think you\u2019ve got all the pieces of information that we\u2019ve given out in terms of the pipeline growth, the diamides longer term view, the portfolio itself, the core portfolio. At this point in time, obviously we\u2019re always looking at M&A from a technology perspective. They tend to play out over the long haul, it wouldn\u2019t impact the near term, but we are looking at a number of items on the technology side of M&A. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything there that we have that you don\u2019t have in terms of trying to model where the future growth of the company is. I think obviously as we go through this planning cycle, we\u2019ll have a much better view at the end of \u201923 around where the company will be going over the next decade. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Adam, please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. Mark Douglas : Morning Adam. Adam Samuelson : Morning. I guess some of this might be tricky because of where you are in the season, but I would just love to get your thoughts on channel inventories. It does seem like there was a good amount of pre-buying in a lot of different regions ahead of maybe an expectation of additional price increases, concerns around supply chain, and just if you could just take a tour around the world about where you think channel inventories sit as you\u2019re going into certainly the northern hemisphere growing season and Brazil, where you\u2019re more off-season, just how you think activity levels and restocking sits there. Mark Douglas : Yes, sure. Thank you. Generally speaking, we are not concerned about channel inventories. There are a couple pockets in the world, one we alluded to, which is India - in Q4, weather patterns were not great and there is a reduction in rice acres in India, and you saw some of the comments about strong growth in ASEAN and Australia offset by India. We\u2019re taking the opportunity to reduce our channel inventories in India at the beginning of the year. We expect that to normalize pretty quickly as we go through the first half here. Outside of that, northern hemisphere, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re carrying excess inventories as we\u2019re going into the channel, into the season. Recommendations from our group are that we expect normal pest pressures for the year going forward in Europe and in the U.S. here, so we\u2019re not seeing anything that we would say is concerning at all. They seem pretty normal to us. In Latin America for us, normal. Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, [indiscernible] we\u2019re where we should be at this point in the season. Demand has been very good for us. Our growth rates are in line with how we\u2019re penetrating the market. You\u2019ll recall on the call here, I just talked about the fact that we\u2019ve been spending a lot of time and effort improving our market access into the soy complex in Brazil, and that\u2019s where our growth is coming from, whether it be with insecticides or some of the newer herbicides that we have in place. We\u2019re not worried about where our inventory levels at all in Brazil or Argentina. Adam Samuelson : Okay, and then just a quick follow-up on the decision to cease operations or sales in Russia. It implies about $75 million of business there last year. Is that something, as we\u2019re modeling that going away? I presume there\u2019s a tail to winding down activities, so it doesn\u2019t just fall to zero immediately. I guess the corollary question would be in Ukraine, what\u2019s the size of business in Ukraine and what\u2019s the expectation on volumes there, just given a lot of the planting disruptions and logistical issues of getting product into the country? Mark Douglas : Sure. I\u2019ll let Andrew comment on the actual numbers. We are working through what the financial impacts will be both from a P&L and a balance sheet impact. We do believe that we have opportunities to offset maybe not all of that impact but certainly the vast majority of it, so we\u2019re working through that right now.  I would say that Ukraine, we\u2019re expecting very low planted acres, especially obviously in the east. Our groups are active, our sales people are out, growers are planting, it\u2019s just under very, very difficult conditions. Getting material into the country, we are doing that. It\u2019s once you\u2019re in country, it\u2019s working through distribution, etc. It\u2019s not, as you can imagine, particularly easy, so I would expect acreage to be down significantly in Ukraine but we will obviously do everything that we can to get material into that country and make sure they can plant every acre they can.  Andrew, do you just want to comment on the rough impact? Andrew Sandifer : Sure. Just some dimensions for you on Russia and Ukraine, between the two countries there\u2019s about $100 million in revenue in 2021, about 70% Russia, 30% Ukraine. The Russian business, we did operate in the first quarter. What was built into our budgets for the remaining three quarters of the year was about $20 million to $25 million of EBITDA contribution from the Russian business, so that\u2019s the headwind we\u2019ve got to address with either redirecting the material not longer being sent to that market to other markets, or finding other opportunities. That\u2019s certainly a part of our upside-downside discussion that Mark went through in his prepared comments about the guidance for this year.  Regarding Ukraine, as Mark mentioned, we are operating. We do not expect to hit our initial expectations for the year, but the business is operating and we\u2019re continuing to ship, and we will continue to support Ukrainian farmers to the best we can.  I do think you should expect that we will take a restructuring charge in the second quarter for the exit of the Russia business. We are not in a position right now to finalize that number given that we\u2019re still in the process of finalizing the exact pieces of our exit there, but there will be a largely non-cash restructuring charge in the second quarter to reflect the exit of the Russia business. Adam Samuelson : All right, that\u2019s all really helpful. I appreciate it, thank you. Operator : Our final question on the call today comes from Michael Sison from Wells Fargo. Michael, please go ahead. Michael Sison : Hey guys. You sort of noted that you felt there could be growth in 2023 in terms of the ag markets. Any thoughts [indiscernible] maybe extend the cycle for another year or so? Mark Douglas : Yes, listen - we\u2019ve gone through a period of very low growth in the ag sector over the last, I would say, last three to four years. Let\u2019s take a step back and look at what is happening on soft commodity prices, what would you have to believe that would drive soft commodities right now. I mean, certainly the Russia-Ukraine situation is driving cereals, you\u2019ve had weather impacts in Latin America last season in the south of Brazil, north of Argentina. We\u2019re watching weather very closely around the world - there is always a weather impact somewhere to disrupt the market, that\u2019s just a fact of life. You\u2019ve got to believe that soft commodities right now are going to stay elevated, and that being the case, that\u2019s a generally a good backdrop for us as crop protection input providers. We\u2019re looking at \u201923 as--it is very early, we\u2019re only in the start of May, but we\u2019re looking at \u201923 as an extension of \u201922. That\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking of it right now. It should be a positive backdrop. We don\u2019t see any negatives out there that are going to fundamentally shift this, so \u201923 should be a good year. Michael Sison : Got it. Then I think you are looking, or you\u2019re trying to reduce some of your manufacturing footprint in China and move it to other parts of the world. Where are you in that endeavor, and have you made any meaningful progress? Mark Douglas : Yes Mike, we\u2019ve talked about this subject before. I always allude back to the 2015 time frame when we bought Cheminova - prior to that, we were about 95% to 90% dependent ton China for pretty much all the raw materials, intermediates, fine and speciality chemicals. We\u2019ve been working and we\u2019ve had a program to really ensure that we have a balanced supply chain of manufacturing footprint around the world, not only with the Cheminova acquisition but with the Dupont acquisitions as well, and today we\u2019re probably in that 43%, 45% range dependent upon China. Our aim is to get that to sub-40% within the next year or so. We\u2019ve done a very good job of setting up manufacturing with the assets, whether it be in India or Europe. We\u2019ve shifted some toll manufacturing into Europe and Mexico, as an example, to feed Brazil. We will continue to do that. It is something that, frankly, is never-ending. I would like to get it into the 30% range. I don\u2019t know whether my manufacturing and procurement people would agree with that, but I think if we could get China dependency on 30%-plus would be almost ideal for us, with a good balance between India and Europe and the U.S. being the rest. I think we\u2019d be in great shape by then. Michael Sison : Got it, thank you. Zack Zaki : Okay, thank you very much. That is all the time that we have for the call today. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : This concludes the FMC Corporation conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call for FMC Corporation. This event is being recorded, and all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Zack Zaki, Director of Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Please go ahead. Zack Zaki : Thank you, Jagrita, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Mark Douglas, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mark will review our second quarter and first half performance as well as provide an outlook for the second half of the year. Andrew will provide an overview of select financial results. Following the prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our earnings release and today's slide presentation are available on our Web site and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call. Let me remind you that today's presentation and discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including, but not limited to, those factors identified in our earnings release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's understanding. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion and the supporting materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations, free cash flow, net debt and organic revenue growth, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that as used in today's discussion, earnings means adjusted earnings and EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our Web site. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Zack, and good morning, everyone. FMC delivered another quarter of strong growth in a dynamic global environment, while offsetting high input costs with our ability to price for the value we offer to growers.  Overall, first half performance was primarily driven by significant price increases and volume gains. This growth reflects robust market demand globally, despite cost inflation and FX headwinds. We continue to expect a strong second half of the year, driven again by price increases and volume growth in a supportive market environment. Turning to Slide 3. Before we review details of our quarterly results and full year outlook, I'd like to offer a few comments on our recently completed acquisition of BioPhero, a Denmark-based insect control company that has pioneered a bioprocessing technology used to manufacture pheromone crop protection products.  As you may know, pheromones are naturally produced by insects to trigger a social response in members of the same species. Pheromones are used in a variety of ways to protect crops by disrupting the insect mating process, and hence significantly lowering subsequent generations of target insect larva, which would otherwise damage crops.  There are several methods to manufacture pheromones, but BioPhero's proprietary fermentation route is a game changer, enabling high volume production of pheromones at significantly lower costs than other production routes. The acquisition, which closed on July 19, significantly expands our rapidly growing biologicals portfolio within FMC's plant health business.  It provides a platform for large-scale production of pheromones and pheromone-based crop protection products, which are expected to generate approximately $1 billion in revenue at above-average EBITDA margins by 2030. We have been expanding our plant health technology base, and this acquisition is another great opportunity to continue bringing biological products to growers around the world. Our Q2 results are detailed on slides 4, 5 and 6. Revenue was up 21% organically, EBITDA up 3% and EPS up 7%, driven by strong market demand for our innovative portfolio and an average price increase of 7%. Adjusted earnings were $1.93 per diluted share in the quarter, $0.08 above the midpoint of our guidance range. The year-over-year EPS increase was primarily driven by an increase in EBITDA and lower share count. GAAP results reflect the impact of our exit from Russia in April this year. We had double-digit growth across several product categories, with insecticide showing the greatest increase at over 20% year-over-year. Our herbicide portfolio also had a strong quarter, with 15% growth led by North America and EMEA. Sales from products launched in the past five years grew more than 35% compared to the same period last year. And these products made up 10% of our total sales in the quarter.  The global plant health business grew 20% year-over-year, led by a 35% growth in our biologicals portfolio. The momentum of this business reflects our customers' demand for new sustainable solutions. We reported $1.45 billion in second quarter sales, led by price and volume growth in Latin America and North America.  In North America, sales increased 26% year-over-year. Demand for both herbicides and insecticides grew double digits. In Canada, high pest pressure supported the successful launch of Coragen MaX, an insecticide powered by Rynaxypyr, targeting a broad spectrum of pests such as grasshoppers in cereals and other crops. Diamides sales were impacted in California and Texas due to dry conditions, but this was offset by growth in the Midwest in soy and corn.  In Latin America, sales increased 44% year-over-year, led by Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Results were driven by the full range of our insecticide portfolio for soy, corn and cotton. Sales in EMEA grew 3% versus the prior year, and we're up 15% organically. Aside from strong pricing, results were driven by increased demand for herbicides. And finally, Asia was down 1% versus the second quarter last year, and up 4% organically. Pricing gains were offset by FX headwinds. Demand for Cyazypyr grew in India for applications on fruits and vegetables. In Australia, Overwatch Herbicide continued to outperform competing products in cereals.  Overall, adjusted EBITDA was $360 million, an increase of 3% compared to the prior year period, and $10 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. Volume gains and price increases more than offset cost inflation and FX headwinds. Average price increases of 7% contributed $84 million in the quarter.  As we expected, cost headwinds more than doubled from the first quarter as inflation continued to challenge our supply chains. FX was a $23 million headwind in the quarter, due to the weakening of European and Asian currencies against the U.S. dollar. Before we review FMC's full year 2022 and second half earnings outlook, let me update you on our views regarding the overall market conditions. We now expect the global crop protection market will be up mid to high single digits on a U.S. dollar basis versus our earlier expectation of low to mid single digit growth.  Latin America is now expected to be up double digits, primarily driven by pricing of non-selective herbicides. We still expect North America to be up mid single digits, while Asia is now expected to grow low single digits. EMEA is still expected to be down low single digits, including the impact of FX.  Excluding currency impact, EMEA is expected to grow low single digits. While commodity prices have come down somewhat from their highs earlier in the year, they remain elevated versus historical averages. This bodes well for the demand of our crop protection products through the end of this year and well into 2023.  Moving to Slide 7. We have seen pronounced shifts in demand and cost between individual quarters this year. Therefore, looking at the business in halves gives a better understanding of the underlying performance. For the first half, performance was very strong as a result of price increases and volume growth, which contributed $178 million and $132 million to EBITDA, respectively. These drivers more than offset significant cost and FX headwinds of almost $250 million, resulting in 9% EBITDA growth over the prior year period.  In the context of our full year guidance, first half EBITDA growth represents more than three quarters of the increase required to achieve the midpoint of our full year guidance. When we consider the drivers for the second half of the year, price is again expected to contribute more to EBITDA than volume. Cost increases are expected to have the biggest impact in the third quarter, with continued but lower cost inflation forecast in the fourth quarter.  There are two primary reasons for the expected cost increases. The first reason is the cost inflation related to sourcing from secondary and tertiary suppliers due to lack of availability from our preferred suppliers. The second reason is the lag of six months between procuring high cost material and its impact on our P&L, since FMC typically turns inventory twice a year. Latin America and North America are our biggest drivers of revenue in the second half. And we have already captured roughly 70% of the orders needed in Brazil to deliver our second half guidance. For reference, this is normally around 50% at this time of the year. The increase in orders is due to the higher than average customer demand driven by favorable commodity prices.  In the U.S., Q4 order discussions are taking place as we speak, which is much earlier than in previous years, making us confident in our forecast. Overall, we expect the second half of the year to contribute 2% in EBITDA growth following a very strong second half of 2021. Turning to Slide 8 and the review of FMC's full year 2022 earnings outlook. After a strong first half of the year, we are raising full year 2022 revenue to a range of $5.5 billion to $5.7 billion, representing an increase of 11% at the midpoint versus 2021. Sales growth will be driven by volume and price growth in all regions, partially offset by foreign currency impact in EMEA and Asia. We are narrowing the full year adjusted EBITDA range to 1.36 billion to 1.44 billion, representing a 6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. The range for 2022 adjusted earnings per share is narrowed as well, and is now expected to be in the $7.00 to $7.70 per diluted share, representing an increase of 6% year-over-year at the midpoint. Consistent with past practice, we do not factor in any benefit from potential future share repurchases in our EPS guidance.  Q3 and Q4 outlook is provided on Slide 9. Midpoint of our third quarter guidance implies year-over-year sales growth of 13%. Q3 EBITDA and EPS growth are expected to be limited by the highest cost increases of the year, despite the targeted mid to high single digit price increases. FX volatility in the absence of sales in Russia will also be headwinds to earnings in the quarter.  Guidance for Q4 implies year-over-year sales growth of 2% at the midpoint compared to the exceptionally strong growth in the prior year period. Cost increases are forecasted to be lower in Q4 compared to Q3, while price increases are expected to continue. This is anticipated to result in an EBITDA growth of 17% at the midpoint with EPS up 13% at the midpoint year-over-year.  Moving now to the updated drivers of 2022 EBITDA outcomes on Slide 10. While the market growth assumptions have improved, costs remain elevated, though we are beginning to see the signs of cost inflation flattening. Price in the mid to high single digit and strong volume growth are expected to offset cost and FX headwinds keeping the midpoint of our guidance unchanged. While we expect the highest cost increases of the year in Q3, we do not expect material benefits from easing inflation to be realized until 2023.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks, Mark. I'll start this morning with a review of some key income statement items. FX was a headwind to revenue growth in the second quarter, as expected, driven by weakness in European and Asian currencies, particularly the euro, Indian rupee and Turkish lira. The Brazilian real was a modest tailwind in the quarter. We continue to anticipate FX headwinds for the remainder of 2022, driven by Asian and European currencies.  Interest expense for the second quarter was $35.3 million, up $2.7 million versus the prior year period, primarily due to higher short-term interest rates and higher debt balances, partially offset by benefits of the refinancing activity completed in fourth quarter 2021. With rapidly rising interest rates, especially in the United States, we now expect interest expense for the full year 2022 to be in the range of $135 million to $155 million, an increase of $10 million at the midpoint compared to our prior guidance. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the second quarter was 14%, in line with our continued expectation for a full year tax rate in the range of 13% to 15%.  Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity. Gross debt at quarter end was $3.9 billion, up roughly $715 million from year end 2021. Gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 2.8x at the end of the second quarter, while net debt to EBITDA was 2.4x. Net debt was in line with our targeted leverage levels, while gross debt was slightly above targeted leverage due to the timing of return of cash from foreign subsidiaries. Moving on to cash flow on Slide 11. Second quarter year-to-date free cash flow was negative $498 million. Year-to-date adjusted cash from operations was negative $401 million, down substantially as compared to the prior year period driven by higher working capital. Strong sales growth, including the impact of aggressive price increases on receivables, was the key driver of increased cash consumption for working capital. Capital additions and other investing activities of $65 million were essentially in line with the prior year period. Legacy and transformation spending was down, primarily due to the absence of spending on our SAP program, which was completed in the prior year period.  We are narrowing the range of our free cash flow guidance for full year 2022 to $565 million to $685 million, unchanged at the midpoint of $625 million and reflecting the more narrow EBITDA guidance range. Adjusted cash from operations is now expected to be in the range of $790 million to $870 million, unchanged at the midpoint.  Working capital growth is expected to result in a year-on-year reduction of $80 million in cash from operations at the midpoint. Our guidance for capital additions and legacy and transformation remain unchanged. With this guidance, we anticipate free cash flow conversion of 67% at the midpoint, with conversion limited this year by inflation's impact on working capital. This guidance also results in rolling three-year free cash conversion of 71%, in line with our long-term targets.  Through the first half of 2022, we have deployed $334 million of cash, $200 million for the BioPhero acquisition and $134 million in dividends. Given the BioPhero acquisition and the seasonality of our free cash flow, we did not purchase any FMC shares in the first half. For the remainder of 2022, we expect to return up to $334 million to investors through continued dividends and up to $200 million in share repurchases.  The reduced outlook for share repurchases reflects two key changes since we last gave guidance. First, as I mentioned just a moment ago, we deployed $200 million of cash to acquire BioPhero. Second, we are limiting the amount of incremental debt we had in 2022 to mitigate in part the earnings impact of faster than expected interest rate increases. We continue to expect to utilize more than 100% of our free cash flow to invest in growth and reward shareholders. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Andrew. FMC delivered solid financial performance in the second quarter, despite a challenging macro environment. Price increases across all regions and strong volume growth continue to deliver strong EBITDA growth in an inflationary period. At the same time, the broader agricultural market remains positive, which we expect to continue throughout 2023. FMC remains well positioned to outperform the industry in this environment, with the focus on crop protection chemicals and biological products working to our advantage. The year is turning out largely as we expected, with a strong first half followed by a second half that is constrained by costs, especially in Q3, delivering an overall strong 2022.  I'll now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Operator : Absolutely. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. You may proceed. Christopher Parkinson : Great. Good morning. Mark, I want to ask what's on everybody's mind. Can you just give as much color as humanly possible on the divergence between the third and the fourth quarter? Obviously, you hit on this a little. I imagine they're things in Brazil, North America and India that are considerations. But if you could also hit on the cost aspects on a sequential basis, 3Q versus 4Q, and your confidence that 3Q would be peak, and anything else that you believe The Street should be paying attention to? Thank you so much. Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks, Chris, for the obvious question to start the ball rolling. Look, when you look at Q3 and Q4, I think we've been pretty clear on the slides and in the script that Q3 is driven really by the cost that we see flowing through the P&L. And Q4 is driven by a lack of that same increase in costs. You look at the top line, we have strong growth in Q3, round about 13% at the midpoint, yet we have 2% top line growth in Q4. What does that tell you? It tells you that our Q4 is not necessarily driven by the external environment. That EBITDA growth is all controlled from inside the company. And the reason we see this cadence in the second half is very simply when we buy raw materials, we have about a six months lag before the cost of those raw materials flow through our P&L. So for instance, the costs that we're seeing in Q3 are costs that we knew were coming back in Q1. So for us, it's not a surprise. It's a large amount, but we've continued to see that increases we've gone over the last 18 months. Now from a confidence perspective, think of the following. I just said in the script that in Latin America, in particular in Brazil, we have more orders on hand than we would normally have by a considerable degree. Why is that? Well, at the end of the day, the markets are robust. Commodity prices are still high. Brazil is getting ready for what will be a robust season. And we will continue to see acreage increase in Brazil and other parts of Latin America. We're seeing the same thing in the U.S. and Canada markets, where customers are now talking to us already about Q4 demand. That doesn't normally happen at this stage of the cycle. It's usually a month or so later than this. So we know already that we have a high degree of confidence, not only from the top line perspective in Q4, but also from a cost perspective. Why? Because we've already incurred a lot of those costs in Q2, that will hit in Q4. So we know to the vast majority of what the cost structure will be in Q4. I like to the fact that for the first time I think in probably about three years, I can tell you we're not actually managing any crises out of China. Things are flowing very well for us and our manufacturing units are operating, our suppliers are generally operating well. And we already see that flowing through. So we feel very confident about supply. The other element is price. You can see that we've raised our prices significantly as we move from midyear last year. A lot of those prices are already embedded into our cost structure and pricing structure for the third and fourth quarters. Doesn't mean to say that we're not still moving price, we are and there'll be more price increases coming. But the fact is we have a very high degree of confidence on Q4. Just a further comment on Q3. You can see the change is predominantly driven by the impact of costs that we've seen flowing through our P&L. But there is another factor. The biggest impact of our Russian exit is in Q3. And remember, we've kept our midpoint guidance of $1.4 billion, despite absorbing $25 million of lack of EBITDA from Russia. So I think that kind of gets lost in the noise here, but we are covering Russia and we haven't moved our guidance downwards. So I think that's a very positive aspect of how we're managing the P&L. So I hope that gives you a little more insight into how we feel about Q4, Q3. We're very confident of Q4. We're also very confident of our top line in Q3. Christopher Parkinson : That's very helpful color. And just as a secondary note, on Slide 10, which is very helpful, you do have a few more checks than the top end of the box, the 1.44. Can you perhaps dive in a little bit more in terms of what you're purchasing right here right now in terms of the cost inflation? Perhaps it doesn't give you the material benefit that we all want in 2022. But what is your confidence as we head into 2023? And what does that actual dynamic look like on a sequential basis? And if you just want to stack [ph] that as what you're competent in, in terms of entering the year, that would still be very helpful? Thank you. Mark Douglas : Yes. We do believe that we're at this, what we call the highest level of inflation. We are starting to see it taper off. Obviously, I've just commented that on Q4. We will expect to see that continue as we go into 2023. If that continues and our normal cadence of flow through the P&L occurs, it would be in the second half of the year that you would start to see some significant benefit from that. I doubt whether you would see it in the first half because although I'm talking about a lower inflation, costs are still high, make no mistake. So I think it's the second half of next year that we would start to see that real acceleration of lower costs. Christopher Parkinson : Thank you for the color. Mark Douglas : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. You may proceed. Joel Jackson : Maybe I'll follow up on that line of questions since Chris is right. It is the most important topic among investors right now. You said, and it was helpful that you might see the inflation really come off second half of '23 if things continue. If we're sort of entering 2023, would your margins be kind of where they've been through the first half of the year in the last couple of years, mid to high 20s, mid 20s? Like what is kind of -- because the 80% in Q3, 30% in Q4, these are really divergent numbers. What would beginning of '23 look like, 26% -- I know you don't give guidance, just what is the early '23 look like? Mark Douglas : I'm glad you know asking about the guidance, Joel. It is a little early. Joel Jackson : I know, but just early '23? Mark Douglas : Yes, I hear you. Listen, I think from a margin perspective, what you're seeing in Q3 and Q4 are pretty extremes around a midpoint. Obviously, we've got a lot of cost in Q3. And then we have the advantages of a lot of price allied to a good P&L. I do think you'll see more normalized margins for us as we go into the first half of next year. So if you look at our margins over the last, I would say, 12 months in that sort of 25% plus range, I think that's what we would expect. So I wouldn't go any further than that at this point, because frankly I don't have the numbers going into early next year. We're right in the middle of our budget process now. So kind of expect average margins as we go into the first half of next year. Joel Jackson : That's extremely helpful. And then obviously, it's complicated. And then the second question I have is with BioPhero, it's going to increase your R&D expense. Do you have some sense now what R&D expense inflation might be in '23 versus '22, solely based on BioPhero? And if you can't get that yet, can you give maybe some color around, I don't know, a number of positions, number of people, some sort of tidbit to let us figure out what the R&D increase might be, run rate might be in '23? Mark Douglas : Yes. I think when you look at BioPhero, we're acquiring about 30 people with the acquisition. All those people are essentially in R&D. There are one or two that are in manufacturing and supply chain. I do think that the expense for that, if you took a base level, something around $10 million additive to where FMC is today on an R&D expenses. Not a bad number. It's rough at this point, but that's what I would be thinking, Joel. Joel Jackson : Okay, that's helpful. It looks kind of small. Thanks a lot. Mark Douglas : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. You may proceed. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. I have two questions. Can you give a bit more detail on inventory levels regionally that you're seeing heading into the back half of the year? And then as you think about sort of the Latin American growth rate, sort of what you will be lapping going into next year given the very strong growth you've seen this year and sort of how tough will it be to lap that? Mark Douglas : Yes, I'll start with the inventories, Laurence. We're very okay with inventory levels pretty much everywhere in the world right now. I would say the only spot, and I've commented on this at the last earnings call, is there has been a significant reduction in rice acres in India. And we're working through inventory in India. That will be done as we go through the second half of the year. Everywhere else, frankly speaking, is very good from our perspective on inventory. So we're not worried about that going into the end of the year. With regards to Latin America growth, we are on a growth trajectory, because we're building out our market share in pretty much every country from Mexico, Argentina and Brazil. What's little known, we've talked about it a little bit in Brazil is our market access. We're investing in more sales resources to reach further into distribution and retail and especially with the major co-ops in the South. So the growth we're seeing is actually market share growth, especially in corn and soy with insecticides and herbicides. So I know the numbers look big in Latin America, but we really are growing very quickly and it's new growth for us. It's not necessarily repeat growth in the sense of selling to the same people, which we obviously do. We're expanding that market access. Laurence Alexander : Can you give a sense for how long you think this period of sort of reestablishing a new equilibrium will take, or how long you can have this sort of be growing well above trend before you get to sort of more stable market shares? Mark Douglas : Yes, I think we got quite a ways to go. When you look at the size of our company and you look at the market given where it is today, we have roughly 9% market share of the crop protection chemical market, with the most robust pipeline and new product introductions that are now, this year alone, the products that have launched over the last five years is $600 million of business that we will do with those new products. I expect that algorithm to continue for a considerable amount of time. We know our insecticide portfolio is very strong, and we know that we're taking share from older chemistries that are getting registration losses that we can take advantage of. So I don't see that algorithm slowing down for quite a long time, Laurence. Laurence Alexander : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Laurent Favre with BNP Paribas. You may proceed. Laurent Favre : Hi. Good morning. I've got a question, three again, on the cost side. And here I want to dig into the comment you made, Mark, around having to source from secondary or tertiary suppliers. I was wondering if you could give us some kind of idea of how big that was in the first half, for instance. Mark Douglas : In the first half, it's very difficult to say as a percentage of the raw materials that we acquire. Only I can give you an anecdote, Laurent, that is basically when I talked to my procurement groups and supply chain groups when it was second half of last year and first half of this year, the conversations were all about where are we getting materials where we're short? And that was quite a long list. In today's reviews that we have, the list is extremely short. And we very rarely talk about secondary sources at this point. So it has changed in a meaningful way over the last six months. That's about as good as I could give you from a perspective. Laurent Favre : Thank you. And then the second one is on herbicide pricing and what you're factoring in, especially as we started to see [indiscernible] prices coming down. So it's both I guess for your non-selective side, but also the selective side of the herbicide business. Do you think that price is -- are you factoring in pricing normalizing through the end of this year and into next year? Mark Douglas : No. Actually, the opposite. I think a lot of the non-selectives are in a world of their own in terms of pricing is so closely linked to the raw material costs that you do see rapid increases, which we've seen over the last 18 months. You're likely to see some decreases as those pressures alleviate. We're in a very different ballgame. We've been raising prices on the back of the value that we bring. We're raising prices as we speak in many parts of the world, and we'll continue to do so. So we do not see a deceleration of pricing. As we go over the next 6 to 9 months to 12 months, we're increasing price right now. Laurent Favre : Okay. Thank you. Mark Douglas : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Mark Douglas : Good morning. Adam Samuelson : I guess I was hoping maybe to dig in on the growth side, and if I'm looking by region, certainly the growth in North and South America were very strong. The constant currency growth in Asia was a little bit less robust. You alluded to managing inventories and declining rice acres in India. Mark, I was hoping to get just some broader color on the region. And is it just rice in India, nearly any mention of China, North Asia and just how you see competitive dynamics in that region and the market outlook there? Mark Douglas : Yes, sure. India is the main factor for us, as I said, that working through that channel inventory due to rice. I would say the ASEAN countries are continuing to grow for us, especially on rice. And fruit and vegetables are two big segments for us in those countries. Australia on cereals with the launch of the new herbicide last year is doing very, very well. We don't mention China, because it's not one of our biggest countries. Certainly, it's a sourcing point for us. But from a revenue perspective, it's north of $100 million. It's a highly competitive market. It's not a market that we consider one of our top strategic markets. We'll grow there, we'll introduce technologies, but it's not something that is driving the region. The region is really been driven by ASEAN and all the countries in ASEAN; India, Pakistan and Australia. Those are the key drivers. Now interestingly enough from a plant health perspective and a biological perspective, South Korea and Japan are very important markets, especially South Korea, as they have quite a flourishing biological industry there and a lot of very high quality fruit and vegetables which can use the biologicals. So Asia is becoming very interesting from that plant health perspective for us. Adam Samuelson : Okay, that's helpful. And if I could just have a -- squeeze another one on cost and really thinking about the movements you're seeing in natural gas and power in Europe, and you've got some important operations in Denmark. But broadly is how do we think about your comments about inflation abating and what you've assumed on the energy power side, especially in Europe, and any thoughts and risks around some of the intermediates that you might still have to source that come in one direction from Europe? Mark Douglas : Yes. So from an energy perspective or use of energy in our manufacturing facilities, all our manufacturing facilities, and especially our major one in Romlund [ph], we can use flex fuel to run the facilities. So in Romlund, we traditionally run on natural gas. Obviously, that's been curtailed, given Russian activities. We can also run on diesel fuel in Romlund and have been doing for some time. There are cost inflation elements there that are built into our overall cost structure. We have a pretty good view on what we think costs will be going forward longer term for those facilities. From a raw material perspective, I think we procure something like $200 million of raw materials out of our $2.7 billion purchases come from Germany, and we have dual sources for all those materials in other parts of the world. So from a supply perspective, we have that one pretty secured. Adam Samuelson : Okay, great. I really appreciate that color. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Mark Douglas : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrew with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Vincent Andrew : Thank you. Good morning. Just, Mark, you mentioned in the fourth quarter you'll have some new launches. And obviously, they'll have a positive impact to revenue. Maybe just want to talk a little bit about those. And then I'm also within that wondering whether 3Q is also incurring some launch costs associated with those new products that you're not going to obviously see the revenue until 4Q? Mark Douglas : Yes, the launches that are coming are mainly herbicides in Europe, which kind of start now but really pick up steam in Q4. We've got insecticides in Canada that have started now. We're seeing that growth, obviously, that will continue. And then we have quite a number of smaller products in Asia to get launched. I don't think at this point that we're seeing any lumpiness in terms of launch expense. It's pretty much built into our SG&A expense as we go through each quarter. We have a very good view of our launch schedule. So we know what's coming. We pretty much spend money on launches about two and a half years before the actual launch itself. So it's not all of a sudden a step up. It's rather a gradual spending increase as we go over numbers of quarters. So in Q3, it really is not necessarily to do with any launch expense, although there is launch expense within that SG&A number. Vincent Andrew : Okay. Thank you. And Andrew, maybe on the cash flow from operations, I'm sure it will all look a lot clearer once we see the Q. But could you just talk a little bit about sort of how the working capital played out in the first half versus how it's going to trend in the second half to get you to that 67% conversion that you're still targeting? Andrew Sandifer : Yes, sure, Vincent. I think certainly the big story in the first half in cash flow is working capital. And it's very, very substantial growth in receivables particularly, both from high volume growth but not the least from the impact of price increases. So those price increases directly inflate our receivables. So in the first half of '22, the big story and the big difference versus the prior year really is the growth in working capital. Now that said, given the positive market backdrop, we have good farmer economics around the world pretty uniformly. There are spots here and there, as always, but we're in pretty good shape. We've actually seen good collection performance. So the absolute dollars of receivables are going up, days receivables actually improved pretty meaningfully versus the prior year, with people having concerns about security supply and with very strong and very healthy grower balance sheets at the moment, we are collecting and collecting aggressively. So we will see the seasonal swing. We have a very pronounced seasonal distribution with working capital, amplified a bit more by the size of prepayments and the North America business, which really is a use of cash in the first half of the year. So in the second half with very high collections and shift from selling mode to collecting mode in many parts of the world, that will drive a big reversal and very, very strong cash from operations for the second half. Vincent Andrew : Thank you very much. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. You may proceed. Stephen Byrne : Mark, you mentioned that 70% of your LatAm orders for the second half are already in place. Do you have visibility on when that revenue will be recognized? You normally have a bigger fourth quarter in LatAm than you do in the third. Do you have view on how that's going to play out this year? Could there actually be a bit of a shift more into the fourth quarter that could be an additional contributing factor to the somewhat slow third quarter expectations? Mark Douglas : No, not really. When we kind of plan for what we call a normal season, that means in Brazil, planting starts sort of mid September to the end of September. That can shift around given weather patterns. So Q4 is obviously a big quarter for us in Latin America, not just Brazil, but Argentina. We've kind of factored that into how we look at Q3, Q4. I don't think there's anything meaningful there. Obviously, it will depend on how the weather plays out. But I think we have most of that factored into Q4 as we normally do. Stephen Byrne : And wanted to drill in a little bit more on the diamide franchise. What fraction of that revenue stream is from direct sales from FMC versus from your licensees that you have supply agreements with? And has that split between those two buckets changed in the last year as you've been growing the supply agreements? And how does that affect price? Is that a mix shift down in price? And more importantly, how does that affect EBITDA? Mark Douglas : Yes. So when you look at where we are today, we're in the range of about -- it's kind of like 60/40; 60% FMC branded products into the marketplace, about 40% through our third partners. That has obviously been growing as we've added more partners. I think it's fair to say, though, we pegged our growth rate for the diamides in sort of the high single digits. In Q2, we grew sort of mid teens, and it's pretty evenly split between both sources of income. On the price side, we don't talk about the specifics of the individual contracts that we have, obviously. But generally speaking, the EBITDA impact for us on a percent basis is neutral. So we manage it that way. So the growth for us is equally as valuable from an EBITDA perspective from either FMC or from our partners. So I would expect to see that 60/40. I would expect the 40 to continue to grow because we've got more partners on board now. They are obviously now gearing up and selling into the marketplace. I think the most important takeaway that you should take away from this conversation is the 40%, as it grows, does not detract from the 60% as we grow. It's an expansion of the market pool for the diamides. And as I alluded to earlier on one of the other questions, we see the diamides taking share from a number of older chemistries, whether they be neonicotinoids, some of the pyrethroids, and certainly some of the carbamates around the world. Stephen Byrne : Thank you. Mark Douglas : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may proceed. Aleksey Yefremov : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mark, you were talking about costs for fourth quarter and your six months kind of lag. Do you have any visibility on the first quarter? Do you expect costs to decline further from Q4 level in the first quarter of 2023? Mark Douglas : Yes, I'll let Andrew pick that one up. Andrew? Andrew Sandifer : Yes, Aleksey, I think as Mark described, since we turn inventory about twice a year, things that we buy today start flowing through our P&L two quarters out. So things that we're starting to buy now, certainly we're getting a little bit of visibility into Q1 of '23. But it's not a complete picture yet. We've not gotten through that far of the buying and some of that buying is tilted in different parts of the quarter. I do want to be very careful with the phrasing of the question and that our expectation is that costs do continue to increase, particularly in the first half of '23. They just do so at a much lower level. And what we're seeing from Q4, Q4 is the largest cost -- excuse me, Q3 of '22 this quarter, coming quarter, is the largest cost increase we've seen and the largest cost increases we expect for the year. We expect the rate of cost increase to drop down in Q4. But there still is year-on-year inflation in Q4. So at this point, what we're seeing is a flattening off in the inflation, but not necessarily yet an absolute drop off in costs. So I think for Q1, we'll continue to see our purchasing go through the rest of this quarter to see what the outlook for Q1 is, but I think at this point we still anticipate some cost headwinds in Q1 and likely into Q2, and then with the opportunities that we start seeing the swing in the second half of '23. Aleksey Yefremov : Thanks, Andrew. And as a follow up, Mark, in the first half, volume gains were roughly in the low teens, 11% or so. How are you optimizing for volume or market share versus profitability and price on the other end? And how frequently do you prioritize, if demand is this strong, why is it not worth to raise prices more at a higher profit level and gain less share or less volume, or maybe it's not optimal? Mark Douglas : Yes. Listen, I think clearly you can look at our price increases and we're targeting that high single digit price increase, and we're moving in that direction. For a company like FMC, those are unheard of price increases. Normally, we price kind of in the very low single digits to offset inflation on a general basis. I think when we're looking at the marketplace, we sell products in some of our categories that are extremely high margin products. You all know the success of the diamides, for instance. Taking volume from older chemistries with the newer chemistries adds tremendous value to the bottom line, whether you increase price or not with those products. Sometimes we do, sometimes we don't. It's a mix of decisions that are made at the local level with the overall mantra that price increases will offset cost. And that's how we've been working this year. So for us, it's somewhat of a complicated discussion inside the company. Except I would say over the last year or so, it's changed to be much more aggressive on price. We have driven price in every region of the world, more so than we ever have before. Aleksey Yefremov : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. You may proceed. Michael Sison : Hi. Good morning. Nice quarter. So when you think about your volume growth, in the second quarter it was pretty impressive, up 14%, EBITDA growth was 3% and I understand why in terms of the cost that you had on Slide 6. But just curious, of the 148 million of costs that you occurred in 2Q and maybe in the past, is any of this cost more structural than just sort of just inflation? You've had to change the way you process some of your materials, logistics are getting more. So I'm just curious how much of this cost is maybe more structural than just it might go away over time? Mark Douglas : Yes, Mike, thanks for the comment on the quarter. Listen, I do think that most of that cost is variable in the sense of its raw materials, its packaging, its logistics that will obviously ebb and flow. And we expect them to obviously decrease over time. I would say the only structural cost that's been embedded is as we're investing in SG&A resources and R&D projects that are more longer term, those are driven around the growth of the company, the market access that I talked about in places like Brazil, Argentina, India, parts of the ASEAN region, and the U.S. as well. Those are structural costs, because they're headcount, they're investments. The other investments around precision agriculture as we're growing out our precision ag apps, such as farm Ark intelligence, those are structural costs. But the vast majority is what I would call more transient. Michael Sison : Got it. And then when you think about the fourth quarter, it tends to be a quarter which has a wide range for the outcomes for EBITDA and revenue. So just curious, what do you think sort of drives the upper end and the lower end of those ranges? Mark Douglas : Well, I think from a revenue perspective, obviously, it would be what does pest pressure look like in some parts of the world? We just talked about the success we had in our North American business. As pressure in Canada was much higher than we normally forecast, that drives demand that gets used immediately. So if you have those series of events around the world that can drive you to the upper end of the range. Also, as we look to expand our market access and the success and the speed of that success, that can drive us to the upper end in terms of more market share, newer products being sold to new customers, that would drive you the same way. Michael Sison : Got it. Thank you. Mark Douglas : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. You may proceed. Josh Spector : Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess just to follow up on the second quarter and the volume outperformance, I guess optically the volumes did a lot better. The drop through was essentially pretty minimal given the cost side. I'm not really sure how much of that is higher spend on the incremental volumes or the higher costs for the base. But I'd be curious if you were to have a repeat, 3Q, 4Q volumes a lot better, should we expect a similar result in terms of the drop through, or should we expect that to be different, much better or worse, any thoughts appreciated? Thanks. Mark Douglas : Thanks, Josh. I'll let Andrew give you the details. But generally speaking, the drop through in 2Q was not far off our average. And we have a wide range of drop through because it can be affected through different reasons. Andrew, do you want to comment on that? Andrew Sandifer : Yes. Josh, I think, look, that can be a big variation and that the drop through, the contribution to EBITDA from volume relative to the contribution to revenue growth from volume. On a trailing four quarters basis, that was about 58% in Q2. The quarter itself was about 57%. So it's right in line with what we expect. Our long-term average is about 60%, which reflects the high value, the mix component of our volume growth. A reminder to everyone that in our bridges mix [ph] is in volume. You can see significant swings in that because there is lumpiness in costs increase. It's not perfect -- it's not a perfect indicator. But I think you should continue to expect that on a rolling basis that volume drop through to EBITDA should be in that 55% to 60% range for the next several quarters and beyond. Josh Spector : Thanks. I guess asked another way, the volume drop through was normal on that bar but was offset by the cost bar. So it volumes were 5%, 10% greater and you had visibility of what you bought six months ago, would you expect the volume bar to offset the cost bar if you saw volume upside in your forecast? Is there any reason why that wouldn't happen or would be different? Andrew Sandifer : Yes. Josh, I think certainly the stronger volume growth can have that pretty healthy drop through that will help offset further cost increases. I think what we've been trying to do is pace the price increases to where price increases cover as much as possible increasing COGS. And then we make up any investments in SG&A and R&D as well as FX headwinds with volume. But certainly, when you look at the second half together where we're looking at very substantial volume growth, there will be a piece of that that will help bridge the difference between the cost headwinds and what we're able to cover in price. Josh Spector : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. You may proceed. P.J. Juvekar: Yes, hi. Good morning. Your top line growth was -- organic growth was 21% in 2Q, but EBITDA was up only 3%. And you talked about your cost inflation and raw material costs and all that. I was wondering if you can just break down your raw material costs in sort of three buckets. What's sort of the inflation from AIs? What are the logistical costs? And what may be other costs, like packaging or labor? Can you just kind of break down within those three buckets? Thank you. Mark Douglas : Yes. P.J., thanks for the question. We don't normally break down those types of costs. But I would tell you that the vast majority is the active ingredients, intermediates that we buy, followed by logistics and then packaging. But by far, the biggest chunk is the whole raw material spectrum that we buy. Do you want to say anything, Andrew. Andrew Sandifer : Yes. P.J., I think, look, as Mark said, that biggest chunk is raw materials, intermediates and active ingredients we buy. I don't think there's many -- there's an overall category that I'd point to of those three big categories; raw materials, packaging and logistics. We've had substantial inflation in all of them. We've had substantial impact from disruption and the need to use secondary and tertiary suppliers in all of those. So I wouldn't point to one of those categories being disproportionately growing versus the other. P.J. Juvekar: Okay. Thank you. And my second question is on your plant health and biologicals, you acquired BioPhero, what are the areas of biologicals that you believe that you have some holes so you would like to make some acquisitions? And what are the multiples that these biologicals are being bought at these days? Thank you. Mark Douglas : Thanks, P.J. Yes, listen, we're building out the technology portfolio. Our biologicals today are really based around microbe technology. Obviously, we've extended into pheromone technology now. We also have through FMC ventures investments in peptides, which was a whole new area of potential pesticide development. We have a relationship with Novozymes developing enzymes as pesticides. So we feel we have quite a good floor of what we call basic structure around technology. That will continue. We'll continue to look for M&A opportunities, probably as much on the geographic side of biologicals as on the technology side, because market access here is important. And from a microbe perspective, there's many countries in the world where you can't import microbes that are not indigenous to that country. So therefore, you need R&D and you need development in those countries. One easy way to get that is to acquire it. So it's something we're looking at. From a multiple perspective, I haven't seen any deals go through in the near term that are indicative. But Andrew, you may have a better view of that than I do. Andrew Sandifer : Yes, P.J., just a few thoughts on multiples. A lot of the kinds of acquisition targets we are looking at in the biological space are more early stage. BioPhero, for example, were small amounts of commercial revenue, but not large scale sales yet. So multiples really not meaningful when considering the value of the acquisition. It really is a case where NPV and IRR really come into play. And certainly as we looked at the acquisition economics for BioPhero, the IRR on that transaction was multiples of our cost to capital. So even on a risk adjusted basis, very, very attractive. So we think about the types of targets that are out there that tend to be smaller companies, more early stage. So traditional EBITDA multiples are less relevant in terms of thinking about valuation. P.J. Juvekar: Great. Thank you for the color. Andrew Sandifer : Yes, absolutely. Mark Douglas : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The final question comes from the line of Tony Jones with Redburn. You may proceed. Tony Jones : Yes. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for the chance to ask a question. With all the supply chain dislocation and we've seeing this partial shift to local supply or more local production, from your perspective, have you found over the past year any sort of regional capacity mismatch? And does that have any implications for CapEx over the medium term? Thank you. Mark Douglas : Thanks, Tony. No real what I would call mismatches, although we are and we have said that we will have a much more balanced supply chain and operations structure as we go forward. When you look at our investments for the molecules that are coming in, putting feed in the ground, we're active in India, we're active in Europe. We're looking at potential toll manufacturers in -- more toll manufacturers in the Americas. So overall, I wouldn't say we have a mismatch. But certainly as the industry grows, the need for formulating capacity is something that we're investing in quite heavily, especially in the U.S. to feed our U.S. business. So I think that that notion of getting your formulating capacity as very local as you can and as close to the customer base as you can is something that's driving our strategic thinking around manufacturing and operations. Andrew, do you want to --? Tony Jones : Thanks. That's really helpful. Andrew Sandifer : Tony, I'll just add to that. When you think -- I think the second part of your question there on the CapEx piece related to this, our capital plan had envisioned building out supply chain that was more geographically diverse, and that very much a part of our thinking in terms of having multiple source points and balancing out points of supply. So that has been factored into the way we've been thinking about the CapEx stepping up over the past couple of years, including our CapEx guidance for this year. And I would just also comment when we start talking about formulation plans, that those tend to be very low capital. This is not heavy equipment. This is not chemical synthesis. It's not trivial, but they're not significant capital investments as compared to a new AI plan, for example. Tony Jones : That's great. Thanks, guys. Mark Douglas : Thanks very much. Zack Zaki : All right. That is all the time that we have for the call today. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : This concludes the FMC Corporation conference call. Thank you for attending.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Zack Zaki, Director of Investor Relations with FMC Corporation. Please go ahead. Zack Zaki : Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Mark Douglas, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. . Mark will review our third quarter performance and provide an outlook for the rest of the year as well as an early view of 2023. Andrew will provide an overview of select financial results. Following the prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our earnings release and today's slide presentation are available on our website, and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call. Let me remind you that today's presentation and discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including, but not limited to, those factors identified in our earnings release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's understanding. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion and the supporting materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations, free cash flow, net debt and organic revenue growth, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that as used in today's discussion, earnings means adjusted earnings and EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Zack, and good morning, everyone. FMC's strong growth continued in the third quarter with a robust start to the Latin American season as well as solid pricing actions across all regions driving our results. New products gained momentum in the quarter, growing 26% year-over-year. As expected, Q3 saw highest year-over-year cost inflation for 2022. Looking to Q4, we are seeing sequentially lower inflation across the supply chain. With this in mind, we expect a strong finish to the year and remain confident in our ability to deliver our fourth quarter and full year forecast. Our Q3 results are detailed on Slides 3, 4 and 5. Revenue was up 19% organically, EBITDA down 11% and EPS down 14%. As expected, these declines in the quarter were driven by the highest cost inflation this year, which more than offset the good start to the Latin American season and average global price increases of 7%. Adjusted earnings were $1.23 per diluted share in the quarter, $0.13 above the midpoint of our guidance range, with the vast majority of the outperformance driven by higher EBITDA. We delivered double-digit year-over-year growth across the portfolio, including 23% growth in herbicides, 19% in fungicides and 10% in insecticides. Third quarter sales were $1.38 billion, led by volume growth in Latin America and North America as well as price increases across all regions.  In North America, sales increased 21% year-over-year. Fungicides grew rapidly in the quarter, especially on corn in the Midwest. Overall performance in the Midwest across corn, soybeans and other crops more than offset lower diamide sales in the West due to drought conditions.  In Latin America, sales increased 35% year-over-year, led by Brazil and Argentina. With the backdrop of strong commodity prices and increasing acres, grower confidence in the region is high. Our results were driven by a robust start to the new season, with strong selective herbicide and insecticide sales, price increases and expanding market access.  FMC has been investing in expanding market access by adding commercial resources and developing new broader relationships with large cooperatives and distributors. These investments are focused on key row crops, such as soybean and corn and we are starting to realize the results benefit from these increased sales. As an example, byfenterin-based insecticides, including those used to control sting boats in soybeans with the largest growth driver in the region for the quarter.  We also successfully launched on Suva, our Fluindapyr-based fungicide for soybeans and peanuts in Argentina and Paraguay during the quarter. This is the second new molecule from FMC's pipeline following the successful introduction of Isoflex herbicide in Australia last year. Turning to EMEA. Third quarter sales were down 12% versus prior year, and we're up 1% organically. In addition to strong pricing, results were driven by increased demand for diamides on fruit and vegetables and herbicides on cereals and oilseed. FX was a significant headwind in the quarter. FMC's decision to exit the Russian market, the first major crop protection companies to do so earlier this year had an approximately $8 million negative impact on EBITDA in the quarter.  And finally, Asia was down 6% versus the third quarter last year and up 2% organically. Pricing gains were more than offset by FX headwinds. Floods in Pakistan and erratic weather in India and other countries impacted performance in the quarter. However, demand remains strong for new products based on diamides and other chemistries, and FMC continues to make significant progress in improving our market access in geographies where we are underrepresented, such as Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. Investments to expand market access have not been limited to Latin America and Asia. We have also invested in market expansions in the US, Turkey and several other countries. This is an important element of our growth strategy and includes scaling up of FMC's technical service organization, expanding our sales force, pursuing new collaborations with distribution partners and other steps that are beginning to deliver market share gains. These initiatives become even more important as we continue to introduce novel technologies that require close engagement with growers.  Overall, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $261 million, a decrease of 11% compared to the prior year period, but $6 million above the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to somewhat lower cost inflation than we previously anticipated. As forecasted, cost and FX headwinds more than offset price increases and volume gains. Average price increases of 7% contributed $85 million in the quarter. We are seeing initial signs of decelerating inflation, and we are confident that cost headwinds in '22 have peaked in the third quarter. FX was a $25 million EBITDA headwind in the quarter due to weakening of several currencies around the world.  Moving to Slide 6 and FMC's full year 2022 and fourth quarter earnings outlook. With continued strength in market demand and the success of pricing actions to help offset cost increases and FX headwinds, we are raising full year 2022 revenue to a range of $5.6 billion to $5.8 billion, representing an increase of 13% at the midpoint versus 2021. Sales growth was driven by volume and price in all regions, partially offset by foreign currency impacts. We are narrowing the full year adjusted EBITDA range to $1.37 billion to $1.43 billion, representing 7% year-over-year growth at the midpoint and reflecting the confidence in our order book and supply availability. The range for 2022 adjusted earnings per share is narrowed as well and is now expected to be $7.10 to $7.60 per diluted share, representing an increase of 7% year-over-year at the midpoint. Consistent with past practice, we do not factor in any benefit from potential share repurchases in our EPS guidance. Guidance for Q4 implies year-over-year sales growth of 8% at the midpoint compared to the prior year period. Pricing momentum and volume growth are expected to more than offset FX headwinds in the quarter. We have good visibility into demand for the quarter with strong order books for both the Brazilian and US markets. Cost increases are forecasted to be lower in Q4 compared to Q3. The combination of sales growth and lower cost headwinds is anticipated to result in EBITDA growth of 15% at the midpoint with EPS up 9% at the midpoint year-over-year. Moving now to the updated drivers of 2022 EBITDA outcomes on Slide 7. Market growth is expected to remain in the mid- to high single-digit range, and we are seeing cost inflation beginning to decelerate. We are successfully mitigating the impact of lost sales from our decision to exit Russia and have good visibility into supply to fulfill fourth quarter demand. Full year price increases of mid- to high single digit and strong volume growth are expected to more than offset cost and FX headwinds, keeping the midpoint of our guidance unchanged at $1.4 billion. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks, Mark. Let me start this morning with a quick discussion of two accounting changes we implemented on July 1. First, we changed our method for costing inventory in the United States from the Last-in, First-out or LIFO cost method to the First-in, First-out or FIFO cost method, consistent with how we account for inventory across the rest of our global business. This is the primary change made and the only one that impacts prior year reported earnings and EBITDA. Second, we changed our method of accounting for the determination of the market-related value for a class of assets within our qualified US defined benefit plan, impacting our net periodic pension costs. This change only impacts our historical GAAP results as we exclude non-operating pension charges from our adjusted results. Certain prior year amounts within the earnings tables included with our earnings release today have been recasted to reflect these accounting policy changes. Impacts to our recast and income statement are not material. Further detail on both of these changes are included in our third quarter 2022 Form 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Additionally, we have included a table in the appendix of today's slides that shows recasted adjusted EBITDA, earnings and EPS for 2021 for easy reference. There were no impacts on reported results for Q1 or Q2 2022 from these changes. With that, let's shift to a review of some key income statement items. FX was a headwind to revenue growth in the third quarter as expected, driven by weakness in European and Asian currencies, particularly the euro, Indian rupee and Turkish lira. We continue to anticipate FX headwinds for the remainder of 2022, driven by Asian and European currencies.  Interest expense for the third quarter was $41.8 million, up $8.7 million versus the prior year period, primarily due to higher short-term interest rates and to a lesser degree, higher debt balances, partially offset by savings from the refinancing activity completed in the fourth quarter of last year. With rapidly rising interest rates, especially in the United States, we now expect interest expense for full year 2022 to be in the range of $148 million to $154 million, an increase of $6 million at the midpoint compared to our prior guidance. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the third quarter was 14% in line with our continued expectation for a full year tax rate in the range of 13% to 15%. Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity. Gross debt at quarter end was approximately $3.6 billion, of nearly $390 million from year-end 2021. Gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 2.6x at the end of the third quarter, while net debt to EBITDA was 2.4x. We continue to expect full year average leverage in our targeted 2.4x to 2.5x gross or 2.3x to 2.4x net ranges.  Moving on to cash flow on Slide 8. Third quarter year-to-date free cash flow was negative $139 million. Adjusted cash from operations of $16 million was down $290 million compared to the prior year period, driven by higher working capital. Strong sales growth was the largest driver of increased cash consumption for working capital. Capital additions and other investing activities of $103 million were slightly higher than the prior year period.  Legacy and transformation spending was down $6 million, with slightly higher legacy expenses more than offset by the absence of transformation spending this year. We are lowering the range of our full year 2022 free cash flow guidance to a range of $440 million to $560 million, a reduction of $125 million at the midpoint. Adjusted cash from operations is now expected to be in the range of $650 million to $710 million, a reduction of $150 million at the midpoint compared to the prior year. Reflecting higher cash consumed by working capital than previously guided. The vast majority of the higher expected consumption of cash by working capital is due to the higher sales now expected in the fourth quarter, none of which will be collected in the current year. The remainder of the increased cash consumption stems from maintaining year-end inventory levels to support an anticipated strong start to 2023 despite the higher Q4 sales, as well as from other impacts of the current inflationary environment on working capital. Our guidance for capital additions has been reduced by $25 million at the midpoint, with capital additions now expected to be in the range of $125 million to $145 million. Legacy and transformation guidance was narrowed to a range of $40 million to $50 million, unchanged at the midpoint.  With this guidance, we anticipate free cash flow conversion from adjusted earnings of 54% at the midpoint with conversion limited this year by the impact of rapid sales growth and inflation on working capital. Rolling three-year free cash flow conversion is now expected to be 67% for 2020 through 2022, somewhat below our targeted 70% to 80%. We anticipate reverting to the targeted cash conversion range in 2023, as the impacts of this year's rapid inflation and price increases moved through our working capital. Moving on to cash deployment. No shares were repurchased in the third quarter. We paid $67 million in dividends. In the first several weeks of October, we repurchased 875,000 FMC shares at an average price of $114.22 per share for a total of $100 million. Year-to-date, we have deployed roughly $490 million of cash, approximately $190 million for the BioPhero acquisition, $200 million in dividends and $100 million in share repurchases completed in October. We paid an additional $67 million in dividends on October 20, and we expect to return up to additional $100 million to shareholders through share repurchases in the remainder of the fourth quarter, for a total of up to approximately $470 million in cash returned to shareholders and approximately $660 million of total cash deployed in 2022. With that, I'll hand the call back to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Andrew. Turning to Slides 9 and 10. I want to provide an early look at the key market and cost dynamics underpinning our emerging view of next year. Soft commodity prices remain robust and stock-to-use ratios for key crops remained below the average for the past decade, growers around the world will continue to rely on our advanced technologies to deliver high yields while they combat erratic weather and persistent drought conditions. As a result, we expect the overall crop protection market will grow in the low to mid-single-digit range next year on a US dollar basis. This favorable backdrop, combined with our continued pricing actions, strong demand for our newest technologies and further market access gains will provide solid support for profitable growth in 2023. There have been significant cumulative cost and FX headwinds to EBITDA over the past couple of years, which we intend to recoup through pricing and lower costs going forward. Clearly, all the recovery will not take place within a single year, but we expect to shift to improving margins in the second half of 2023. Headwinds to the top line will come from FX volatility as well as a normal range of registration losses, potential factors that could drive 2023 revenue higher include stronger market growth, better pricing or product mix and a reduction in FX volatility. On the supply front, we expect greater stability as we continue diversifying our raw material sources and experience fewer disruptions. Input cost inflation is expected to decelerate, and hence, input costs are expected to become a year-over-year tailwind in the second half of the year. In fact, we are already seeing improvements in the availability and cost of logistics. Regarding internal costs, SG&A and R&D expenses will grow at or below the rate of sales growth. Investments will be focused on commercializing new products, expanding market access and developing new chemical and biological solutions. Potential factors that could drive 2023 EBITDA higher include faster-than-expected easing of input costs and the potential for improved SG&A leverage. Taking all of this into consideration, we expect FMC's growth momentum will continue throughout next year with margin expansion in the second half of 2023. To conclude, the second half of 2022 is playing out is largely as forecasted. We delivered solid results in the third quarter, despite peak cost headwinds. For full year 2022, we expect to deliver another record performance. FMC has thrived in a year of unprecedented challenges. Our team successfully navigated logistics bottlenecks around the world. We have made steady progress derisking our global supply base, which we will continue to do next year. We have maintained disciplined controls on discretionary spending, and at the same time, we continue to invest in the future with the acquisition of BioPhero which enhances our biologicals platform as well as increased investments in R&D. Finally, our continued investments to expand FMC's market access in key regions and countries are producing strong results and market share gains. Looking to 2023, we are optimistic based on what we see at this point. Crop Protection fundamentals appear to be positive for next year, which bodes well for market demand across our existing portfolio.  New product introductions based on our latest technologies as well as new biological solutions are doing extremely well and they will drive mix improvement. We are seeing signs of raw materials, logistics and supply challenges will continue to ease next year, providing a positive tailwind to margins in the second half of 2023. Once again, when we look at the full picture for 2023, we remain upbeat on market fundamentals and the performance we expect to deliver.  I'll now turn the call back to the operator for questions Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Laurent Favre with BNP. Your line is now open. Laurent Favre : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Mark, my question is regarding the cost inflation you're talking about for H1 and you're starting to have visibility on this. I was wondering if you could talk about the magnitude of this inflation, which it seems to me that it's so much that you're not confident to grow the margins for the full year. I think the choice of what is interesting, you're talking about margin expansion in H2, not for the full year. So, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about this? Thank you. Mark Douglas : Yes, certainly, Laurent. Well, first of all, let me clear up that little misunderstanding. We do expect margins to improve as we exit 2023 versus where we are today in 2022. So margins will improve next year. I think that's an important point because we have been talking about first half versus second half, but full year will be positive. Obviously, we've described quite a few times how costs flow through our P&L. The materials that we're buying in the second half of this year give us very good insight into the costs for the first half of next year.  And we are seeing costs still higher than they were, but the rate of increase is slowing down, and that's very important because what that tells us is that as we enter the first half of next year, the materials that we will be buying and the cost of flow through the P&L in the second half of the year will be lower. So that's how we see the first half, second half. So costs go from being somewhat of a headwind in the first half to somewhat of a tailwind in the second half. Now when we talk about the full year, we don't have a budget at this point. So we are giving what we describe as an early look at next year. I think, though, that when you think about our five-year plan that we put in place in 2018, our top line of 5% to 7% growth and now 7% to 9% growth on the bottom line, they're very much where we're thinking we can be next year.  And when you think about the slides that we put out there in terms of the cost dynamic and the market dynamics, market dynamics are pretty positive for us. So if you think about the following : if you think about price up next year in the sort of low to mid-single-digit range, you think of volume the same in the low to mid-single-digit range. You've got some registration losses. And you've got a market that's growing in the low to mid-single-digit range. You take that, you take an FX headwind probably in the low to mid-single digits, it's quite easy to see as being within the middle to the upper end of that 5% to 7% range, and that's how we're sort of modeling it at the very early stages. We described in the slides things that can move us up and down and if we're in that range, then obviously, we're going to get EBITDA leverage, and you should see EBITDA in that 7% to 9% range as well as improved margins. So the algorithm works, I'm confident in what we see in terms of our own portfolio, new product introductions coming in next year. It is a volatile world, but we are pretty confident about what we see next year, Laurent. Laurent Favre : Thanks, Mark. And as a follow-up regarding more Q4 and a wide range. I was wondering if the uncertainty there is more about how much of an early season you get into 2023 in the northern hemisphere or to what extent in the southern hemisphere? You have had an incredible Q3, and inventories might be a bit high. And so therefore, Q4 volumes might be maybe a little bit, I guess, at risk. Mark Douglas : Yes -- no, seriously, we have a range for a reason. We don't necessarily see that range as wide. There are a lot of things going on in the world right now, as we all know. I would say the season in Latin America, as we've said, has started well. We planned for that in Q3. We took advantage of that. We expect it to continue in Latin America as we go through Q4 and Q1. It is a strange time of the year because not only is the Latin American season in full swing, but things are moving in North America, things are starting to move in Europe ahead of the season. So it's a time of volatility in demand. And as we've said before, we tend to look at the years in two halves. Well, that applies to Q4 and Q1. So yes, there is a range there, but we don't consider it too broad. We're confident of our ability to deliver on Q4, looks good in Latin America, looks good in North America and Europe is gearing up well. So overall, I think the midpoint is where we said we would be for the full year, and we really haven't changed the second half at all. You've seen that in the numbers. It's going to be a good second half for us. So I think the range is appropriate for what we see in terms of what's going on in the world. Laurent Favre : Okay. Thank you, Mark. Operator : Our next question comes from Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Your line is now open. Christopher Parkinson : [Technical Difficulty] Top-down perspective on the growth rates for the diamides, plant health, on new products, including Cyazypyr [ph]. And just -- I think you said registration losses would be more or less in line with historical averages. Just any preliminary thoughts on how we should be thinking about that throughout the balance of 2023. Thank you very much. Mark Douglas : Yes. Chris, could you just repeat the first piece of your question? We didn't hear it. Christopher Parkinson : Oh, I'm sorry. No, I was just asking you to potentially parse out your preliminary thoughts on growth rates for the diamides, your plant and health portfolio and new products just broad-based thinking of how you're assessing that. Thank you. Mark Douglas : Thanks, Chris. Yes. So let me take the diamides first. This year, year-to-date, we're up in the high mid-single digits. We would expect that same growth rate next year as we go forward. We're getting new registrations, especially for Cyazypyr. That market is growing rapidly in many parts of the world, which is good news. On new products, the new products are about $600 million this year in terms of overall revenue. We're about 10% of revenue. We would expect that to increase next year. I don't have the exact amount, but I would expect it to move upwards in terms of overall revenue, certainly given the strength of what we've seen over the last couple of years with new product introductions. And then the plant health business is doing extremely well. It's growing north of 20% this year. Biological is growing even faster than that. I would expect that business to continue growth of north of 20% as we go into next year, driven mainly by biologicals.  So overall, that whole new product mix that we have going through the business is getting stronger every year. And it's interesting when you think about it, we closed the DuPont deal five years ago this week, which is frankly hard to believe, but the $600 million of what we call products launched in the last five years have all been put in the marketplace since that acquisition. So, it just shows the power of that innovation engine that we have, and it's certainly been accelerating as we've gone over those 5 years. So more to come from that pipeline, but hopefully, that gives you sort of a flavor of how the 3 pieces fall out. Christopher Parkinson : That's very helpful. And just as a quick follow-up, if we aggregate the quarterly cost headwinds, so the recent $169 million in Q3, you got plus or minus 3.79% year-to-date. A part of that is raw materials part of that, I believe, transportation logistics. And part of that is also, correct me if I'm wrong, operating on getting \u2013 procuring certain raw materials that are off contract. In addition to this, let's say, standardized the potential for raws to roll over, how should we think about the other parts of that, so in terms of optimizing procurement from your core suppliers and then also transportation in terms of freight costs and everything else. Just if you have any other details on that, that would also be incredibly helpful? Thank you. Mark Douglas : Yes. I'll give you a high level view and then Andrew, if you want to make a couple of comments. Listen, I think we've been in such a period that we've never seen before in terms of volatility and movement in supply that we're very hopeful that as we get into 2023, we're starting to enter into more of a stable environment in terms of how we operate, that has many benefits. Obviously, stress on the organization is an important one.  But second is cost because it allows us to go back and get materials from what we call our prime resources where we have the best conditions, the best terms, the best pricing. We are seeing, and I just said it in the script, we are seeing logistics costs freeing up. Obviously, we're all pretty much aware that the world is entering into a recessionary period, there is less goods moving around the world. What does that mean? It means container space is freed up. It means lower maritime shipments. We're seeing lower cost for road freight in different parts of the world and where we sparingly use air freight, those costs are coming down as well. So we are seeing the whole cost complex around logistics getting better. Andrew, do you want to make any other comments? Andrew Sandifer : Yes. I think we've talked in the past about the makeup of our cost headwinds. The largest piece being active ingredients or the intermediate used to produce them. Those are very specific to FMC into our product mix. So, while certainly, I think people are seeing some cost turning in certain commodity chemical categories, for example, given the nature that most of our cost headwind has really been around the supply/demand dynamics and disruption of availability for these very specialized intermediates and active ingredients that we purchased. That decrease in disruption that Mark referenced is starting to give that benefit of allowing us to reconcentrate purchases back on strategic suppliers. And that's where we're expecting to see the turn. That is our biggest cost bucket these raw materials that for active ingredients and the intermediates. It's also the slowest to flow through our P&L. So that's why it takes the longest time to react to changes. But we do see some good reasons to be optimistic there. Packaging is our second largest -- much smaller, but second largest cost bucket. It's still very mixed, where we've seen some reduction in input raw material costs in certain parts of the world, but still some disruptions in availability. It's still a mixed area for us and an area where we are optimistic to see improvement going into 2023. And then as Mark commented, certainly on logistics, which is the smallest of the three buckets, but the one that flows through our PL most quickly, we are seeing some signs of improvement both in ocean and air as well as in rail in terms of availability and cost. Christopher Parkinson : Very helpful. Thank you so much. Mark Douglas : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to follow up on the price comments for 2023. If I've got my math right, you guys have been achieving high single-digit pricing year-to-date, very strong. It seems like you've got a good uptake from your customers. So if you're talking about low single-digit into next year, I assume that that's a new round of pricing that you're anticipating introducing. And I'm just wondering because it's only early November, and you don't have your plan yet. Is that just sort of a placeholder and you haven't decided exactly how much price it takes for next year, or just sort of what is the pricing philosophy for next year? And does it vary by region? Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks, Vincent. Yes, it does vary by region. And it varies in the method of how we implement prices in certain parts of the world, such as Europe or the US, we have a price book that goes out before the season starts, and all sales are based upon those price books. Now over the last two years, we had actually changed mid-season because of just the scale of what we see. In other parts of the world like Latin America, the cost and the prices moved constantly. So it's not as if you have a price, you're moving prices constantly. So the way we see next year, we are definitely moving prices. We already have in the US. We are in Europe as well. We're also moving in parts of Asia. So we're on the track to recoup the EBITDA that we've had the compression with over the last couple of years. And as I said, we're not going to get that all back in one year. So 2023, 2024 will be the years of us coming down the other side of that curve as we hold price and raise price in certain parts of the world. So yes, I think the basic answer is, we continue to be aggressive on price. We've had margin compression that we don't like, and we're going to get those margins back. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And then just on the new market initiatives, obviously, I know this has been a important initiative, and now you're starting to see the results. And I'm just wondering, as you see those results, is it sort of creating new opportunities or new lines of sight on other things you can do within those markets with other molecules, just is the opportunity set broadening, I guess, is my question. Mark Douglas : Yes. Listen, I think once you start down the road of expanding where you're actually selling then growth rates accelerate, and that's what we've seen. I'll just give you a little factoid that we talked about growth in Latin America being very strong. 50% of our growth in Brazil in the third quarter was our new market access. So what does that basically mean? It means we're selling onto new acres that we never sold them to before. We're selling to broader distributors and co-ops with deeper relationships. And we're selling a portfolio that is somewhat different to what we've sold before. For instance, I talked about the bifenthrin based products for [indiscernible] that is a big problem in the Brazilian soybean market and we have the best solution there.  So we're expanding our sales into new areas. US is another good example. We've added a number of salespeople and tech service people over the last 12 months. That means we're calling on more retailers. We're calling on different distribution outlets, and we're getting our portfolio into hands that have never been in there before. So, when you think about FMC's price and volume growth, that volume growth is not to the same customers. The volume growth is going to new people, new markets, new acres, new crops that we've not been on before. So, we see that as something very positive. And I would say we're at the beginning of a multiyear asset by FMC to really improve our market access, which will improve our market share and profitability. I'm very happy with what I see today. Obviously, we have to train new sales people. We have to train tech service. But you know what, within a 12-month period, good salespeople start to get returns, and we're seeing that now. Vincent Andrews : Sounds great. Thank you very much. Mark Douglas : Thanks Vincent. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with VRP. Your line is now open. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. Mark, I think you've closed on the BioPhero deal and owned it for maybe three or four months at this point. So can you provide an update on what you're seeing in that business and your level of confidence in the strategy to leverage the technology across major crops with an eye towards your goal of $1 billion in sales by 2030? And more broadly, what are you seeing in the pipeline as it relates to future inorganic growth potential for your biologicals platform? Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks, Kevin. It's hard to believe that we've owned the business for three or four months, there's been a lot of progress. First of all, on integration. Integration has gone very smoothly. The good news is that our biologicals platform and plant health platform is based in Copenhagen, which is where BioPhero are based, and we're only about kilometers apart from each other. So that's working really well. There's been very good dialogue there.  I think the most important thing that I can tell you is that we made our first commercial sales in the last three to four months. We made our first commercial batches of one product, and we've actually scaled up a second product. So the timing was very good for us. It allowed us to integrate and get the first commercial sales, that's an important step to prove that the technology works and customers are willing to buy that technology is very important. The pipeline is pretty much as what we said it was. We have five products in research today and then moving through at the rate that we would expect. I think the most important other aspect is manufacturing strategy. This is fermentation and it is new technology to FMC. Our manufacturing groups are hiring people right now with fermentation capabilities to augment what BioPhero have and we're making great progress on our strategy for where are we going to manufacture? Are we going to do it ourselves or we doing it with third parties? Is it a combination? So all of that is going very well. Second part of your question, Kevin, regarding the inorganic opportunities for M&A. We do have a number of targets that we're looking at today from a plant health perspective. They are based around the biologicals platform. I'm not going to say any more than that, except that this is, and I've said it in numerous times, this is an area of focus for FMC, not only from an M&A perspective, but from our ventures group as well. I think many of you know that we set up a ventures group about 2.5 years ago. Actually, BioPhero was one of the first companies that we ever invested in. We do have other investments in peptides that are going very well. These are new areas for biologicals to be used as pesticides. So I expect to see more from us on that M&A front. Kevin McCarthy : Thank you for that. And then secondly, if I may, are you seeing inventory levels that you would describe as outlying either in terms of being too high or too low in any of your major markets nowadays. A \u2013 Mark Douglas : Well, I think generally speaking, overall, we would say we're happy where inventory levels are in the marketplace. There are pockets of higher inventories. We talked about India before. The last few years, with the weather monsoons played out and rice acreage reductions, have not been great. So we're working through inventory there. I would say in the US, things are fine. Europe is pretty okay for us. one or two pockets in the South because of the dry weather that we had last year. I would say in Latin America, there are parts of Brazilian market where they had a drought last year that you can imagine inventories are high. Inventories are high right now in Brazil because we're in the planting season. But we're happy with where our inventories are right now. Kevin McCarthy : Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Joel Jackson with BMO. Your line is now open. Joel Jackson : HI, Mark. You're not going to like this question, but I'm going to try. I'm going to connect the dots to what you said so. You said you\u2019re on pace to hit the five year target that you set in 2018 for 2023. If I take 8%, if your 2018 EBITDA CAGR that, that's about 1.6-something billion EBITDA next year. Then I think you said well, but you're on pace for 8% or nothing you say wouldn't take out of the range, that normal 7% to 9% growth rate off of this year, that would imply $1.5 billion EBITDA next year. Can you clarify your comments, please? A \u2013 Mark Douglas : Yes. I think maybe you misunderstood, Joel. I said that next year, we would have in the range of 5% to 7%, 7% to 9%. When you look at the five-year average, we're at about 6.5% revenue growth, and we're slightly below the EBITDA number for the last four years. I think we're about -- we're at 1.4%. And I think our forecast for 2022 in the long-range plan was 1.45%. But if you back out Russia, we're up 1. 425 billion, so we're $25 million below on $1.45 billion. That's not a lot. So when you think about the significant costs we've had -- and I think through the planning period, we're over $1 billion of cost in FX, Andrew, is that correct? Andrew Sandifer : Right? And EBITDA, I think, Joe, just to put a couple of markers down, with our five-year goals, at the midpoint of our guidance for this year, revenue would be 7.4% compounded. So above the high end of our 5% to 7% range that we target over that time period. EBITDA is just about 6% at the midpoint. And as Mark pointed out, that's after swallowing $25 million in lost EBIT in -- by the exit of our Russian business absent that decision a little bit better. I think the comments earlier in the call and in the script are been Mark made around the 5% to 7%, 7% to 9%, very specifically to single year 2023. We think that relationship of top line and bottom line, where the top line grows at a multiple of the overall market with a balance of pricing and volume, and where the bottom line grows faster and we see margin expansion, particularly in the second half, as we've discussed some of those dynamics is the right way to be thinking about 2023.  But I'll echo Mark's earlier comment. We don't have a budget yet. We're in the midst of that roll-up process. This is from working through that process and I think a recognition of a very strong market backdrop that we're operating in right now. And I think a good \u2013 some good signs of momentum in the right direction around costs and continued strength with volume. Joel Jackson : Okay. And then my follow-up would be, I guess, a little bit small two-parter. So I think CapEx went down $25 million this year. Would that mean we're going to have more CapEx next year? And then if you've got inflation hurting net working capital this year that's brought down your free cash flow, are you expecting next year to have some very positive tailwinds on net working capital and free cash flow? Andrew Sandifer : So let me hit both pieces. I think, yes, we did bring down the midpoint of our CapEx guidance this year by about $25 million. That's really driven by availability of materials and labor to do the projects we had in the pipeline. We still think $150 million to $175 million is the right range, steady state for our business and it's also limited by our own internal capability to execute. So I don't expect some big step up in CapEx next year. But $150 million to $175 million is probably a more normalized range looking to '23 and beyond. In terms of the working capital impacts on cash flow, look, we're dealing with massive cost inflation and large price increases at the midpoint, $650 million in sales growth this year. Given our cash cycle, it's going to take a little while to catch back up and have that flow all the way through and be collected. With the higher sales in Q4, the dynamics of the -- where the markets we sell in, in Q4, so that you don't collect on those sales in the same quarter. So that's the reason for the decrement down in free cash flow this year. And as I commented in the script, and I'll echo here, we do expect to revert back to the more normal 70% to 80% conversion range next year as we work through some of that and catch up on some of that inflation on working capital. We are still expecting some inflation in cost next year. We are expecting to continue raising prices next year but at a lower rate. So it should not be the same substantial headwind in cash that we have this year. It really is that just catching up on very, very rapid inflation and price escalation that's hitting our working capital in the short term. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Adam Samuelson : Thank you, good morning everyone. Maybe following up on Joel's line of questioning on the growth. And I'm just trying to connect this concept of price cost and FX has been a kind of multiyear headwind to the business and this idea that you do think there is potential to catch up. And I just want to just clarify because that does actually occur. I presume that would get you to a year where you have scope to exceed that kind of 7% to 9% EBITDA growth algorithm. And especially, I'm trying to think on a year-on-year basis, there's the absence of these secondary supplier sourcing, which are incremental costs you're incurring to drive volume that are difficult to recoup. The absence of that could be bigger tailwind. I'm just trying to connect kind of if we can actually -- when can we actually think -- get at caught up on price cost, FX kind of the net of those three, which has been pretty sizable headwind for the last couple of years. A \u2013 Mark Douglas : Yes. Well, I think we've been pretty explicit that I would say we're starting to see some of that in Q4, and we'll see more of it as we start to go through next year. But I think where you see the real turn is the second half of the year because at that point, we will be continuing to benefit from the price increases. And at that point, if everything goes as we think it should go, then prices will actually be coming down in the second half of the year for raw materials, logistics, et cetera. So that's when we should start to see that acceleration of margin, and you will see that continuing through 2024. So it's really 6 months out from now, although we're starting to see the first signs of it now. Andrew, would you want to add anything? Andrew Sandifer : Yes. Adam, I would just add, I think as you think about expectations for 2023, in particular, as Mark pointed out, that shift in cost from being a headwind to a tailwind is likely second half. And then just the nature of catching up on that cumulative price cost, FX relationship, that's going to take more than a year to do, and Mark had commented that in our prepared comments. That is not something that's just going to switch back immediately. We will continue raising prices. We'll continue holding prices as costs begin to decelerate and turn the other direction, that's when we'll see the margin to catch up and the catch up on that relationship. So could next year be better than 7% to 9% at the bottom line? Possible. Again, we don't have a budget yet. But what we do feel very confident about is that relationship between top line growth at a multiple of the overall market driven by a balance of volume and pricing, with leverage to the bottom line, particularly in the second half next year as we get to a reversal of the cost direction that we've had for past multiple years, that, I think, is something we can feel very confident about going into 2023, even in the absence of a full budget. Adam Samuelson : Got it. And I appreciate you don't have a full budget, so this will be something that will get much closer scrutiny kind of through the next few months and the year outlook in February. But on the SG& A and R&D side and looking at the way you find the cost dynamics, you talk about labor cost inflation, which is evident, but continued investments across kind of all your key kind of investment areas. Is there any notable or sizable step-up on the SG&A and R&D side that in excess of some of the broader inflation that we're seeing that we should be contemplating? A \u2013 Mark Douglas : No, I don't think so, Adam. We're investing in R&D at an appropriate rate right now. That will step up next year as obviously we continue. We're introducing new products into our pipeline. Precision Ag is getting the appropriate funding and that is growing well for us. And then on the SG&A side, we will not slow down on the market access investments around the world. And then we have the inflationary rates that we see for people costs around the world as we go into next year. But I don't think there's anything there that I would call a step up. Andrew, I don't think there's anything. Andrew Sandifer : No. I think at this point, I've just guided that we would expect SG&A and R& D to grow no faster than sales. That would allow plenty of room to continue funding the investments Mark has described to deal with inflation. And then on the SG&A side, in particular, we're continuing to drive leverage out of our back office. We are making investments in customer-facing market access areas of SG&A, but in more of the back office business process part of SG&A, we're working very hard to continue to drive efficiencies out of the business. So that kind of leverage on sort of back office SG&A you should also expect to continue. Adam Samuelson : Super helpful. Thanks Mark Douglas : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Stephen Byrne : Andrew, just a couple of minutes ago, you made a comment about expecting further cost inflation in the first half of next year. Is that just a year-over-year comment, or do you expect inflation sequentially from here? I raised that as we've heard about some actives being sourced from China that have already deflated significantly. So can you comment on where are your raws inflation in the third quarter year-over-year? And are you seeing a difference between whether you're sourcing those raws and actives from China versus other parts of the world? Andrew Sandifer : Steve, I think great point. Let's let me parse that in a couple of pieces. First, when we're talking, we've been talking about inflation year-on-year change. So we expect there to be year-on-year increase in our costs in the first half of next year, principally based on what we are seeing in raw material, active ingredient intermediates that we are entering purchase orders for right now.  Now I think we've tried to highlight, and let me reemphasize, we can only speak to the mix of things we buy. We are aware and have seen market data on a number of more generic commodity active ingredients are being sourced out of China, where there have been some announced price decreases. We are buying, for example, intermediates for diamides, which are highly specialized and have very few, if no other commercial uses and very limited number of suppliers, that dynamic may be FMC specific. I will say this, again, we are seeing a decelerating rate of inflation as we look into the first half, although costs will be up year-on-year. And as we \u2013 that gives us confidence and as we continue to look at how supply disruptions are resolving and how they \u2013 our ability to, again to ship more production back to revert suppliers and concentrate the buy a bit relative to what we've been doing in the past several quarters, gives us confidence that we're going to see this benefit going into the second half.  So again, I think cost inflation should be lower in Q4 than it was in Q3. It should be lower than the first half next year than it was in Q4, still up year-on-year. And as we get into the second half, we start to get to a positive year-on-year comparison. Does that help? Stephen Byrne : It does. So what were raws inflation year-over-year in the third quarter? And maybe more broadly, what limits you from being able to push price not more than 7% to close that gap? Are you seeing any erosion and discipline from competitors, or is it certain regions of the world or certain ag economies that really represent the challenge on pushing price more than that? Mark Douglas : No, I don't -- it's Mark here. I don't think so. I think we're in the high single digits. That's a lot of price when you're at our size and especially with our EBITDA margins. So for us, it's not -- you're never going to get all of this back in one or two quarters. The costs flow over a period of time and you work your way through back on a same sort of principle.  At the end of the day, we are a fine and specialty chemical company. We're not a commodity chemical company. So it takes us a little bit to get it on one side. But on the other side, we keep it. And I think that's an important asset that you have to remember. I think Andrew outlined pretty well, the inflationary aspect that we're thinking through. But for me, I think the way we're growing the business, and don't forget this year is going to be a record year for us. I think we're taking the appropriate actions on price and we'll continue to do so. And in addition, we're gaining market share by our market access activities. So I think the two combined produce very strong results. Andrew Sandifer : And I think, Steve, just one last comment there. You have to think about maintaining that, if we continue to have effective full year price increase next year and the second half where costs are declining, you get that -- you're starting to get real margin recovery. So raising prices into that are -- we're basically trying to set the price where we can hold it and hold that margin as costs begin to decelerate and recoup the margin with decelerating costs and the stickiness of those price increases. As Mark mentioned, that's very much the hallmark of a specialty business as opposed to a commodity business. Stephen Byrne : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Artem Chubarov [ph] with Redburn. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for taking my questions. I think we've already touched on that a bit. But getting back to your full year guidance of low to mid-single-digit growth, is that correct to assume that you're penciling in low single-digit price increase, or is it more like the mid- or high single-digit growth? Would you have any comments on that, please? Thank you. A \u2013 Mark Douglas : Yes, I think I said it earlier at the beginning, when we think about next year, pricing in that low to mid-single-digit range, volume in the low to mid-single-digit range is appropriate for how we're thinking our early thinking for next year. So if you're specifically focused on price, I would think in that low to mid range. Unidentified Analyst : All right. Thanks very much. Just wanted to confirm that. Thank you. A \u2013 Mark Douglas : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is now open. Josh Spector : Yes. Hey, guys. Good morning. Two quick ones, if I may. Just when you talked about diamides gaining momentum in Asia, is there a way to think about the penetration of those products in that market versus the rest of the world and the runway there? And when you talk about increased market access in Latin America, have those people and costs have been put in place and now you're going to reap the benefit of that, or is that something where costs are still ramping? Thanks. A \u2013 Mark Douglas : Thank you. Yes, most of -- taking the second one first. Most of the costs have already been embedded in the Latin American business, and we'll see those benefits. We've seen them already, but we'll see them accelerate as we go through next year. On the diamides in Asia, listen, there's two very big markets for us, rice and fruit and vegetables and pretty much every country grows rice and pretty much every country grows fruit and vegetables. Diamides in Asia is our biggest market, about 50% of the diamides sold in Asia. So you could think about pretty much every country are our major markets and rice and key ones Josh Spector : Okay. Thank you. A \u2013 Mark Douglas : Thank you. Operator : That was our last question. So I'll pass the call back over to the management team for closing remarks. End of Q&A: Zack Zaki : Yes, there are no more closing remarks. That is all the time that we have for the call today. Thank you, and have a good day. Operator : That concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Zack, and good morning, everyone. FMC delivered record performance in the quarter, driven by a combination of robust volume growth and strong pricing actions. Sales of new products continue to accelerate nearly doubling year-over-year and representing 11% of the total sales in the quarter. We continue to make investments in expanding our market access in key geographies, including the U.S. and Brazil. Pricing actions in the quarter more than offset headwinds from both cost and FX, resulting in EBITDA margin expansion in excess of 40 basis points. This positive gap between price gains and headwinds from cost and FX and is expected to continue as we move forward through 2023. Agricultural markets remain robust with high commodity prices, increasing acreage for crops and positive grower sentiment, providing a solid backdrop for FMC. Our Q4 results are detailed on Slides 3, 4 and 5. Revenue was up 17% organically, EBITDA up 17% and EPS up 12%. The U. S. and Brazil were major contributors to the quarter's results, with volume and price driving the U.S. business, while price and FX drove Brazil's results. Adjusted earnings were $2.37 per diluted share in the quarter, $0. 07 above the midpoint of our guidance range. With this outperformance driven by higher EBITDA and lower-than-anticipated taxes. In North America, sales increased 35% year-over-year, driven by strong sentiment among growers and our distribution partners in the U.S. for the upcoming season. Selected herbicides for soybeans and other crops as well as fungicides for corn grew rapidly in the quarter. We have made great progress in revitalizing our North American product portfolio with almost 20% of the quarter's branded sales coming from products launched in the last 5 years. We have also invested in more sales and tech service resources, enabling us to reach more retailers to promote our newest technologies and expand our market access. In Latin America, sales increased 13% year-over-year and 9% organically, led by Brazil. Pricing actions, demand for our fungicides and selective herbicides as well as our investments in market access drove results for the region. Our market access investments contributed to about 50% of the region's growth in the quarter. FX was also a benefit in the quarter, driven by the strong BRL. However, dry weather negatively impacted corn and soy in Southern Brazil and Argentina. Asia was flat versus the fourth quarter last year and up 12% organically. Insecticides and selective herbicides led the growth in the region. Overwatch herbicide, which is based on Isoflex, the first active from our pipeline, continues to gain share on cereals in Australia. Almost 20% of branded sales in Asia came from products launched in the last 5 years. FX was a significant headwind in the quarter, offsetting the double-digit organic growth. EMEA was up 7% versus prior year and up 20% organically. In addition to strong pricing, results were driven by broad-based demand, especially for cereal herbicides. 13% of branded sales in the quarter came from products launched in the last 5 years and sales of [indiscernible] formulations almost doubled in the quarter. In our Plant Health business, Biologicals grew double digits in the quarter, reflecting the strength of our portfolio. Overall, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $432 million, an increase of 17% compared to the prior year period, resulting in EBITDA margin expansion in excess of 40 basis points. Average price increases of 8% contributed $109 million in the quarter and more than offset the cost and FX headwinds. Moving to Slide 6 in FMC's full year 2022 results. We reported record $5.8 billion in revenue which reflects a 15% increase on a reported basis and 18% organic growth. This is despite exiting our Russian business earlier in the year. More than $600 million in sales came from products launched in the last 5 years, growth of 50% over the previous year and about $100 million came from products launched in 2022, continuing the multiyear trend of strong growth from new technologies. Diamides grew in the mid- to high single-digit range for the year. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.407 billion, an increase of 7% compared to 2021, despite $463 million in cost headwinds and $74 million in FX headwinds. Exiting Russia negatively impacted our EBITDA by approximately $25 million. The benefit from pricing actions in the year was $372 million. This was necessary to overcome the most significant input cost headwinds we have ever experienced. We believe input cost headwinds peaked in the third quarter and expect them to ease going forward. 2022 adjusted earnings were $7.41 per diluted share, an increase of 8% versus 2021. This increase was driven primarily by the EBITDA increase and lower share count, offset partially by higher interest expenses and taxes. In addition to these financial results, we also had other significant achievements in the year as detailed on Slides 7 and 8. FMC continues to make substantial progress on our sustainability and net zero goals. For example, we reduced Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions at our operating sites by at least 2% in the last year, while at the same time, delivering record growth. The consistent progress we have made on various ESG metrics was recognized by several raters that moved us up on their rankings in 2022. FMC now stands at or above industry average across these raters. In our Plant Health business, we launched 17 new biological products spread across all 4 regions as well as 2 new micronutrient products. We also acquired BioPhero in 2022. As we've said before, BioPhero is a pioneer in biologically produced pheromone technology with a patented fermentation platform that enables significantly lower cost production compared to current standards. In Precision Ag, we continue to advance our Arc Farm Intelligence platform, FMC's proprietary mobile solution that helps farmers manage pest pressure through predictive modeling. Arc is now deployed across 20 million acres spanning over 20 countries, and we have found the growers who use Arc are tending to buy a broader range of products from FMC. Finally, our venture capital arm, FMC Ventures continued to build its portfolio in 2022 with new collaborations and strategic investments in start-ups and early-stage companies, working on new or disruptive technologies. These engagements, which support or augment our internal capabilities span several technology segments, including robotics, drone technology, ag fintech, pathology detection, soil health, peptides and pheromone. As an example, in 2022, FMC Ventures increased its investment in Micropep, the start of developing short natural peptide molecules that target and regulate plant genes and proteins. In addition to our equity investment, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Micropep late last year to develop solutions to control herbicide-resistant weeds. FMC Ventures also invested in Traive, an ag fintech startup, addressing working capital needs of growers in Brazil. Turning to Slide 9, which provides the key market and cost dynamics underpinning our 2023 outlook. We expect crop commodity prices to remain robust and that growers around the world will continue to rely on our advanced technologies to deliver high yields while they combat erratic weather patterns. We expect the North American market to grow in the low single-digit range with an assumption of normal weather conditions. The Latin American market is believed to have grown significantly in 2022 primarily due to rapidly price increases in nonselective herbicides, a product segment in which FMC does not participate. In 2023, we expect the Latin American market to contract by mid-single digits as some of those gains in nonselective herbicides reverse. Asian markets are expected to be flat to last year. And EMEA is expected to be up high single digits with improvements driven by increasing acres for cereals. Taking into account these regional market projections and in light of the very strong market growth in 2022, we expect the overall crop protection market will grow this year in the low single-digit range on a U.S. dollar basis. FMC's continued pricing actions, strong demand for our product portfolio, particularly our newest technologies as well as further market access gains are expected to provide solid support for FMC's top line to grow above the market rates. Costs are anticipated to remain a year-over-year headwind throughout the year. However, we aren't seeing deceleration of input cost inflation and these costs are expected to become a year-over-year tailwind in the second half. We will continue to invest in R&D and SG&A to expand market access, grow our Plant Health business, deploy new technologies through Precision Ag and develop new synthetic and biological products. Overall, we expect price increases to more than offset cost and FX headwinds, resulting in margin expansion in the second half of the year. Turning to Slide 10 for our full year 2023 outlook. We expect the full year revenue in the range of $6.08 billion to $6.22 billion representing a 6% growth at the midpoint compared to 2022. New launches and market access initiatives will drive volume growth with mid-single-digit pricing expected for the full year. FX is expected to be a moderate headwind to top line results. Adjusted EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $1. 48 billion to $1.56 billion, reflecting 8% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Price is anticipated to be the primary driver of EBITDA growth in the year, with cost headwinds expected to be significantly lower than those experienced last year. Increases in the input cost portion of cost headwinds are anticipated to decelerate as the year progresses and become a year-over-year tailwind in the second half. We expect adjusted earnings of $7.20 to $8 per diluted share, representing a 3% increase at the midpoint, with EPS growth limited by higher interest and tax rates. This assumes a share count of approximately 126.5 million and does not factor in the benefit of any potential share repurchases in the year. Looking at the first quarter outlook on Slide 10, we forecast revenue to be in the range of $1.41 billion to $1.45 billion, representing 6% growth at the midpoint compared to the first quarter of 2022. We are targeting mid- to high single-digit price increases of which much has already been implemented. Price is expected to be the primary driver of revenue growth in the quarter. FX is anticipated to be a headwind in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $345 million to $365 million, flat versus the prior year period at the midpoint, mainly due to pricing gains being offset by expected cost headwinds. Volume gains are expected to be offset by FX-related headwinds. We expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.63 to $1.83, representing a decrease of 8% at the midpoint due to higher interest rates and taxes. This assumes a share count of approximately 126.5 million. Moving now to Slide 12. I want to highlight some of the potential factors that could drive our results to either end of the guidance range. For the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA guidance, we are assuming market growth in the low single-digit range and FMC achieving mid-single-digit price increases. Input cost headwinds are expected to continue decelerating and become a tailwind as the year progresses, while FX is expected to be a headwind throughout the year. With the resilience we've built into our supply chain, our base case assumes any minor disruptions are mitigated. Alternatively, if cost headwinds ease more rapidly, if the market grows at a higher rate than forecasted and if we are able to realize high single-digit prices or FX has a lower impact, we could deliver results at the high end of our guidance range. Major supply disruptions of critical inputs or services are examples of factors that would drive results below the midpoint of the guidance range.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks, Mark. I'll start this morning with a review of some key income statement items. FX was a 2% headwind to revenue in the fourth quarter, with weakness in Asian and European currencies, partially offset by strength of the Brazilian real. For full year 2022, FX was a 3% headwind overall, with the most significant headwinds coming from the euro, Turkish lira and Indian rupee, offset in part by a strong Brazilian real. Looking ahead to 2023, we see continued modest FX headwinds on the horizon, consistent with the initial outlook for 2023 we provided on the November call. For the first quarter of 2023, these headwinds are across a range of Asian and European currencies. Interest expense for the fourth quarter was $44.8 million, up $11.8 million versus the prior year period. Interest expense for full year 2022 was $151.8 million, up $20.7 million versus the prior year. Rising U.S. interest rates were the primary driver of higher interest expense for both the quarter and the full year. Looking ahead to 2023, we expect full year interest expense to be in the range of $200 million to $210 million, an increase of more than $50 million at the midpoint versus 2022, driven primarily by higher U.S. interest rates. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for full year 2022 came in slightly better than anticipated at 13.7%, driven by a modest shift in mix of earnings across principal operating companies. The fourth quarter effective tax rate of 13. 1% reflects the true-up to the full year rate relative to the 14% rate accrued through the third quarter. For 2023, we estimate that our tax rate should be in the range of 14% to 16% with the increase driven by anticipated higher foreign earnings subject to U. S. GILTI tax versus 2022. Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity. Gross debt at year-end was slightly below $3.3 billion, down $285 million from the prior quarter. Gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 2.3x at year-end while net debt-to-EBITDA was 2.0x. On a full year average basis, gross debt-to-EBITDA was 2.6x, while net debt to EBITDA was 2.3x. Moving on to cash flow generation and deployment on Slide 13. FMC generated free cash flow of $514 million in 2022, down 28% versus the prior year. Adjusted cash from operations was down nearly $250 million compared to the prior year. Growth in EBITDA and cash provided by nonworking capital items were more than offset by cash used by working capital. Receivables net of rebates, vendor financing and advanced payments were a major use of cash driven by the inflationary impact on receivables and price increases to offset cost headwinds. Advanced payments from customers in North America were up somewhat, but grew rate much slower than revenue growth. Inventory was the use of cash with year-end inventory levels higher, as expected, given our anticipation of a strong Northern Hemisphere season in the first half of 2023 and the impact of inflation on inventory values. Accounts payable was a source of cash driven by cost inflation. Capital additions and other investing activities of $119 million were up $5 million compared with the prior year, with nearly half of the spending directed towards capacity expansion. Legacy and transformation was down substantially with the decrease due entirely to proceeds from the disposition of an inactive site. Legacy and transformation would have been essentially flat year-on-year in the absence of these proceeds. Overall, free cash flow conversion from adjusted earnings for 2022 was 55%, with rolling 3-year average free cash flow conversion at 67%, slightly below our long-term goal for 3-year average cash conversion of 70% or more due to the inflationary impacts on working capital. With this free cash flow and a modest increase in net debt year-on-year, we deployed $566 million in 2022 with nearly $370 million returned to shareholders through $267 million in dividends and $100 million of share repurchases. The remainder of cash deployed in 2022 was used to acquire BioPhero and to make equity investments through FMC Ventures. With leverage levels through the year, slightly above our targeted ranges, we chose not to repurchase additional shares following our third quarter earnings call. Looking ahead now to free cash flow generation and deployment for 2023 on Slide 14. We are forecasting free cash flow of $530 million to $720 million in 2023, up more than 20% year-on-year at the midpoint. Underlying this forecast is our expectation of adjusted cash from operations of $800 million to $920 million, up $200 million at the midpoint, with the increase driven by growth in EBITDA and slower growth in working capital resulting from lower sales growth and easing input cost inflation. This is partially offset by higher cash interest and taxes. We further expect to continue to modestly ramp up capital additions as we expand capacity to meet growing demand and to support new product introductions. Legacy and transformation cashment is expected to be essentially flat to midpoint after adjusting for the benefit from the disposal of the inactive site for 2022. With this guidance, we anticipate free cash flow conversion of 65% at the midpoint for 2023, a significant improvement from the 55% conversion last year. The rolling 3-year average free cash flow conversion is expected to be 67% just under our targeted conversion range of 70% or more. With interest rates substantially higher, we do not intend to utilize incremental borrowing capacity for cash deployment this year so as to mitigate the impact of higher interest expense on earnings and cash flow. Free cash flow will be used first to fund the dividend and approximately $290 million use of cash at the newly raised dividend per share authorized by our Board of Directors in December. Free cash flow will then be used to fund inorganic growth, if attractive opportunities become available. Free cash flow remaining after any such investments will then be directed to share repurchases. Given the seasonal nature of our cash flow, any share repurchases will be weighted more heavily to the latter part of the year. That said, we do intend to repurchase in the first quarter at a minimum, enough FMC shares to offset any dilution from share-based compensation. I must emphasize that this is not a permanent change in capital policy for FMC. Rather, this is temporary as we adjust structurally higher interest rates in the United States. Our intent here is to actively manage the impact of higher rates in 2023. Should interest rates ease, we would consider using incremental debt capacity to expand our cooler deployable cash. Finally, moving on to Slide 15. Let me put our free cash flow generation and deployment into perspective. Since launching FMC is a focused agricultural sciences company in 2018, we've made substantial improvements in free cash flow generation and free cash flow conversion from earnings. As you can see on the left-hand side of this page, we've improved 3-year rolling average free cash flow conversion from adjusted earnings from 42% in 2020 to 67% at the midpoint of 2023 guidance. We've shown we can convert more than 70% of earnings to cash in a single year, as we did in 2021, and we are well on our way to our targeted 70% or more rolling 3-year average cash conversion. Equally as important, we've been very balanced in how we've utilized this improved cash flow generation. Strongly rewarding shareholders with nearly $2 billion in cash returned over 2019 to 2022, split equally between share repurchases and dividends, while fully funding our organic growth, as well as directing $268 million to inorganic growth investments like our recent acquisition of BioPhero. Overall, we feel this approach to cash deployment balances shareholder rewards over both the near and long-term horizon.  And with that, I'll hand the call back to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Andrew. FMC delivered a record performance in 2022 despite facing the largest input cost inflation headwinds in the company's history. Robust volumes driven by our market access initiatives and the continued accelerated growth of new products as well as strong pricing gains helped to overcome significant cost, supply and FX challenges in the year.  We expect the broader economy to be volatile in 2023. However, agricultural market fundamentals are expected to remain solid. FMC's pricing momentum continues, and we should benefit from the potential deflation in the broader industrial supply chains. We continue to invest in our technology portfolio of synthetics, biologicals, precision ag and FMC Ventures.  Our expanding market access initiatives are resulting in increased profitable growth, and we intend to continue the pace of these investments across more countries.  Overall, there are fewer disruptive factors that we see today compared to the same time period last year, and this strengthens our confidence in the narrow guidance range we have provided. We expect to deliver another year of strong and profitable growth in 2023.  Finally, as we are now in the final year of our current strategic plan, we are planning to host an Investor Day at our global headquarters in Philadelphia this November. At that time, we will share details of our new strategic plan and we look forward to seeing you here in person. We will, of course, announce the date for this Investor Day event soon. Zack Zaki : Thank you. Emily, you may now take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Christopher Parkinson : Great. It does look like you have some cost benefit built into your -- just the midpoint of your EBITDA growth versus your projected revenues. I know you've been taking a prudent approach on the price cost in terms of the cost side and forecasting. But can you just talk a little bit more on how you see that progressing throughout the year, specifically in the second half and even potentially how you think it progresses throughout the year, which would even have implications on the first half of '24. Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks, Chris. So let me take a step back on that one and just talk a little bit about -- I mentioned in the script where we were last year versus where we are this year. Last year at this time, we had a wave coming at as of inflationary costs. And truly, we did not understand the order of magnitude. We ended up with what -- $463 million of costs at the beginning of the year, our forecast had nothing like that number. I would say this year, we're in exactly the reverse position. We see cost receding, we just don't know exactly how much that will be. We know it will impact us in the second half of the year. And we have built what I would call a modest amount of cost reduction into the midpoint of our guidance. But what I really see is a time line here that gets us through the end of this year and into early 2024, where costs do become a meaningful tailwind for us. We do expect to see margin expansion as we go through the second half of the year. We did talk about the fact that we will continue to invest in SG&A and R&D, and I'll have Andrew add a couple of comments here at the end on details here. We are investing in those areas because frankly, we are seeing profitable growth from those investments, whether I think about the growth in Brazil or I think about the growth in the U.S. or other parts of Asia, those investments are paying off very quickly in terms of how we gather new sales from new customers and new parts of the value chain. R&D is growing very simply because we're investing not only in our synthetic pipeline. And this year, we moved another molecule from discovery into development, and we'll talk more about that in Investor Day. But we've also got a full year run rate of our BioPhero investment in R&D, and we continue to invest in Plant Health and Precision Ag. So if you think about a growth rate of roughly 6% for the top line, you should expect SG&A to be growing pretty close to the 6%. And then R&D, a little bit above that. That's how it will flow through the year. The input costs are higher in the first half. And you can see what we said about in Q1, we still have high input costs. They were a legacy of what we bought in the second half of last year. Those will abate as we go through the half, and then in the second half, we'll get that margin expansion. So I've seen some of the flash reports last night at the -- are we being conservative? I think we've been prudent. The world is still somewhat volatile. We all know that. But we are confident enough to say that we're already seeing the trend lines, same as we saw last year, the trend lines are there. We just don't quite know where we'll be. So when I talked about on the script, could we see areas where we'll have improvement? Yes, absolutely. So we'll see as we go forward. The make call will be an important call for us because we'll have a much better view on where we are with raw materials. Our pricing actions, we probably have about 50% of our price target for this year is simply a rollover from last year, just pure timing of when pricing was implemented. So we feel good about the pricing side. We're less sure about the cost side, but the trend line is there for it to get better as we go through the year. Andrew, do you want add anything there? Andrew Sandifer : Yes. Let me just reiterate and expand on a couple of your thoughts there, Mark. I think certainly, input cost, the cost is at our COGS line, they are a significantly smaller headwind in 2023 than they were in 2022. And as Mark described, they remain a headwind in the first half, but we anticipate them becoming a tailwind in the second half. we will have growth in SG&A and R&D spending on a dollar basis. The SG&A should grow, as Mark described, generally in line with sales, R&D might grow a bit faster all of us to support growth, the addition of BioPhero, the investments in our Plant Health platform. We have moved another active ingredient from discovery into development in an active ingredient pipeline. So that SG&A and R&D dollar spending will continue to be a cost headwind as we go through the year. That said, on a percentage of sales basis, SG&A will stay relatively flat. R& D expand slightly. But this is against the contract where over the past 4 years, we've taken 300 basis points out of SG&A as a percentage of sales and over 100 basis points out of R&D as a percentage of sales. So while we might not get the same kind of leverage this year, more flat on SG&A and R&D as a percentage of sales, still a very, very competitive cost structure. The SG&A more than 500 basis points lower than our nearest competitor. So I think what you'll see through the year is that on a dollar EBITDA basis, SG&A and R&D continue to be a cost headwind, we will manage that carefully as we always have, and we'll adjust as we need to as we progress through the year. Mark Douglas : Very good. Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : I just want to touch on the pricing environment a little bit. I think I heard you say, Mark, that you've already got 50% in place just sort of from a rollover of last year. Of the other 50%, how much have you already gone out with for the first half versus, I assume there's a fair amount that you need to go out with for the back half of the year. And just want to understand sort of what you're hearing from your channel partners in terms of continued receptivity for pricing at this point? Just thinking atmospherically, a lot of headlines about we're all entering into a deflationary environment. We're seeing fertilizer prices come down and glyphosate prices come down. I know those are very different products versus what you sell, but just we are sort of pivoting out of the inflationary or price increase environment. So what, if any, change in feedback are you getting from the channel partners? Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks, Vincent. Well, listen, for pricing in the first half of the year, I mean, pretty much most of it, as I said, is already underway. The U.S. and Canada markets are active now, Europe is getting active right now. So those price increases are through. I think what you're referring to is probably in the fourth quarter as we roll into the Latin American market, where we will be. It's a valid question to ask. We don't know. We are planning price increases. At the end of the day, as Andrew just alluded to, input costs are still higher than they were last year. They are still increasing. They're just increasing at a much lower amount. Plus the fact that we're seeing significant labor cost inflation around the world, not only for SG&A, but within our manufacturing plants, et cetera. So for me, there is a cost environment that is still conducive to price increases. In Europe, you have high energy costs. Yes, they've come down off their peaks, but they're still meaningfully different to the average over the last few years. So we will continue to move price where we see fit. And of course, it's not a standard number around the world. We've talked about this before. It's different in different markets with different products. We continue to use that differentiation to move price. I think most of the value chains that we operate in really do see that inflationary environment. It's like any negotiation, they're always difficult. They're never easy. But overall, we are getting the price that we need to get to move us back to the EBITDA margins we want. You're right on the nonselective herbicides. You can look at all the metrics, you see them coming down. They went up very quickly. They come down very quickly. They truly are commoditized. We're not seeing that sort of curve for the more specialty products where you're really selling value not just on a cost basis through a contract. And that's a key differentiator for us. We don't have those nonselective herbicides. We don't operate in that type of environment. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And just as a follow-up, Mark, did I hear you say -- I believe last quarter, you thought the market overall would grow low to mid-single digits. I believe now you're thinking low single digits for this year. Is that just a function of last year for the market coming in better than you thought. So just a harder compare? Or is there anything at all different about sort of what you expect for this year globally? Mark Douglas : Yes. I think overall, when I look at the market, we are -- we do have a lower view of the overall market. But frankly, it's driven by Latin America. I mean we still expect North America to have a reasonable growth despite how strong it was in the past year. There is very good sentiment in the North American market right now for the coming year. Europe, we expect to be up. We do see increase in cereal acres, which will be positive. So we see Europe up. Asia will be slightly flat. There has been some weather issues in India, Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia, offset by a good market in Australia. I would say the reason we're going lower in the world today is because of Latin America. There are independent numbers that suggest the Latin American market may have grown $6 billion in 2022. Now the vast majority of that is with nonselective herbicides, mainly price and then pricing for other active ingredients. So I do think that people need to watch that nonselective herbicide market in Brazil and Argentina. That's the reason we're calling for a lower overall market, but it really is focused in that particular segment, which is so large, it does impact the rest. The rest of it is probably close to where we said it would be in November. Operator : The next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs, your line is open. If you'd like to please proceed with your question. Unfortunately, we're not receiving any audio from Adam's line, so we'll move on to our next question, which comes from Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Adam Samuelson : Just wanted to get back to your first quarter guidance, you had margin expansion in just reported fourth quarter '22 and you're guiding to some of lower margins and flat EBITDA in the first quarter. In what way are these quarters different? Could you just maybe provide some of the bridge items for Q1. Mark Douglas : Yes, Aleksey, I'll just give you a quick high-level view and then Andrew, please give some color commentary here. Very different markets in the sense of where you're selling into. Latin America, Brazil, Argentina, huge markets in Q4, still important in Q1 but to a lesser degree. And then obviously, in Q1, the European business is starting to kick in, which is very different. So you have a very different geographic mix across the world for how we see. And it's why we never ever talk about sequential quarters. It's almost impossible to look at the business on that light. But Andrew, if you want to make some comments on the revenue side and the cost side. Andrew Sandifer : Yes, certainly. I think, yes, to take Mark's comment, very, very challenging to look at our business on a sequential basis, given the different regional country mix for each quarter. I think what we're looking at is solid revenue growth and flat EBITDA, entirely due to cost headwinds in the first quarter, we're will be close to offsetting them with price increases in the first quarter, but we don't really get to that positive price cost comparison and for any strong way until we get into the following quarter. So we do see some EBITDA margin dilution from Q1 '22 to Q1 '23 which I would suggest is a better comparison period to be looking at and trying to understand the Q1 performance. Again, it's really driven by getting past this last part of the wave of cost inflation. Now as we move into the second half of the year, as input costs received as we're anticipating, that's when you start to really see margin improvement. Adam Samuelson : And as a follow-up, you mentioned diamide, mid-single-digit to high single-digit growth, sort of -- they -- did diamides dip to mid-single-digit territory going forward over the next 2, 3 years. Is this the level of growth that you see as fairly normal? Or could it be a little higher or lower? Mark Douglas : I think we've said in the past, sort of that mid- to high single digits is where we think it will pan out over time. I wouldn't change that view right now. We do continue to launch new diamide formulations around the world and Cyazypyr is growing very nicely as we get the new registration. So I think the mid- to high single digit is a perfectly good range of legacy. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Spector with UBS. Josh Spector : Yes. I guess just to follow up on some of the raws questions earlier. I mean, you've been pretty clear in the past, you have about 6 months of visibility to what you're buying. So I mean is this something where next quarter you'll have a stronger view on second half and would adjust your view, kind of aligned with what you're seeing there? And just curious on some of the near-term dynamics as well. Is China disruption impacting your view of what pricing can be. Does that have an impact there? And if you look at your buy now, is there any way to frame what your raws will be doing year-over-year in the second half then. Mark Douglas : Yes. Listen, it's exactly what I talked about. I think as we go through the second quarter, we're going to have a much better view of, a, what have we bought and what are we buying in the second quarter, which will inform our raw material view in the second half. So I think at the May call, we'll be giving a lot more detail in that area. China has not impacted us at all through this latest round of COVID. We did have closures of some supply. But over the last 3 to 4 years, we've built up a really robust process and network of how to manage disruptions. So we didn't see any significant disruptions through the Chinese New Year and through the COVID wave that they had to deal with. China opening up is it's positive for us in the sense that, obviously, we get raw materials from China. It's not a huge market for us from a sales perspective. It's a nice market, but it's not one of our leading growth markets. So for us, it's a bit of a neutral event, China opening up. We've managed raw material as well out of China. We've been distributing our manufacturing network over the last 5 years to other countries. That continues at a pace. So overall, I think we feel pretty good from a supply position standpoint right now. Josh Spector : Okay. And if I could just poke on your guide range on the high end specifically. I guess if I just take one of those variables and look at price and say you do high single digit versus mid-single digit, it's $150 million plus of EBITDA upside. Your scenario is $40 million higher and I guess you list a whole bunch of positives that could play out. So what are the negatives that we should be thinking about? Or is that higher upside potentially possible if you get more visibility there? Mark Douglas : Well, I think on the negative side, I highlighted supply disruptions, which is the obvious one. Weather disruptions would be the next one, I would say. Outside of that, it would be a lack of pricing or something in the world that creates an inflationary environment for raw materials. We don't see that today. As I said, you look at the script, we mentioned 3 or 4 items that could move us from the midpoint to the upper end of the range. We mentioned basically one that would come the other way. So you can read into that what you will. Operator : The next question comes from Stephen Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Stephen Byrne : The EPA recently came out with a draft risk assessment on Cyazypyr and they concluded this -- the terminology likely to adversely affect. Is this meaningful in your view? Could there be impacts from this on how Cyazypyr appear is used? And how would you compare this to other insecticides? Is this fairly normal? Or is this a concern? Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks, Steve. Top line, no, it's not a concern, and we've been following this for some time, as you can imagine. We're well clued into where the EPA is going. Cyazypyr is one of the -- what we call the softer chemistries, much more targeted. We don't see the EPA guidance has any impact on our business. We continue to see Cyazypyr grow at quite a fast rate around the world. It has numerous attributes that are very targeted. There are lots of old pesticides and insecticides that are more broad in nature that Cyazypyr would take share from and is taking share from. So we don't see any impact to our business from this ruling. Stephen Byrne : Okay. And I wanted to just drill into your outlook on the biologicals. It's clearly an area that you're devoting a lot of focus on. Do you find that it has the potential to be, say, synergistic with your synthetics or is used in combination? I think that was view that Kathy Shelton had in prior years. Is that still the view that there's a synergy between the biologicals and synthetic chemistries. Mark Douglas : Yes, very much so. When you look at the growth rate of our biologicals, we talk about our Plant Health business. This year, it will be pretty close to $300 million in size. Biologicals is now roughly half of that. It's getting close to the $150 million business. It's growing in excess of 20% top line per year. And that growth is coming from not only the new products but the synergistic effect that you talk about, which is twofold. First of all, we are developing products where biologicals and synthetics are in the same formulation. So you're getting different modes of action and different attributes from a biological and lowering the amount of synthetic material in the formulation. The second one is in spray programs where you will replace a synthetic spray with a biological spray. So you are using a pure biological but using it in a way that augments what the synthetics are doing and once again reduces the amount of synthetic material. So we see that growth coming from both aspects. We're launching, as I said, we launched 17 new products last year in the whole biological space. I continue to see that space growing rapidly. We are investing more in R&D. We are investing through ventures as well. So I think it's one of the bright spots in the portfolio in terms of overall growth and investment for the company. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Mark, how would you characterize channel inventory levels in the U.S., Brazil and Argentina exclusive of the nonselective herbicides where you don't compete? Mark Douglas : Yes. I think -- so from a North American perspective, U.S. in particular, I think channel inventories are a little bit elevated right now, but that's normal. I would say, as you enter the season, most of retail and distribution is stocked up for a very good year. When I think of inventory levels for FMC compared to our sales on a percent basis, we're about the same place we were the year before. So I think it's pretty normal. Brazil and Argentina, a different story. Forget the nonselective that we just talked about. I think because of the conditions that we saw in the south of Brazil and in Argentina, it was very dry in the fourth quarter. I have no doubt that there is elevated channel inventories in that area, would not be a surprise at all. If I run around the rest of the world, Europe, South of Europe is high again because of hangover from the last season. Northern Europe is pretty much okay, I think. In Asia, we've talked about India in the past. The weather didn't help again in 2022. So we see high channel inventories in India, which we'll be working through. Parts of Indonesia are similar, somewhat high. Rest of Asia is good. So overall, it's pretty much what you would expect. And don't forget, people are focused on what happened in Brazil in terms of growth. The vast majority of the growth in Brazil was price, it wasn't volume and that's important to recognize. So I think out of the weather patterns that we saw in the South and in Argentina, I think other parts of the country are fine. Kevin McCarthy : That's helpful. And as a second question, if I may, you've owned BioPhero for roughly 6 months now and so I was wondering if you could provide an update on what you've seen so far. I think when you bought it, you talked about potentially launching 5 new pheromone over the next 3 to 5 years with an eye toward $1 billion of sales by 2030. Maybe you could just provide an update as to how that aspect of the biologicals pipeline is going here? Mark Douglas : Yes. Thank you. Great question. We're very happy with the acquisition we made. In fact, I would say, when I think of the key metrics that we're looking at when we acquired the product, we had 5 new pheromones in the R&D pipeline. Today, that number is 9. So the accelerated rate of discovery and application of new pheromones is growing. We have made our first batches of products and move them into the marketplace. So that was a major milestone. The company that we acquired, BioPhero had not -- I was just at the very beginning of making commercial scale quantities. We've now got past that. We are looking to invest in our own manufacturing. We do use some toll manufacturers today, but we're looking at balancing that out across the world. And I would say the trial work, we have substantial trial work around the world on the pheromones that we already have in place. And those trial works are going very well. So from my perspective, the integration has gone very well. But more importantly, I see an accelerated rate of discovery and development coming out of that pipeline, which is very encouraging. Operator : The next question comes from Richard Garchitorena with Wells Fargo. Richard Garchitorena : First question on CapEx. It looks like for '23, a bit of a step up $140 million to $180 million versus 2022. Can you talk about where you're going to be adding capacity. What new products plan to increase? And where your operating rates are currently? Mark Douglas : Andrew, why don't you talk about the overall CapEx. Andrew Sandifer : Yes. So we spent about just under $120 million in CapEx in 2022. We're stepping up at the midpoint to about $160 million. So about a good-sized increment in CapEx. A lot of that additional CapEx is to support manufacturing capacity for our new active ingredients. So we're expanding production of Isoflex which is our serial [Averside] we introduced in Australia several a couple of years ago and are rolling out now more broadly around the world. We're expanding capacity for Fluindapyr, the fungicide that we've introduced in a couple of key countries and starts becoming much more material as we get into the next several years. That CapEx, I think, building on comments earlier, that CapEx is largely directed in places outside of China. We're expanding capacity in Europe. We're expanding capacity in other parts of Asia to complement the sourcing that we have today and the strong sourcing position that we have in China, helping just sort of balance that mix of sources that we have. And Mark, if you want to add anything to that? Mark Douglas : Yes, I would say a couple of things on top of what Andrew just added. Formulation capacity is also important. Having the active ingredient is one thing, but expanding your formulation capacity is also a key attribute of where we spend capital. It's nowhere near the same scale of capital, but it is important. And we have, over the last year, expanded capacity here in the U.S., in Europe, and as we go into '23, we're expanding our formulating capacity in Brazil as well. So you won't see -- it doesn't become so apparent in terms of overall dollars of capacity expansion but that is an important attribute that we're focused on as well. Richard Garchitorena : Okay. Great. And as a follow-up, in the slides you provided some details on your Precision Ag business, the Arc mobile solution. Maybe can you talk about how you're going to plan on monetizing this potentially in the future? What your expectations are for growth of that platform. And also, what would you say to folks who -- there's a thought out there that Precision Ag could be a negative to volumes longer term, given it could make farmers more efficient and they may be applying less volume of product. Maybe if you could touch on those. Mark Douglas : Yes, sure. So I'll take the last one first. Listen, I think once you apply something from a precision methodology, you are going to de facto use less volume. I think what gets mixed and what gets missed in this area is the discussion around volume and value. Where are you bringing value and how do you capture that value? Obviously, there are some very large products used around the world, especially nonselective herbicides to go back to that topic. See & Spray technology, which has been developed is an area that is obviously of interest in that space. For us, when I look at how do we capture value from Arc, what are we doing? We're allowing the grower to very precisely time when they need to put the best products in the field to remove insects. That's great from a sustainability perspective. It is also something where you capture value from not only the products you're selling today but the broader portfolio that you sell to those growers. I don't see anywhere in the world where we charge for Arc. We provide it free of charge. It is an SG& A expense, but it does have tremendous uplift in terms of the portfolio mix that you sell. And also, don't forget, it has another attribute, it defends business for us. We're defending on 20 million acres, quite a few hundred million dollars of high-profit products that is very difficult to remove once somebody is using a process like that. That's a differentiator that we believe adds more value to the company than anything else. So we don't necessarily see it as a separate profit center, but we do see it as an important element of how we continue to grow the portfolio and defend the business we have today. Operator : The final question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC. Arun Viswanathan : When you think about maybe \u201824 and \u201825, \u201823 and \u201822 have been impacted by FX as well as cost inflation. But when you look at \u201824 and \u201825, you expect to get back on to a 7% to 9% EBITDA growth rate? And maybe if you could give us a little bit of what you\u2019re thinking strategy-wise longer term. Are you planning to have an Investor Day and maybe unveil the next 3 to 5 years of strategy and biologicals be a bigger part of that? Or maybe you can just explain maybe some of the longer-term strategy? Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks for the question. As I just said in the script, we are going to have an Investor Day at the end of this year. We\u2019ll give the dates coming. I don\u2019t want to re-empt that because there\u2019s a lot of work to do between now and then but we will be giving a view of the future, both, I would say, within the near-term few years and then a longer-term aspirational goal for the company. It is important that we feel that we have that longer-term view as we drive the company forward. We\u2019ve been very good in managing the company through the last 5-year cycle, as Andrew has talked about before, we\u2019re pretty much right now above our metric for revenue. But right on the bottom line of EBITDA despite well in excess of $1 billion so far of costs. So I would say you just have to hold that question until we get to the end of the year. Zack Zaki : All right. Thank you, Emily. That\u2019s all the time that we have for questions. Thank you very much. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes the FMC Corporation conference call.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Zack Zaki, Director, Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Please go ahead. Abizar Zaki : Thank you, Glenn. Welcome to FMC Corporation's First Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Mark Douglas, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mark will review our first quarter performance as well as provide an outlook for the second quarter and implied first half expectations. He will also provide an update to our full year outlook and imply second half expectation. Andrew will provide an overview of select financial results. Following the prepared remarks, we will take questions.  Our earnings release and today's slide presentation are available on our website, and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call. Let me remind you that today's presentation and discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning certain factors, including, but not limited to, those factors identified in our earnings release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's understanding. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties.  Today's discussion and the supporting materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations, free cash flow and organic revenue growth, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that as used in today's discussion, earnings means adjusted earnings and EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Zack, and good morning, everyone. Our Q1 results are detailed on Slides 3, 4 and 5. In Q1, FMC delivered solid results with strong pricing actions, accelerated growth of new products, increased market access and cost discipline, driving margin expansion of over 60 basis points versus the prior year period. We reported $1.34 billion in first quarter revenue, which is flat on a reported basis and up 4% organically. Revenue was flat due to FX headwinds and lower volumes.  Adjusted EBITDA was $362 million, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year period and $7 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. EBITDA margins were 26.9%, an increase of over 60 basis points compared to the prior year period. This margin expansion was driven by pricing gains, strong mix and cost discipline. Adjusted earnings were $1.77 per diluted share in the quarter, a decrease of 6% versus Q1 2022 but $0.04 above the midpoint of our guidance range. North America had a record quarter with sales growth of 28% or 30% excluding FX versus the first quarter of 2022. You will recall, we built inventory for the region at the end of last year in anticipation of another strong quarter and aided by our investments to increase market access. We were able to take advantage of the available supply to gain market share, especially in Canada. Canada achieved record first quarter revenue and effectively doubled in sales compared to the prior year period due to high customer demand particularly for insecticides such as the recently launched Coragen MaX, low channel inventory for FMC products, price increases and product mix were also drivers for the strong performance in Canada.  Product mix across North America also benefited from higher sales of new products with 29% of branded revenue derived from products launched within the last 5 years, including a significant contribution from the successful launch of a new patented diamide formulation Altacor eVo for use on tree nuts and other crops. Branded diamides grew more than 20% in the quarter. Sales in EMEA declined 4% year-over-year and were up 2%, excluding FX. Robust pricing actions offset lower volumes of herbicides in core EU countries, anticipated registration losses and the impact of discontinued sales in Russia. FX continued to be a headwind in the region. Branded diamides grew mid-single digits in the quarter versus the prior year period. Switzerland, Turkey, Hungary, Romania and the Ukraine all grew double digits compared to the prior year period.  Moving now to Latin America, where revenue declined 12% versus the prior year period. As expected, drought conditions and missed applications in Southern Brazil and Argentina led to lower volumes in the quarter. Demand in Mexico and the Andean region remain stable. In Asia, sales decreased 22% and were down 15% organically. Australia experienced a dry start to the growing season impacting sales in the area. In addition, we continue to actively manage India's elevated channel inventories to bring them down. Fungicides grew more than 20% in the quarter driven by Japan. And finally, new products contributed to 17% of the region's branded sales in the quarter.  Overall, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was up 2% year-over-year driven by pricing gains, partially offset by lower volumes, inflationary impacts on costs and FX headwinds. Price was up $96 million in the quarter. FX was a $32 million headwind. And once we saw volume slowing mid-quarter, we took deliberate action to control costs, especially in SG&A. Hence, the overall cost headwind was limited to $27 million for the quarter, driven by higher input costs.  Before I review FMC's full year 2023 and Q2 earnings outlook, let me share our updated view of the overall market conditions. Crop commodity prices remain elevated, and growers continue to rely on advanced technologies to maximize yields. This was reflected in the success of our new products in the first quarter and the continued momentum is anticipated for our innovative technologies for the rest of the year. However, the price normalization that we highlighted last quarter in nonselective herbicides, a segment in which FMC does not participate has accelerated, especially in Latin America. Droughts have impacted key geographies such as Brazil, Argentina and now Australia. We have seen a trend where some distributors are delaying purchases to manage their working capital. We see this as a result of the higher interest rate environment.  Taking these new factors into account, we are revising our view of the overall crop protection market and now expect the global market to be down low single digits versus our prior forecast of up low single digits. Breaking this down by region, we now expect Latin America to be down high single digits. EMEA is now projected to be up mid-single digits. North America is still expected to be up low single digits, and Asia is now expected to be down low single digits. FX is still projected to be a headwind to market growth on a U.S. dollar basis. To be clear, the key driver to the changing market outlook is nonselective herbicides. And let me reiterate, this is a segment in which FMC does not participate. Excluding nonselective herbicides, we expect the global crop protection market to be flat versus the prior year. We still expect to deliver revenue growth in this environment driven by pricing gains as well as volume growth through new products and expanded market access.  Slide 6, 7 and 8 cover FMC's Q2 full year first and second half earnings outlook. We anticipate revenue in the second quarter to be flat compared to the prior year, with further price increases, particularly in EMEA, growth of new products as well as market access gains to be offset by lower overall volumes and FX headwinds. North America purchase patterns are expected to return to normal levels after 2 consecutive quarters of very strong demand. Channel inventory -- Channel inventory is anticipated to remain a focus in India as it will for the rest of this year. Our diamides partners are lowering their inventory levels in light of working capital concerns impacting volumes in Q2 and the rest of the year. EBITDA guidance is flat compared to the prior year of $360 million, and EPS is expected to decline by 9% year-over-year, primarily due to higher interest rates.  FMC's full year 2023 revenue forecast is unchanged in the range of $6.08 billion to $6.22 billion, representing an increase of 6% at the midpoint versus 2022. Driven by pricing gains as well as volume benefits from higher new product sales and increasing market access. Our forecast for contributions from these new products has increased from approximately $720 million in our previous guidance to over $800 million now. FX will continue to be a headwind to revenue. We are raising guidance for full year adjusted EBITDA by $10 million based on the first quarter outperformance, continued pricing gains, positive mix and projected cost tailwinds. We now expect full year EBITDA to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.56 billion, representing 9% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.  2023 adjusted earnings per share is raised by $0.04 at the midpoint and is now expected to be in the range of $7.34 to $7.94 per diluted share. Representing an increase of 3% year-over-year at the midpoint, reflecting higher EBITDA, the benefit of share repurchases completed in Q1 as well as somewhat higher interest expense. Consistent with past practice, we do not factor in any benefit from potential future share repurchases into our EPS guidance.  Looking at the implied guidance by halves, first half '23 revenue is expected to be flat versus the first half of '22 and second half '23 revenue is expected to increase by 12% compared to the prior year period. While drought conditions are expected to impact sales in the first half, revenue in the second half is anticipated to benefit from continued growth of higher-margin in new products and especially in North America and Latin America as well as pricing gains and expanded market access. EBITDA guidance for the first half of '23 indicates a 1% growth over the prior year period, driven by pricing actions. Full year guidance implies a 17% year-over-year EBITDA growth in the second half of the year. Compared to last year, our EBITDA growth outlook is second half weighted with significant year-over-year gains projected in Q3 due to input cost tailwinds.  Turning to Slide 9 and the updated range of 2023 EBITDA outcomes. The global crop protection market is now expected to be down low single digits versus the prior year, primarily driven by normalizing prices of nonselective herbicides. Input costs continue to decelerate and there is a lower likelihood of major supply disruptions. New products are growing at a faster pace than previously anticipated, resulting in better mix as well as significant share gains in selective markets. We continue to have strong pricing and FX is still expected to be a minor headwind to full year EBITDA. Despite our tight internal cost controls, we are continuing to invest in commercial and agronomic resources to grow our market access. We've seen the very positive results from these investments in the U.S., Canada and Brazil, and we are now expanding the program to the Middle East, Africa and parts of Asia.  As a result of all the factors I've mentioned, we have narrowed our guidance range and raised the low end of the guidance by $20 million.  I'll now turn the call over to Andrew to cover details on cash flow and other items. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks, Mark. I'll start this morning with a review of some key income statement items. FX was a 4% headwind to revenue growth in the first quarter, with the most significant impacts coming from the Turkish lira, Canadian dollar, Pakistani rupee, Euro and Chinese renminbi. Looking ahead through the rest of 2023, we see continued modest FX headwinds in the second quarter, which diminish as we move through the rest of the year. For the second quarter of 2023, these headwinds stemmed primarily from Asian currencies, particularly the Indian rupee and the Pakistani rupee. Interest expense for the first quarter was $51.4 million, up $21.5 million versus the prior year period. Substantially higher U.S. interest rates were the primary driver of higher interest expense in the quarter. We now expect full year interest expense to be in the range of $205 million to $215 million, an increase of $5 million at the midpoint with the increase driven by somewhat higher short-term borrowings to support working capital than previously assumed. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the first quarter was 15%, in line with the midpoint of our full year expectation for tax rate of 14% to 16%. Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity. Gross debt was $4.2 billion at March 31, up approximately $900 million from the prior quarter. Gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 3.0x while net debt-to-EBITDA was 2.6x, as expected, given the normal seasonal working capital build.  Moving on to cash flow generation and deployment on Slide 10. FMC generated free cash flow of negative $915 million in the first quarter, down roughly $250 million versus the prior year, entirely due to lower adjusted cash from operations. The modest growth in EBITDA was more than offset by higher cash used for working capital, particularly receivables and inventory, growth of which was driven by price increases and cost inflation as well as other non -- higher other nonworking capital items. Capital additions and other investing activities of $51 million were down slightly compared with the prior year. Legacy and transformation cash spending was essentially flat versus the prior year at $13 million. We returned just under $100 million to shareholders in the quarter and a combination of $73 million in dividends and $25 million in share repurchases. The repurchase of approximately 194,000 FMC shares more than offset the dilution of the share-based compensation, resulting in weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 126.1 million for the first quarter. We now expect share count to remain at this level through the rest of the year in the absence of any future share repurchases.  We are maintaining our free cash flow guidance of $530 million to $720 million in 2023, up more than 20% year-on-year at the midpoint. We continue to expect adjusted cash from operations to be $800 million to $920 million, up $200 million at the midpoint, with the increase in EBITDA guidance offset by minor changes in other items. We continue to expect capital additions to be $140 million to $180 million as we expand capacity to meet growing demand and support new product introductions. Legacy and transformation cash spending is expected to remain essentially flat at the midpoint after adjusting for the benefit from the disposal of an inactive legacy site in 2022. This guidance implies free cash flow conversion of 65% at the midpoint for 2023 with rolling 3-year average free cash flow conversion of approximately 67%.  Looking to cash deployment for the remainder of the year, free cash flow will be first be used to fund the dividend. Cash will then be used to fund inorganic growth should attractive opportunities become available. Free cash flow remaining after any such investments will be directed to share repurchases. At the midpoint of guidance for 2023, this would imply approximately a further $220 million returned to shareholders through dividends and up to $300 million in additional share repurchases. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Andrew. Before I make my closing comments, I'd like to invite you to FMC's Investor Day on November 16 at our headquarters here in Philadelphia. Our agenda promises to be robust with dynamic showcases multiple speakers from commercial and functional areas and a chance to interact with FMC's executive leadership team. We will share more about our short- and long-term strategies, outline long-range financial goals and provide an early look at 2024 expectations. Please visit our website to register your interest in attending.  I'm also pleased to announce a new collaboration with the Halo Trust, a humanitarian nongovernmental organization that restores livelihoods of people affected by conflict through demining activities. As you may recall, FMC was the first crop protection company to exit Russia 1 year ago, and we continue to support Ukraine and its farmers through various initiatives. As part of the collaboration with the Halo Trust, FMC is donating 3% of its 2023 sales revenue in the Ukraine to support expansion of its demining efforts. With this funding, the Halo Trust will be able to significantly increase its capacity to remove land mines from Ukrainian farms. This project not only ensures Ukrainian farmers can safely return to their fields for planting and harvest but it also contributes to improving food security around the globe.  Finally, I'm proud to share that FMC is among just 6 companies in the world and the first crop protection company globally to have its net 0 target by 2035, verified by the science-based targets initiative organization. FMC has made substantial progress in recent years on its sustainability and net 0 goals. The company reduced Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions at its operating sites by at least 2% in the last year, while at the same time, delivering record growth and increased revenue -- increased volume.  In closing, FMC continues to perform strongly in a volatile market. Our performance is a result of our innovative portfolio of products that address a variety of grower needs across diverse crops, applications and geographies. It is also a reflection of the power of our product pipeline, which continues to provide us with exciting new synthetic and biological technologies. We have taken strong pricing actions to help recover from 24 months of unprecedented cost inflation and improved our product mix at the same time. Market access investments made over the past couple of years provide growth opportunities, especially for our new products. Input costs are receding, and we have good visibility into the year-over-year tailwinds in the second half of the year. But finally, other costs will be managed prudently while maintaining investments in R&D and expanding market access. These factors give us confidence in our raised guidance and position us to deliver another year of earnings growth and increased cash flow.  I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Christopher Parkinson from Mizuho. Christopher Parkinson : Just given how well it appears price cost is trending at least to begin the year given your 1Q margin result. Can you just speak to the confidence that you have for your volume growth outlook for the balance of the year. And for those who may be skeptical on it, what would you say to them inclusive of where you think your progress on reducing inventories in key regions? Mark Douglas : Yes. Chris. Maybe I'll start by just making a comment on the elements I talked about in terms of the overall market. I think one thing you have to put in perspective is although we're talking about volumes in Q1 and Q2, you have to remember that last year was an absolute record year in terms of total market for crop protection chemicals, driven a lot by volume, not just price. So although we're looking in the first half at what we would consider somewhat low volumes, it's lower. It's not absolutely low.  So let's put that in perspective. The market is still operating at a very, very high level. On-the-ground usage is very robust in most parts of the world. So the actual market itself is looking good in terms of soft commodity prices are remaining elevated, growers are looking to plant as much as they can. We're going to see area increase in Brazil as we go through the end of this year as we enter the '23, '24 season. So all the signs are all good. Yes, we're seeing some adjustments that we talked about in terms of how we think about the marketplace. But overall, the volume perspective as we go through the year will improve for FMC. And let me talk about why I think that is.  First of all, we talked a lot about new product introductions. And for us, those are the products that are introduced over the last 5 years. We just increased since our last guidance from $720 million to over $800 million of revenue this year from those products. The majority of that comes in the second half of the year. So that's growth we have in places like the U.S. and like Brazil. These are brand new formulations that are continuing to grow. So we see this dynamic of new products taking share in markets that we wish to participate. The fact is also 2% of our revenue this year will come from products launched this year. It's about $120 million that again, is more second half weighted than first half weighted.  Give you an example of what some of that looks like in Brazil, we're launching a brand-new Rynaxypyr bifenthrin formulation for use on soy and corn as well. That's new market access for us. We have a new Fluindapyr, which is our new fungicide launch this year called Onsuva, which again is there to treat Asia soybean rust, which is one of our first products in that new market. And I think what's important about those 2 new formulations is they got prioritized registrations in Brazil. What does that mean? It means they're seen as critical to enabling growers to combat pests and your registrations come quicker than you thought. These are the reasons why we've just increased our new product introduction metric by pretty much close to $100 million because we expect to see that.  So from us, new product introductions the whole market access gains that we've been talking about in the U.S., in Brazil and now in other parts of the world as well as a backdrop where frankly, Latin America, the market this year suffered because of the drought in the South and in Argentina. We forecast for normalized weather conditions. So we expect that to be a normal weather condition in Latin America as we go through the end of the year. So Chris, those are the sort of reasons why we're more confident of volume in the second half than we are in the first half. Christopher Parkinson : That's helpful. And just as a -- to quick -- actually -- true follow-up to that question. Mark, you've spoken about and then you just hit on some of that with the NPIs, the non-diamide portfolio growing a little bit faster than the diamides when the original assumption was mid-single digits. If you could give us a quick update there as well as your biological assumption, correct me if I'm wrong, I think you were speaking about something about 230 to 300 plus there in terms of volumetric growth contribution. It seems like you're well on track as of the first quarter based on your PowerPoint commentary. If you could just hit on this other 2 further dynamics to go down one further level, that would be very helpful. Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks. So listen, on the portfolio itself, last year, we had 15% growth as a company. And this year, we're aiming for our rough 6% growth. When you look at the portfolio itself, the rest of the portfolio last year grew faster than the diamides. And that's not to say that the diamides weren't growing at a good rate. They were, and they have been since we acquired the products. This year, we expect the diamides to grow in that sort of mid-single-digit range, and the rest of the portfolio will grow at the same rate. That's the strength of that investment we've been making in the new products. So we have a very balanced view of how the company is growing across fungicides, insecticides and herbicides.  The Plant Health business, of which biological is the major component, that business is expected to grow over 20% this year, and biologicals will grow pretty close to 30%, if not over 30%. So again, we have a strong mix there. We have more new products coming into the marketplace. But as you think about FMC going forward, you should think about that growth as more balanced across the overall portfolio, not just from a geographic perspective, but also from an intent perspective. Operator : The next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Wondering if I could ask on the cost side of the equation for the back half of the year. I noticed that your expectations for raw material costs are still sort of at the midpoint of your sort of outlook. So could you talk about sort of the visibility you have there and why it's going to be more 3Q loaded than 4Q? And then just as we think about the overall second half, if I look at what you're guiding to, it looks like revenue up about $375 million year-over-year. And EBITDA is up about $115 million year-over-year. So is there anything else in between those 2 numbers beyond just price being up, volume being up and raw material costs being down? Is there sort of an SG&A or an R&D catch-up in the back half of the year? That's embedded in there or anything else like that? Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks, Vincent. I'll give you some high-level comments on how I see the overall cost picture playing out through the year. And then Andrew, if you want to dig into a couple of the details that Vincent raised.  Certainly, from a cost -- let's put it, cost input in terms of raw materials, logistics, all other supplies, et cetera. We do have a very good view now of certainly Q3 and pretty close to finally in Q4. If you remember the way costs flow through our P&L, we have about a 6-month hang-up as inventory gets pushed through to revenue. So what do we see today? We know Q3 already. And the reason we're saying that the second half of the year is more front-end loaded into Q3 is that last year, Q3 was an extremely high impact from raw material inputs, in fact, the highest we've ever seen. We see that reversing now and most of our costs are locked in for Q3. So we know we have a significant uptick in Q3. So don't think of the second half has been back-end loaded into Q4. It's not. It doesn't mean to say that Q4 won't be good, but Q3 will be the area where we see the biggest EBITDA improvement because of costs.  On SG&A, we continue to manage that well. FMC has done that well for the last 2 to 3 years. We're very flexible in how we move our SG&A around and where we need to save, we can, and we exhibited that in Q1. But Andrew, if you want to talk a little bit more about some of the flows of the cost go ahead. Andrew Sandifer : Yes, Vincent, I think, look, our outlook for cost is essentially unchanged from the beginning of the year. We still expect a pretty substantial headwind from input costs in the first half and then a reversal of those into a tailwind in the second half. As Mark noted, Q3 of last year was the biggest cost increase we've ever had in our history, $169 million of cost increase in 1 quarter. So that reversal is pretty pronounced and really drives much stronger results in Q3 anticipated for this year than certainly the split in that second half being very Q3 heavy for the EBITDA growth.  I think as you also noted, certainly, a part of that cost headwind is growth in SG&A and R&D. And we do fully intend to continue investing in the growth of the business through new product development through market access investments and resources, both commercial and agronomic, to go support the our new products out in the world. That is a nontrivial portion of the cost headwind for the year, probably on the order of 40%. And that is something that in Q1, we did modulate a bit as we saw the quarter evolving and slowed some of our SG&A investment as you saw in the reported P&L, net of FX benefits, SG&A spending was actually down in the quarter. If you remove those FX benefits, we did spend more in SG&A this year than we did last year, but probably at a bit slower pace than what we'd anticipated going into the quarter. We'll continue to adjust spending, particularly in the noncustomer-facing nongrowth supporting areas as we go through the year and see how the business evolves. But I think, look, the bottom line is the cost environment is pretty much as we expected. I think we're managing through that. And that lapping, that big headwind from Q3 of '22 is a big factor in driving our second half EBITDA growth. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And if I could just ask a quick follow-up. Slide 10 on the cash deployment. You do talk about the potential for inorganic growth through M&A this year. I would assume that's going to be on the sort of smaller side of the equation, if anything comes to fruition? Or is that not correct? Mark Douglas : Yes. No, I think, Vincent, we've said many times that we're very interested in adding to our technology portfolio, especially in the Plant Health Space, whether biologicals or one of the other elements. They do tend to be lower investments in the tens of millions of dollars although we did make the BioPhero acquisition last year, which was pretty close to $200 million. So you can get up there into the couple of hundred million, depending on what it is you're buying. But generally speaking, the things we're looking at are more in the tens of millions of dollars right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Tony Jones from Redburn. Tony Jones : I wanted to also talk about raw material costs a bit. So as cost go deflationary in H2 and presumably, that continues into '24, how do you see your prices holding up maybe an industry and an FMC level? Mark Douglas : Yes. Tony, I'll certainly talk from an FMC perspective. We -- as I said, I think it was on the last call, we're not a commodity chemical company. Our prices don't shoot up overnight and they don't come down overnight. And I think that's an important facet that people have to remember. We have spent the last couple of years absorbing a tremendous amount of inflation of input costs and early in '21, we started to move price and we built as we went through the year and then we gained price last year. And obviously, we're still moving price today. That will not slow down. We intend to recover all of the input costs that we've seen in terms of inflation.  So while we were a bit of a shock absorber for our customers as we went up this curve, we intend to keep that as we go to the other side of the curve. So we're very confident of our ability to hold price. You saw that in Q1 that will continue in Q2 through the rest of this year and as you rightly say, into '24 as well. Tony Jones : And then for a follow-up, you're obviously very positive on your new product growth. But I was wondering if we should be expecting some sort of acceleration in capacity -- sorry, CapEx for new capacity, how do you see CapEx then developing over the next couple of years? Mark Douglas : Yes. I'll just give you my view and then Andrew, please jump in on some of those CapEx numbers. We do plan forward. Obviously, it takes us 3, 4, 5 years to get new facilities up and running from the initial stages of planning. We're already well into that curve. We have a very robust pipeline of new active ingredients, and that planning is folded into our near-term view of CapEx. When we get together in November, we'll give you the longer-term view of what CapEx investment will be. CapEx tends to be more modest for a company like ours, even when we're investing in the real active ingredient synthesis. So we're not like a major petrochemical company. So our forecasts include what we need today. But Andrew, do you want to make a comment? Andrew Sandifer : Yes. So certainly, Tony, I think you've seen a step up in the capital additions and investing activities that we're guiding for this year in the range of $140 million to $180 million. At the midpoint, that's a little over $40 million increase versus the level of CapEx in the prior year. And that step up very much reflects what Mark is pointing to in terms of the investment to support new products and capacity growth. I think that $160 million to $180 million range is probably the right number for the next couple of years. We do have a succession of new products coming to market that will require investment in capacity to be able to support their production and their growth and not the least of which continue to build out support for all of our broad products, including biological.  I don't think you should expect it to go much further north than that 160 to 140, 180 range over the next several years. I think just in terms of the pace of our growth, and as Mark mentioned, just the lower capital intensity of our business shouldn't be a significant difference from there. But again, at a midpoint of $160 million in CapEx this year on the guided $6.15 billion in sales, a very low capital intensity business. Operator : Next question comes from Stephen Byrne from Bank of America. Stephen Byrne : Our view on new crop chemicals is that they generally take a long time to ramp, this metric that you're quoting or 15% of your sales from products introduced in the last 5 years. Would you characterize that as a faster ramp than say, historical ramps on new products and more importantly, what are you doing differently to drive that? You mentioned, Mark, about investing in commercial. Is this staffing that's driving this? Is this your outreach to farmers in some way? Or is this just sharing the margin with the retail channel? What's driving it? Mark Douglas : Yes, I think a couple of things. Steve. On the growth side, I don't see this as being -- I don't see it as being an exceptionally accelerated rate right now. It's pretty normal for products to grow at this sort of rate. I think what is unique for us is the number that we're introducing. Our number of introductions, whether it be from our discovery and development pipeline of new active ingredients, or whether it's local formulation work in our research laboratories that are based in region, I think the number is increasing. Therefore, you're seeing the gross number get bigger every year just because every year, we're not slowing down.  I can think of some of the insecticides that we have that are 20, 30, 40 years old, they're still growing and they're still viable and still developing new formulations. So I would say, a number of products is key. So the productivity of our R&D organization is high. And then I think the second piece is what we've been investing in over the last couple of years, which is real resources on the ground to support growth. So when we talk about market access, we're not just talking about sales people, i.e., commercial people. We're talking about agronomists. We're talking about tech service people. We're talking about marketing people who can launch products in a region. It's that type of background activity that you have to invest in from an SG&A perspective to make sure that the products you're launching are getting the traction it needs. So it's that more holistic approach to new products that I think is bearing fruit from us.  And when I look at the pipeline, not just of active ingredients themselves, but of the product development work in the regions, it continues to accelerate. I mean, think about it. We got 2% of our revenue this year is coming from products launched this year. That's a very high number, and we've been hitting that number for the last couple of years, and we expect to see that to continue. So it's not one thing. It's holistically how we built the engine that delivers the new products to market. Stephen Byrne : And then, Mark, maybe just a little bit on your outlook for the overall market. It seems like you're a little more cautious with excluding the nonselective herbicides, it's now you're looking for a flat market. Is that primarily price-driven or volume? Mark Douglas : Yes. I think I'll just explain why we feel the nonselectives are driving the overall market. I think it's going to be a combination, depending on region of price and volume. I don't think there's any one that I would say it's all volume or oil price. I mean we do see growth in North America and Europe and the Middle East and Africa. So those markets will continue. That will be a combination of price and volume. Latin America, we're talking about a down market. We see that mainly driven as price. Volume is pretty good. As I said, we expect an acreage increase as we go through this year into the next season in Brazil. So volumes will be good. It's mainly price that we see from an overall perspective in Latin America.  And then Asia is down low single digits. Again, more likely to be priced than it is volume. Although India, as we've talked about, we have higher channel inventories. We know the market has higher channel inventories there may be some volume impacts in places like India as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Garchitorena from Wells Fargo. Richard Garchitorena : Just wanted to ask about the Plant Health business. It looks like it grew 30% in the EMEA, 10% LatAm, Oh God, only 8% organically. So you talked about North America sort of what you're seeing there and sort of how that should play out through the rest of the year given your overall expectations for growth, 20% overall. Mark Douglas : Yes. Listen, the Plant Health Segment has its ups and downs just like any of the other segments in the Crop Protection. So it's not unusual to see similar trends across the regions. North America is a market that we expect the business to grow rapidly. We have a number of new products that we're introducing, some of them pretty sophisticated formulations of synthetics as well as biologicals to aid the grower to give them new tools. Brazil is already a big market for us and continues to grow. I think in Europe, we're getting some more traction in terms of not just the biological piece, but the nutrition piece as well. So we have a very full range of micronutrients that we sell around the world. Europe is a key market for that.  And then I would say the next piece is Asia. Asia is very fragmented in terms of each country has its own requirements. We're making very good progress in places like Korea. We're now targeting India as another market that we feel we should be selling more of these products into. So when I talk about the biologicals growing pretty close to 30% and plant health overall growing at 20-plus percent is really coming from pretty much every region in the world, but with a very different mix. Richard Garchitorena : Great. And just a follow-up in terms of new product sales. North America saw a big uptick in the first quarter at 29% versus 19% in the fourth. So is it fair to say, as you move through the year, that's going to continue to add cumulatively. So how big could it get by the time you get to the fourth quarter, that's definitely going to be helping margins as well, I would assume. Mark Douglas : Yes. I mean when you think of the new product introductions on a full year basis, this year, we're targeting something like $120 million of sales within this year. So if you look at the first quarter, it's pretty much on a little bit lower because it's more second half weighted in terms of North America and Latin America, getting ready for the next season. So you launch initially at this part of the season, and then you gain the full benefit as you go through the year. So you should expect to see that build.  But the overall number of $120 million is what we launched this year, the overall number of just north of $800 million is building nicely as we go through the year. We're getting traction across all those products that we've launched in the last 5 years. Operator : We have our next question. And it comes from Josh Spector from UBS. Joshua Spector : Two questions on the volume side. I guess when you think about Latin America and the volume shortfalls in the first half because of the drought conditions, I guess, what gives you confidence that inventory levels aren't at risk to the back half or into next year? And kind of similarly on the diamides, where you talk about some partner channel destocking. What's the visibility that, that doesn't bleed into the second half as well? Mark Douglas : Yes. I think on the channel inventories, we'll see how we go through the second quarter. The markets are moving. You know what, if the market doesn't change much, yes, there will be some channel inventory hangover as we go into the next season. That occasionally happens. As the weather patterns improve as we go through the second quarter, we should be eating away at some of that inventory. So we'll see where the market gets to.  Our expectation, as we're forecasting is for a more normal season as we enter Q4 and Q1 into next year in Latin America. On the diamides, what we're telling you in our guidance now is that the partners that are reducing inventories, that's not just an event now that continues through the rest of the year. So that's already built into our forward-looking guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyCorp. Aleksey Yefremov : On India inventory adjustment, Mark, is there -- could you just describe the progress that has happened so far and how much longer this could take? Mark Douglas : Yes, sure. So we talked about it for a couple of quarters now. We had 2 to 3 years of very different monsoon patterns in the north and south. Last year, we had significant rice acreage reduction. So those are the catalysts for having higher inventories. We're going to work through that this year and probably into early next year. Given where the 2 seasons are in India, different types of products are sold on different crops. So once you get through 1 part, you've got to wait until the next season. It's not as if it's continuous. So in India, really, it's -- it's a case of work it down this year into early next year and then continue on our path of growth in India. Still a very, very important market for us. New product launches are carrying, good portfolio there. And obviously, inputs are needed to improve the productivity of the Indian growers. Aleksey Yefremov : And just because Asia was the largest drag on sales this quarter, you also mentioned dry conditions in Australia and they come as a first bullet in your Asia comments. Was this a larger negative than India? And do you have any broader comments about Asia, whether this will continue to be sort of the most negative region for you this year? Mark Douglas : Yes. I mean Australia was -- the impact was bigger than what we're doing in India, obviously. A country like Australia, people often don't think about as being terribly important in terms of the overall portfolio. But within 1 quarter, it can be because you're starting the season. So when you have a weather delay, that can impact a region, and you saw that in terms of what happened in Asia. Now the expectation in Asia is that we'll get past that. And once we get into the other markets like ASEAN, parts of China, Pakistan is growing nicely for us. Those countries will pick up the slack. So I wouldn't expect those numbers to be replicated as we go through this year. Australia was a key driver. Obviously, we didn't know about it when we gave our last forecast and it really is weather-related. It's not anything to do with the performance of the portfolio. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Question, and this might be for Andrew. Just as we think about cash flow and specifically kind of the cadence of working capital through the year, I mean, I appreciate there's inflation on the sales line. So this would normally build and there is normal seasonality, but it does seem like a slightly bigger than average or higher than normal step-up in receivables through in the first quarter. Can you just help us think about the cadence of working capital and cash flow and just how you're thinking about how tightly you're managing that to the -- in the current environment? Andrew Sandifer : Sure, glad to. Look, I think for us, seasonally, Q1 is always profoundly negative free cash flow. Both from the timing of sales and where we're growing in the world geographically. But also -- and I don't forget we've taken very substantial prepayments from customers in North America in the fourth quarter. So we're shipping a lot of product in Q1 that's essentially already been collected. So the size of this year the negative free cash flow of 915, up about $250 million versus the prior year. That just reflects the size of the growth of the business. I mean, we grew the business over $800 million last year. The amount of price and cost inflation that's flowing through receivables and inventory in particular to support that. Quite honestly, the $900 million, roughly $900 million negative free cash flow that we turned in this quarter was actually slightly better than our internal forecast. So we were pleased with that. Some good discipline around collections and actually in terms of what was expected to be collected in the quarter. We actually performed slightly better than what we were forecasting at the beginning of the quarter. The really big driver year-on-year are receivables and inventory. And that really -- again, it's the flow-through of inflation through working capital.  So I think the pattern of our working capital and our cash flow for this year is very similar to what you've seen in the last 4 years, strongly negative in Q1, will be modestly positive in Q2, and then you see significant positive cash flows in Q3 and Q4. On a cumulative free cash flow basis, we don't turn cash flow positive until some point in the third quarter. This also impacts our cash deployment that we tend to do. If we're going to do share repurchases, it tends to be back half weighted because it's more in line of when we are generating positive free cash flow. So I would just say, in summary, we were -- we are actually pleased with our free cash flow performance in the first quarter. We recognize it's a big number, but that's just the realities of the seasonality of our working capital, again, was slightly better than what we were anticipating and we expect a normal pattern as we go through the rest of the year. Adam Samuelson : All right. That's helpful color. And then just on the cost side, appreciate the SG&A control and some of the -- sometimes quarter-to-quarter timing differences that you can have on some of the spending. But how should we think about kind of a range of outcomes in terms of year-on-year spending growth in R&D, year-on-year growth in SG&A and just what would get you towards the -- just help us -- and kind of what that can be for the balance of the year? Andrew Sandifer : Yes. We can give you some rough thoughts here because it's very easy to be falsely precise with a 9-month outlook here. I think our general expectation is SG&A is probably growing in line with sales for the full year. We could adjust that depending on market conditions, and we have some ability to both from timing of spend and choices when we make some investments, we could slow that down in a given period. But I think assuming that SG&A growth generally in line with sales growth this year is not a bad assumption. R&D, I would expect to grow substantially above the growth of sales this year. We are investing very heavily in our new product pipeline and the continued development of differentiated formulations. And we do have a step-up this year in the acquired Fairmont business where we are investing a nontrivial amount of incremental R&D versus what we had in 2022 results and continue to drive forward the Fairmont product line to start bring products to market here shortly. So something north of the sales growth level for R&D growth would be what I would expect. Operator : Well, our next question comes from Joel Jackson from BMO. Joel Jackson : Could you maybe elaborate a little bit on what products or types of products would likely or see more stickier pricing than others? Mark Douglas : Yes, Joel. I mean, I think when I look at the portfolio, we have a lot of what we call differentiated products across the portfolio, especially from that NPI metric that I talked about. So if you think about the more recent formulations, the more recent active ingredients we've put in place, they're all bringing new modes of action on new ways of removing pests that are highly advantageous to the growers. So it's like a lot of different industries. The more specialty nature you have the more opportunity for differentiation, therefore, you've got more opportunity to hold price. And we see pretty much a large chunk of our portfolio have those sort of characteristics. I would say certainly on the insecticides, almost all on the fungicides because they're all new business for us.  And then on the new formulations for the pre-emergent herbicides as an example, in North America, and then other areas of herbicides, whether they're specialty herbicides on cereals. Those are the types of areas where we see us holding price. Joel Jackson : And then just on your Slide 9, you give your drivers for upside EBITDA guidance range drivers. Better anticipated mix, which is a general statement, but maybe you can give 1 or 2 most likely examples where you could get better than anticipated mix to hit the upside? Mark Douglas : Yes. I mean, certainly, the way we tried to structure this for people was to say, look, we're seeing a couple of things on the upside here around better mix as we improve the portfolio, the mix is improving. One thing you really don't see that now because just of the sheer magnitude of inflation that we've had going across the portfolio. Once that starts to receive, the mix element will become more apparent. And Andrew and I have been very focused on that as we think about driving the portfolio. The market share gains are very important. And those market share gains are happening not just in the U.S. although we've been talking about that, our activities around new insecticides, new fungicides, especially for corn and soy in the U.S.  Certainly in Brazil on market access around soy and corn where we've definitely improved our market share over the last few years and are bringing even more products to improve that. I think in Asia, the ASEAN countries, so thinking here of Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, where there is a lot of rice and a lot of specialty crops, again, putting investments in to gain share. I would say those are the 2 areas on the upside. For the midpoint, we're getting our mid-single-digit price increases. That's going really well. The cost headwinds we are seeing decelerate pretty much at the rate we thought it would, as I said, going to be very positive in Q3. We're not really seeing any supply chain disruptions now. Things are -- I wouldn't say back to normal because I hesitate to do that. But certainly, what we do see, we're managing very easily compared to where we were certainly 1 year or 18 months ago.  And then on the downside, I think the only thing we highlighted here was we're expecting a lower market growth than we were before, and that's probably on the downside. The positive thing here is we raised the lower end of the guidance, frankly, we're not seeing all these other elements. We're not seeing price momentum slowing. We're not seeing a product mix deteriorate. Input costs are not returning to an inflationary environment for us. So you can see how we're thinking about the world. The world is from a midpoint up is looking pretty good. Operator : The last question comes from Mike Harrison from Seaport Research Partners. Michael Harrison : In terms of EMEA, you mentioned the herbicides volume weakness there. Can we get a little more color on what you're seeing? And maybe help us understand if this has more to do with growing conditions or planted acres? Or maybe has something to do with competitive dynamics? Mark Douglas : Yes, Mike, I think the way I would describe it is, cereals market, core countries in Europe, so France, Germany, Northern Europe, U.K., growers and distribution, in particular, really taking notice of their working capital in this area. Cereals spot prices in Europe are lower than other parts of the world. I think it's just a prudent approach from the chain, the value chain in Europe on cereals right now. They will be using products. The question is how much do they replenish their inventory as we go through the rest of the season. So it's more of an industry dynamic than it is a peculiar FMC dynamic at this point. Michael Harrison : All right. And then in terms of the registration losses and the impact of the Russia exit? Are we lapping some of those headwinds in EMEA, I guess, during Q2 and as we get into the second half of the year? Mark Douglas : Yes, you will lap Russia now Q2. So that won't be a factor we'll be talking about anymore. We will still have registration losses in Europe. I think this year, we're talking about just north of 1%, something like that in terms of revenue. So it's a pretty -- what I would call a normal number. Europe does tend to be the area where we have more of these given the regulatory regime that's in Europe, but nothing out of the ordinary for the rest of the year, I would say.  So as we wrap up here, I'd just like to make 1 comment. The questions have been very good. I mean, ranging from everything in the P&L to the balance sheet. I think you can hear from the term that we're talking about in terms of the second half of the year we're feeling very good about the second half of the year. We have very, very good insight into where our cost structure is and the ability to manage our costs from an SG&A and R&D perspective as we go through the year. I think the growth on NPI is very exciting for a company like FMC. When you're having $800-plus million of your revenue coming from products launched in the last 5 years, and $120 million of products launched within the year. That tells you that the R&D and the innovation machine and the marketing machine is working very well together. That is a confidence booster for us in terms of how we think about new volume for the rest of the year. Thank you. Abizar Zaki : And that's all the time that we have for the call today. Thank you, and have a good day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the FMC Corporation Conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

This event is being recorded and all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Zack Zaki, Director of Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Please go ahead. Zack Zaki : Thank you, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Mark Douglas, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mark will review our second quarter performance as well as provide an outlook for the rest of the year. Andrew will provide an overview of select financial results. Following the prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our earnings release and today's slide presentation are available on our website, and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call. Let me remind you that today's presentation and discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning certain factors, including, but not limited to, those factors identified in our earnings release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's understanding. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion and the supporting materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations, free cash flow, net debt and organic revenue growth, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that, as used in today's discussion, earnings means adjusted earnings and EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Zack, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results are detailed on slides 3, 4 and 5. Sales in the quarter were significantly impacted by a substantial decline in volumes across all four regions. During our first quarter earnings call, we already had reduced our outlook for the crop protection market and thought that it would decline by low single digits this year. We now believe this is no longer a valid assumption. Considering the abrupt and intense destocking by growers in the distribution channel in the second quarter, we now expect the global crop protection market to contract by high single digits to low double digits. Even as on-the-ground consumption by growers remains at levels similar to last year and planted acres continue to grow in key geographies. Channel feedback indicates the destocking actions are a result of three factors : first, higher interest rates have increased the carrying cost of inventory; second, there is increased confidence in product availability as the supply chain disruptions of the past few years have eased; and third, price reductions in fertilizers and nonselective herbicides have led to a wait-and-see approach to ordering. As a result, growers in the distribution channel are placing orders as close to application as possible. For FMC, the reduced volume led to second quarter revenue that was 30% lower than the prior year and 28% lower, excluding FX. Despite the challenging market conditions, sales of new products introduced in the last five years remained resilient and were at levels similar to last year which aided product mix and illustrates the value of our innovative portfolio. Branded diamides also outperformed the rest of the portfolio. Price increases were broadly implemented in the quarter with an average gain of 3%. While our newer products generally perform better on a relative basis, nearly every country reported lower volume compared to the prior year period which illustrates the widespread nature of current channel dynamics. Turning to the regions. North American sales declined 25%, 24%, excluding FX versus the second quarter prior year. Overall, volumes were down. However, new products introduced in the last five years grew 43% and comprised 28% of total revenue, a record for the region. Branded diamides, including Coragen MaX, also showed strong growth, primarily due to elevated insect pressure in Canada. Sales in EMEA declined 26% year-over-year and were down 24%, excluding FX. Stronger pricing in the quarter was more than offset by lower volume as destocking was compounded by adverse weather across Europe. Shifting to Latin America. Revenue declined 38% versus the prior year period as the region faced additional headwinds to volume from a historic drought in Southern Brazil and Argentina. In Asia, sales declined 29% and were down 23% organically. In India, excess rain in the North and delayed monsoon season in the South added to volume challenges from continued high channel inventory. Australia and parts of ASEAN were also impacted by adverse weather. Overall, EBITDA was $188 million in the quarter, down 48% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the volume decline. Pricing momentum continued in the quarter. Costs became a year-over-year tailwind for the first time since 2020 as input costs continue to decline, and we closely manage spending. FX was a headwind to EBITDA in the quarter. Moving to the outlook for the rest of the year. Slide 6 shows our expectations for the second half. Overall, our second half EBITDA guidance is in line with the guidance provided during our first quarter earnings call as we expect the negative impacts from lower volumes to be modestly offset by lower costs. We expect second half revenue to be slightly below the prior year period at the midpoint and are assuming that the channel's active inventory management will continue, especially in Q3. However, we expect destocking headwinds to be partially offset by new product launches and higher volume in Latin America in the fourth quarter. We are assuming growers will continue to order products closer to the planting season. Business fundamentals remain solid as grower consumption and product applications are expected to remain steady and planted acreage is projected to increase. We are expecting a low single-digit pricing benefit in the second half with the majority of pricing actions already in place. FX impact is forecasted to be minimal. We are guiding EBITDA for the second half of the year to be $801 million in the midpoint, which is a 16% higher than the prior year results. The main drivers are expected tailwinds from lower input costs, improved mix from new products and a modest pricing tailwind, partially offset by volume headwinds. This is expected to result in EBITDA growth and healthy margin expansion. Slide 7 provides the quarterly guidance for the second half of the year. Volumes are forecasted to more heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter as the recent hand-to-mouth inventory management is expected to result in growers and the distribution channel, making purchases closer to the timing of applications, especially during the start of the planting season in South America. Our third quarter revenue guidance at the midpoint is 11% lower than the prior year as destocking is expected to continue, resulting in a volume decline in the low-teens percentage. However, we are still projecting slight EBITDA growth at the midpoint as favorable input costs are anticipated to offset the revenue headwind from the volume decline. Fourth quarter revenue is expected to be 6% higher at the midpoint versus the prior year driven by the timing of orders shifting from the third quarter, product launches and additional acreage in Latin America. EBITDA and earnings per share are both expected to be 24% higher than the prior year at the midpoint, primarily from higher volumes and the positive mix impact from new products. Slide 8 provides the second half assumptions for the outcomes at each end of our guidance range. The largest variable in the range is volume, which is closely tied to the duration of channel destocking. We are assuming a high single-digit volume decline and a low single-digit price benefit. Across the guidance range, we are confident in our cost discipline, and we still expect input cost tailwinds. However, we are aggressively managing our working capital in response to the current trend of order patterns, including adjusting production levels across our manufacturing lines. Many of our lines are currently not operating which will result in some unabsorbed fixed costs. I will now turn it over to Andrew to cover cash flow and other the financial items. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks, Mark. I'll start this morning with a review of some key income statement items. FX was a 2% headwind to revenue growth in the second quarter, with the most significant headwinds coming from the Indian rupee, the Pakistani rupee, the Canadian dollar and the Turkish lira. Looking ahead through the rest of 2023, we see modest FX headwinds in the third quarter with diminished impact in the fourth quarter. Third quarter headwinds stemmed primarily from Asian currencies, particularly the Indian rupee and Pakistani rupee. EBITDA margin of 18.5% in the quarter was down more than 600 basis points versus the prior year period. Gross margin percent was up 200 basis points year-on-year due to input cost tailwinds, higher prices and favorable mix, but the steep drop in revenue and moderately higher operating spend resulted in a lower EBITDA margin. We are anticipating strong expansion of EBITDA margins in the second half with continued input cost tailwinds, mix improvement, pricing and operating expense discipline. EBITDA margins are expected to be up roughly 270 basis points in Q3 and 460 basis points in Q4 with full year 2023 EBITDA margin forecasted to increase by roughly 120 basis points despite the tough first half of the year. Interest expense for the second quarter was $64.5 million, up $29.2 million versus the prior year period. Substantially higher U.S. interest rates were the primary driver of higher interest expense in the quarter, along with higher overall debt levels resulting from elevated working capital. We now expect full year interest expense to be in the range of $220 million to $230 million, an increase of $15 million at the midpoint compared to our prior guidance. This increase is driven by higher debt balances due to elevated working capital levels. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the second quarter was 15%, in line with the midpoint of our full year expectation for a tax rate of 14% to 16%. Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity. On May 15th, we issued $1.5 billion in senior unsecured notes and equal tranches of 3-year, 10-year and 30-year maturities. Proceeds from this offering were used to retire the 2021 term loan and pay down commercial paper balances. After these financing actions and reflecting the results of the Company in the second quarter, gross debt was $4.7 billion at June 30th, up $470 million from the prior quarter. Gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 3.8 times, while net debt-to-EBITDA was 3.0 times. During June, as the magnitude of the channel inventory reset and its implications on our business started to become apparent, we entered into discussions with our bank group to amend the leverage covenant on our revolving credit agreement. We signed the final amendment on June 30th, which raises our leverage ratio covenant to 4.0 times through March 31, 2024, and 3.75 times thereafter. We believe this amendment provides us ample room to navigate through the current disruptions. Moving on to cash flow generation and deployment on slide 10. FMC generated free cash flow of $93 million in the second quarter, down $72 million versus the prior year. Cash from operations declined $64 million as substantially lower use of cash for receivables was more than offset by negative cash flow impact on nearly every other line. Capital additions and other investing activity spending was up while legacy spending was down. With this result, year-to-date free cash flow at June 30th was negative $822 million, more than $300 million lower than the prior year period. This reflects the year-on-year drop in EBITDA as well as the impact on working capital of the current channel inventory reset. We returned $123 million to shareholders in the quarter in a combination of $73 million in dividends and $50 million in share repurchases. Between May 10th and May 17th, we purchased approximately 457,000 FMC shares at an average cost of $109.35. With these purchases, we now expect weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 125.8 million shares for the remainder of 2023. We reduced our free cash flow guidance to zero at the midpoint for 2023. This is a result of the decline in EBITDA, lower first half sales resulting in lower cash collection and an expected pronounced decline in accounts payable in the second half of the year as we adjust production to balance inventory with demand. Adjusted cash from operations is now expected to be between $40 million and $370 million, down substantially versus the prior year. We slightly lowered our plans for capital additions and now expect to spend $125 million to $135 million as we continue to invest to support new product introductions. Legacy and transformation cash spending is expected to remain essentially flat at the midpoint after adjusting for the benefit from the disposal of an inactive site in 2022. This guidance implies a rolling three-year average free cash flow conversion of 47%, well below our targeted 70-plus-percent due entirely to the cash flow impacts of the channel inventory reset. While it's too early to comment in detail, we do expect cash flow to rebound as we move past the current disruptions. With the current year free cash flow outlook, near-term cash deployment priorities have changed. Free cash flow generated in the second half will first be used to pay the dividend with remaining cash used to reduce short-term borrowings. We do not plan any further share repurchases this year. We will evaluate restarting share repurchases in 2024 as leverage levels return to targets. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Andrew. Before we open it up to Q&A, I want to remind everyone that we will be holding our Investor Day at our headquarters here in Philadelphia on Thursday, November the 16th. In addition to interacting with our executive team and leaders, attendees will be updated on our new strategy going forward. To close, it is very clear that the market is performing in a fundamentally different way than we had forecasted at the beginning of the year. We are adapting to control tightly what is critical at this time, namely lowering our inventories of raw materials and finished goods to match the short-term demand, managing our internal costs, while at the same time, investing in our R&D pipeline for the future and finally, focusing on selling our newly launched products, which add real value to our overall profitability, as well as new products we have coming in Q4, especially in Latin America for soy applications. While we have not seen this magnitude of volume change across multiple regions at the same time before, we have successfully managed through demand shocks in the past and have always emerged a stronger, more profitable business. I am confident this will happen again, especially as we have the benefit of good grow demand for our products around the world. I'll now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have our first question comes from Laurent Favre from Exane BNP Paribas. Laurent Favre : I'd like to go back to what changed since the May outlook and you -- Mark, you mentioned the volumes seen at low single digits and now up to low double digits and yet with consumption being broadly flat. I was wondering, has it changed your assessment of how much went into the ground last year, or do you think that channel inventories will end up abnormally low this year. And I guess it's a way of asking if there are reasons to hope for a big volumes reversal into 2024? Thank you. Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks, Laurent. Well, first of all, you can tell by the comments we made, as we went through the quarter and especially from the end of May onwards, we really started to see a very aggressive deceleration of orders from around the world, basically. So any country that was in season was really reducing volumes. And this came, I think, through basically starting at the grower level. What we suspect now is that growers were holding inventory to levels that have not seen before. And let's be clear, it's not normal for growers to hold inventory. It's not something they usually spend their cash on. So, our analysis today says that growers were holding inventory. When retail went to sell to growers, growers basically said, \"Well, we don't need anything right now\" and of course, that starts to back up through a pretty complex supply chain until it comes to us. And we've seen this around the world. We've seen it through other players in the industry with their public announcements. You can tell that this is fundamentally a global reset of inventories. What we think happened over the last couple of years is that as supply disruptions made people nervous, obviously, inventory was being built through all these different nodes in the supply chain, and that has now been unwound. Now going forward, what do we expect? We do see that this phenomenon will continue in Q3, as we've said. And we're indicating we expect our own volumes to be down in that sort of low-teen range across the world. We expect that to continue through Q3. Our assumption is that this will evolve as the seasons evolve. So for instance, we do expect the growers in Latin America and South America, in particular, Brazil and Argentina, they will be placing orders, but they're going to be much closer to the planting season. That doesn't normally occur. We've talked about in the past that at this time of year, we have a certain percentage of orders on hand. That's not the same this year at all. We're expecting those orders to flow as we go through late Q3 and into Q4. Now that's in Latin America. We expect the North American season as people start to buy in Q4, the end of Q4 into the beginning of Q1, we'll start to see the same phenomenon. We won't see that in Europe until Q1 and into Q2 just because of the way the seasons flow. Asia is a little more balanced because we have both Northern and Southern Hemisphere. So it is going to be a case of we expect inventories to start normalizing as we go into Q4 and order patterns to start normalizing. And that will continue as we go through the first half of next year. I've never seen this before. I've been in this industry 12 years. I've seen pockets of this Brazil in 2015, which was a totally different circumstance, but still a reduction in volume. This is everywhere. I think we only had two or three countries in the world where we saw increased revenue year-on-year, everywhere else was down. So that tells you the magnitude of what we're dealing with. Laurent Favre : Thank you. And you also mentioned the price declines in fertilizers and nonselectives as the reason, I guess, for growers to change behavior. In that context, what gives you confidence that you can avoid price cuts into the second half and into next year, in particular, given the context of variable cost deflation? I'm not aware of such a strong pricing discipline in the industry, but maybe especially for diamides, it might be a different story. Mark Douglas : Yes. Listen, I think given the strength of the portfolio, and I just alluded to the fact that our products launched in the last five years were very robust in the quarter and have been so far this year. That's a lot to do with the type of products we're bringing that are differentiated. And with differentiation, you have the ability to hold price, which is what we're talking about now. Price in the second half of the year and in particular, into Q4, we pretty much already have in place the prices. Now it's a case of managing through the disruptions and the holding price as we go forward, which we're confident of doing. Given the size of the NPI sales today, to put it in perspective for you, in Q2, about 14% of our revenue came from products launched in the last five years. That was up from 10% in Q2 2022. So it continues to grow rapidly. And when you look at the full year, as we think about the new products rolling into Q4, that number gets up to about $720 million year-on-year versus about $620 million the year before. So almost a 20% increase. That's the heart of the Company today. It is the new products we're introducing, the value they bring. Now I did talk about new products in Q4 going forward. Very important in Latin America, we have two brand-new products that we're launching right now. One is an insecticide for soybeans; the other is a brand-new fungicide that is for soybeans, but will be traditionally launched on cotton first. Those are expected to be very valuable and large volume players as we go into Q4. So, it's not just price. It is the portfolio. We also talked about the diamides. Our branded sales of diamides performed well versus the rest of the portfolio. I think they declined something like high single digits versus our overall reduction of about 30%. That can't be said the same for our partners in the diamides, which are the people that we sell technical diamides to. We talked about these partners before. They have been doing the same thing as everybody else in the industry, which is drawing down their inventories, which impacts our sales to them. That will come back next year. We have no doubt about that. We've talked to them. They're just managing their inventory like we are. So I think you've seen a confluence of events that are playing out right now that will unwind as we go into 2024. Operator : We have our next question comes from Christopher Parkinson from Mizuho. Christopher Parkinson : Mark, just given everything that's going on and I'd say the lack of urgency of wholesaler and co-op behaviors relative to the past few years, what do you think the probability is that some of your retail channels kind of overshoot to the downside in terms of inventories, just given healthy end market demand? I know perhaps that's not kind of the key focus right now, but just given how strong volumes are and once again, what's actually being sprayed, what are your thoughts on that on the various -- within various geographies, but I'm asking specifically on North America. Thank you. Mark Douglas : Yes. Chris, listen, I think you're going to see pockets of people overshooting on inventory reduction. It's such a big industry. There are many different nodes to these channels. You could tell that the industry's ability to forecast what was coming, as we went down this curve, it's probably the same as we come out of this curve. So I do expect to see places where inventory has been run down too much and will come back at a faster pace. There are other places where inventory was high and is being drawn down to what we would call more normal levels. So, it's going to be a combination of the two. It's -- as I said, it's such a large industry and complex supply chains that it would not surprise me to see that. I think you'll see it in North America just as much as you'll see it in anywhere else. I don't think North America is in any particularly different shape. I would say, Latin America, we expect to see the same phenomenon and certainly in Europe as well. We have seen public comments by major distributors in the U.S. about how they see their inventory levels reducing and how they expect to see that come back as we go through the next season. So overall, I think you're going to see probably both impacts. Some people will overshoot and some people won't. Christopher Parkinson : Very helpful. And just as a quick follow-up. I know it's a little bit early, but obviously, there's going to be a lot of focus on free cash flow generation and obviously, how a lot of investors have been thinking about your rolling three-year averages and how '23 is a bit of a hiccup in that kind of longer-term trends. Perhaps either you or Andrew could just hit on the key considerations as we're exiting '23, understanding there can always be a lot of movement between the fourth and the first quarters. But how should investors be broadly thinking about the longer-term algo as it -- specifically as it pertains to hopeful '24 improvements? Thank you. Andrew Sandifer : Sure. Hey. It's Andrew, Chris. Thanks. Look, I think that the story for free cash flow in 2023 is actually relatively simple. However, challenging and disappointing it might be in the immediate term. We have a substantial drop in the EBITDA guidance for the year that flows directly through cash flow. The sales growth is in the second half, and the balance of our sales is more second half weighted as you know well, given the regions in which those sales are made, we won't collect on those sales in the year, so collections are lower. But building on comments Mark made in our prepared remarks, we are adjusting production levels across our operating lines right now. That means we're not buying anything as we're not manufacturing a lot of -- we have ample inventory at the moment. So, we're not manufacturing a lot of new material. So, we're not buying anything. So, we're looking at somewhere north of a $400 million drop in accounts payable at year-end. I mean simply $180 million drop in the EBITDA guidance and a $400 million drop in accounts payable basically wipes out the free cash flow we had guided for this year. Now as you pointed to, free cash flow is pretty lumpy. And as you cross, time periods can swing pretty rapidly. We do expect that as we move into more normalized conditions in '24, that we would see a rebound in free cash flow. We\u2019d see a rebuilding of payables. We\u2019d see a reduction in inventory, and we get back to a more normal collection cycle, more balance between the halves of the year. So we have nothing that makes us feel any different about our long-term goal and expectation that we should operate this business at a 70% plus rolling average free cash flow generation. It's just these -- the rapidity of these adjustments in this channel inventory reset this year is just too much to overcome unfortunately, in the six-month period. So that's the reality of free cash flow. But again, I think we feel very confident about the cash-generating capability of this business over the long term, and you will see that rebound as the situation normalizes. Operator : We have our next question comes from Salvator Tiano from Bank of America. Salvator Tiano : So the first thing I want to understand is, you mentioned how farmer applications seem to be flat year-on-year holding up. Can you talk a little bit about your -- how you go in trying to understand what farmers are doing and what confidence level you have here? Because obviously, what farmers ultimately do is the critical point in understanding how much of this volume decline is true demand decline versus actual destocking. Mark Douglas : Yes, sure. I mean, there's different methodologies for us to be able to have some insight into what is happening at the grower level. First of all is acreage that gets planted. Obviously, you're planting, you're using crop protection products. So, that's something that we look at around the world, and it's well recorded and many independent consultants look at that. The second is there are other independent sources that we put information in and the rest of the industry puts information in and then you get an aggregate output, which tells you what the market is doing. That's particularly strong in Brazil. It's particularly strong in the U.S., less so in Europe and less so in Asia. So, it's a couple of things. It's our understanding on the ground of what's getting planted and then what is being applied and then also third-party independent sources, which are available to everybody. Salvator Tiano : Great. Thank you. And my follow-up is a little bit on trying to understand a little bit what's happening with your diamide partners. So firstly, you're talking about the destocking. So essentially, in your view and your understanding is that diamide demand, whether it's branded products or from your partners, is holding up, but your partners like UPL are going above and beyond to lower their AI purchases firstly. And secondly, I think UPL specifically entered the U.S. market with its Shenzi product a few months ago. What is the impact for this to your own branded business in the U.S.? Mark Douglas : Well, a couple of things. So, first of all, when we talk about supply and technical grade diamides to our partners, think of us as essentially a raw material supplier. So, they're treating us as a raw material supplier, the same as we're treating our raw material suppliers. So, it's nothing more than that. It is a simple case of they obviously have demands on their inventories that they're having to reduce, and we are part of that. We do that to our own suppliers and are doing it right now. So, you see that. From a demand perspective, we don't think their demand is slowing down at all, neither is ours, as we just commented on. To the second part of your question with regards to competition in the U.S., we've seen competition for some time in many parts of the world with the diamides. What we do know is that our branded products and the new introductions that we're making of new formulations are moving the needle. In other words, we're not selling the same products that we were selling five years ago. We're selling more sophisticated, higher concentration formulations to our current customers. So, where generics are coming in with a certain type of product, we're not selling those products anymore. We're selling something completely different. So, it's very much a case of our product life cycle management that we've been going through and we've been talking about for the last five years, it is now bearing fruit in terms of how our product mix is changing for our branded diamides. Operator : We have our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : I'm wondering if we could talk a little bit just about raw material costs. Obviously, that was a good news story, supposedly start in the second half of this year and into next year. Just wondering, with the reduction in production on your end and presumably others will have to do the same thing, should we be expecting more deflation, obviously, maybe not immediately, but as we move into 2024? Mark Douglas : Yes, Vincent, good question. And let me just start it off and then Andrew, if you want to talk a little more granularity on the cost side. Certainly, we've been anticipating and we expected lower costs as we go through the second half of the year. We started to see that in Q2, and we've talked about an order of magnitude difference in Q3, which we know is there. I would say generally in the industry, prices have come down, continue to come down. I think we're looking at perhaps a little better scenario than we thought at the beginning of the year. A lot depends on what China does. We're seeing a lot of shutdowns in China after they've been selling products, what we believe has been below costs. Obviously, you can't keep that going for very long. So, it'll be interesting to see what happens to many of the Chinese producers that are probably in some significant financial issues right now. We expect that -- we expect some of those smaller companies to disappear. Our view is that we'll expect to see the current level of lower raw materials and intermediate costs roll through into 2024. But Andrew, do you want to just comment on that further? Andrew Sandifer : Yes, certainly. I think, Vincent, I think you're spot on in that we are seeing improvement in costs as the pressures of the destocking hit every stage in the value chain. Despite the weak volume outlook for Q3, we still have substantial cost tailwinds in the quarter. In fact, the cost tailwinds are stronger now than what we anticipated three months ago. Some of the things that move more quickly through our inventory and into cost like packaging materials, for example, have improved. So we actually are seeing improved costs. We saw better than expected costs in Q2. We're expecting stronger than what we had initially expected in Q3. And I think you see continued benefit of that in Q4. So, these dynamics pushing back into the chain, I think set up a very favorable cost position going into 2024. A bit hard to look too far out to 2024 just yet, but from what we can see, we should start the year in a very favorable input cost situation. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And as a follow-up, I know with the reduced guidance when you pre-announced, it came with some incremental cost out efforts that you were going to do. And I just would like to get a better sense of what it is that you're doing and how you're sort of balancing the desire to sort of improve your near-term earnings situation through this challenge and then obviously look for cash flow versus the last year or two, we've been talking about the very successful investments you've made and opening up new markets and doing things like that. So, how are you trying to sort of balance? It's obviously a very challenging period of time right now with sort of making sure that you're continuing to do the right things to invest in the growth of the business over the medium to long term. Mark Douglas : Yes. Vincent, listen, it's a very good point. I mean, we run this company for the long term. And the Company really is built that way in terms of, I think, of R&D and the longevity of that R&D pipeline. We're not cutting back on our R&D. That's something that is very important to us. We believe the strength of that pipeline will drive the overall valuation of the Company over the long haul. So, we're doing everything we can not to slow down the projects in R&D. That doesn't mean to say we can't save costs in R&D from an operating standpoint, but we're not slowing down the main projects. That's the important message. On the rest of the Company, we're really focused on the front end, the very pointy end of the Company, which is all our commercial groups and marketing groups which drive revenue demand. There are many things that we look at in terms of all the line items from a sales and general and admin perspective. That's where we're cutting back. So, we're cutting back in the short term on things that we know will not impact our customer intimacy, won't stop us getting volume or demand that's out there. So, really focusing on the customers. Everything from the customer back, we're doing everything we can to reduce that spend. Andrew, do you want to add anything? Andrew Sandifer : Yes. I just would emphasize that we are controlling spend. We are still going to be spending more dollars in R&D this year than we did last year. We're just not growing quite as fast. Similarly with SG&A. And as Mark pointed to, we're not making any compromises on investing in the commercial operations of the Company and that expanding market access and building that closer intimacy with the customer. We are being very careful in metering our spending in other areas. And I think this is something that we've demonstrated over a number of different disruptions that have occurred in the past 12, 15 years that we can do, particularly in the last 5. So, we will be spending well below what we started the year planning to spend, but we'll continue to make investments that are going to drive the long-term future of the Company. And nothing that we're doing has any structural impact to the Company's ability to grow. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Spector from UBS. Lucas Beaumont : This is Lucas Beaumont on Josh. So I just wanted to get back to the volumes, if we could. So if sort of I understood your comments earlier correctly and a chunk of the volume growth over the last two years was more driven by sort of customers that are ordering and it's basically going into inventory versus the underlying demand. So, I mean, if we kind of look then at sort of your trends for this year in the last two, over a kind of three-year period, you're basically in line with that sort of long-term low single-digit kind of volume growth rate. So I guess that as we think about the setup for next year, does that mean that we should basically going to just return to trend growth from this like lower level and not really expect more of a rebound, or how should we kind of think about that? Thanks. Mark Douglas : Yes, good question. I think your thesis is pretty close to how we think about it. I think going forward, listen, it's early August, it's almost impossible for us to think through to 2024 right now. We haven't even really started our budget process. But if I just take a step back and think about the fundamentals of the market that we're talking about, what do we see? We see soft commodities and grains at very good prices in the marketplace. Not quite at the peak they were about a year, 18 months ago, but not far off and certainly well above the long-term average for these products. You look at the stock-to-use ratios, stock-to-use ratios in many of the soft commodities have been trending down. Why? Because we've had yield issues around the world. As climate change really does impact agriculture, you could see what happened as we talked about in Latin America last year, unprecedented drought in South of Brazil and Argentina. We've had flooding in the north of India. We've got a dry Midwest right now in the U.S., heat in Europe. All those things contribute to a higher commodity price and lower yields. So, that's a good backdrop for somebody to sell into. So fundamentally, we know there is demand. We know we have to increase productivity by about 3% a year just to keep hunger at bay around the world. So I think the backdrop is solid. We see acreage increases anticipated, especially in Brazil and other parts of Latin America as we go into the next season. So for me, that on-the ground grower view of the world is positive. And right now, it's hard to see what would change that. So, it's a little early to say what our growth rates would be next year, but I am expecting a positive backdrop as we roll through 2024. Lucas Beaumont : Great. Thanks. And then just on the fourth quarter specifically, could you walk us through your margin assumptions that are getting to your 4Q guide? So how much of that is kind of from volume catch-up versus more normal trends? And how much do you expect raw materials to help there in the fourth quarter? Thanks. Andrew Sandifer : It's Andrew here, on margins in the fourth quarter. Look, I think it's all of the above. We do have positive volume contribution. But remember, when we look at volume, we include mix and volume. It's a strong quarter for us for new product introduction. Mark mentioned two specific products for Brazil that we have very high expectations for. But it's a broad portfolio of newer products that will contribute to a more positive mix. We do have cost tailwinds. We do have input cost favorability that we expect to sustain in Q4. We do have some modest continued pricing benefits. Now, it's not necessarily new price increases, but the year-on-year comparison from where we've raised prices to at this point still carrying over versus the prior year. So it's a broad-based combination there. And it really does allow us to deliver what will be one of the strongest margin quarters in quite some time for FMC. But it is a combination of all of those factors in the fourth quarter. It's input cost, it's volumes, it's operating expense discipline, it\u2019s the continued pricing benefit of actions we've already taken, all of those factors. Operator : We have our next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Dan Rizzo : This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Thank you for taking my question. I thought I remembered in 2015, 2016 that channel inventory destocking became a multi-season issue. I was wondering how things are different now and if that is somewhat of a risk to happen again. Mark Douglas : Yes. 2015, you've got to remember back to 2015, it seems a long time ago now, but that was a particular event in Brazil. It was both inventory, it's currency impact and it was, again, that scarcity of products leading into that. I think this is different in the sense of it's broader and it's happening much faster. In other words, the decreases we're seeing on a quarterly basis right now, they're much more extreme than they were before. I think the other thing for us, in particular, although there was a lot of people impacted by the Brazilian event, there was a new seed trait that was introduced into Brazil for soybeans, which impacted insecticides within a reasonably short time frame. That was a factor that it's certainly not at play today in any way, shape or form. So, I don't necessarily look back on Brazil as a proxy for what is happening today. Dan Rizzo : All right. Thank you. That's helpful. And then have you guys kind of quantified what a headwind unfavorable cost absorption will be given the lower production levels you talked about in the second half of the year? Andrew Sandifer : Yes. We have not yet quantified that in part because it's a moving target. We do anticipate based on what our operating levels are right now that there will be some modest fixed cost absorption headwinds in Q4. That's built into our guidance, be very clear. It mitigates -- it offsets a small amount of the input cost benefits we have in Q4. But in terms of how that might bleed over into next year, it's too early to know because it's going to depend on how we operate through the rest of the year. I think we're being very thoughtful about managing our inventories, trying to bring them down in line with current demand, but also leave ourselves in a position to be able to capitalize on the eventual recovery of market. So, it is a bit of a moving target. But I think key message, both our Q3 and Q4 guidance reflect our expectations for any impact of unabsorbed fixed costs in these periods. And as we look forward to the next year, it's really going to depend how the rest of the year plays out. Operator : We have our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : I was hoping to maybe draw a little bit closer distinction in the terms of the second quarter sales decline and the trends you're seeing between orders from your customers for -- where you're a supplier of the diamides to other crop chem manufacturers to sales into the channel? And is there actually any distinction in terms of sales trends and magnitude of decline to glean from those just as we think about kind of where the change in activity levels have occurred, and I mean, again, it's been global, it's a magnitude that's really not with recent precedent, but I'm just trying to distinguish where you're now a bigger supplier to other manufacturers than you were historically. Kind of how that has -- if there was any meaningful change in distinction between those two sales trends? Mark Douglas : Yes. Listen, I think we just commented on the fact, Adam, that the branded diamides that we're selling ourselves into the marketplace did much better than the overall portfolio. That's a subset of that new product introduction. In other words, we're introducing new branded diamides that are very differentiated. That's what the market is looking for. The market is looking for newer products that enable them to remove pest brake resistance, et cetera. I think the sales to our partners, that is used for a number of different applications, whether it's for seed treatment or whether it's portfolio applications. So they're going about their business in their own way in managing their inventory as they are. There's no indication, as I said earlier, that their volumes to the end users are falling off. It's more an inventory management perspective. But I do want to emphasize the fact that our own diamide sales, our own branded products are doing extremely well, especially the recently launched products. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then, if I just think about the fourth quarter and the cadence of revenues for the balance of the year where you have volumes improving in 4Q. Can you talk about just the magnitude that the expected contribution from some of those new product introductions and kind of where not really firm orders per se, but where -- just help us that meeting a discrete building block to return to growth in 4Q versus kind of what is just an assumption of a return to more normal buying patterns from your channel partners, presumably in South America, most notably? Mark Douglas : Yes. I mean the new products are really targeted at Latin America. I'm not going to give the numbers for that because I don't want to give away any competitive information on how well we're doing. But we already have significant interest from our partners in the channel, whether it's distribution, co-ops or large growers for these new products. So, we're very excited about bringing those products to market. And so far, the interest that we've generated with our growers is very, very positive. Operator : Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyCorp. Unidentified Analyst : This is Paul on for Aleksey. Can you walk us through some of the adverse weather conditions you are seeing and where inventory levels stand in those regions? Thanks so much. Mark Douglas : Yes. Listen, I just made a comment earlier about weather. I mean, we've had in the first half of the year, obviously, very difficult conditions in the south of Brazil and Argentina through drought. We're seeing dry conditions in the Midwest of the U.S., very dry conditions in the South of Europe as you go through Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey. We also have seen flooding in China, flooding in the north of India, dryness in the south of India, dryness in Australia. I mean the list goes on and on. We're dealing with more weather volatility than we ever have over the last year. So those are the types of things that mother nature throws at us. And of course, mother nature doesn't care about the financial quarters that we have to deal with but that's something that we all have to manage as we play in the agricultural field. But it's certainly real. And in some countries, it's very, very impactful. Unidentified Analyst : Great. And as a follow-up, as raw materials and the logistics environment start to normalize, do you see the supply of more competitive products entering the market? Mark Douglas : I guess, you mean from a generic standpoint, from a -- what you mean from a -- could you just elaborate a little bit more what you're looking for? Unidentified Analyst : Yes, yes, from a generic standpoint. Mark Douglas : Listen, generics play a major role in the marketplace. They have been around and they are around. We don't necessarily play in a lot of those markets. It's not to say that the markets they play in are not valuable, they are. But we don't have a lot of generic pressure in a lot of our product lines, mainly because of how we differentiate through either new active ingredients or new formulations that we bring to market. So, I expect the generic market to get more competitive, but we don't play in that space. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Garchitorena from Wells Fargo. Richard Garchitorena : Great. Thanks. My question, just from a bigger picture, you mentioned that the macro environment has changed the way that your customers have been managing inventories. Is there any change in terms of what you think about in terms of what the mid-cycle sort of earnings generation of the business is? Should we look at $1.4 billion sort of like as a good base to move from going forward? Mark Douglas : Yes. This is a very good question. I mean, in November, we're going to give you a view of our world going forward for the next three years and then a longer-term aspiration. But we've been clicking along at a fair rate of 5% to 7% top line, 7% to 9% bottom line. We just did a look back and we've outgrown the market anywhere from 1.5 times to 2.5 times over the last 20 years. So we know we have a model and a portfolio that can deliver that type of growth. I do think thinking of this year as a reset is a good way to think about it, and then how do we bring the next generation of growth to the Company. I don't see it as some massive rebound next year. I don't think that's going to happen. I think the channel is learning the lesson of carrying the right amount of inventory. So I think we'll reset this year. And then we'll move forward, and we'll share with you in November what we think that potential new algorithm will look like in terms of top line, EBITDA and EPS growth going forward. Richard Garchitorena : Okay, great. And just as a follow-up, how has the biological business impacted at all the change in the market environment? Do you still see 7% to 8% CAGR growth for the next few years? I know we get an update in November but any thoughts on that right now would be great. Thank you. Mark Douglas : Yes. I mean, listen, I don't think there's a single piece of this crop protection market that has not been impacted in the same way, whether they're biologicals or micronutrients or whatever the product you're bringing to market. I think everything has been impacted by the significant reset we're seeing. Now, having said that, we still have expectations that the plant health business will grow in that 20-plus-percent range. The biologicals are growing even faster. We'll continue to see that accelerate as we invest more, especially in R&D. So, we see that continuing. It's not something that we feel has been hampered long term by this recent reset. If anything, it teaches us that having that broader portfolio is going to help us going forward from a value perspective. So, we do see plant health as it continues to be a major focus for us, and the biologicals will continue to outpace the rest of the Company by some degree. Operator : We have our last question comes from Joel Jackson from BMO. Unidentified Analyst : This is Joseph on for Joel. So just to help get volumes moving again, would FMC consider increasing rebate programs in the second half to help pull forward some volumes from first half 2023? Mark Douglas : Good question. Listen, there is always a commercial package to be put together. And rebates in some parts of the world are a meaningful way that we go to market, like everybody else, the U.S. being one of those markets, but rebates are not used all over the world. So, we consider all the tools we have to make sure that we're delivering value to the growers and that we're getting the appropriate value to FMC. So, if there are rebate changes to be made, they'll be made, but it will be done in the context of the value we're bringing. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then, just coming back to Q4, in terms of costs, are they essentially all locked in now, and how much of Q4 volume and price expectations are at risk, would you say? Mark Douglas : Andrew, do you want to\u2026 Andrew Sandifer : I'll chime on at least the first part of that question. I think the costs for Q4 are largely locked. There are items that move more quickly through our cost structure, particularly packaging items and logistics that we can continue to move as we move into fourth quarter. The final mix actually does matter because the cost reductions we're seeing are not uniform across every input or every product that we have. So, I do think we have a high confidence in the level of cost tailwind we're expecting in Q4 and a vast preponderance of that is pretty much locked in, but not quite all of it just yet. I think, in terms of -- Mark, maybe you want to speak to price and volume in the fourth quarter in terms of visibility there. Mark Douglas : Yes. I mean, listen, price and volume will be, as we've said, it will be within the quarter or very close to the quarter. A little early to say at this point, but as we get there, we'll know exactly how we're playing and how the market is moving. Our expectation, as I've said numerous times, is we expect orders to be coming very close to the planting season, and that's what we're gearing up for. Operator : Thank you. Due to time constraint, I will now pass back to Mr. Zack Zaki for closing remarks. Zack Zaki : All right. No, that's it. Glenn, thank you very much. That's all the time that we have for the call today. Thank you, and have a good day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the FMC Corporation conference call. Thank you for attending.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Zack. And good morning, everyone. During Q3, we observed a continuation of industrywide destocking activity as the value chain resets inventory levels in response to increased security and supply and high interest rates. This led to significantly lower volumes versus the prior year and in the case of Latin America, the decline was much more severe than we had estimated at our last earnings call. As a reminder, due to the timing of its growing season Latin America is typically the strongest contributor to our Q3 results which amplifies the region\u2019s impact on our overall Q3 numbers. We had assumed that the destocking we observed in Latin America during Q2 would be sufficient to allow for our normal order patterns to resume. As Latin America entered its main growing season in September, it became clear that we underestimated the debt and duration of the destocking to come. It is our view that when the global destocking ends and channel inventories have been reset, there will not be a snapback restocking period. Rather, we expect the crop protection market will grow from that reset inventory base at a more historical growth rate. As a result, and as we noted in our pre-release, we are taking significant actions with regards to our company's cost structure, with an announced restructuring of our Brazilian operations, as well as a review and adjustment of our total company cost base. We are right-sizing our cost base to better reflect market conditions, protect our margins, and position us for future success. We will provide more details about our restructuring programs at our Investor Day. Our Q3 results are detailed on slides 3, 4 and 5. Q3 revenue was 29% lower than the prior year, both including and excluding FX, driven primarily by lower volumes from channel destocking and, to a lesser extent, dry weather conditions in some countries. We had price increases in North America, EMEA, and Asia, which were more than offset by price decreases in Latin America. While our sales were down significantly versus prior year, we need to be clear that the grower application of crop protection products has been steady, and even trend in higher than the prior year in some key countries such as Brazil and the US. In addition, sales of our newer and more differentiated products, including Branded Diamides and Plant Health, outperformed the overall portfolio. Products launched in the last five years grew 4% and represented 10% of total sales in the quarter, demonstrating robustness in the current environment. New product launches accounted for more than 4% of total company sales in the quarter. Looking at our revenue by region, North America sales were lower than the prior year by 34% as anticipated destocking activity was the main driver of lower volumes. Dry weather in Canada was a smaller volume headwind. Sales in EMEA were relatively flat with a revenue decline of only 1% and 4% excluding FX. We encountered volume pressure from channel destocking as expected particularly in Germany. This was mostly offset by a combination of higher prices, strong diamide sales that outperformed the overall portfolio and a modest FX tailwind. In Latin America sales were down 33%, 36% excluding FX due to lower volumes and to a lesser degree pricing pressure. Destocking particularly in Brazil and Argentina was the driver of the results in the region. At the same time, we had a very successful launch of our patent pending diamide insecticide Premio Star in Brazil. The strength of that launch was one reason branded diamide strongly outperformed the rest of the region's portfolio. Shifting to Asia, sales were down 28% and 23% organically. As expected, from like the other regions, volumes were negatively impacted by destocking behavior, particularly in India, where elevated channel inventory continues to be actively managed. Pricing was up slightly with an FX headwind. Products launched in the last five years showed greater resilience than the rest of the portfolio and grew 16% versus the prior year, driven by sales of Isoflex herbicide. The outperformance of new products in most regions demonstrates how our technology differentiates FMC in the marketplace and why our new product pipeline is a key contributor to our growth at consistently superior margins. We reported EBITDA of $175 million in the quarter, down 33% compared to the prior year period, due to the volume decline along with a smaller pricing headwind partially offset by lower costs. Sales of new products included launches and sales of differentiated products such as our branded diamide and biologicals positively impacted mix. Costs were $137 million tailwind, with contribution from inputs and to a lesser degree operating costs. Input cost benefits were especially pronounced compared to the prior year period that represented the peak of inflationary headwinds. Combined SG&A and R&D costs were favorable to prior year, and we are on track to deliver our commitment of $60 million to $70 million cost control in the second half, keeping those operating costs in line with the prior year. Shifting to our outlook, slide 6 shows our latest expectations for Q4 and full year. We are expecting revenue in Q4 to be 22% lower than the prior year, driven by a high teens percentage volume decline, as destocking continues. Similar to Q3, we expect a low to mid-single-digit pricing headwind in Q4, driven by Latin America. FX impact is forecasted to be minimal. Adjusted EBITDA in Q4 is expected to be between $246 million and $306 million, which is a 36% year-over-year decline at the midpoint, primarily due to lower volumes. We expect positive mix impact as sales of new products, including launches, continue to show growth. Operating costs are expected to be in line with the prior year as cost controls remain in place. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew, who will cover cash flow and other financial topics. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks, Mark. I'll start this morning with a review of some key income statement items. FX had essentially no impact on revenue in Q3, with headwinds among Asian currencies, particularly the Pakistani Rupee and the Indian Rupee, offset by tailwinds in Latin American and European currencies, particularly the Brazilian Real, the Mexican Peso, and the Euro. EBITDA margin in the quarter was down 120 basis points versus the prior year period. While favorable input costs and positive mix led to a gross margin percent that was over 400 basis points higher than the prior year period, the severity of the volume decline resulted in a decline in EBITDA margin. EBITDA margins in Q4 are expected to be meaningfully below prior year and prior guidance. Gross margin is anticipated to be challenged by pricing pressures in Latin American, Asia due to current market conditions. Despite continued operating cost discipline, the expected decline in volume is anticipated to further pressure EBITDA margin, as SG&A and R&D expenses are supported by a lower revenue base. Interest expense for Q3 was $65 million, up $23 million from the prior year period. The significant increase in US interest rates year-over-year with the main driver. Higher overall debt levels also contributed to increased interest expense as working capital remains elevated. Relative to guidance, elevated interest expense was entirely attributable to higher debt balances. We now expect full-year interest expense to be in the range of $240 million to $245 million, with the increased versus prior guidance due to elevated working capital levels resulting in higher debt balances. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for Q3 was 15%, in line with the midpoint of our full-year expectation for a tax rate of 14% to 16%. Moving next to balance sheet and liquidity. As of September 30th, gross debt-to-EBITDA was 3.6x, while net debt-to-EBITDA was 3.3x, reflecting the sudden deceleration of our earnings beginning in Q2 and elevated debt levels due to higher working capital resulting from this deceleration. The covenant of our revolving credit facility evaluated our leverage using a metric that includes adjustments to both EBITDA and debt as reported. With these adjustments, covenant leverage was 3.8x as of September 30th, relative to a maximum allowable of 4.0x. We do not view this as an acceptable leverage level relative to our covenant. In light of this and the reduced outlook for Q4, we are currently in advanced discussions with our bank group to further amend our covenant to provide additional headroom for the company as we adjust our cost structure and debt levels to current market realities. Our bank group continues to be highly supportive of the company and recognizes the transitory nature of the current industrywide channel inventory correction. We expect to complete this amendment in the next 7 to 10 days and will provide further updates at time. Moving on to cash flow generation and deployment on slide 7. FMC generated free cash flow of $32 million in Q3, down from $360 million in the prior year period. Cash from operations declined $316 million with lower EBITDA and substantially lower payables as we adjust our operations to match current demand. Capital additions and other investing activities were slightly lower than the prior year period while legacy spending increased $14 million due to timing of expenses. Year-to-date cash flow through September 30th was negative $790 million, $651 million lower than the prior year period. Nearly all of the reduction stems from lower cash from operations, which was down substantially due to lower EBITDA and lower payables. We returned $73 million to shareholders in the quarter via dividends. There were no share repurchases in Q3. We expect full-year weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be $125.7 million. We've reduced our free cash flow guidance for 2023 to negative $750 million at the midpoint. Down from breakeven in our previous guidance. The reduction in full-year cash flow outlook is a direct result of lower than expected second half EBITDA and the impact of reduced volume on working capital. Compared to prior year, the decline in free cash flow is almost entirely due to lower EBITDA and payables. With lower use of cash for inventory, largely offsetting other items including higher cash interest, cash taxes and capital investment. Adjusted cash from operations is now expected to be between negative $635 million and negative $435 million, down substantially from prior guidance. Capital additions are expected to be between $135 million and $145 million including spending to support new product introductions, which is our most recent results illustrate, drive high value for our business even in challenging industry conditions. Legacy and transformation cash spending of $70 million to $80 million is expected to remain essentially flat to midpoint after adjusting for the benefit from the disposal of an inactive site in 2022. This guidance implies a rolling three year average free cash flow conversion of 21%, substantially below our targeted 70 plus percent. This is due entirely to the cash flow and books impacts from the inventory reset in 2023. I'll reiterate Mark\u2019s earlier point that end market demand for our products is solid. The quality of our receivables is solid with good performance on collections in key countries including Brazil. Once this industrywide channel inventory reset is finished and more normal order patterns resume, we expect a significant rebound in cash flow as EBITDA improves, inventory is converted to receivables which are subsequently collected and critically as we rebuild payables ramping back up production. Our near term cash deployment priorities have not changed with the dividend and debt reduction including the redemption in Q4 of the $400 million in notes due in 2024, still the top priorities. Share of purchases will remain suspended until leverage returns sustainably to targeted level. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thanks, Andrew. I mentioned earlier that our more differentiated products were showing resilience in the current market environment. This includes the Diamides, a very successful product franchise, which has received renewed attention over the last couple of months. Today, I'll give you an update on the progress of our Diamides growth strategy. This will be supplemented by our forward-looking view of the robust growth plans we have for the Diamides at our Investor Day. We have owned the Diamides for the past six years. Over this timeframe, we have delivered on every target we've set, including growing the size of the business, expanding our partner base, accelerating registrations, expanding our geographic footprint, and finally, introducing brand new patented formulations that allow us to explore and expand the new market segments. All of these results should provide confidence that we can continue to profitably grow the franchise into the future. Turning to slide 9 for some basic data on the insecticides market, which was valued at over $20 billion in 2022. Insecticides have grown at roughly 5% per year over the current time frame. FMC's Diamides, Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr, make up more than 80% of the entire Diamides class, which includes a few other smaller active ingredients. FMC's Diamides have grown at about 12% of the total insecticide market. And as you can see, Diamides outperformed every other leading chemistry class in the insecticide market by growing at 11% compound annual growth rate and gained 5% market share as a result. High value technologies such as the Diamides continue to take share from older insecticides, some of them being phased out by regulators. Turning to slide 10, we showed a breakdown of our $2.1 billion of Diamides sales in 2022. Cyazypyr has grown more rapidly than Rynaxypyr since our acquisition of the assets and made up more than 20% of total sales. This year, we estimate that this trend will continue, with Cyazypyr making up roughly 22% of total Diamides sales. Partner sales are a key element of our lifecycle management strategy. FMC sells either technical active ingredient or formulated products to our partners under these arrangements. We have long-term supply agreements with five key global companies and over 60 local agreements in various countries with the potential to add more partners in the future. Many of these agreements go through the end of the decade. The partnership model has helped to expand the market for our Diamides since our partners have access to customers, crops and segments that we do not currently serve. Moreover, partner sales are not margin dilutive and these sales made up roughly one-third of our Diamides revenue in 2022. While the remaining two-thirds came from our own commercial activities, which we refer to as branded sales. In 2023, we've seen our partners actively manage their inventories, resulting in lower sales. Branded sales have continued to outperform the overall company. We've also shown the geographic breakdown of our branded sales as of 2022. Asia made up more than 40% of our branded sales, followed by Latin America at 28%, EMEA at 17%, and North America at 12%. This year, we expect branded sales to outperform total sales in Latin America, driven by new products' introductions. Branded Diamides in the other regions are expected to perform in line with, or better than, respective regional sales. On the right to the crop breakdown of our overall Diamides revenue, which includes branded and partner sales. The diversity of crops reflects the broad market potential, as well as market access required to sell these products. This is an important fact to note, as we have numerous products selling in more than 90 countries across dozens of crops. Our Diamides are not a single monolithic product, and as such are defendable through various mechanisms, including, most importantly, newly patented formulations, branding, value selling, agronomic support, and grower education. Our precision ag offering, Arc farm intelligence, now helps support and defend over $700 million of revenue from our branded Diamides, a unique and powerful tool in our Diamides growth strategy. Turning to Slide 11, you can see that managing the Diamides life cycle has multiple strategic components. We will provide more color on these pillars at Investor Day in November, but I wanted to start framing the innovation and IP pillars today. Turning to slide 12, FMC has continued to significantly grow the Diamides to innovation, since acquiring them in late 2017. At acquisition, sales were already segmented across dozens of formulations and brands, spread across more than 80 countries. Since acquisition, FMC has increased the segmentation by developing new partner sales, launching new patented formulations and brands, obtaining new registrations and expanding existing labels which have resulted in a diverse portfolio. This diversity minimized reliance on any single formulation and instead relies on innovation to drive future growth. We have already started to see the benefits of recent innovation in Diamides. This is evident from the increase in total sales of Branded Diamides from \u201821 to \u201822, even though some of the core Rynaxypyr products decline modestly in the same time frame. Coragen MaX insecticide powered by Rynaxypyr is one example of innovation that did not exist when we acquired the Diamides. Coragen MaX is a patent pending higher concentration formulation of Coragen that provides targeted insect control in canola, pulses and cereals. Premio Star is another example of new technology that was developed primarily for applications on Brazilian soy, corn and citrus crops and receive priority approval from Brazilian authorities. The patent-pending combination of Rynaxypyr and bifenthrin provides a differentiated formulation with extremely high performance for chewing and sucking insects. Premio Star has a dual mode of action, its broad spectrum, with both immediate and extended control. FMC has developed and launched four new patented or patent-pending formulations across 10 countries in the past few years. These new technologies are expected to make up 17% of branded Diamides sales in 2023. Contributions from new products will further accelerate over the next few years, removing FMC's portfolio away from older and less differentiated products. Slides 13 and 14 show an updated view of our patent and regulatory timelines. FMC has a patented state of over 1,000 granted and pending patents filed in over 75 countries for the Diamides. While we have not changed our overall outlook, we have included additional commentary to reflect developments since we last shared these timelines. One addition from our last version of this slide is the inclusion of patented mixtures and patent-pending formulations that can extend patent coverage once granted to 2040 and beyond in some cases. Patents are regulated by different government entities than the ones that issue crop protection registrations. Approvals of registrations does not have any bearing on patent validity. Generally speaking, legal actions must be initiated by the patent holder and can only start after registration is received and a generic product enters into commercialization. Moreover, patent judgments in one country do not change FMC's patent rights in other countries. Nor do these judgments give companies the freedom to operate in other countries with valid patents in place. FMC will continue to enforce our patents and we view any infringing parties as a seller of illegal product. In addition to our legal strategy, we also have a regulatory advocacy strategy that includes the enforcement of our data protection rights and notifying regulators about companies that do not have permission to produce or have unknown or different impurities in their products, or otherwise do not comply with applicable regulatory law. This has been and continues to be a successful strategy. Numerous regulatory authorities have declined to approve registrations from such companies. In other instances, companies have voluntarily cancelled or withdrawn applications as a result of our efforts. Hopefully this overview has provided a more comprehensive understanding of the current state of FMC's Diamides. At or Investor Day, we will provide a view of the next phase of growth for this franchise, driven by innovation and other strategic levers. Finally, let me wrap up by saying that 2023 has clearly not turned out how we or the broader industry thought it would. However, we firmly believe the current channel destocking will run its course, and I believe we have taken the right actions to reflect what is happening from a channel demand standpoint. Our new products, Plant Health products, and Branded Diamides all continue to outperform the rest of the portfolio, which shows the benefit of our technology investments. We look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day where we will lay out our new strategic plan and provide an outlook for FMC's growth over both a near and long term. We can now open the line for questions. Operator : Our first question today comes from Joel Jackson of BMO. Joel Jackson : Hey, good morning, everyone. There are a lot of questions in FMC, obviously, the last weeks, last months on the near term outlook and then, of course, the midterm outlook with the diamides and other products. Maybe we could start with next year. I realize it's early, but it's a key question. We had a lot of volatility around the different numbers. When you think about 2024, can you help anchor us on what it might look like? I don't know if you want to use your 7% to 9% EBITDA placeholder target as a starting point and as granular as possible around volumes, costs, price, where do you think earnings growth can shake out next year? What do you have to do to get the inventory out of the system? Do you have to lower prices? Whatever you can do to help us, get an early look on 2024. Be appreciative. Mark Douglas : Yes, thanks, Joel. Listen, you are right, it is a little early to be giving specific details and we will talk more about this at our Investor Day as you can imagine. But let me try and frame \u201824 in the context of where we are today, give you some idea of how we're thinking. We have gone through obviously since sort of mid-year a very significant inventory reset and I'll keep reiterating the point that we see this as destocking inventory reset, whatever you want to call it, it does not reflect on the ground demand. We see strong on the ground demand pretty much everywhere in the world which is the backdrop for how the business really recovers and comes out of this period. The resetting is occurring now, obviously we started in Q2, we entered Q3 and here we are in Q4 and it's still ongoing. I would say next year Q1 is going to be more difficult because the inventory had not reset so Q1, 2023 was a pretty good quarter kind of flattish to 2022. That's not going to be the case. We're going to see that inventory reset continue in Latin America, likely in Europe as well, and maybe even a little bit in the US. We'll see how we go through Q4. I think things will start to change in Q2 as we start to lack the industry reset. And then I expect the industry to move forward in the second half of the year. I know some people will say it's going to be a first half, second half story. It is just because of the way the seasons are moving and the inventory is resetting. From our perspective, I see revenue growth next year for FMC, and I see higher than revenue, EBITDA growth and revenue for next year. Why do I say that? I think the second half of next year is going to be much better. I think the industry will be in a much more balanced shape. As I've said, we're not expecting a snapback. I just don't see with the current economic environment where I see supply and where I see interest rates. I don't see people going and building a significant inventory again. That's not necessarily a bad thing. The industry typically grows at 3 plus percent a year. I expect you're going to see something like that number in the second half of the year. For us, new products continue to be a major driver. One reason why we're very excited about next year is we have more products coming. And right now, when you look at what we call our NPI data, we're having something like $630 million this year of new business from those products launched in the last five years. I expect that number to be higher next year, adding more revenue to the company. So we see the new products paying off as we go over the next few years. From a cost perspective, I'll let Andrew comment a little bit on costs. We do have a couple of elements flowing through the P&L and balance sheet right now. Not only do we have cost savings, but we have unabsorbed variances coming out of our manufacturing plants as we think about the length of time that those manufacturing plants are either shut or idle and until they come back. So you've got to factor that in as we go next year. Having said that, we are putting in place significant restructuring plans. That will benefit EBITDA next year, as well as the product mix benefits EBITDA and gross margin. Andrew, do you want to say anything on the cost side? Andrew Sandifer : Yes, just echo comments you made, Mark, I think, as we look forward to input cost for next year. The cost of what limited buying we're doing right now, but the cost of things that we're buying are in a positive comparison to prior year. We do expect that input cost will be a modest tailwind next year. The challenge is, unfortunately, that carried forward of unabsorbed fixed costs from reduced production and then the latter part of this year and into early next year. So at gross margin, we're not expecting a lot of help either way at the gross margin line from input cost. Being offset again by unabsorbed fixed costs. It really would be the impact of the cost savings programs we're in the process of launching that will impact every line of the P&L from COGS to SG&A and R&D. We'll detail this more, additional detail at our Investor Day in a few weeks, but that will be a big part of driving profit growth next year. Mark Douglas : So Joel, to wrap up for you, expect to see revenue growth, expect to see EBITDA growth above revenue growth next year from FMC. Joel Jackson : Great. That's helpful. And then you reiterated a lot of your plan to defend the Diamides across the decade. As you've started doing some of these moves, can you talk about what's going well, what's not going as well as you've thought in some of these strategies and how you're thinking about changing them? And if you can be as granular as possible, what's working and not working in the different countries like India, Brazil, wherever else it'd be helpful. Mark Douglas : Yes, sure. I mean, first of all, our main strategy, I think it's on slide 12, which shows the sediment chart. You can see on that slide how we're altering the profile of the portfolio of the Diamides. The new products are growing rapidly. The one we mentioned in the script, Premio Star in Brazil, that has already contributed in Q3, tens of millions of dollars of new growth. And we expect to see the same in Q4 and as we go forward in the rest of the season. That's the type of activity that changes the face of the Diamides. First of all, they give you tremendous pattern extension because these are very sophisticated formulations, whether it's the blend of different active ingredients or something like Coragen MaX, which is a very high concentration formulation. It means you can use less; it means you're carrying less water, less packaging. So from a sustainability perspective, it's a great product and it also has superb efficacy. So it's those types of innovations, not only change what we sell, it may move us away from any generic products that will come into the market, either legally or illegally in different countries. It changes the shape and it adds more value to the company. So I think from a product innovation standpoint, that's one aspect that we've been heavily focused on. The second piece is the continued geographic expansion, registration, label expansion. You can see by the chart that we showed where Diamides sits in the whole spectrum of insecticides. There are some very old chemistries out there that are going to be removed over the next 10 years. Our target is those older chemistries. So we need to make sure we have the products in the right registrations and the right geographies on those crops to take away those older chemistries. So for me, it's innovation, it's geographic expansion and the innovation is really driving the next generation of patent support that we have for these products. So we feel very good about where we are. We'll give you more details on November the 16th about that growth profile. But think of it in terms of innovation and geographic expansion. Operator : Our next question today comes from Laurent Favre of BNP Paribas. Laurent Favre : Thank you. Good morning, guys. First question. The business is back roughly to the size of 2019 or 2020. The working capital that I think you're implying for the end of this year is about $1.5 billion higher than it was back then. And I guess my question related to the framework that you've given us Mark, how much of that $1 billion, $1.5 billion you think you can get back not just next year but also maybe in the following years? Should we assume that working capital is significantly higher now structurally compared to what it was or what it has been over the last few years? Mark Douglas : Yes, Laurent. I'll let Andrew give you some details on the working capital side. My view is when we think about restructuring the company, we're not only talking about our cost base but we're absolutely talking about the other metrics that we look at the performance of the company. Working capital be one of them. The different elements of working capital move at different speeds. Obviously, payables are a lot lower than it should be given the fact that we're not manufacturing a lot right now so therefore we're not buying a lot. That will change inventory. We are working our way through inventory right now. Obviously, selling out of inventory reduces inventory and then we'll collect the receivables at the normal rate. I expect the metrics to get back in line through \u201824 and \u201825 in terms of as a percent of revenue, how much working capital do we carry. But Andrew, if you want to give any more details on that. Andrew Sandifer : Yes, certainly, Laurent, I think you're on to the right theme which is we do expect normalization of working capital over the next 12 to 18 months. I do think it's important to remember in the ag input space that working capital cycles different than other chemical or materials businesses. Now we buy on reasonable terms, industrial terms from our suppliers. Then we hold manufacturer product hold an inventory for to meet seasonal demand. Then have inventory ready when needed when pest pressure shows up. Then we sell often on crop terms or longer terms certainly than what we pay for materials we purchase. So it's a bit of a long cash cycle that's becoming elongated particularly as inventory levels have gotten out of line with the go forward sales pace. So I think right now the focus is really on, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, on taking inventory, converting it to sales, converting it to receivable and collecting it. But there can be a good six to 12 month lag in that process due to the seasonal nature of the business to be able to really clear through that inventory and turn it to a good to receivable and collect it. So certainly a good reference point, looking back a couple of years where trade working capital in 2021 at 9/30 was about $700 million lighter than where we are today. That's not a bad dimension. And certainly we would think that those working capital metrics would come back in line that to more historical norms. It's just going to take 12 to 18 months to really adjust to all of the whiplash we've had in the supply chain with both the rapid growth in 2022 and now the rapid deceleration in 2023. But I think my fundamental message to you is, yes, we fully anticipate a robust working capital release in 2024 and bleeding into 2025. Laurent Favre : Thank you. And the second question, having seen sharp normalization of pricing in LATAM, what makes you think that prices are not going to be sharply down in the northern hemisphere when you start the \u201824 season? Mark Douglas : Yes, I wouldn't describe what we've seen in Latin America is sharp. And also, Laurent, it's not broad pricing. It's more a reflection of how we account for customer inventory and how we're managing price with customer inventory going forward. It shows up in price. Obviously, our customers, some of our customers are holding higher cost inventory. We're working that through as we go through this season. So it's not broad based price pressure. And as we indicated in the other three regions of the world, we actually had price increases over the year, over the period. We will continue to look at price increases next year. People should not forget there is still inflationary pressures moving through many economies and certainly companies like us. We have labor cost increases as many companies do. So we will not be shy from raising prices as we go through the next 12 months cycle. Operator : Our next question today comes from Aleksey Yefremov of KeyBanc. Aleksey Yefremov : Thanks and good morning. Continuing on the working capital theme, could you give us some idea how your working capital would strengthen the next few quarters? I mean, typically you'll have a build-in if you want, but given the current situation, would you expect maybe no build and release of working capital in the first quarter or something else perhaps? Andrew Sandifer : Sure. Hey, I'll take, this as Andrew. Look, I think the traditional working capital build you see in Q1 should be significantly lower. From an inventory perspective, we're already sitting on a substantial inventory, so our traditional end of year, beginning of year inventory builds in advance of the Northern Hemisphere seasons will be much less subdued, if at all. I think from a receivables perspective because we do have significant advance payments in Q4 against sales in Q1. You don't see as much relief on the receivable side in Q1. And then the question mark is going to be how rapidly we start ramping back up production. We significantly reduced production levels, step down in Q3 and further step down in Q4. So our payables are quite depressed. How quickly we rebuild those payables in the first half of next year will have a lot of impact on it. But certainly I would say the biggest factor that should limit the traditional big working capital pump in Q1 is there is no need to build up a significant pool of inventory going into the new year. Aleksey Yefremov : Thanks, Andrew. And sticking with working capital, your inventory is an absolute dollar basis. I mean, they decline sequentially, but given that you've shut down many of your production lines, maybe you would have expected a bigger drop. Could you just talk about that? Am I wrong here? And what's going on with inventory? Would you expect that number to come down more sharply in Q4 and Q1? Mark Douglas : Yes, Alek, let me just make a comment up front and then Andrew can give you some other details. You've got to think carefully about how the inventory is and where it is. We have a lot of work in progress. From the moment we place an order with either outdoor manufacturers or our own facilities, it can take six months for those products to hit the warehouses to sell to customers. So once you start slowing that engine down, it takes a while for that to actually stop dead. We're out of that period now. So we do expect that inventories in Q4 will come down considerably. But Andrew, do you want to make any comments? Andrew Sandifer : Yes, I think just building on that in Q3, look, sales were $250 million lower than what we'd expected in the quarter. And that's directly a big chunk of inventory reduction that we would have expected to achieve in Q3. And I think as Mark has commented, you can't stop a super tanker in one quarter, it does take time to slow things down. You should expect to see a more substantial drop in inventory from 9/30/23 to 12/31/23. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. Andrew, it sounds like you've had at least some preliminary discussions with the banks regarding your covenants. Can you walk us through the path of deleveraging that you would foresee over the next several quarters and maybe talk through some of the more salient covenants and costs to amend those? Will be the first part of the question. And then, longer term, I think you've been running the balance sheet with a goal of about 2.5x leverage. Are you tempted to reduce that goal on a structural basis given the volatility that we've seen in the market. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks, Kevin. Look, I think the covenant discussions are well underway, going very positively. We'd expect to have something more concrete to disclose next week. So, some more to come there. Our most recent covenant amendment we did with 100% support of the bank group and at no cost. This covenant amendment may cost us a little bit, but it won't be a material expense. So I\u2019ll reserve comment until we have completed the discussions, but discussions are well advanced. We have gotten very positive feedback from the bank group. And just to reiterate, they see the need for us to adjust and go through this period of resetting our size of our business with this industrywide channel reset really is a transitory business condition. So the banks have been very supportive of the company. We will, again, adjust the covenant to give ourselves room as we're both reducing debt and allowing the trailing 12-month EBITDA to recover. So as Mark pointed to, certainly Q4, the guidance we have today is challenging, Q1 not likely to improve, and in Q2 we would expect to see an inflection point and start to see trailing 12-month EBITDA begin to recover. That will help with leverage. And then certainly any of the cash that we generate beyond paying the dividend at its current level, all of that cash flow will go to reducing debt. And including, I want to be very clear because there have been some questions about this. We have $400 million in senior notes that are due in February of 2024. We will be redeeming those notes this quarter. So, we'll have no near-term maturities to address. And that's a part of the whole conversation with the bank group on the covenant. So, we'll have some further information for you in the next week on the covenant. In terms of longer-term financial policy, I'm going to reserve comment there to our Investor Day. I will state that 2.5 target leverage on average has been our long-standing policy. We've run north of that on average for the past several years. So that's something that we've had some very active discussions Mark and myself along with the board. So we'll bring some further comments in that in two weeks in the Investor Day. Kevin McCarthy : That's helpful. And then secondly, Mark, to follow up on your prior comments regarding pricing and also the sales outlook for 2024. Would you expect price to trend flat up or down next year versus 2023? Mark Douglas : A little early to tell, Kevin. We really not thinking through the volume price mix just yet. Generally speaking, price tends to be sticky for FMC over the years. We've seen that. We do tend to raise prices every year, even if it's only 1% to cover some form of inflation in different parts of the world. So a little early to say I'll give you more details on November the 16th when we talk about 2024. But volume, sorry Kevin just to finish that conversation, I would say just our new product introductions come through on volume for us not price. So that growth in new products would show up in volume expansion. Operator : Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. Just two questions about framing. One is if you think about the loss sales this year, can you give us rough split between how much you think is order timing moved into the first half of next year? How much is permanently lost and how much you think you would recover by I don't know \u201925 -\u201826? Mark Douglas : It's, Laurence, there is no push of sales into next year. This is all real inventory that's been held in distribution retail and it's been removed. It does not get pushed so I would say it's zero going into next year. It truly is a reset of bringing those inventories around the world down and then growing from that new point onwards. Laurence Alexander : Okay. And secondly on Diamides just for context, can you give a sense for how many reformulations you're introducing? I don't know either annually or over the next three, five years and how that compares with the cadence across the rest of your portfolio. And then also just for context, there have been other large chemistry classes that have gone off patent. What has been the typical growth trajectory for those over 5, 10 years after they went off patent? Mark Douglas : Yes, I'm going to give you those details on November the 16th because we have a section on Diamides and the overall growth of the portfolio so we'll put it all in context for you. Suffice to say that the number of formulations accelerates as we go over the next 5 to 10 years and those products are already in our pipeline that we'll talk about. Well documented in terms of what happens to molecules when they go off patent. Generally the market expands, pricing alleviates but volume goes up and the net-net is you have an expansion of the market itself plus an expansion in overall dollars of profitability. I don't think the Diamides will be any different. The difference may be the fact that they are so fragmented and different types of patents in different parts of the world. You may see that coming off in different regions and we kind of showed that in the slides that we put forward. We have our own examples, Sulfentrazone, Clomazone that have been off patent for many years. They continue to grow, they remain profitable. We don't see any difference for those Diamides, but we'll put all that in context for you on the 16th. Laurence Alexander : So your bias is they're in line or better than average as opposed to worse than average? Mark Douglas : You mean in terms of growth? Laurence Alexander : Yes, in terms of what happens, in terms of that sort of typical trajectory. For historical example, do you think they're kind of at least in line with the average? Mark Douglas : Yes, I would say the Diamides will be higher than the average just because of the attributes that they have. Operator : Our next question today comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners. Mike Harrison : Hi, good morning. Just speaking with the Diamides discussion, you guys have worked pretty hard to enable potential competitors to work with you on licensing and other commercial arrangements. You gave some details in the slides there, but how should we think about potential competitors? You mentioned there were five large ones and more than 60 smaller ones who have taken that avenue and are working with you and they're now customers versus potential competitors out there who are looking to go with a load and create generic versions of your Diamides without working with you. And I guess how do you see that kind of evolving over the next several years? Mark Douglas : Yes, I mean, this is -- that will obviously happen as patents roll off and jurisdictions change, generic products will come. I mean, that's normal in this industry, we see it every molecule that has ever existed. What we're doing about that, changing the formulations, bringing new technologies into the Diamides as we just talked about, expanding that geographic base, those are the things that we're doing. The branding of our products, we have extremely strong branding around the world. The brands that we sell are some of the best known brands in the pesticide industry. That is a very powerful tool in places like India, in places like Brazil. Brand matters, quality, assurance of performance. So all you bring all those things together, and we'll talk about that on the 16th, those are the types of activities that allow you to continue to grow your market share in an expanding market. Mike Harrison : All right, thank you. And then in terms of the, where you see channel inventories today, and your visibility on normalizing order patterns. Can you maybe walk us around the world and talk about where you see those channel inventory levels? I guess are the challenges right now, mostly focused on Latin America, or is visibility still pretty limited in other regions as well? Mark Douglas : Yes, it's not great right now, Mike. It's very difficult to walk around the world. You could tell by the types of results that FMC is putting out there, as well as our competitors, that everybody is having the same issues in judging where the market is. I think the focus is on Latin America, because Latin America is now at the beginning of its season, where we've had time in the Northern Hemisphere to work through some of this in US, Canada, obviously Europe. So I think Latin America has all the focus now, just because it's late to the game in terms of where its season is. That does not mean to say that there is not channel inventory elsewhere in the world. Hence my comments, I see this working through Q1, possibly into Q2, and then off we go. So I think that first half is where we're really focused on to make sure that we understand, as we come out of that period, exactly where are we and how is volume flowing. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Mark, I wanted to try to square some of your preliminary comments on 2024. I recognize they're at a high level. I understand raw material costs can be down next year. I understand that you're going to have some restructuring cost savings, and that's going to help EBITDA grow year-over-year, where I would appreciate some more color. It's just on the top line. I think you said you expected FMC to have sales growth next year. And I'm just thinking through, like, if 1Q has to lap, what we've seen in 2Q through 4Q \u201823, which is kind of like a mid to high 20s sales decline. And I think you only had volume down about 3%, yes, 3% in 1Q \u201823. In my model, I just sort of assumed that the headwind from lapping things in 1Q \u201823 on the top line was kind of too much to overcome in the balance of the year to get growth. So, particularly if we assume that once the destocking is over, it's just sort of a reset of sales levels and we go back to the industry growing 3% and perhaps you guys doing a bit better than that. So is there something I'm not thinking about right that helps you get to the idea that you can overcome the 1Q and potentially even a little bit of a 2Q top line headwind to get full year sales growth next year? Mark Douglas : Yes, I think there are. I'm not going to go into those details today because I actually, we're preparing for all of that as we go into our Invest Today. You've got to understand that the NPI, the growth of the new product is accelerating, so that gives you a tailwind. You do have a full season of LATAM in the second half of the year, which is also a positive tailwind. You take those big pieces together. We believe we'll have positive growth next year, Vincent. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Well, I look forward to the detail on that in a couple of weeks, and maybe just as a follow-up, just trying to understand the inventory drawdown that we're seeing through the supply chain. Obviously, the numbers are quite incredible. Where would you have guessed a year ago or so that those levels were, and is it really just a function of sort of twin effect of, they overstocked a bit during the supply chain challenges, and then we've gotten the interest rate shock, which has sort of swung the pendulum 100% in the other direction. I'm just trying to understand how the channel was managing to hold, what incentivized them to hold all this inventory this whole time? Mark Douglas : Yes, I think, listen, I think that your LATAM premise is absolutely right. In 2021 and 2022, clearly there was a lot of uncertainty around supply. There was a lot of price increases. I think the thing that caught the industry out is that growers around the world were holding inventory, and I don't think that was factored into people's calculations. That has obviously been much more than anybody thought, and that's one of the big catalysts that we saw starting to unwind in Q2. And here we are today. So I think it's not only, don't just focus on distribution and retail, the grower component here was much bigger than I think anybody thought. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC. Arun Viswanathan : Great, thanks for taking my question and good morning. So I guess you've addressed a lot of the issues around the Diamides franchise, but just so we're completely clear, two questions around this. So it sounded like the EBITDA contributions of the Diamides is relatively high, north of 40% of company EBITDA, or maybe around $500 million to $600 million annually. Are you saying that you don't necessarily see risk to that? Generally speaking, you would maintain that level of contribution, EBITDA contribution from that franchise. And if you do see any deterioration that the new product growth and maybe some of the other stools you've added, such as biologicals would fill that gap so there really isn't really any risk to losing large chunks of profitability within the company? Mark Douglas : Yes, absolutely. We don't see that at all. November the 16th, I'm going to paint the picture for you as how we grow over the next 36 months and what we look like 10 years out. You'll see that there are a number of components that aid that growth. We are absolutely committed to continue to grow the value of the diamonds in terms of its contribution to the company. Now you will see there are other parts that we're introducing that are growing much faster than the Diamides. So don't think of FMC as being a Diamides story. Yes, the Diamides are incredibly important to us. It's a fantastic franchise. Anybody would give their right arm to have this franchise. What we're telling you is we have other things that are actually growing faster and will become more important to the company over the next 3 to 10 years. So I think that's the story that people are missing. You're assuming we're going to drop EBITDA in Diamides. That is not the case. EBITDA is going to grow with the Diamides. You also have the additive of all the new products and the new platforms that we're building. That's the total story and I think that's getting missed today. Arun Viswanathan : All right, thanks for that clarification. And then just on the supply chain itself, what are some of the steps that you can take to get better intelligence of inventory levels, whether it be at the distributor level or even as maybe has happened in the last year at the farmer level? Is there further intelligence you can get through your grower network or distributor network? And do you feel like there's accurate communication about those inventory levels? So what's so different around this time that the magnitude of destocking is just so much more pronounced? Thanks. Mark Douglas : Yes, listen, it's a very, very fragmented structure in this industry. It is very difficult at the grower level to understand what people are holding when you have millions of farmers around the world. We obviously talk to our big distributors and partners around the world and they were caught out by this. So I think the industry has a lot to learn in terms of how much inventory is set out there. We are going to be doing some things internally ourselves. I don't want to say what they are, to try and aid our demand forecast accuracy and understanding what inventory is out there. But I think we have to recognize it's never going to be 100% accurate. It is just too fragmented. But there are things that we've learned over the last 12 months that we can apply to our thinking, especially as we're planning our supply chain activities. So yes, there are learnings, some of them I want to keep for ourselves. But generally speaking, I think the industry does have to do a better job of. communicating where inventory sits at any point of that value chain. Operator : Our final question today comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. It's a lot of ground cover today. I know that there's going to be a lot more detail on some of these topics at the Investor Day. But let's hope and maybe just step back and I understand there's a lot of channel intelligence. Refresh, it's going to happen on your end as well. As you're thinking about 2024, do you think it's 2020, 2021 kind of shipments that are a more appropriate baseline for future growth or kind of cumulatively where do you think the inventory build both in your distribution channel and at your -- at the farm customers actually built up so that we can think about a proper base off which to grow longer term. Mark Douglas : Yes. I think for us, as we just talked about, I think we reset as we go through Q4, Q1, much more balancing Q2. That's where you grow from, industry typically grows at 3%-ish can be zero can be a little more. Think of that as sort of the second half move. You're getting more normal growth patterns. You also have to remember that inventory doesn't sit still at any one point of this value chain. It can move from grow a back to retail and retail back to distribution. So any one point in time, inventory looks different. That's another complicating factor. Having said all of that, we expect this to reset as we go through the first half of next year predominantly Q1. Second half of the year will be much, should be much more normal in terms of growth and inventory management. That's how we see it. Zack Zaki : Yes. All right. I'm sorry we don't have time for a follow up. I do appreciate the questions. Thank you. That's all the time we have for the call. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Zach and good morning, everyone. Details on our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results can be found on Slides 3 through 6. Market conditions and buyer behavior were pretty much as we had expected in the fourth quarter. with North America, EMEA and Asia performing to our plan. The one exception was Latin America. In addition to the ongoing channel correction, our results were negatively impacted by drought conditions in Brazil. This was somewhat offset by stronger sales of our more differentiated products which are showing continued resilience despite market conditions. Branded diamide sales in the quarter were up 5% and with sales essentially flat or higher in all regions. While products launched in the last 5 years outperformed the overall portfolio and comprised 14% of our total revenue. The channel inventory correction is running its course at varying rates through the regions and we're expecting this to continue through the first half of 2024. However, the underlying fundamentals of our business in this industry remains solid. Based on input from third-party data and our own commercial teams, crop protection products continue to be applied at steady rates. Looking at fourth quarter sales on a regional level, North America revenue was down 37% versus prior year from lower volume as expected after a record Q4 in 2022. In Latin America, sales were down 38%, 41% excluding FX, due to lower volumes and low double-digit pricing decline. Branded diamides were essentially flat to the prior year, aided by the successful launch of Premier Star in Brazil. In addition, we had solid growth in Mexico supported by higher sales of new products. Fourth quarter sales in Asia were flat to prior year period as both in fungicides and biologicals effectively offset inventory destocking, particularly in India, where channel inventory remains elevated. Branded diamides [ph] sales in the region were in line with the prior year period. Revenue in EMEA was down 24% or 22% lower excluding FX, due to lower volume, mostly in herbicides. Price was a low to mid-single-digit benefit as the region continued to effectively implement price initiatives. Branded diamide sales experienced strong growth of more than 20%, driven by the launches of Verimark in Spain and Presto Core [ph] in Turkey. Shifting to EBITDA; fourth quarter results were 41% lower than the prior year period due primarily to lower sales. Costs were a strong tailwind with contributions from lower input costs and diligent spending controlled in SG&A and R&D. Our full year 2023 results are listed on Slide 6. EBITDA margin of nearly 22% was lower by approximately 240 basis points but remains at industry-leading levels. This was accomplished through effective spend management and by holding or raising price in many geographies, especially in EMEA which benefited from a price increase of low double digits for the year. We had substantial cost favorability for the year that was more than offset by the decline in sales volume. Operating cost actions we took in the second half of 2023 in response to lower demand, delivered spend reductions well in excess of our $60 million to $70 million target. Diamide sales for the full year were $1.8 billion, a decline of about 15%. However, sales of our branded diamides outperformed and were only down 7%. Across our portfolio, the new and more innovative products showed much greater resilience even in a weak demand environment. NPI sales were down only 2% and made up a little over 13% of our total revenue. a new annual record, up from 10% in 2022. New products that drove this performance include a number of products in Brazil, such as Premier Star insecticide for [indiscernible] and stone herbicides for sugarcane and soy and on fungicide [ph] for soy, based on our new active ingredient, fluindapyr. We also benefited themselves of Coragen Max insecticide for canola [indiscernible] insecticide for fruits and vegetables and overwatch herbicides for cereals. Before we move the discussion to 2024, I would like to highlight some of the actions we have taken to enhance visibility into channel inventory. In Europe, we have put surveys in place in 9 of our most important countries and covering hundreds of distributors and growers to gain insight into their inventory and especially of our products. In Asia, the larger countries, including India, are utilizing proprietary digital platforms to track inventory movement in real time across the channel as it passes from distributor to retailer and then to grower. In Mexico, we're in the final stages of integrating our systems with those of our retailers which will also give us real-time visibility of inventory sellout. We are also piloting the same system and approach in Brazil. In Argentina, we have increased the frequency of data updates to our inventory tracking system. And finally, in the U.S., we are expanding our forecasting process beyond distributors to now include retailers. This expanded data set will then be incorporated into our demand forecasting processes. Moving to 2024 expectations; our full year guidance and commentary being provided on Slide 7 through 10. Having closed 2023 and established a starting point for 2024, we now expect revenue of $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion, an increase of 2.5% at the midpoint. We are anticipating the full year global market to be flat to down low single digits as a softer first half is expected to be followed by the resumption of historical low single-digit percent growth in the second half. The exception to this forecast is India, where we expect the market to be down for the full year, primarily due to channel inventory that the entire industry is carrying as a result of multiple seasons of unfavorable monsoons. Revenue growth for FMC in 2024 centers on volume growth led by NPI which after posting sales of $590 million in 2023, we expect to grow by approximately $200 million in 2024. Almost half of the NPI growth is expected to come from products launched in 2024. Major products driving higher NPI sales include Coragen Evo insecticide in Argentina and the U.S. Premier Star insecticide in Brazil, Overwatch herbicide in Australia as well as on suva [ph] fungicide in Brazil and Argentina. We expect moderate pricing pressure in the year with the largest impact in the first half. FX is also expected to be a minor headwind for the year. EBITDA is expected to be between $900 million and $1.05 billion, flat to 2023 at the midpoint. Growth of new products and benefits from our restructuring are expected to be offset by higher cost of inventory carried forward from the prior year, lower fixed cost absorption and modest pricing pressure. The updated sales range is $150 million lower at the midpoint than our preliminary outlook presented in November. This range now reflects our actual 2023 results. The EBITDA range midpoint is $100 million lower than the preliminary outlook, mainly due to reduced revenue expectation for 2024 and minor additional headwinds to gross margin. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be between $3.23 and $4.41 per share, an increase of 1% at the midpoint from low interest expense and D&A. At our November Investor Day, we acknowledge that, although FMC had responded aggressively to market challenges in the second half of 2023. Broader actions were needed to better align our business operations with the current realities in the marketplace. We are moving quickly on a global restructuring plan that will fundamentally transform our operating model, including how we're organized, where we operate and the way we work. This is a multipronged approach that focuses on shorter-term expenses and longer-term structural costs as we restructure the operating model. These structural changes will position for success as we move beyond 2024 and towards our 2026 goals. Slide 9 provides some additional detail on the actions we're taking. The global restructuring program is currently underway and will largely be completed in Brazil by the end of Q1. We have also made strong progress through a voluntary separation program in the U.S. with preparations for additional workforce reductions company-wide. Combined, approximately 8% of our workforce will be impacted as we begin to consolidate roles and adjust team structures. Reducing indirect spend is another place where we've accelerated our actions on many critical areas, including nonessential spend and implementing a new strategic sourcing strategy. We already announced plans to sell our noncrop Global Specialty Solutions business. We will be preparing for this over the last 2 months and we are now ready to begin marketing. And lastly, we are examining the company's global and regional footprint. Our location strategy is a critical pillar in FMC's overall transformation and we've made good progress in our analysis so far. This includes examining office locations, manufacturing sites and research centers. Although this is a longer-term work stream, there will be milestones that we will announce throughout this year. As a reminder, we expect this restructuring plan to result in $50 million to $75 million of cost savings in 2024. It's important to note that these savings are net of inflationary and other cost headwinds that we're forecasting for the year. We expect $150 million of run rate savings by the end of 2025. We plan to complete this restructuring and deliver lower costs while continuing to prioritize investments in critical growth areas such as our plant health business, further engagement with growers and R&D, including new product innovation. Slide 10 lists some of the factors that would lead to varying EBITDA outcomes in our guidance range. The pace of recovery in the market is still the largest determinant factor. Our base assumption is that by midyear, every region will have had one full growing season to manage inventory to desired levels, aided by steady application rates by growers. Recovery may vary by region but we expect to see overall market growth in the second half of the year. Slide 11 provides our outlook for the first quarter. Expected revenue of $925 million to $1.075 billion is lower than the prior year by 26% at the midpoint which is consistent with the revenue declines of the last 3 quarters. Volume is expected to be the primary driver of lower sales with pricing pressure in Latin America and Asia, a smaller secondary headwind. EBITDA guidance for the quarter is between $135 million and $165 million with the decline versus prior year primarily driven by lower sales as well as higher cost inventory carried forward from 2023. Taking into account the first quarter guidance that is lower than the prior year period, Slide 12 provides a bridge for how we plan to achieve our full year guidance over the remaining quarters. The largest component of EBITDA growth over the second to fourth quarter period is higher sales volume of new products. Not only do these products have a strong track record of delivering sales in difficult market conditions but they also contribute higher margins which will positively impact mix. We expect NPI sales to grow by over $200 million in 2024 with the majority of the growth occurring after Q1. Market recovery in the second half will also contribute to EBITDA growth. as well benefits from our restructuring program which we'll build through the year as initiatives are implemented. As you can see, we have built a plan primarily based upon elements we control and are not reliant on an outsized market recovery. to achieve our guidance. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks, Mark. I'll start this morning with a review of some key income statement items. FX was a 1% tailwind to revenue growth in the fourth quarter with the strengthening of the Brazilian real, Mexican peso and euro, only partially offset by weakening of the Turkish Lira. For full year 2023, FX was a 1% headwind overall, with the most significant headwinds coming from Asian and European currencies, offset in part by a strong Brazilian Real and Mexican Peso. Looking ahead to 2024, we see continued minor FX headwinds on the horizon. For the first quarter of 2024, these have been stemmed primarily from the Turkish l ira and Pakistani rupee, offset in part by a strengthening Euro. Interest expense for the fourth quarter was $56.7 million, up $11.9 million versus the prior year period, driven by both higher interest rates and higher debt balances. Interest expense for full year 2023 was $237.2 million, up $85.4 million versus the prior year. Substantially higher U.S. interest rates were by far the largest driver of higher interest expense for the year. with higher balance as a secondary factor. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect full year interest expense to be in the range of $225 million to $235 million, down slightly to the prior year, driven by both expected interest rate reductions and lower borrowings as we reduce leverage through the year. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for full year 2023 came in slightly better than anticipated at 14.5%. The driven by a somewhat more favorable mix of earnings across principal operating companies than expected. The fourth quarter effective tax rate of 13.3% reflects the true-up to the full year rate relative to the 15% rate accrued through the third quarter. As you may have noted from our earnings release schedules, there were two extraordinary events that impacted our GAAP provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter. First, our Swiss subsidiaries were granted new OECD Pillar 2 compliant tax incentives. As a result, we recorded deferred tax benefit assets of approximately $830 million net of valuation allowances to reflect the estimated future reductions in tax associated with these incentives. These incentives will allow FMC to maintain our advantaged tax structure for at least 10 additional years despite the implementation of Pillar 2. Second, changes in Brazilian tax law allowed us to release a long-standing valuation allowance position in Brazil, generating a tax benefit of approximately $220 million. Along with other items, this resulted in a GAAP income tax benefit of roughly $1.2 billion. For 2024, we estimate that our tax rate should be in the range of 14% to 17% and up 1 percentage point versus the prior year at the midpoint. The increase in midpoint and broader guidance range reflect uncertainty associated with changes in tax loss related to the implementation of Pillar 2 and transitionary impacts related to the new Swiss tax incentives. Moving next to the balance sheet and leverage. Gross debt at year-end was approximately $4 billion, down $158 million from the prior quarter. Gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 4.0x at year-end, while net debt to EBITDA was 3.7x. On a full year average basis, gross debt-to-EBITDA was 3.6x, while net debt to EBITDA was 3.2x. Relative to our covenant which measures leverage with a number of adjustments to both the numerator and denominator, leverage was 4.17x as compared to a covenant of 6.5x. As a reminder, our covered leverage limit was raised temporarily to 6.5x through June 30. It will step down to 6.2x at September 30 and again to 5.0x at December 31. We expect to have ample headroom under these limits as we progress through the year with improving leverage as we shift to positive year-on-year EBITDA comparisons midyear and as we reduce debt through free cash flow generation and through proceeds from the anticipated divestiture of our Global Specialty Solutions business. We expect covenant leverage to be below 3.5x by year-end. We remain committed to returning our leverage to levels consistent with our targeted BBB/BAA2 long-term credit ratings or better. As I discussed at our November Investor Day, our midterm leverage target is now approximately 2x net on a rolling 4-quarter average basis. While we will still be meaningfully above this level at the end of 2024, we are confident that with EBITDA growth and disciplined cash management that we will reach our targeted leverage in 2025. Moving on to free cash flow on Slide 13. Free cash flow was negative $524 million for 2023. Adjusted cash from operations was down $960 million compared to the prior year, driven by significantly lower payables and EBITDA, offset in part by lower cash used by receivables and inventory. Cash interest and taxes were also headwinds to cash from operations. Capital additions and other investing activities of $144 million were up $25 million compared with the prior year. with continued spending on capacity expansion to support new active ingredient introduction. Legacy and transformation spending was essentially flat for the third year in a row after excluding onetime proceeds from the divestiture of an inactive site in 2022. Compared to our November guidance midpoint, free cash flow improved by more than $225 million, with this improvement nearly entirely due to better-than-anticipated net receivables performance. Looking ahead now to free cash flow generation and deployment for 2024 on Slide 14. We are forecasting free cash flow of $400 million to $600 million in 2024. And a swing of more than $1 billion from 2023 performance at the midpoint of this range. Underlying this forecast is our expectation of adjusted cash from operations of $670 million to $850 million, up over $1 billion at the midpoint, with the increase driven by a significant cash release from rebuilding accounts payable and reducing inventory, partially offset by higher accounts receivables due to revenue growth and with modest improvement on other items such as cash interest. Capital additions of $95 million to $105 million are down roughly $45 million at the midpoint as we tightly manage capital investment in light of our current leverage. That said, we continue to fund needed capacity expansion to support new active ingredients over the next several years. Legacy and transformation cash spending is expected to be between $155 million and $165 million, with underlying legacy spending generally in line with prior years and with spending of approximately $75 million for our restructuring program. With this guidance, we anticipate free cash flow conversion of 104% at the midpoint for 2024. In terms of cash deployment, we expect to pay $290 million in dividends at the current rate in 2024. The remainder of free cash flow as well as any proceeds from divestments or disposals will be used to pay down debt. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thanks, Andrew. Our first quarter guidance reflects the trend of volume declines and related impacts to EBITDA that we've seen over the last 3 quarters. The destocking trend is expected to level off and start inflecting after the first quarter. Looking more broadly at 2024, we have a plan that is based largely on elements that we control. First, NPI sales are expected to drive revenue growth this year after already showing resilience in the prior years. We have demonstrated a history of growing this high-margin segment of our portfolio over the past several years. We are not counting solely on market growth in 2024. And second, the restructuring program we initiated last year is well underway and this is another area in which FMC has demonstrated strong execution in the past. We're also taking actions to increase visibility into inventories in the channel as well as grower levels through a combination of system implementations and strengthening our relationship with the grower. This is going to be a transition year for the crop chemicals market and we are taking the actions necessary to position ourselves to achieve our medium and longer-term goals. Despite the updated guidance for 2024, our outlook for 2026 has not changed. While it may take well into 2024 to start to rebound from the global channel inventory reset, the drivers for our industry and business remains strong. and many of the challenges we are facing this year, such as working through high-cost inventory are temporary. With the anticipated return to more normal market conditions in '25 and '26 along with our portfolio and deep pipeline of innovative products, we see strong growth ahead. With that, we can now open the line for questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyCorp. Aleksey Yefremov : Mark, could you discuss your diamides business? You're talking about healthy sales in branded diamides, can you also provide an update on non-branded? What is the situation there? And what is the outlook? Mark Douglas : Yes, sure. I mean, listen, we do that deliberately because there are two very different businesses, obviously. And we've discussed this multiple times in the past. Our branded business continues in a very strong fashion as we talked about in November, we're launching new products on a constant basis and especially the latest one which is Premier Star in Brazil which has done extremely well in its first quarter of launch. Those are the products that are really expanding the diamide franchise. Our partners are doing exactly what we and the rest of the industry are doing which is drawing down their inventories. So they did this in '23 and their current forecast show further declines as they draw their inventories down. At some point, that will come to an end and we'll move forward. But '24 from our view of where our partner revenues are look very similar to what happened in '23 which is basically just drawing down inventories. Aleksey Yefremov : And just a follow-up on that. Do you have visibility into consumption of your partners versions of diamides, is that healthy and also about pricing of those partner sales? Mark Douglas : Yes. Listen, it's impossible for us to talk about what they're doing with their revenue growth targets or where they're growing. We don't have insight into that. All we do is provide them either formulations in some cases or more importantly, actual technical active ingredient. And don't forget, a lot of our partners use these products for seed treatment applications which is a very, very different market from us. So treat it as a separate market. We don't get involved in it. We provide the raw materials; that's how we think of it. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from VRP. Kevin McCarthy : Mark, in your prepared remarks, I think you mentioned that you anticipate a moderate headwind from pricing in 2024. Can you kind of talk through your expectations in terms of where you're more optimistic, less optimistic on pricing by region? And with regard to the first quarter, in particular, do you think that price will be any better or worse than the minus 5% that you posted in the fourth quarter? Mark Douglas : Yes, certainly, Kevin. I mean, first of all, the dynamic this year is going to be pretty much the reverse of last year, where we had very, very strong pricing as we went through the first half of 2023. Obviously, as we go through this year, we're going to start to lap those price increases, so the difference gets a little different. I would say, obviously, we've highlighted EMEA a highlight for us, it was in '23, continues to be that way in 2024. North America is looking good as well in terms of managing price I would say the place where we expect the most headwind is no surprise to anybody will be Latin America and that's mainly in Q1. We expect that to abate as we go through the year, mainly because of that lapping of price as I just talked about. So think of it as Latin America with really Brazil has been the main area there. With regards to Q1, we talked about a pricing headwind. It is a small number in terms of percent. So I would suggest less than the 5% that you just mentioned. We already see that in Brazil. So that's part of what we have forecast for Q1. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. And then secondly, perhaps for Andrew, can you talk about the amount of working capital that you think you can extract in 2024, including inventory. And as you draw down inventory, what impact do you think or do you expect that, that will have on your earnings, if any, I imagine it creates fixed cost absorption challenge. Is that true? And how would your guide be different if you weren't drawing down inventory, if that makes sense? Andrew Sandifer : Yes. Thanks, Kevin. Sure. I think certainly, as we're looking to free cash flow for '24, working capital, particularly accounts payable and to a lesser degree, inventory are really the big drivers of cash release in 2024. And that's in part because of an expectation as we go through the year, then we start rebalancing and production and inventory. We have been intentionally throttling back pretty severely manufacturing over the past two quarters and well into Q1. We would expect to see some ramping back up in manufacturing activity as we go through Q2 through Q4. That will help with bringing up accounts payable. At the same time, we're selling down from the higher levels of inventory we have right now which includes some higher-cost carryover inventory from prior years. So if you look at the big contributors, it's about 2/3 accounts payable, 1/3 inventory that is a benefit from a cash flow perspective. From a P&L perspective, Q1 in particular, is impacted by the carryover of higher cost inventory from last year. As we get further into the year, we have been buying at lower cost. There are lower cost materials and inventory that we'll get to as we work it down. And then as we rebuild production, we expect that to be at or better cost than what we have in inventory right now. So this is a part of that, unfortunately, the pronounced quarterly cadence this quarter as well. As we -- and I think certainly finished the year, we'll have re-established a balance and a more normal balance between inventory and payables and the inventory we will have will be at a more normalized cost base to current market costs. So that absence of that headwind going into 2025 should be a powerful tailwind as we look ahead. Operator : Our next question comes from Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Joel Jackson : I want to asked a little more about the cadence of the year given Q1, given the full year. There was a comment earlier on this call that you expect EBITDA contraction to turn to growth midyear. If we just take -- it would seem like you would need about 30% plus growth in the last three quarters EBITDA growth to get to your $975 midpoint. I assume Q2 is going to be interesting quarter. when do you exactly expect -- what does Q2 look like? Still contraction end of the quarter starting getting growth? Like anything you could help to help us bridge how we go from contraction back to growth would be really helpful. Mark Douglas : Yes. Sure, Joel. Andrew, do you want to take that one? Andrew Sandifer : Sure. Look, I would put it this way. We've long said that we think that this channel inventory correction takes a full year in every market to reach sort of a bottom. We have not gotten to that full year yet. This phenomenon really started in the latter part of Q2 of 2023. Thus, the Q1 revenue drop pretty much in line with the previous three quarters where we've been going through this channel destocking trends. So I think as we think about trajectory for 2024, Q2 is the real transition. We expect a shift to growth in Q2. It may not be significant growth but we do expect to grow as we anniversary the initial drop that started this phenomenon. And as you pointed out, I mean, certainly in that last Q2 through Q4, where our guidance implies about 16% top line growth -- or excuse me, 15% top line growth and about 30%, 32% bottom line growth. That starts in Q2 where you have this inflection and then accelerates in the second half. And as Mark commented on in his prepared comments, it's really driven by new product introduction, right? And I can't emphasize enough when $200 million of year-on-year growth of new product introduction in a year where we're only forecasting $115 million is total revenue growth at the midpoint. It's a significant mix benefit and it's very much tilted in the second half. So I do understand it's a bit of a very back-end loaded profile. But I think there is a clear logic to it. Q1, we're finishing out the first year of this channel inventory correction getting past the anniversarying of it. We have this hangover from high-cost inventory from the prior year. Q2, we see a transition back to positive comparisons and then an acceleration in the second half driven by new product introduction. Joel Jackson : You had a really comprehensive Investor Day about 2 months ago. And you laid out the target of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion EBITDA in 2026. I mean you're obviously maintaining those targets right now. And I don't expect major changes 3 months later. If it's a marathon and you're now laying out there third of the way it's merited now at a slower pace than you would have thought. Can you talk about how you can catch up in '25 and '26 to hit Merin [ph] cassette piece you thought you would? Mark Douglas : Yes. Joel, listen, I mean, I think for us, as I said, '24 is a bit of a transition year. Yes, we did lower the full year of '24 but that's fundamentally on one thing. We finished '23 lower than we expected. It is as simple as that. The numbers just flow from there. We were not going to hold a number that we thought was unrealistic just because we said it in November. We don't think that's the right way to run this business. Now when you look at '25 and '26, particularly '25 Andrew just commented on something that's very important and I mentioned it, we had a lot of headwinds that are temporary right now that are impacting us in 2024. They will go away. First of all, the high-cost inventory. The biggest impact of that is Q1 gets less in Q2. And then as we go into the second half, it dissipates. We also have the benefit of the mix impact from all the new products we're selling. The $200 million of NPI is at above average margins for us. So that changes mix as we go through the year. So you take those pieces and then you take the restructuring plan which is also now underway in building, we intend to have that at $150 million run rate by the end of '25. So you take those pieces they all build as we go through this year, that allows you to make that catch-up period as you go through '25 and '26. And then obviously, the market itself, market has been unbelievably depressed over the last 9 months and going into the first part of this year. That will not stay like that. The market will come back. It will grow at its normal low single-digit growth rates. Once we get into that period, we have a great tailwind going into '25. So I think we catch up. That's why we haven't changed it. We have a view. We know what we're going to be launching; that's an important view for us. So think of it as those elements will make up the '25, '26 period. Andrew Sandifer : Joe, it's Andrew, I'd just add one additional comment there. We set out those goals in November. We highlighted 6% to 9% revenue CAGR and a 9% to 14% EBITDA CAGR of the '26 horizon. With the adjustment with the lower results in 2023 and the slower start in 2024, you're really only talking about increasing that by 1 percentage point. right? As we've shown in the updated slides today, a 7% to 10% top line CAGR and a 10% to 15% bottom line CAGR. So it's not a fundamental shift by any means and the amount of growth we were targeting. And the logic as Mark has outlined here of how we think we can deliver that. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : There was one more piece to all that, I think, was just the fixed cost absorption, right? That's obviously hurting you now. When do you think you'll get your plant rates back up to a level where you'll get that better fixed cost absorption? And do you have a way of quantifying that for us? Mark Douglas : Yes, I'll take it at the high level, Vince and then Andrew, you can make a few comments. We have numerous manufacturing facilities that are built up of individual production lines or synthesis units. Those synthesis units are coming up and down constantly. I would say as we enter Q2, we start to see more of those lines coming back. We already have cases today where we're out of inventory. So we've been pushing inventory down dramatically over the last 6 to 7 months and you can see that in our inventory numbers. That will continue. You always have some dislocation between what sales is selling and what the demand forecast says. So we see that tension now. And that's a change for us. We haven't seen that in the last 6 to 7 months. So we're starting to see the signs of our inventory levels in certain key areas coming down to a point where we know we're going to have to fire up some of those units again. I expect that to happen in the Q2 period. So Andrew, do you want to talk about what impact that has as we go forward? Andrew Sandifer : Yes. I think, Vince, certainly when we think about the cost impact from last year, part of that is the carryover of bond variances of fixed cost absorption. And that really hits most significantly in Q1 and to a lesser degree in Q2. As Mark described, as we start ramping up production more broadly through the first half of the year and definitely into the second half. we'll get past that unabsorbed fixed cost headwind. But it's certainly a contributory factor into why the EBITDA in Q1 is depressed more than the sales drop. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And then if I could just ask on the raw materials. It sounds like your comments for the year that they're going to be flat but that seems to be a function of carrying the higher cost inventory. And I believe Andrew, you referenced that you currently invoicing raw materials below what you're expensing them at. So I don't know how you want to quantify it or give us a sense of it. But if raw material prices where they are today, stayed flat as we move through this year into next year. What type of deflation benefit might be available to you once things are kind of back to fully upending from a production perspective? Andrew Sandifer : Like Benson, I think that trend is clear and real. I don't think we're prepared to quantify that today because, obviously, it's going to depend on how the rest of the year plays out. But you're absolutely correct. What we said and what we're seeing for the materials we are buying, we are buying them at or below cost of what we have in inventory. So it will be a tailwind as we go through the year and will improve as we get through the year. We'll have to see how the rest of the year plays out to see what the actual magnitude of that tailwind is going into '25. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Harrison from Seaport Research Partners. Mike, your line is now open. Michael Harrison : I was hoping that maybe you could give a little bit more color on what you're seeing with new products. Maybe talk a little bit about the commercial traction that you're getting on some of the products that you introduced over the last couple of years? And maybe just remind us what new launches you're expecting in 2024. Mark Douglas : Yes. Sure, Mike. We talk about this a lot because obviously it's a big driver of our growth and also from our profitability standpoint. I think what we've been doing over the last few years is really a mixture of what we call product extensions which you've seen in the diamides area. I mean, we keep talking about Premier star. We need to put that in context I'm not going to give you the exact number because obviously, we have a lot of competitors listening in on the call. But in Q4 alone, we had tens of millions of dollars of brand-new business. So that's extending the diamide franchise in key crops in Brazil like soy. So those are types of products that are really driving the growth. When you look at the roughly $200 million of new growth in 2024. About $100 million of that is products that are launched within the year. Now $100 million in reference it's usually anywhere from $100 million to $150 million on an annual basis. That's what we've been tracking at. So our expectations for the brand new product launches are not out of line with what we've done historically despite how difficult the market place is. So we know we can sell those new technologies. We know growers are always looking for new alternatives to combat pests. It's split pretty much across all the regions, led by Asia and then Latin America and Europe and North America are all pretty much similar. So the good news there is it's in different geographies on different crops. So we're not banking on the growth of the new products by one big hit with one molecule. That's the good news. And that's how we like to play this. The other one is really our new fungicide, fluindapyr. That is gaining traction. We launched in Brazil. We launched in Argentina. We expect that to grow considerably as we grow through this year. This is our first real entree into a market that's called Asia soybean rust in Brazil. It's a $2 billion market, give or take and we have very little revenue there today. So that's another example of us taking a brand-new product, driving it into a geography and market space. Michael Harrison : All right. That's very helpful. And then maybe just a little bit more detail on what you're seeing with channel inventories in India, sounds like that was an issue in the fourth quarter but also expected to kind of remain an issue as we go through 2024. Any more detail you can provide there? Mark Douglas : Yes. Listen, channel inventories are high. We are carrying high channel inventories. We are not the only ones. Other people on earnings calls have highlighted India. You've had at least 3 years of bad monsoons as well as low pest pressure. So there is a lot of inventory that needs to be worked through that. We'll take all of '24 and probably into '25 to work that down, depending on what the weather patterns look like. If you look good, then we may get some acceleration. If not, it's going to take a while. So you're probably going to hear us talk about India pretty much every quarter as we go through this year and certainly into early next year. I doubt we'll be the only ones talking about that either. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Adam, your line is now open. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Maybe just a bit of a clarification just on the assumptions for the full year on price and maybe distinguish a little bit by region because it seems like the pricing competition. It's more severe in Latin America and maybe in India. Just how do we think about the total price cost balance for this year in aggregate. And as we think about that inflection in profitability into '25, kind of how would you frame the risk if pricing doesn't start to probably that price cost balance doesn't start to flip more favorably again? Mark Douglas : Yes, Adam, let me just start by giving you an overview of how we think about that price volume mix around the world. And Andrew, then you can comment on the price cost element. In these environments, one thing we are determined not to do is go and chase volume. And you can see that in our margins. Our margins are roughly 22% as we finish the year. They're at industry level highs. You can't see that for every company out there. And the important thing is that we're managing price very carefully, not chasing volume where there is no volume and also managing the balance sheet. So you have to take all that into consideration about how you think about FMC's strategy on price. We do take price where we can and we've proven that in Europe and other parts of the world. And then there are other parts like Brazil, where it is a price-competitive market. Now remember, when we talk about our price reductions in Brazil, roughly half of that is activities we put in place to help our customers with their high-priced inventory. So all that price is not necessarily a price drop for the list sheets that you see. So please keep that in mind. When you think about FMC, you look at the volume, you look at the price and look at the margin. That's how we're managing the company. And you know what, we think that will serve us well when we come through this period as we get into the second half of the year. And certainly, as we accelerate through 2025, having a base for margins that are based around a solid price and then when volume comes back, our products will grow into that volume space. We believe that's the best strategy to tackle this. Andrew, do you want to comment on the cost price piece for the year? Andrew Sandifer : Sure. I think certainly, on the price dynamics, first quarter low to mid-single-digit price headwind, heavily anchored in Lat-Am, a little bit in Asia. For the remainder of the year, prices are actually pretty flat. We'll be anniversarying some price reduction in Q3 and Q4, as Mark described, much of that is rebated incentives, not necessarily list price changes. So it's the absence of headwinds as well in the second half of the year as we see stabilizing market conditions. So for the full year, you end up with a low single-digit price headwind. Certainly, relative to cost, cost is going to be a strong tailwind this year as we get through the full year in Q1, no but as we get through the full year, input costs will start to turn to a tail as we get past the high cost of inventory. And then certainly, with all the restructuring actions that we're taking, that will help generate a further tailwind this year. So the net price/cost relationship for the year is positive. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Salvator Tiano : This Salvator Tiano filling in for Steve. So firstly, I wanted to touch base again on kind of the Q2 to Q4 assumptions. So as you said before, you're kind of assuming a 15% increase in revenue after Q1 year-on-year. And even if we think about the flattish price you've just mentioned and most of the NPI benefits coming there, it still looks to me that you're assuming probably double-digit volume increase on the legacy business. Is that correct? Are there any components of leasing? And what would drive such a strong growth versus, I guess, your expectations for the market being down a little bit overall, how would you outgrow the market, excluding the NPIs which I took out of the equation? Mark Douglas : Andrew, do you want to take it? Andrew Sandifer : Sure. Look, I think we're -- as sales we've talked about, we're expecting pretty strong growth from new products in the second half. The first half is down across the board. So that growth from Q2 to Q4 is stronger than the full year growth. So there is growth in the core portfolio, absolutely. Probably more like high single digits rather than mid-teens, a little stronger growth from new products in that Q2 to Q4 time horizon. I think we have to be a little bit careful with percentages here. We've had a major market reset in 2023 and as the channel starts to settle out, normalize on inventory, the dollar amounts we're talking about in terms of incremental growth are not egregious by any means when you think about the dollar growth that, that would imply for our core portfolio and a core portfolio that's performed pretty strongly historically. So I think we think that's a pretty reasonable balance. But again, that strong base and that strong driving on the new products is what really helps reinforce the acceleration and the leverage to the bottom line in Q2 through Q4. Salvator Tiano : Okay, perfect. And I wanted also to check on what you mentioned before about the nonbrand diamides. I'm just wondering, so the idea of having partners was to kind of extend the -- you sign agreements and you extend kind of your protection here as you will prevent them from competing with you directly at some point. But you mentioned that -- it's a separate business. You have no visibility into what they do. I'm not really sure why wouldn't you try to from the start have an idea of what is their sell-through or how much they sell in the market? Do you have any plans to start understanding better or request from them more information so you can figure out what kind of the overall diamide consumption in the channel? Mark Douglas : Yes. I mean, listen, it's a very valid question. You've got to remember that they're selling products still into the marketplace from their inventory. We're not replenishing their inventory because they're not buying it. It's exactly what we're doing with our suppliers and what our customers are doing to us. A big piece of that market is seed treatment. Do not underestimate how much volume of the diamides goes into treating seeds around the world. It's a large volume. They also operate in markets that we don't necessarily have access, whether it's on a geographic basis or a crop basis. So once again, this is a $70-plus billion market for pesticides that is highly fragmented. It is not unusual for us not to know where those products are going. However, what we do know is that when they see a utility for diamides, they're using FMC's technology and that's what's important to us. So we think about it in that way. I think the other thing you've got to remember is we're talking about where the forecast currently sit. Forecast can change and frequently do. They did last year. The forecasts that the partners put in place in January is very different to what it looked like in September. We could well see a difference in their September forecast or their August forecast than what it is today. So we'll see. For us, the partners are very valuable. They've worked extremely well since we bought the assets way back in 2017 and they will continue to work well. They are just going through the same phenomena that we are. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Wright from ROTH MKM. Brian Wright : Could you give us a little bit of an update on the plant health outlook and as far as that reflects for 2024? Mark Douglas : Yes, absolutely. Plant health was down in 2023, mainly because of the segments that we're in. We have a big exposure to one particular segment in Brazil that was down. We had growth in other parts of the world. We see plant health coming back to its more normal growth rates in 2024. And those growth rates are high teens, low 20s. And with the biologicals component, somewhat higher than that. So you should expect to see the Plant Health business back to its normal cadence. We're also doing what we said we would do in our Investor Day. We're investing in new business models for this business. And despite all the changes we're making, we have carved out the ability to create a new business model in Brazil for the plant health business. So we're going to be very interested in seeing how a purely dedicated plant health business starts to perform once it gets its breadth of portfolio which is doing today. So I expect it to be very good growth in 2024 for plant health. Operator : Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Laurence Alexander : Just given the controversy around diamides, can you characterize how diamine margins are performing compared to the overall business? And secondly, in the rebound in the back half of the year, do you expect the new products, including diamides to rebound faster or slower than the average business? And then lastly, I can't help it because you mentioned the seed treatment. How large is seed treatment roughly as a percentage of global diamide volume? Is it like 10% to 20%? Mark Douglas : Yes. We don't -- that last bit, we don't break out, Laurence. I don't know what controversy you're talking about, about the diamides. We love the business. Higher margins than normal in general, have been since we bought the business, continue to be so. Margin, profile, very strong. I would expect -- I think it was the middle part of your question that as the diamides continue, we'll see what happens with our India business as we go through all the channel inventory work. That may be a drag. Partners, we've already said, is going to be lower. The rest of the branded will see as we accelerate through the year. The new product introductions will definitely be faster growth than the rest. That's how we see the business. It's a strong franchise has been since we owned it and it continues to be. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital. Arun Viswanathan : Apologies if I missed this but maybe I'll just ask a question on the longer-term outlook. So you did reiterate the rolling 3-year forward view which maybe you can just kind of flesh out how you're thinking about '25 the well. So is it kind of $975 or so for '24 growing to about $1.2 billion of EBITDA in '25 and then that gets you to the $1.4 billion midpoint in '26. And is that '25 growth really that $150 million of run rate savings and then maybe exiting the year in a more normal environment in Brazil. How are you thinking about kind of that longer -- medium- and longer-term outlook at this point? Mark Douglas : Yes. Listen, I'm not going to guide' '25 in February. I can tell you that the growth that we see is related to new product introductions, more normal market growth at the top line. we will then see the benefit of our restructuring program hit the bottom line and the absence of all the headwinds that we're seeing today, those will reverse and will obviously contribute to the growth in EBITDA next year. Andrew, do you want to give any more color? Andrew Sandifer : Yes. Look, I think Mark is right, it's a little early to guide '25 specifically. But in terms of shape of the curve, we've always expected '25 was a big acceleration. You pointed to some of the factors that compound that in terms of the restructuring benefits as well as coming out from higher cost inventory that we have right now in our inventory. But with then still continued very strong growth in 2026. So that's how I described the general shape of the curve at this point, a pretty big step-up in '25 and continued strong growth in '26. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Keches from Barclays. Andrew Keches : Andrew, can you just talk about the seasonality of cash flow, particularly in the early part of the year. Typically, that's a pretty large seasonal draw. So any high-level thoughts on the magnitude of that relative to historical patterns? And then the follow-up would just be, can you clarify, I think you said that the covenant leverage would end this year below 3.5 which stood out to me because covenant leverage is typically above the simple net debt to EBITDA. So does that include already the assumption about a divestiture of GSS? Andrew Sandifer : Let me hit those questions. I think in terms of seasonality of cash flow this year, we expect a very different profile for cash flow seasonally this year. We would normally have a large working capital build in Q1 driven by inventory build as -- you're painfully aware, we have plenty of inventory at the moment. So we would expect a much more limited working capital build in Q1. So a much more limited negative free cash flow in Q1 which is a big part of helping us move forward on deleveraging quickly. I think through the rest of the year, you're going to see a little more acceleration as we go through the year. We are typically free cash flow heavy in the second half in Q4 in particular. But the -- certainly, the historic large outflow in Q1 should not be repeated this year. In terms of your question on covenant leverage, yes, we are assuming the covenant leverage at less than 3.5x. That is assuming that we close a divestiture of the GSS business at some point in the second half. That process is just getting launched. As Mark noted, we finished preparations, we're getting prepared to go to market formally with that property. We had a lot of expression of interest in it. So we'll run through that process and continue to update as we move forward to get under the 3.5x covenant leverage, we do need to have proceeds from the GSS divestiture. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Garchitorena from Wells Fargo. Richard Garchitorena : Great. Just wanted to touch on the new measures that you've implemented to increase visibility into the channel inventories. I was just wondering if you got some early lessons from that, so far, are you seeing any change in how distributors manage their own inventories? And have you had any thoughts in terms of how you manage your own inventories and then your own supply chain going forward? Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks, Richard. Yes, we have seen already some insights into how distribution is thinking of managing its own supply chain. And clearly, distribution is lower its inventory levels. you would expect that to happen. The good news is some of the insights we already have in certain parts of the world like the U.S. which we think is probably the furthest advanced at the grower level and at the retailer level. inventory is probably at or maybe even below normal levels. So it's going to be interesting as we really roll into the U.S. season starting in a month or so time [ph], how that really unfolds. The rest of the pieces have been put in place. I do expect Europe to have a much better view. The survey we've put in place is pretty comprehensive. And we're really entering the European seasons Q1 and Q2 are the big growth areas for Europe. So I'm very interested once we get through to the end of Q2, what does that survey tell us when we get to the end of the season. As I said, it's very comprehensive. It's hundreds of different retailers and more importantly, growers throughout Europe. So we'll get a good view there. Operator : We currently have no further questions. And that concludes today's FMC Corporation conference call. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you.",

Information presented represents our best estimates based on today's understanding. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion and the supporting materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations, free cash flow and organic revenue growth, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that as used in today's discussion, earnings means adjusted earnings and EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Curt. Good morning, everyone. Our Q1 results are detailed on Slides 3, 4 and 5. We delivered a solid first quarter with EBITDA at the higher end of our guidance range and excellent improvement in cash generation. First quarter revenue declined 32% versus the prior year period. Volume declined by 27%, in line with the magnitude we've observed in the prior 3 quarters. The volume reduction was driven by continued channel destocking and is consistent with the change in grower behavior to delay purchases until closer to the timing of application. Market conditions were largely as we anticipated. And if not for some negotiated returns in Argentina, first quarter sales would have been in the lower end of our guidance range. We delivered EBITDA in the high end of our guidance range and earnings per share above the midpoint of guidance. In addition, we reported a very significant improvement in free cash flow versus the prior year period. Our earnings benefited from restructuring actions, and we still expect to deliver the targeted savings net of inflation of $50 million to $75 million this year. Slide 4 provides detail on our sales at a regional level. North America sales declined 48% due to lower volume against a record prior year period. Price was essentially flat. New products introduced in the last 5 years, or NPI, showed greater resilience versus the rest of the region's portfolio with strong growth in fungicides, including Xyway, which is based on flutriafol; and Adastrio, which is based on our newly launched active ingredient, fluindapyr. Turning to Latin America. Sales were down 20%, a decline of 22%, excluding FX. Volume was lower in most countries and included negotiated returns in Argentina, resulting from a change in the distribution relationship. Lat Am reported the least volume decline of our 4 regions. Our differentiated products in the portfolio performed well. Branded diamides grew double digits aided by the recently launched Premio Star insecticide and continued growth of our Cyazypyr brands. New products reported strong growth, including sales of Onsuva fungicide, which is based on fluindapyr. Sales in Asia declined 29%, 28% lower excluding FX. Reduced volume was the primary driver with the most significant downturn in China driven by poor weather. India channel destocking continues, although dry weather limited the applications. Pricing pressure was in the high single digits. NPI sales were essentially flat to prior year and outperformed the rest of the portfolio, including sales in Australia of Overwatch herbicide based on Isoflex. EMEA sales were 20% lower than the prior year period, a decline of 17%, excluding FX, driven primarily by volume, including headwinds from registration removals and rationalization of lower-margin products and poor weather in the U.K. and Northern Europe. We did grow volume in other parts of Europe, most notably France, Poland, Italy and Spain. A moderate FX headwind was partially offset by low single-digit price increases. Adjusted EBITDA declined by 56%, primarily due to volume and to a lesser degree, price. Costs were favorable with significant contributions from our restructuring actions and lower input costs more than offset other COGS headwinds. Slide 6 includes further detail on our restructuring actions. We're making strong progress, and we'll continue to transform our operating model, including how we are organized, where we operate and the way we work. We've moved quickly to rightsize our organization and remain diligent in our cost and reducing indirect spend. These changes have been made without sacrificing strategic investment in areas such as plant health and our R&D pipeline. Restructuring provided significant year-on-year savings in the first quarter. As the year progresses, our prior year comparisons will include cost actions taken in 2023 to limit spending. This resulted in an outsized cost saving versus Q1 in the prior year compared to what we expect will be reflected in Q2 through Q4. We are tracking to deliver cost savings within our $50 million to $75 million range in 2024, net of any inflation impacts to our operating costs. We continue to anticipate $150 million of run rate savings to be realized by the end of 2025. The sale of our Global Specialty Solutions business is progressing well. We're now in the second round of a robust bid process. There has been significant interest from a mix of both strategic buyers and financial sponsors. We expect the sale of this business to be completed towards the end of the year. Slides 7 and 8 cover FMC's Q2 and full year earnings outlook. Our full year outlook remains unchanged. The fundamentals of our business are strong. Grower incomes have come down from peak levels, but remained positive in most countries. Generally speaking, weather has been favorable in many countries, which has led to steady application of product on the ground. Overall, we see a healthy ag industry. Data from third parties as well as input from our commercial teams shows that the inventory reduction actions in the channel are making good progress. On a regional basis, the pace of destocking is varied. We see North America furthest along with inventories at the retail and grower level back to normal, while distributors are still working to reduce their level of inventory. EMEA is in a similar condition, except in countries hit by unfavorable weather. In both these geographies, our customers are now targeting to operate with inventories at lower-than-normal levels. In Latin America, inventories are materially lower and are expected to trend towards more normal levels as we move through the rest of the year. We expect India destocking to persist well into 2025, but parts of Asia, such as ASEAN and Pakistan, have made strong progress in destocking in Q1. While these activities continue to run their costs, we're encouraged by the first signs that customers are starting to return to historical order patterns. In North America, we continue to receive orders for products that will be used early in the current season, which indicates that the inventories of such products have now been depleted. In Brazil, customers are now discussing next season's volumes providing visibility that we did not have last year. Our full year outlook assumes that the market improves as the year progresses, but the customers will seek to hold lower levels of inventory. We are forecasting our second quarter results to be similar to the prior year. Sales are expected to be between $1 billion and $1.15 billion, which represents a year-on-year growth of 6% at the midpoint, driven by higher volume. This is the first quarter during which we expect to report an improvement in year-over-year volume since the start of global destocking. Price is anticipated to be a headwind in the low to mid-single digits and the FX outlook is neutral. Our outlook assumes customers continue to reduce and maintain inventory levels in many countries with a significant amount of the volume growth we're forecasting in the quarter coming from new products. These include Coragen eVo insecticide in Argentina and the U.S., Premio Star insecticide in Brazil, Adastrio fungicide in the U.S. and JORDI  fungicide in Germany. EBITDA in the second quarter is expected to be between $170 million and $210 million, up 1% versus the prior year at the midpoint. At the EBITDA midpoint, we expect that volume growth and restructuring benefits will be offset by lower price and COGS headwinds. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be between $0.43 and $0.72, an increase of 15% at the midpoint, due mainly to lower interest expense and D&A. Slide 8 provides our full year financial outlook, which is unchanged from our last update. Sales are expected to be between $4.5 billion and $4.7 billion, an increase of 2.5% at the midpoint. Volume growth is forecasted to benefit from improving market conditions in the second half with a substantial amount of the growth expected to come from new products. We anticipate strong growth in new products between Q2 and Q4 with the major contributions coming from Coragen eVo insecticide in Argentina and the U.S.,  Premio Star insecticide in Brazil, Isoflex active herbicide in Australia and Argentina and on Onsuva fungicide in Brazil and Argentina. We're also excited to launch new diamide formulations in Australia, Indonesia and other countries throughout Asia. We expect moderate pricing pressure for the full year with the largest impact in the first half. FX is expected to be a minor headwind. Our EBITDA outlook remains between $900 million and $1.05 billion, which is essentially flat to 2023 at the midpoint. Volume growth and restructuring benefits are forecasted to be offset by lower price and COGS headwinds. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $3.23 to $4.41 per share, an increase of 1% at the midpoint from lower interest expense and D&A. Slide 9 illustrates the implied growth in sales and EBITDA in the second half to deliver the midpoint of our full year guidance. Revenue growth of 23% and EBITDA growth of 46% may appear outsized on a percentage basis, but considering the low 2023 comparison, we believe the required growth on an absolute dollar basis is achievable. The implied second half revenue and EBITDA are both in a range that we've delivered in the second half of 2020 and 2021. We expect improving market conditions as we progress throughout the year and transition to more normal conditions in 2025. Slide 10 outlines the various factors that will impact our results within the EBITDA guidance range. The magnitude and timing of improving market conditions remains the biggest variable. Our expectation is that recovery will vary by region. But broadly speaking, we anticipate meaningful improvement in market conditions in the second half. We expect new products will continue to show greater resilience in sales, which is a trend they've demonstrated for several quarters. We also anticipate the raw material costs stay flat for the year, and that pricing will be a modest headwind, mainly in the first half as we shift to more favorable comps in the second half. As for what we directly control, we're confident not only in our ability to successfully launch new products but also in delivering the $50 million to $75 million of restructuring benefits in 2024. With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew to cover details on cash flow and other items. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks, Mark. I'll start this morning with a review of some key income statement items. FX was a minor, less than 1% headwind to revenue growth in the first quarter, with the most significant headwind coming from the Turkish lira offset in part by a stronger Brazilian real, Mexican peso and euro. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we see continued minor FX headwinds, primarily from the Indian rupee and Turkish lira, offset in part by strength in the Mexican peso. Interest expense for the first quarter was $61.7 million, up $10.3 million versus the prior year period, driven by higher commercial paper borrowings and, to a lesser degree, by higher interest rates. We continue to expect full year interest expense to be in the range of $225 million to $235 million, down slightly to the prior year, driven by lower debt balances as we reduced borrowings through the year, offset in part by a change in the mix of short- and long-term debt as compared to 2023. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the first quarter was 15.5%, in line with the midpoint of our full year expectation for tax rate of 14% to 17%. As a reminder, we are forecasting a 1 point increase in tax rate at the midpoint versus 2023 and providing a broader guidance range to reflect uncertainty related to tax law changes associated with Pillar 2 and as well as transitionary impacts related to our recently awarded Swiss tax incentives. Moving next to the balance sheet and leverage. Gross debt at March 31 was approximately $4.3 billion, up $378 million from the prior quarter. Cash on hand increased over $100 million to $418 million, resulting in net debt of approximately $3.9 billion. Gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 5.6x at quarter end, while net debt to EBITDA was 5.0x. Relative to our covenant, which measures leverage with a number of adjustments to both the numerator and denominator, leverage was 5.7x as compared to a covenant of 6.5x. As a reminder, our covenant leverage limit was raised temporarily to 6.5x through June 30 of this year. It will step down to 6.0x at September 30, 2024, and then again to 5.0x at December 31, 2024. We believe we have ample headroom under these limits as we progress through the year. Leverage is improving as we shift to positive year-over-year EBITDA comparisons in the second half and as we reduce debt through strong free cash flow generation and through proceeds from the anticipated divestiture of our Global Specialty Solutions business. We expect covenant leverage to be approximately 3.5x by year-end. We remain committed to returning our leverage to levels consistent with our targeted BBB or BAA to long-term credit ratings or better. As I discussed at our November 2023 Investor Day, we've shifted our midterm net leverage target to approximately 2x on a rolling 4-quarter average basis. While we will still be meaningfully above this level at the end of 2024, we are confident that with EBITDA growth and disciplined cash management, we should be approach targeted leverage by the end of 2025. Moving on to free cash flow on Slide 11. Free cash flow in the first quarter improved over $725 million versus the prior year period. This is a critical first step towards substantially improving cash flow in 2024, which is an essential part of our deleveraging plan. Adjusted cash from operations improved by $748 million compared to the prior year period driven by working capital release from lower inventory as well as lower accounts receivable. Capital additions were lower as we continue to constrain investment to only the most critical high-return projects. Legacy and transformation cash spending was up due to costs related to our restructuring program. We continue to expect free cash flow of $400 million to $600 million for full year 2024, a swing of more than $1 billion from [ 2023 ] performance at the midpoint of the range. This increase is expected to be driven by a significant cash release from rebuilding accounts payable and reducing inventory, partially offset by higher accounts receivable due to the revenue growth in the second half of the year, and with modest improvement on other items such as cash interest. With this guidance, we continue to anticipate free cash flow conversion of 104% at the midpoint for 2024. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Mark. Mark Douglas : Thank you, Andrew. We started 2024 as we planned, serving customers with innovative technologies, improving our cost structure to deliver on our restructuring targets as well as delivering much improved cash flow. The crop protection market has started to turn to more normal buying behavior, and we believe market conditions will continue to improve as we move through the rest of the year and into 2025. Growers are constantly looking for new technologies to combat pest resistance and FMC is delivering these innovative new products. We expect approximately 17% of our revenue this year will come from products introduced in the last 5 years, a record for our company, up from 10% in 2021. This growth is despite the challenges the industry has faced over the last year and shows the value growers place on new technologies. With that, we are now ready to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question today comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Wondering if you can give a bit more color on the first quarter sales. You referenced Argentina issue that, that would have gotten you to the low end of your sales guidance. Could you just tell us a little bit more about that, and then help us understand what could have happened that might have gotten you to the midpoint of 1Q? It also sounds like you're expecting volume growth in 2Q to largely come from your new product initiatives. So what does the base business need to do in 2Q in order to hit your guide? Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks, Vincent. Let me just expand on the Q1 comment, first of all. We did highlight, obviously, a distributor arrangement that we changed in Argentina. We talked before about being very careful how we do business in the Southern Cone and in Brazil. We've been very -- extremely diligent in protecting our balance sheet. We saw an issue with a distributor that we had in Argentina, and we decided to take material back from that distributor and that relationship. So that's the type of activity that, yes, it slowed down the top line. But from a balance sheet perspective, it was absolutely the right thing to do. I think the second feature that impacted us in Q1 that we were not expecting was really the terrible weather in Northern Europe. For those of you that follow these things, the U.K. has had, I think its wettest spring in -- for about 200 years and the same in Scandinavia, the same in Germany, Holland, Belgium. That was really the other factor that brought down our revenue. So over and above everything else, pretty much all the regions performed as we expected. Moving forward and looking through Q2 and then into the rest of the year, I would start by saying, first of all, the market, the fundamental market, the use of products and technologies on the ground remains robust around the world. Yes, there are pockets where weather has impacted, but generally speaking, growers are protecting their crops with the best technologies they can find. What does that mean for us? Well, relationships with our growers are, I would say, at a different level in terms of communication and conversation about the   future today than we've seen in the last year. I'll give a couple of examples. Brazil, our orders on hand today are significantly higher than where they were this time last year. In other words, growers have depleted much of their inventory. They are now asking distribution and retail and hence FMC, we need materials going into the next season. Acreage is expected to increase in the '24, '25 season in Brazil, so they're expecting a good year. We now have those orders on hand. What does that mean for us? It gives us better insights into the second half, but also it's given us confidence to now carefully start bringing back manufacturing lines that have been closed over the last year. So we're bringing back manufacturing on the basis of the orders that we have on hand for Brazil. That also means we're extending payables now, which is the first time we've really started to buy raw materials, I would say, over the last year, and Andrew can comment on that a little later. In Europe, conversations with growers are now changing to be what do I need for the rest of the season rather than what do I need for this week or the next week. So that starts to give you the feel that there is more of a longer-term view. Yes, people have changed their inventory levels, and that's the way they're going to operate their business, but they're asking for materials. In the U.S., we're still selling products that are used very early in the season, even in May, which is unusual. What does that tell you? It tells you that the inventories of those products have been totally depleted. We're selling for products that will be used right now. So you take those 3 big regions alone. There is better visibility for us as we go forward. That also contributes to our view of new products and our launches of new products. I listed in the scripts numerous products that are being launched from herbicides through the new fungicides through insecticides. It's the new technologies that drive the value and growers are always looking for new tools to invest in resistance breaking, and that's what we provide. So generally speaking, that's how we expect the year to flow. It's why today in May, do we feel confident to leave our forecast where they are versus where we were in February. We have a better sight of where our customers are today than we had in February. Operator : The next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc. Ryan Weis : This is Ryan on for Aleksey. Just a quick one for me. Can you guys talk about the level of pricing for your brand in diamides versus the rest of the portfolio? Just any color there would be helpful. Mark Douglas : Yes, we don't give pricing for our products versus other parts of our products. I think you all know that the diamides are a very healthy franchise for FMC, continues to be so. When I look at Q1 and I look at this year, we expect that diamides will perform better than the overall portfolio. We did highlight in the release that our diamides in Brazil grew double digits in Q1 and that is against a very difficult backdrop. The reason they grew is exactly what we said we would do in November at the Investor Day. We're producing new formulations that are differentiated, and they are being accepted by the market. Premio Star is a brand-new insecticide for soybeans, and it has been well attended in the marketplace. That allows us to move from the older products to the newer products and gain market share and growth. Operator : The next question comes from Christopher Parkinson of Wolfe Research. Harris Fein : This is Harris Fein on for Chris. Just a quick one for me. In North America, obviously, volumes were down on a tough comp pretty significantly, but you still held price flat. Just curious what your thoughts are on potentially adjusting the rebate structures to get volume slowing again. Is that something that you think could be necessary or that you're exploring? Mark Douglas : No. When we look at the portfolio, I think one of the facets that's kind of getting missed in FMC's North American business is just the sheer mix change that's going on there, something like 25% of our revenue has come from products launched in the last 5 years. That's probably the highest of any region we have in the world. The North American team has done a great job in introducing new insecticides based on the diamides, introducing brand-new fungicides, such as the one I mentioned, Xyway and Adastrio. This is new market opportunities for us. Generally speaking, when we introduced those new products, they are at a higher price point and a higher profitability point, they're bringing new attributes to growers. So when we change that mix, obviously, we see the business starts to change. So no, we're not doing anything with our rebate programs in North America. We believe that our proposition to grow is, is based upon technology and availability of that technology. We feel very good about where the North American business is. I think if you looked at that on the face of that statement, I said, but you dropped 48% in Q1, why -- if your business is good, why is that? Frankly speaking, Q1 2023 was a blockbuster quarter, mainly driven by Canada. There was huge pest pressure in Canada last year, and we haven't seen that same pest pressure this year. That's normal for these ag markets, but the North American business fundamentally is in very good shape. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Spector from UBS. Joshua Spector : So I wanted to ask specifically on your second half guidance. I think one of the parameters you have in there is second half pricing out flat year-over-year. Can you characterize your level of confidence in that just especially given that you're seeing mid-teens down in Latin America today, high single digits down in Asia. What normalizes that? And would you flag that at risk or not at this point? Mark Douglas : Andrew, do you want to make a comment? Andrew Sandifer : Yes. Thanks, Josh. Look, I think you have to look at the price of where we are and the overall progression is correct. We have downward prices movement in Q3 and Q4 of last year as well as in the first quarter of this year with overall low single, mid-single digit, minus 3% in Q3, minus 5% in Q4, low single digit, mid-single-digit kind of price ranges overall, but with a significant amount of pricing being in Latin America. As we finished the season, we will be going into the new season in the fall, anniversarying very significant price reductions in Latin America. So we're not anticipating that there's big shifts and less price as we go into the new season given where we already are. Operator : The next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : I was hoping to get a bit more color on kind of the market expectations and performance in India. It's the one area where I think the destocking kind of trend is kind of still moving to high channel inventories. It feels like that's been a pretty consistent narrative in that market for running on 2 years now. And just love to get what gives you line of sight to maybe that ending, if anything? And how maybe you're disaggregating channel destocking and potential lower application rates from any competitive pressures that might exist there? Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks, Adam. Yes, India is -- it's a very important market for us and one that is facing its own individual challenges, not necessarily related to the same reasons as the rest of the world is facing, the channel inventories. I would say India is almost unique in the sense of the channel inventory pressure that we face there is purely due to weather and dislocated monsoons over the last few years. We're not the only market participant to comment on this. Others have also commented on it. It's an industry-wide phenomenon. And it's just time that takes us to get through that. The monsoon in the last season was not great. We're hoping for better weather conditions as we continue through the rest of the year. We are reducing channel inventory every quarter. Some quarters is faster than others, but it will take some time to remove what is a fair degree of channel inventory. The markets themselves are good in India from where the weather is good. Generally speaking, the Indian growers do like to use the latest technologies and the more advanced technologies. It's one of the only markets in the world right now where we have online spray services with drones. It just shows you that some markets like India that appear highly fragmented, really do adopt technology very quickly. So we're drone spraying. I think we run over 5,000 acres right now. That number is growing. That's a differentiated approach because it allows us to take our brand-new products and apply them in a way that is very beneficial to the small farmholders in India. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : A lot of talk about destocking, but I had a question on your own internal inventory. It looks like that came down $324 million on a year-over-year basis, if my math is correct. Can you frame out where you are now versus where you would like inventories to be thinking about Mark, I think you made a comment, bringing some manufacturing back online as it relates to Brazil, inventories in other parts of the world, maybe a little bit higher. So maybe you could just kind of put that internal effort of rationalization into context for us? And any related thoughts on operating leverage would be appreciated. Mark Douglas : Yes, absolutely, Kevin. Thanks for the question. I'll make an overarching comment and then Andrew, if you want to jump in with some different views. Yes, we peaked inventory basically around about August last year internally. And we've been obviously on a track since we first came into this channel destocking to really remove inventory as fast as we could. We're getting close to the point. We're not quite there yet. We're getting close to the point where at the macro level for our inventory, we're going to be pretty much where we want to be. We do have pockets, however, where our inventory levels are lower than they should be. And hence, we're now bringing back up manufacturing. As normal, not everything moves at the same pace. But I would say by the time we get through Q2 and into Q3, we're going to be in pretty good shape in terms of where our revenue has reset this year versus where the inventory needs to be. It's important to notice that we really took some hard steps here. I mean we really did crash manufacturing in the sense of stock manufacturing. That's painful to do in an organization like ours. But we're now coming through the other side of that. And we will rebuild specific inventories as we see that demand come forward. Andrew, do you want to make any other comments? Andrew Sandifer : Yes, certainly, Kevin. I think we're certainly mid-innings in the journey and getting our own inventory in the right place. As Mark pointed to, we -- our reported inventory at June 30 was about $2.1 billion. We're down to just under $1.6 billion this quarter. We have another couple of hundred million to go. It won't be a one big step. It will be very -- it will be bit by bit because I think there's a very delicate balancing of ramping up production, as Mark mentioned, particularly for products where we are already in short supply and balancing it with the inventory we have on hand and its sell-through. This is a part of the algorithm for generating free cash flow this year as we ramp up that production, build up our payables back to more historically normal levels, but maintain inventories that are more in line with our current sales level. So there will be -- it won't be one big step, but through the rest of the year, you should expect another couple of hundred million of inventory to come out of our balance sheet and that will translate to a contribution to free cash flow generation for the year. Mark Douglas : Yes. Andrew, just I'll add one comment, Kevin. Andrew mentioned here that it's what we call the fine balance. I call it a fine balance, find dense. Remember, we have to go to our raw material suppliers and ask for products to feed this pipeline. And many of them are in the same position that we are. In other words, they have their manufacturing shutdown. I think you know that this is a very, very complicated supply chain and quite long. So this whole notion of how product flows from our suppliers to us, to the customers. It's not easy and starting this up is going to be interesting because as we run down our inventories over the last year, our customers have got used to us holding their inventory. That is not going to be occurring in some places in the world with some product lines. So I think this whole notion of the distribution and retail folks running at very low inventory levels compared to historical, we've never done that. So it's going to be interesting to see how this plays out for the value chain, and how we manage inventory going forward as growth starts to come back. Operator : The next question comes from Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Joel Jackson : I'm going to ask a few questions in one. Just you reset, I think, senior management in Brazil. Maybe you could first talk about what's changed there, maybe what you're seeing there, what you've learned with the new eyes looking at it. Second of all, just to reconcile a couple of things you said on this call this morning. So I think you said that you're seeing customers now put out -- giving you order visibility a bit later than they were hand to mouth, but I think you also said that customers are going to be running with lower inventories than they normally have. I may have got that wrong, but can you reconcile those 2 comments, if I got that right? Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks, Joel. Yes, new management in Brazil. It's the first time that FMC in a very long time has brought somebody in to be the president of the region from outside the company. We have a very robust human capital process inside the company where we develop talent and move them around the world. We felt now was a good time to bring in talent from the outside, and we brought in a very experienced industry veteran, who has both crop protection background, but also retail and distribution background. So we're getting the best of both wells there. What are we learning? We're learning that we can expand our customer presence in the sense of where the market pockets are that we can go and expand into. So that's a good sign of a market growth perspective. Also bringing that retail and distribution mentality allows us to think about how we build our offers into that part of the channel to make FMC's overall portfolio very attractive. I think from the order visibility and lower levels of inventory, Joel, I would say both are caring. The fact that people are holding lower levels of inventory is one thing. But it's where it is in that chain that you have to think about. It may be the distribution wants to hold lower levels of inventory, but retail might not because they have to service the customer from what they have. So don't think of the 2 pieces as being opposed to each other. They actually do work hand-in-hand. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Steve Byrne : When we look at your volume trends over the last 5 years, there is a fairly meaningful difference between first half and second half. And perhaps that's a reflection of second half is nearly half driven by Lat Am. But when we look at like your volumes in this first quarter, they're lower than the 2 to 5 years of volume growth. So something really led to sharp contraction in the first quarter in volume, but yet your second half volumes presumably that Lat Am are -- looks like they're going to get back to 2022 levels just reversing 2023. So I guess I'm trying to understand your -- why the difference is between first and second half your? And is that second half potentially driven by just robust demand for insecticides? There are some additional insect pressures in South America these days. Mark Douglas : Andrew, do you want to make some comments? Andrew Sandifer : Yes, Steve, it's Andrew. Thanks for the question. First, just to put some of this in context, I think Q4 is the -- Q1, excuse me, Q1 of '24 here is the last quarter where we're comparing to a pre-channel inventory disruption world, right? As Mark mentioned earlier, Q1 of '23 was a record quarter for us. Our North America region was up 41% in Q1 of 23% year-on-year to put it in perspective, right? So we're dealing with a big swing from peak to more correction kind of zone. And the volume performance in Q1 of '24, very much in line with what we've seen with all 4 quarters of this channel correction. I mean Q2 of '23, we dropped 23% -- excuse me, 31%. Q3 of '23, we dropped 27% volume. Q4, we dropped 25% volume. This is -- the Q1 performance, I would say, just put in context, is just a continuation of the channel correction that we've always said was going to take at least a year to clear out that you had to get through an anniversary this change before you would start seeing any kind of volume return. So I'd put Q1 in that context. But to the second part of your question, I think it's an interesting one. In terms of the size, the growth in the second half. And look, if you look at percentages and the slide that's in the presentation, 23% top line, 46% bottom line growth in the second half. Those feel like very large numbers. I get it. But when you look at our historical size of business, revenue dollars in the second half that we're implying are similar to what we did in 2021, well before the overbuying of 2022. EBITDA dollars are actually lower than '21 sort of between our performance in the second half of 2020 and 2021. So we're not counting on massive correction. We're not counting on recouping 2022 type positions, where we acknowledge there was overbuying. What we have here is a return to more normalcy. And given this Lat Am in particular, if you think about what drives our second half, certainly, Lat Am is a big chunk of it. and the U.S. market and prestocking in Q4, big chunks of it. Both of those businesses took big corrections in '23 and have taken big corrections through the remainder of the season. As Mark described, we finished -- we're finishing up the current season in Latin America with much lower inventories, particularly at grower and retail level. So we're going into a market that is not normal, but improving. And I think that's the key, the improving market conditions. So net-net, we think that the size of the absolute dollar business we're forecasting doing in the second half is reasonable given that we are past the worst of these year-on-year comparisons. And we're growing from -- certainly growing from a smaller base. So again, just to be careful, don't get overwhelmed by the percentage change here, the absolute dollar size of the business again, compares pretty much to what we were doing in 2020 or 2021. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Keches from Barclays. Andrew Keches : Andrew, I have a question on the cash flow discussion that you hit on a couple of questions ago. So you've said or at least you've indicated that cash flow will be more back half weighted in 2024. But I also heard Mark talk about starting to rebuild some of those payables already in Brazil. So can you give us a sense just for the cadence of cash flow from here, the second quarter is typically a source on a free cash flow basis, but just any sort of relative sense and how back-end weighted should we expect it? And then if I can sneak in a tiny follow-up. You did mention continued deleveraging in 2025. This year appears to be mostly cash inflows and debt repayment driving that. Is next year going to include debt repayment as well? Or is that more about EBITDA growth? Andrew Sandifer : Certainly. Thanks, Andrew, I appreciate the questions. Look, I think on a dollars of cash flow basis, the free cash flow is very heavily weighted to the second half of this year. We were negative free cash flow in the first quarter as is normal, but significantly less so than the prior year quarter, right? And that's a big inflection and marks the change in inventory levels for us, where we would traditionally have a working capital build in Q1 with growing inventory. Q2, I would expect still probably to be breakeven until the negative cash flow. And we don't -- we're not going to guide it precisely. There is too many moving variables. But I would tell you that all of -- essentially all of the positive free cash flow for the years may come in the second half. And again, the key drivers for the full year on free cash flow, it's reduced inventory and it's rebuilding of payables. And this dance, this balance that Mark and I have been talking about this morning, we are starting to spool up and restart manufacturing lines. That will pull through purchases, that will add to create some work in process and finished goods inventory that flows in the inventory and then we sell through. What we are carefully balancing is continuing to bring down our absolute level of inventory while selling through at the higher rate we're expecting to sell in the second half, new production. So it will be a stagger step as we go through the rest of the year to bring payables back up to a more reasonable level and to get inventory, again, a couple of hundred million less than where we are today. So that will be the combination of those 2, and it really will take through the full second half to get the cash benefit from those actions. As we think about the second part of your question and thinking about leverage, certainly, we've been very clear. The priority for all available cash after paying the dividend this year is paying down debt. So proceeds from divestiture, from free cash flow that we generate organically. In 2025, we still have a significant way to go to get the leverage to the right place. We will continue to see leverage improvement, but it will be driven by 2 factors instead of just debt repayment. It will be driven by growth in EBITDA. We absolutely are expecting to have growth in EBITDA that will help us to bring leverage back to more of a normal level for this business and well within the kind of covenant range we should be at. But we will also continue to prioritize free cash use for debt repayment until we get the balance sheet into the right place, right? So I think it will be that combination of the 2 levers. It will be growth in EBITDA in 2025 as well as still a commitment to utilizing free cash flow to get leverage to the right place as we go through 2025 that gets us to that where we think we'll be right about the targeted levels by the time that we get to the end of 2025. Operator : The next question comes from Edlain Rodriguez from Mizuho. Edlain Rodriguez : Just a quick follow-up on market normalizing. As inventory destocking comes to an end and as you get into 2025, like how do you see volume growth for the portfolio in 2025 and 2026. Mark Douglas : Yes. Listen, as we go through '25, I think we've said that we expect what we would consider a more normal type of growth for the marketplace. Acres continue to grow in, certainly, in Latin America and Brazil. So we expect that to be a driver. And don't forget at that point, people will be then resetting from a lower level of inventory. So you would expect more of a normal market growth. Typical market like this grows at anywhere from 2% to 3% per annum. And we generally speaking, with our differentiated portfolio, outgrow the market in the long haul. So I think it's more about a normalized market. Demand on the ground, as we said, even in these conditions is very good. We expect that to continue as pressure continues to change. So we see that market piece as being pretty robust. Obviously, our NPIs are growing rapidly. So we would expect '25 and '26 to be actually faster than the growth we see in '24. And then the other piece of -- which is not really market-driven, but just a view of '25, we had a lot of cost headwinds flowing against us right now that are obviously depressing our EBITDA and our EBITDA margin. Those turn into tailwinds as we go into next year. And I think it's an important facet as we walk through the next couple of earnings calls as we build out the picture of what '25 is going to look like, you certainly have got a more stable, more robust external market, but we also have some pretty significant tailwinds in the sense of how we think about our P&L. Andrew, do you want to comment on that? Andrew Sandifer : Yes. I think, Mark, as we look at '25, obviously, one of the headwinds we're dealing with this year is unabsorbed fixed costs from low manufacturing activity. That -- as we go through this delicate dance we've been describing this morning and get back to more normal operating rates. By the time we get to the end of this year, we anticipate being past that, to where the relatively significant headwinds we've had this year from unabsorbed fixed costs are no longer there. So if you think about the absence of the headwind going into '25, itself being a bit of a tailwind or a stronger base for performance in '25 adding certainly that will be a key element of our outlook. Now we've got to see how the rest of the year develops. But I think based on how we see things today and the way we're planning to ramp up production, do expect that volume variance piece that unabsorbed fixed costs to really ease by the time we get through the end of this year. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Harrison at Seaport Research Partners. Michael Harrison : I was hoping that maybe you could give a little bit of additional color on the recent new product launches, and how they're performing relative to expectations. And then you mentioned just now that you would expect some acceleration in '25 and '26. Maybe help us understand how you see grower adoption evolve and those adoption rates change from the launch year into the second and third year post-launch for those new products. Mark Douglas : Yes. Thanks, Mike. If you look at what we've been talking about today in terms of how we think about what we call NPI products launched in the last 5 years, we've gone from back in 2020, 2021, about 10% of our portfolio from those new NPIs. In '23, it was about 13%. We expect it to be about 17% this year. You can see that it takes a number of years for those numbers to start to creep up. And the reason is, you never get to peak sales in year 1. I mean it's impossible in this market. Peak sales going to be anything from 5 years through 10 years. I mean we still have some active ingredients that are 10-plus years old that continue to grow as we find new applications for them. We've talked about the fungicides. North America doing a very good job, especially with the fluindapyr-based fungicides. They've now been launched in Brazil and in Argentina, and they'll be launched in other parts of the world as we go through '25. So you should expect us to talk about the fluindapyr fungicide growing nicely in '25, '26 easily through '27. The diamides continue their track of new introductions, the Premio Star insecticide that we talked about has grown rapidly. We launched it in Q4. It grew very well in Q1. We expect the '24-'25 season to be very interesting and continued growth. Pest pressure is not going away in Brazil. And we have, by far, the most robust portfolio of insecticides in the world. So that's a market that we do expect to continue to grow. On top of that, we have Isoflex, which is the grass herbicide that we released in Australia. That is now being put into Argentina. It will go into other parts of Asia as we go through the '25 season. And then probably more exciting than all of those and trust me, they're pretty exciting molecules. We have the brand new rice herbicide that comes in 2026. And that really is a game changer. Rice is a grass and killing grass in rice is not easy. We have the first new mode of action in 30 years. So Asia is a major target for us in 2026. And then outside of that, on the biological and pheromone side, we will have our first soft launch of our first pheromone in Brazil in '25 and that means it will build in '26 and '27 and beyond through the next decade. That's really the first launch of that whole new platform that we've built. We're making excellent progress in terms of R&D. We have our manufacturing and supply chain coming together very well. We're producing our first real amounts of these pheromones through our new process. So you can tell that over the next few years, the robustness of that portfolio, it's really, really strong. Operator : The next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital. Arun Viswanathan : Congrats on a good Q1 here. So I guess I just wanted to ask about the second half. Andrew, you provided some very useful comments. I guess, noting that on a dollar basis, it looks like your second half looks like you should be at 2020 or 2021 levels. And you will be exiting according to your guidance, at least at the midpoint at say, $1.25 billion or so on an annualized basis. If you were to annualize that second half guidance. So is that kind of how you're thinking about '25 and maybe informing your comments, I think in 2020, you did that $1.25 billion; in 2021, you did $1.32 billion of EBITDA. I know it's still ways away, but just kind of thinking if you think that the second half guidance really encapsulates that normalization. Andrew Sandifer : Yes. I think certainly, look, always cautious in trying to annualize a very seasonal business, right? And obviously different dynamics in each quarter with regional mix and product mix, et cetera. But I think your bigger point, right, return to sales levels that not necessarily 2022 by any means, but the sales and EBITDA levels that look more like where the business was a few years ago, not an unreasonable assumption going into 2025. It's too early to get too granular here. But I do think a combination from top line, we're in a situation right now where inventories downstream are really getting more and more light. People are targeting levels of inventory that we would argue are not sustainable over a multiyear period, downstream of those. At some point, there has to be some rebalancing that's not going to happen quickly. But over time, there could be some rebalancing and just getting back into the more normal flow. Look, the one thing we've pointed to, and we're very comfortable and confident with, grower use of crop protection chemistry has been steady and increasing throughout this disruption. We had an overbuying in the channel in 2022 that built up excess channel inventory. We've had an overcorrection and rapidly drawing that down in 2023 and into 2024 that as those draw down manufacturing supply has to get back more in balance and in sync with underlying consumption by growers. That will drive healthier top line demand in 2025 than we've seen in 2024. When you look down to EBITDA, right, we've talked a little bit about what's going on with our manufacturing operations and through the second half, when we start ramping up production and getting back to more normal capacity utilizations, there will be cost tailwinds or the absence of headwinds from unabsorbed fixed costs as we go into 2025. So that top line growth with better manufacturing costs with mix benefits from new product introduction and some of the exciting things Mark was just talking about in terms of growth drivers for us long term with new products, that should drop more of that growth to the bottom line. So again, too early to give firm outlook for '25, but I do think we feel pretty strongly that there's a positive outlook out there. We have a couple of more quarters to really get through here. Q2 is a big inflection with a return to volume growth. And then the second half getting back into much improved market conditions from what we saw in 2023. Mark, if you want to add to that? Mark Douglas : No, good review, Andrew. Operator : Our final question today comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Daniel Rizzo : This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. You talked a lot about getting inventories down and payables and working with those. I was just wondering with in terms of receivables, if there were -- you're comfortable where they are, that's something that has to be worked on as well. Andrew Sandifer : Sure. Thanks for the question. I think -- yes, I think we're comfortable with receivables. There's always opportunities to continue to be more efficient. This is a working capital-intensive business. We get it. There will be some use of cash in the second half as we return to growth and that naturally brings some growth in receivables. But we have been managing very carefully our balance sheet. And I think if you look at our -- how we've chosen to manage through this correction period as opposed to some of our peers, we have been disciplined about pricing and about not chasing volume that wasn't there. So it's not to build up receivables and longer-term collection risk. I think we're in a position now where there's always collection risk, but we are at a very good position. We understand where our risks are. We understand -- we've taken some lumps by not -- again, not pursuing extra volume when there really wasn't volume in the market to be had. And instead, working through this so that we can come into what will be an upturn here in the second half and then into 2025 with a strong balance sheet with healthy receivables. So again, always room and opportunity to continue to look for ways to improve our working capital efficiency. But in terms of the quality of our balance sheet, we feel very confident. Operator : We've now concluded our Q&A session. So I'll hand the call back to Curt Brooks. Curt Brooks : Thanks, everyone. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes the FMC Corporation conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions]. After today's prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Curt Brooks, Director of Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Please go ahead. Curt Brooks : Good morning, everyone and welcome to FMC Corporation's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Pierre Brondeau, Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Ronaldo Pereira, President. Following our prepared remarks we will take questions. Our earnings released in today's slide presentation are available on our website and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call. Let me remind you that today's presentation and discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors including but not limited to those factors identified in our earnings release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's understanding. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion and the supporting materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations, free cash flow, and organic revenue growth, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that as used in today's discussion, earnings means adjusted earnings and EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website. With that I'll now turn the call over to Pierre. Pierre Brondeau : Thank you, Curt. And good morning, everyone. Since resuming the CEO role, I have taken an in-depth look at the company and the crop protection market which has led to revise full year outlook. To share my views, today's call will be more wide-ranging than a typical earnings call. We delivered a solid Q2 helped by a successful execution of a restructuring program. We expect continued growth in Q3 and Q4 from demand recovery led by the Americas where we expect channel inventory to approach normal levels by year-end. Q2 through Q4 also show higher revenue driven by volume with the rate of growth accelerating in Q4 as we shift into the next crop season. The markets have begun to recover as channel inventories are starting to normalize, even if not as fast as we had previously expected. We plan for FMC's pace of revenue and earnings growth to accelerate through the rest of 2024 and throughout 2025. We continue to firmly believe in the strength of the Diamides portfolio, new product recently introduced, and the technology pipeline. Later in the call, our newly appointed president, Ronaldo Pereira, will provide our views on the strength of the portfolio and how this positions us to take a full advantage of the demand recovery. Full year revenue EBITDA guidance has been reduced to a slower demand recovery than we originally anticipated. To help mitigate the slower recovery in the second half, we have increased our cost saving target and speed of execution. The lower guidance is more of a timing impact and is not a fundamental issue with the market or with FMC. We'll address the Q3 and Q4 profiles in more detail, but I want to quickly touch on two key points. First, the EBITDA margin gathered for Q3 is not representative of the current company performance and operations. There is an expected COGS headwind in that quarter of about $40 million, mainly due to an absorbed fixed cost in relation to a reduced manufacturing activity in the second half of 2023 that are now flowing throughout P&L. Second, the strength of Q4 compared to Q3 is an exaggeration of the typically stronger sales report in the fourth quarter. Historically, Q4 has always been stronger than Q3, but it's magnified this year by the shape of the demand recovery. Our intent for the call is to share information that will demonstrate a confidence in the Q4 forecast. Overall, I am feeling positive about the company. Having said that, I see a number of areas where we can improve on our execution, and we are already implementing changes. I will share more detail in future conversations. I hope this helps position my views of the company and market and provide context for the rest of the call. Slide 3 through 5 provide an overview of our second quarter results. Revenue increased by a modest 2% with volume growth of 14%. In part, the stronger than initially planned volume growth was enabled by strategic pricing actions made during the call. The 10% price decline was mainly driven by three things. One is competitive pressure, which is a normal market dynamic when demand starts to return. Two is a strategic intent to take back market positions in less differentiated products that we intentionally left to competitors by holding to a high-priced strategy when demand was low. And third is one-time incentives to address high-cost inventory in the channel. We began making these one-off adjustments as a way to speed up de-stocking ahead of the next crop season, which will begin in September. With demand returning, we do not plan to make these kinds of one-off adjustments going forward. It is important to recognize that from Q4 2021 to Q2 2023, we raised price every quarter. Even considering the recent price adjustment, we are still substantially ahead in pricing. And now that demand is returning, we can take strategic action in pricing as a lever for sales growth in certain markets. With one full year of de-stocking completed, we saw a return to volume growth in many countries, particularly in the U.S., Brazil, and Germany. As expected, we saw many more small orders to fill immediate needs as customers continue to actively manage inventory. There are a few original sales highlights I want to call out. North America sales were up 24%, mainly from volume in the U.S. with strong growth in herbicides. We are seeing customers waiting to order insecticides and fungicides until they observe pests in the field. In Latin America, sales were up 14%, mainly from volume growth in Brazil. The region also showed strong gains in new products, including Coragen eVo and Premio Star diamide insecticide, Burrow Food, and Stone Herbicide and Onsuva, a newly launched fluindapyr based fungicide. Lower price was driven by three factors I mentioned earlier, competition in the market, strategic pricing on less differential products, and one-time price adjustment. Asia sales were down 28%, and that was largely driven by volume in India. Channel volume in India remains high, especially in insecticide, which has built up over successive aforementioned seasons. Sales of generic Rynaxypyr are acting as smaller secondary headwinds while we pursue litigation for process patent infringement. Ronaldo will speak more to the diamides in a few minutes. We do not see the India channel inventory resolving until at least 2025. In other areas of Asia, Asian countries reported the strongest growth while China declined. Sales in the EMEA were down 3%. Excluding sales to a diamide powder, the region reported overall sales growth in the low 10% driven by volume. The region delivered strong growth in branded diamides and fungicides. Looking at the EBITDA Bridge on slide five, we delivered EBITDA of $202 million, which is at the highest end of our guidance range. The increase of 8% versus the prior year was due to volume growth, cost benefits from the restructuring actions, and FX tailwinds. These three factors more than offset lower pricing and COGS headwinds related to the self-rule of higher cost inventory. Slide six provides an update on the progress in our restructuring actions. We are making excellent progress and have already realized considerable cost benefits through June. We now expect between $75 million to $100 million of cost benefits in 2024, net of inflation, and are on pace to achieve over $150 million of gross run rate savings by 2025. On July 11th, we announced that we entered into an agreement to sell a global specialty solution business for $350 million to Envu. We're expecting the transaction to be completed by the end of the year. We will continue to include the results of this business in our reported figures until the deal has closed, as it does not meet the criteria to be moved into discontinued operations. Our guidance for the second half includes earnings and cash flow from this business. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we have updated our full year revenue guidance to a range of $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion, which is 2% lower than prior year at the midpoint. This is $200 million reduction between the midpoint of our new and prior guidance, and about half of that attributed to lower first-hand sales that we do not expect to make up this year. The remaining reduction is mostly the result of a slower than expected demand recovery. Although demand recovery is slower than originally anticipated, we do not see improvement in most geographies - sorry, we do see improvement in most geographies, with the exception of India. A revised EBITDA guidance of $880 million to $940 million reflect the lower revenue outlook, and is a 7% reduction at the midpoint against prior guidance and prior year. We expect third quarter revenue to be between $1 billion and $1.09 billion, which is 6% higher at the midpoint versus prior year. Volume is the key driver, with pricing expected to be down low single digits. Year-over-year pricing headwinds are lower compared to the second quarter, as we do not plan to continue one-time incentives now that much of the high-cost inventory in the channel has been reduced. Overall, pricing levels in the third quarter are expected to be similar to the second quarter. Third quarter EBITDA is expected to be between $165 million and $195 million, representing 3% growth at the midpoint. EBITDA margin midpoint of 17% reflects the outsized impact of a $40 million COGS headwind we expect during the quarter. The headwind is mostly attributed to unabsorbed fixed costs related to reduced manufacturing during the second half of 2023. Absence of this headwind would put our implied third quarter midpoint EBITDA margin in line with the historical Q3 average. Fourth quarter revenue is expected to be between $1.34 billion and $1.45 billion, which is 22% higher at the midpoint. Volume is expected to be the key driver of sales supported by new products, improving demand, and growing market share. Price and effects are both expected to be low single-digit headwinds. Fourth quarter EBITDA is expected to be between $353 million and $383 million, up 45% at the midpoint, almost entirely attributed to higher sales. Costs are expected to be favorable from restructuring benefits. The quality pace of results this year is forecasted to be different from what we reported in the past. Typically, the third quarter is the lowest revenue quarter in the year. This year, it is expected to be higher than the first and second quarters due to the timing of the demand recovery. Our second half revenue split between Q3 and Q4 has historically been about 46% third quarter and 54% fourth quarter. This year, we are getting to a quarterly revenue split in the second half of 43% third quarter and 57% fourth quarter. The higher than usual sales in Q4 are due to the shape of the demand recovery. To achieve the midpoint of our full year guidance, we expect to grow in the second half by 15% revenue and 28% in EBITDA with a strong fourth quarter. There are four reasons we are highly confident in those numbers. One, there are signs that demand is recovering. Our second quarter volume is evidence of that. What we're seeing in our second half order books also reflect that improvement. For example, in Brazil, we have about a third of the orders in a book that we'll need to reach that country's second half targets. At this time last year, it was almost zero. Early indications after one month of second half operation show that the regions are on track to reach that target. Two, a large portion of the sales growth we expect in the second half is coming from products launched in the last five years. We see solid demand for these products due to their differentiation from other technologies. Some examples include Onsuva fungicide and Coragen eVo insecticide in Latin America. Overwatch herbicide in Asia based on the new active ingredient Isoflex and new diamides formulation in North America like Elevest and Vantacor Evo. Three, improved orders from diamide partners. Similar to FMC, our partners have been attempting to work down high level of inventories. Levels are now reaching a point that are supporting higher purchases. And four, cost management. We have shown the ability to effectively control cost and deliver on a restructuring savings commitment. That will continue in the second half. I will now hand the call over to Andrew to cover some financial items including our cash performance and outlook. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks, Pierre. I will start this morning with a review of some key income statement items. FX was a 2% headwind to revenue growth in the second quarter with the most significant headwinds coming from the Indian rupee, Brazilian real and Turkish lira. For the remainder of 2024, we anticipate continued low single digit FX headwinds driven primarily by the Brazilian real. Interest expense for the second quarter was $63.6 million, down slightly versus the prior year period. But lower foreign interest expense offsetting higher domestic interest expense. For full year 2024, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $235 million to $240 million, essentially flat year-on-year at the midpoint. With the impact of higher rates on domestic debt offset by lower foreign borrowings. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the second quarter was 15.5%, in line with the midpoint of our continued expectation for a full year tax rate of 14% to 17%. Our GAAP provision for income taxes in the second quarter benefited from the transfer of intangible assets to our Swiss subsidiaries, where we recently were awarded OECD Pillar 2 Compliant Tax Incentives. This asset transfer will allow us to take further advantage of these new incentives and will help ensure FMC maintains a structurally advantaged tax rate for at least the next decade. Moving next to the balance sheet and leverage. Gross debt at June 30th was approximately $4.2 billion, down $157 million from the prior quarter. Cash on hand increased $54 million to $472 million, resulting in net debt of approximately $3.7 billion. Gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 5.3 times at quarter end, while net debt to EBITDA was 4.7 times. Relative to our covenant, which measures leverage with a number of adjustments to both the numerator and denominator, leverage was 5.4 times as compared to a covenant of 6.5 times. As a reminder, our covenant leverage limit was raised temporarily to 6.5 times through June 30th this year. It will step down to 6 times on September 30th and then again to 5 times on December 31st. We expect covenant leverage approaching four times by year-end, reflecting both the year-on-year EBITDA growth in the second half, as well as receipt of proceeds from the recently announced sale of our Global Specialty Solutions business to Envu. We remain committed to returning our leverage to levels consistent with our targeted BBB BAA2 long-term credit ratings, or better. While we will still be meaningfully above this level at the end of 2024, we are confident that with EBITDA growth and disciplined cash management, we can reach leverage metrics consistent with our target credit rating in 2025. Moving on to free cash flow in slide 11. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $280 million, an improvement of over $187 million versus the prior year period. Nearly all of this improvement came from adjusted cash from operations, which improved by $184 million from a reduction in inventory, as well as a build of payables. Collections continued to be strong and ahead of our internal forecast. Capital additions were lower as we continued to constrain investment to only the most critical high-return projects. Legacy and transformation cash spending was up due to costs related to our restructuring program. Through the first half of 2024, free cash flow is up $915 million versus the prior year. We now expect free cash flow of $400 million to $500 million for full year 2024, a positive swing of nearly $1 billion from the 2023 performance at the midpoint of the range. This year-on-year increase is expected to be driven by significant cash release from rebuilding accounts payable and reducing inventory, partially offset by higher accounts receivable due to revenue growth in the second half of the year. Relative to our prior guidance, this free cash flow outlook reflects the updated EBITDA guidance provided today, as well as a modest reduction in anticipated capital investment. With that, I'll hand the call over to Ronaldo. Ronaldo Pereira : Thank you, Andrew. Before I begin, I want to take a moment to describe the four components that drive our portfolio's growth. The first is innovative formulations of our non-diamide products, some of which are patented. The second is our diamide franchise. Growth of the diamides is supported by existing IP protection and our actions to transition to unique patented formulations. This is enabled by our extensive knowledge of the diamides and their target insect populations. Third is bringing to market four new active ingredients, with two having a new mode of action and a new family of products, the pheromones. Finally, our expanding platform of biological products. Today, I'll focus my discussion on diamides and the new active ingredients and what gives us confidence in our ability to keep growing. Diamides have been a core part of our business since we launched at FMC as a pure play agricultural sciences company in 2018. In these almost seven years, we have grown our partner base and expanded our geographic footprint. Through new product registrations, we have introduced brand new patented formulations that allow us to enter new market and crop segments. From the time we purchased the diamides, there have been concerns regarding a perceived cliff on revenue. This is absolutely not how we see it. Rather, we expect the diamides to be a growth platform for FMC well into the future. Discussions about the strength and resilience of our diamides usually start with the composition of matter patents for the active ingredients. These have largely expired for Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr active ingredients. But there are many other factors that support the strength of our diamides. One such factor is other patents, which includes manufacturing processes and specific intermediates. These patents provide protection that continues through mid-2026, varying byproduct and geography. In countries like India and China, these patents have been harder to enforce, which is not the case in most other geographies. This is evidenced by recent legal victories and the lack of generic players attempting to sell in these other geographies. Another factor is data protection. Providing studies for necessary registration can be time-consuming and costly for competitors. If a generic player wants to reference our proprietary data to save cost and time in registering their own products, they will need to wait until the data is no longer protected, which can be as long as 10 years from the original registration. We sell our diamides in nearly 100 countries. Each country has its own regulatory agencies, and the time to register a generic can vary from one year in some countries to more than five years in others. As such, in many countries, competing companies are prevented from registering a generic version of our Cyazypyr actives because FMC's data protection has not expired. After all compositions of matter, process, and intermediate patents and data protection expire, we know that generics will come to the market, most with solo-diamide products that mimic our original products. What they will find is that FMC has not been standing still. We have been actively working to advance our diamides technologies through new formulations. First, through the development of new and, in many cases, patented solo-enhanced formulations. Solo formulations are Rynaxypyr or Cyazypyr molecules formulated to be convenient to farmers, more sustainable, and more cost-effective, allowing FMC diamide products to be more competitive while remaining highly profitable. These new enhanced solo-formulations that we are now introducing in the market are often patented and include high concentration and solid formulations, such as the large effervescent granule product we showcased at our November Investor Day. The second and most important advancement stems from our innovation in developing mixture formulations, which combine diamides with complementary active ingredients. These mixture formulations not only mark a substantial leap forward in performance for growers, but also play a crucial role in preemptively addressing potential insect resistance. At FMC, our proactive approach involves extensive monitoring of insect populations through molecular biology, allowing us to anticipate and mitigate resistance issues. Our expertise in this domain informs the development of superior products tailored to meet the specific needs of each key market. Because we own these products, we have more knowledge about the diamides than any other company, and we are using this knowledge to create superior products. This work is highly tailored to each key country, which, again, significantly diminishes the likelihood of any sudden widespread impact on sales. Simply put, we are confident that there is no impending revenue cliff for these key assets. There are layers of protection for both Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr-based products, making them an important growth platform for FMC for years to come. We have talked about the diamides many times over the last year. To recap the key points, our current patent state is strong and will remain in place for some time. We are successfully defending our patents and will continue to enforce our IP. We are extending and further protecting the lifecycle of diamides through new formulations to ensure our portfolio remains convenient to growers, highly cost competitive, and performance differentiated. Today, we're developing and launching products that will be needed to help fight insect resistance now and in the future. FMC is best positioned to do that because we have consistently used advanced techniques to monitor insect populations for years. These are the reasons why we believe that diamides will continue to be a meaningful contributor to FMC's growth throughout this decade and beyond. In addition to the diamides, the continued introduction of new molecules and new formulations will support our long-term growth. This includes the launch of four new active ingredients, which we spoke about during our 2023 Investor Day. Fluindapyr, a patented fungicide that we have recently launched in the U.S., Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil with future registrations expected for Mexico and India. This product gives us access to the large corn and soybean fungicide segments where we played only marginally until recently. Isoflex, the herbicide we launched in Australia and Argentina. Isoflex will also be launched in Brazil later this year and continue to expand into other crops throughout 2025. In India, we just received product registration this week and plan to launch soon. In Great Britain, we have received the active registration and anticipate product registration shortly. Dodhylex, a patented rice herbicide and the first herbicide with a new mode of action in over 30 years. We have submitted regulatory registration in seven countries in which these make up close to 30% of the global rice market. Commercial launches are expected in 2026. Dodhylex is a big innovation in rice and as we advance its development, we continue to find new opportunities on additional crops. Rimisoxafen is still in its earlier stages. Rimisoxafen is an exciting herbicide effective against resistant weeds like Palmer amaranth, in corn and soybean markets. It's another unique product with a new dual mode of action. Finally, pheromones, a platform of products that can potentially change the way growers manage and protect their crops from insects. We have already applied to register the first pheromone product for row crops in Brazil, Mexico, U.S. and Philippines. We estimate this product platform will contribute about $1 billion in revenue by 2033. Years from now, when solo diamide products are fully exposed to the market, in the market, we expect that FMC will be well beyond those original products with patented new formulations and innovative diamide mixtures. Regarding the five new products I have just mentioned, two have launched. Two are awaiting registration and one is pending regulatory submission. Combined, these products will give us access to segments we do not play in today, significantly expanding our addressable market in the future. Our growth story is one of innovation. It is strongly rooted in the strength of our current portfolio and the significant growth we anticipate from our new products. These are sales that will be in addition to our legacy portfolio, including the diamides. I will now turn it back over to Pierre. Pierre Brondeau : Thank you, Ronaldo. Before we move to Q&A, I want to make a few high-level comments on 2025. It is too early for any formalized guidance, but I will share some factors that we believe could influence our results. We are expecting demand in the market to continue to accelerate from where we end 2024. That would lead to a volume growth for FMC, especially in the first half of the year, where prior comps will be weaker. We also expect continued strong growth over new products. Pricing is uncertain, as in the case during any period of demand recovery. The pricing actions we have taken this year should position us well in 2025. Overall, we expect 2025 revenue growth at around 6%, excluding the GSS business. On the cost side, there is about $150 million to $200 million in expected favorability. That's coming from lower raw materials, the absence of an absorbed fixed-cost headwinds that is forecasted in 2024, and a full year of restructuring benefits. There is some uncertainty, depending upon how raw materials move, but overall, the 2025 cost story is shaping up to be positive. The cost favorability will be partially offset by the loss of about $30 million to $35 million of EBITDA from the sale of the GSS business. That gives us growth at the top and bottom line in 2025, with further growth coming in four years as the new products in the pipeline that Ronaldo spoke about are launched and or expand into new countries and markets. With that, we are now ready to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Chris Parkinson from Wolfe. Your line is now open. Christopher Parkinson : Thank you so much for taking my question. So, Pierre, as much as I'd really love to focus on some of the intermediate and longer-term factors which you've been highlighting on a preliminary basis, I'd love to just dig in a little on the second half and just the cadence between the third and the fourth quarter. I mean, the ag markets are still pretty difficult. There's still some uncertainty in Brazil, but just any color you could offer to give investors a little bit more comfort on the split there and kind of the puts and takes that you outlined on slides 8 and 9 would be especially helpful. Thank you so much. Pierre Brondeau : All right. Thank you, Chris. I'm going to try to be concise on answers, but I might be a bit longer on this one because I think it's the right question. The sequence is important. Q4 is an important quarter. First, I'm going to make an answer which is not a business answer. I'm just back. I do not need to take a risk as a CEO just back to miss my first two quarters. I could have gathered a different level. Nobody would have been surprised with a full year guidance at 890 or 900. So, if I gathered where I did for the fourth quarter, it's because I did a very strong due diligence and it's a true bottom-up process. We went through to define sales and earnings. For Q4, we have a much-improved visibility today in Latin America and mostly Brazil, in North America and in EMEA. As an example for Brazil, we believe that the orders we already have in hand and the Q2 action to prepare for the season put us in an excellent position to meet the Q3, Q4 target. North America, I'd say the visibility is good for the short term. It's an easier market to forecast short term in a sense that we have fewer customers. They are mostly large distributors. So, it's a much easier place to define your short-term potential sales. I would say that the least comfortable in terms of visibility for us would be Asia, driven by the channel situation in India. And I can tell you that that has been reflected in the way we have been forecasting the quarter, the fourth quarter. Third point I would make is the channel is getting closer to normal and demand is picking up. Additionally, we know and we've seen and we've talked to our customers and we know some of the customers have pushed Q3 demand into Q4. They're buying as late as they can so that is inflating the Q4 sales number. On the price, we do not see risk. We have taken very strategic decisions, bringing a price down in the second quarter. We have repositioned pricing. That's being proven by the volume we're able to reach in Q2. So, we believe Q3, Q4, we should see price quite slight versus Q2 and we do not see many risks, especially in Latin America. Finally, and most importantly, in the second half, 60% of the growth in the second half is new product introduction. This is actually quite in line with what we saw in Q2. The demand for those products, some of them which were introduced and market tested in 2023, is very strong. Importantly, it gives us access to market we did not have access to. So that is a very large component over H2 and Q4 growth. And maybe, Ronaldo, you want to say a couple of words about the new product we're introducing to give some confidence about Q4 forecast? Ronaldo Pereira : Sure, Pierre. I would highlight too, in the U.S., we're talking about these enhanced formulations of the diamides, as well as some herbicide platforms that continue to grow for FMC. We just launched an industrial fungicide in North America and that is gaining a lot of steam and speed. And in South America particularly, we're very excited with the introduction of the Fluindapyr-based Onsuva, a fungicide that puts us to play in the soybean rust segment. And also, we don't talk much about that, but there are two new formulations of our Sulfentrazone franchise that are also growing fast in Latin America, particularly in Brazil. One for sugarcane, [ph] Borolfo, and the other one more on the control-to-control resistant weeds on soybean in Brazil. That is a storm, as Pierre mentioned. Pierre Brondeau : So, in a few words, I'm going to say it again. Trust me, I don't want to miss neither Q3 or Q4, so there is a very solid due diligence behind those numbers and strong confidence. Christopher Parkinson : Excellent, color. Thank you so much. Pierre Brondeau : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is now open. Josh Spector : Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit on the cost side of things a little bit more. So, you talked about a headwind in 3Q from some higher product costs due to the downtime you took later last year. When do you roll through that? So, is that a tailwind into fourth quarter, or is that more of a tailwind into next year? And I guess any other weird cost movements we should be thinking about between 3Q or 4Q that maybe drives some higher confidence in that 4Q pickup? Andrew Sandifer : Hey, Josh. It's Andrew. I'll take this one. I think certainly Q3 has been an aberration, just the lumpiness of how some of this cost is flowing through. Just a reminder, everybody, we do have raw material cost benefit throughout the year for newly purchased materials. We've had headwinds that offset that in different ways throughout the different quarters. As we look to the third quarter, the big issue is a big slug of unobserved fixed costs that are now flowing through our P&L from downtime we took in manufacturing facilities in the last year. That is really the big offset to raw material cost favorability. We do also have a little bit higher distribution and freight costs because we're doing higher volumes, but it's really that flow through of the unfavorable variances. In Q4, we still have a little bit of those volume variances flowing through that unabsorbed fixed cost flowing through. We do have higher distribution costs, but we still have raw material cost favorability from the prior year. So, that gross margin costs become much more of a flattish issue in Q4. Some of the additional benefits on total costs, you'll see a modest tailwind on overall costs in Q4 with restructuring benefits and a lack of a headwind on COGS. So, Q3, really it's the carryover of unobserved fixed costs from last year. It's lumpy, it's flowing through, and this is the last big slug. But unfortunately, it's large enough to where it offsets any of the restructuring benefits year-on-year in Q3. Q4, we get out from under the biggest pieces of that, and the COGS headwind gets to be pretty flat. Josh Spector : Got it. Thank you. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent, your line is now open. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. Andrew, maybe I'll just follow up on that. On the foreign exchange impact on the back half of the year, if I read this right, Q3 has a revenue hit from foreign exchange, but there's a tailwind to EBITDA, and then Q4 also has a hit on the revenue line, but it seems to be neutral on EBITDA. Can you just update us on how that flow through works, or is there something sort of specific to the second half and some of the issues that you mentioned in terms of timing of raw and inventory flow through that's maybe impacting this as well? Andrew Sandifer : Yeah, thanks, Vincent. No, it's really more of an issue in SG&A and RD, quite honestly, the currencies that are just the most in play in those quarters. And it's a basket of currencies, but in Q4 in particular, it's the REI. And while we have a revenue headwind, it's an SG&A benefit. So, net-net, we end up with a - it's a minor tailwind to EBITDA in the fourth quarter, but we wanted to highlight that because it might not - given that it's a modest, low-single-digit FX headwind at revenue, we didn't want to mis-signal people that it would actually go the other way in Q4. Q3, you see more alignment where you have the revenue and EBITDA headwinds, both minor, low-single-digit revenue for FX. So that's really the difference in Q4. Its which currencies are hitting and the fact that there are benefits in SG&A from those currency changes that offset what happens at revenue. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital. Your line is now open. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks for taking my question. Good to speak with you guys, and good to hear you again, Pierre. So, I guess my question is really around some of the learnings that you've unearthed and maybe some of the topics you've touched on earlier as far as due diligence. Were there any personnel changes other than yourself, and do you think that's necessary? And then maybe you can also highlight the go-to-market strategy in some of these areas. I mean, obviously, the credit issues were a factor in South America last year that potentially exacerbated some of the destocking that you've seen. Yeah, maybe you can address those issues. Thanks. Pierre Brondeau : Sure. In terms of personnel issues, I think the team is in place. We're well-organized. We do due diligence. I think what I've been looking deep into is the forecasting process, selling process, and execution. I think it's pretty clear that we've missed quite a few quarters where we've missed our own selling target, and I think that's a place where we need to be highly vigilant. And Ronaldo and myself, we're looking deep into that. And I can tell you that I've spent a long, long time with each of the four regional presidents to validate the forecast for Q3 and Q4. Another topic where I see change, I would like is regarding Diamides. I think Diamides franchise is good. I think we have very interesting solo and mutual formulation. We need a more aggressive Diamides global and regional marketing strategy. We also need to accelerate new product invention for Diamides. So that is also a place where I'm going to be looking into very carefully, and we have started to do some work. I'd say point number three, I am, of course, pleased with the results of the restructuring program. I still believe we are operating at a cost which is too high. The corporation is back to sales number of 2018-2019, but we have a cost structure which is more of a 2022 cost structure, 2023 cost structure. So, no need to implement a new restructuring program, but I can tell you there is attrition, which if it's used strategically, can truly lower your cost of operation and very quickly at no cost. So that's going to be a part we are looking into right now to lower our cost. Maybe last, I'm quite pleased with the R&D organization, I would put, but I still want to have maybe a stronger coordination between the work which is done in the regions and at the global level to have an even more efficient R&D organization. So, some of the places where I'm focusing my attention right now, the strategy of the company is in place, is solid. I'm not planning major change, but execution and short-term marketing strategy is important. I don't know, Andrew, you want to address the question on Brazil? Andrew Sandifer : Yeah, look, Arun, I'd say simply this. Certainly, the availability of credit to our customers did impact perhaps some buying last year, but I would emphasize the quality of credit in our own receivables is very high. Our past dues are down. Our collections have been ahead of our own internal forecast. So, while that availability of credit may be a rate-limiting step on purchases, particularly last year when there was such the heat of the correction, we don't believe that that's either a risk to our revenue or a risk to our balance sheet at this point. Arun Viswanathan : Great, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Your line is now open. Frank Mitsch : Yes, good morning, and yes Pierre, good to hear from you again. And I really appreciate the answer to the first question, given that there was some sense perhaps that the 4Q guide was more on the aspirational side, and clearly you don't believe that to be the case. You indicated that one of the things that gives you confidence is that in Brazil, a third of the order book is already booked as opposed to last year where it was zero. I'm curious as to what that typically is, because obviously last year was an anomaly. So, what is more normal? So, we have a kind of a benchmark there. And then also, obviously on the cost side, you're doing a lot of work, and I noticed SG&A was particularly light in the second quarter. If you could give us some color as to your expectations on the SG&A side as we progress through the year and into 2025? Thank you. Pierre Brondeau : Sure, thanks, Frank. The first one - Andrew Sandifer : The normal pace. Pierre Brondeau : Oh, yeah, normal pace. Yes, sorry. Yeah, we have about 30, probably 35% of orders. Last year was zero. I would say that in period of high demand, when your markets are growing at a strong pace, a 45% up to 50% of orders in hand would be a normal ratio you could expect. I'm talking when you have a very healthy market with low inventories in the channel. I think the numbers you've seen are not much different from what we said in the script. I think we're increasing north of $75 million, the target, with the last part coming from SG&A. I do believe that we're going to reach the $150 million by the end of 2025 in run rate, in overall cost saving, with a significant part coming from SG&A. But once again, I want to emphasize, as much as $150 million, whether it's on the COGS side or the S&R side, is a good number. We're going to need to do better. We're going to need to do better. We're going to need to operate at a lower cost. And we have in place a strategy program around attrition, because that's an opportunity for us. We have tools which allow us to work differently, and I think we have to use them. Frank Mitsch : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Richard Garchitorena from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Richard Garchitorena : Great, thanks. And welcome back, Pierre. My question basically is a bigger picture in terms of, Pierre, you're coming back to the industry and looking at where the industry has gone. You know, we saw peak earnings in 2022. Obviously, you've done some restructuring and some divestitures. I was just wondering what your thoughts are in terms of where we are in the cycle, given where crop prices have been moving weaker through 2024. And then I know you gave some high-level comments around 2025, but I'm just curious in terms of when you think we see an inflection point in terms of pricing getting better. And do you really think we are at the trough here in the second half of 2024? Thank you. Pierre Brondeau : Yeah, I think we've, you know, the cycle, we've seen them, we've seen them before. There is always the seven, eight years of growth, followed by a one to two year down cycle. Every indication we had, and we try to be very scientific and maybe more than usual in analyzing the market, we believe we reached the bottom in Q2 2024. That being said, we do not see getting back to a more normal business activity and a more normal channel until the first quarter of 2025 for LATAM, Europe, and North America. I think for Asia and mostly driven by India we're going to have to wait well into 2025 to have more normal activity. I believe by the end of 2025 we are off the downturn. Mostly, mostly, the recovery is going to be mostly driven by non-Asia regions in the first quarter of 2025. Operator : Thank you. We have our next question, comes from Edlain Rodriguez from Mizuho. Your line is now open. Edlain Rodriguez : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Pierre, so one quick question. I mean, I think in terms of pricing, I think you mentioned in the opening remark about like the strategic intent to lower prices to regain the less differentiated products. That was a key driver of the lower prices. The question that I have is, why the shift in strategy there? And also, how is that going to improve margins? I mean, are you chasing volume at the expense of profitability? If you could address that a little bit, please. Pierre Brondeau : Absolutely. I think we acknowledge that we were aggressive on pricing to recover raw material cost increase. This period of inflation in cost is now mostly behind us. But we intentionally kept prices at a very high level across the board because we saw a market where demand was poor. There was no real demand. So, fighting with price in time when there is no demand, we felt was not the smartest thing. But we also have to face that now we have more than recovered cost through the period of raw material inflation. And we do have a tool to take back position we should have and get back to market share we had in places where we've been artificially keeping price high even if there was no differentiation. So, it is not a change of strategy. We're not going to become a company which is going to be chasing volume at any cost. I think we used Q2 to reposition our prices in order for us to be able to grow and benefit from the growth of the market. But this is it. You will not see us continuing this in Q3 or Q4. But I have the feeling that we needed that repositioning of our pricing after quarters of aggressive price increase. But absolutely no change in the strategy. No chasing of volume at any cost and we\u2019re not going to pay less attention to the margins of the gross margin or EBITDA margin of the company. Edlain Rodriguez : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Benjamin Theurer from Barclays. Benjamin your line is now open. Benjamin Theurer : Good morning and thanks for squeezing me in at the end. I just wanted to follow up real-quick on some of the promotional activity that you've mentioned what\u2019s happening in India and how that's impacting. Anything you can share on how consumers or farmers are reacting to that and if there's any risk of overstock in the future given those discounts that you're putting in? Thank you very much. Pierre Brondeau : If I understand well the question, you're asking about the one-time incentive we gave to our customers and in Brazil to some extent in North America. We're holding high-cost products and those products were stocked in the channel. We needed to see those products move through the channel to go to the end customers. And we had discussion with them. They needed help. We helped them and that allowed us to free space with a product going on the ground and moving through the channel. So, it was very clear with them. It's a one-time incentive which is done toward the end of a down cycle. Customers need help. We were there for them. It helped us too for the following of the year and it's cleaning up the channel. I think everybody's clear on the market on why we do it. I don't think there is any risk of channel stocking because our prices right now are where they should be and are not lower than what the market is commending. Benjamin Theurer : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the FMC Corporation conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Curt Brooks, Director of Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Please go ahead. Curt Brooks : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's Third Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Pierre Brondeau, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Ronaldo Pereira, President. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our earnings release and today's slide presentation are available on our website, and the prepared remarks and today's discussion will be made available after the call. Let me remind you that today's presentation and discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including, but not limited to, those factors identified in our earnings release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's understanding. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion and the supporting materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations, free cash flow and organic revenue growth, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that as used in today's discussion, earnings means adjusted earnings and EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Pierre. Pierre Brondeau : Thank you, Curt, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into the details of the third quarter and the forward guidance, I want to start by giving an overview of the company's performance and our view of the current market conditions. Overall, we reported a strong third quarter with growth at the top and bottom line. The quarter unfolded mostly as expected in Europe and Asia. However, we operated in a weaker-than-expected market landscape in Latin America, which was offset by a stronger-than-anticipated performance in North America. Latin America faced some unanticipated challenges this quarter, but we still delivered growth. Markets in Brazil and Argentina were more challenging than expected due to the delayed rains and increased borrowing rates. The bankruptcy of a large customer in Brazil added specific challenges for FMC. Given that we believe we are only a couple of quarters away from a more normal market situation, we decided to take pricing actions to maintain our market position. In fact, about 2/3 of the total company price decline in the quarter came from Brazil and Argentina. The rest of the region performed at or above expectations. While conditions are improving, it is clear that Latin America has not yet emerged from the down cycle as distributors and growers continue to manage their inventories carefully. On the other hand, North America performance was stronger than expected. More than half of the regional sales growth was due to increased order by diamide partners. I would add a note of clarification here. While the sales to these partners are recognized in North America, the final product is not always sold by the partner in that region. This creates the potential for North America sales to appear higher at the expense of other regions. The North America region also benefited from distributors shifting purchases from Q4 into Q3 in response to lower-than-expected inventory levels in the channel. On the product line front, sales appear 1 of our 2 diamide products reported growth in every region and was the fastest-growing molecule with 58% higher sales than the prior year. Strong branded sales appear sales and increased orders from the partners led to the diamides outperforming the overall portfolio. As we mentioned on the Q2 earnings call, the performance of new products is critical to a second half growth expectation. These products include new formulations of diamides as well as 2 of the 4 new -- of the 4 brand new active ingredients we highlighted during our Q2 earnings call. Fluindapyr based from fungicide and herbicide containing Isoflex active are already receiving strong interest and demonstrating their growth potential. We expect combined sales of fluindapyr and Isoflex based products to reach over $100 million in sales in the second half of the year. The launch of fluindapyr especially important as fungicides are product category in which FMC has historically been underway. These products are opening up new markets for FMC. As I mentioned earlier, we saw more challenging markets than expected in Latin America, especially Brazil and Argentina. With expected channel inventory improvement on the horizon, we made the conscious decision to protect our market share in those countries even if it created price pressure beyond what was forecasted. This strategy is validated by North America, where price pressure was the lowest this quarter as its channel normalized. Looking ahead, our view on the time line of channel inventory recoveries is relatively unchanged from what we communicated during our August earnings call. The U.S. and most countries in Europe are normalizing the fastest and Latin America is expected to be much improved in the second quarter of 2025. Asia markets are still expected to be challenging in 2025, with no recovery expected until 2026 as India continues to work through excess channel inventory. On a cost basis, we are accelerating the delivery of savings and increasing our targets. We are now targeting cost benefits from restructuring of $125 million to $150 million to be reflected in the P&L in 2024 with greater than $225 million of gross run rate in 2025. To accomplish this, we're accelerating restructuring, taking new critical initiatives to realign our manufacturing footprint and using attrition as a key tool to drive further savings. We are confirming our full year guidance adjusted for the sale of the Global Specialty Solutions business, which we are now expecting to be sold in early November. This translates to fourth quarter sales growth of 19% at the guidance midpoint. Despite continued channel inventory issues in India and less than optimal early season conditions in Brazil and Argentina, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our guidance based on the strength of our new products as well as cost benefits from restructuring actions while market conditions improve. With that, let's review the company's third quarter performance in more detail. Slide 3 through 5 provide an overview of our third quarter results. Sales growth of 9% was above the midpoint of our guidance range with organic sales growth of 12%. Volume grew by 17% led by Brazil and the U.S. In addition, sales to diamide partners grew strongly in North America. Pricing was lower by 5% with approximately 2/3 of the decline attributed to Brazil and Argentina due to the challenging conditions I mentioned earlier. On a regional basis, North America sales increased 48% because of strong volume growth. Insecticides delivered significantly higher sales due to increased order from diamide products and gains in branded [indiscernible] products. Latin America sales grew 8% with 15% growth, excluding currency. Sales were higher across all product categories due to volume growth versus the prior year period, mainly in Brazil more than offset lower pricing and FX headwinds. New products were a key factor to growth, most notably from the fluindapyr based Sura fungicide now commercialized in Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay. We also saw increases in the new diamide formulation [indiscernible] Argentina, and the sulfentrazone based herbicide borough fuel in Brazil. The robust sales of new products in a challenging market environment reflects the strength of FMC's R&D pipeline. In Asia, the 10% sales decline was mostly due to lower sales in India. Destocking in [indiscernible] channel is making good progress aided by favorable weather. Finally, in NEA sales declined 7%, driven by lower volume from expected registration losses. Branded diamides showed very strong growth, especially Exirel in Germany. Excessive wet weather in Central Europe acted as a moderate headwind, especially in herbicides. Turning to Slide 5. Adjusted EBITDA grew 15% year-over-year, above the high end of GaNS range. Increased sales volume, FX tailwinds and above target cost savings from restructuring more than offset lower pricing and unabsorbed fixed cost from prior periods. Slide 6 provides an update on these restructuring actions. We are pleased to report continued solid progress on this front. As I stated in my opening, we now expect cost savings of $125 million to $150 million delivered to the P&L in 2024 with gross run rate savings greater than $225 million in 2025. Earlier this year, we announced our agreement with NGO to divest a Global Specialty Solutions business for $350 million. We expect this deal to close in early November. As such, we are confirming a full year guidance less the foregone revenue and earnings from this business after the sale closes. This equates to an impact of $20 million in revenue and $10 million in EBITDA. This adjustment for GSS has been made to the full year outlook on Slide 7. Other than this adjustment, the outlook for the full year remains unchanged. We expect revenue to decline 2% as volume growth is more than offset by lower price and FX headwinds. EBITDA is expected to be lower by 8% and growth in the last 9 months of the year is not expected to fully offset the lower results from the first quarter. EPS is guided to be lower by 12% at the midpoint from lower EBITDA. Slide 8 provides our expectations for the fourth quarter, which has been revised from the prior guidance to adjust for the GSS sale and the over delivery in Q3. At the midpoint, we expect revenue growth of 19% driven by higher volume in all regions. Price is expected to be a mid-single-digit headwind as challenging market conditions persist mostly in Asia and Latin America. FX is expected to be a low single-digit headwind. New products are expected to be a key contributor to growth, including new formulations of diamides across the region such as [indiscernible] in Argentina. Fungicides, such as [indiscernible] the U.S. And [indiscernible] in Brazil, the herbicide based on Isoflex active. New product sales are expected to contribute about half of the sales growth of Q4. They are key to overall growth as they were in the Q3 performance despite suboptimal market conditions. EBITDA in the quarter is expected to grow by 32% at the midpoint due mainly to higher sales as volume more than offset lower price and FX headwinds. The unabsorbed fixed cost and sell-through of higher cost inventory that acted as COGS headwinds for most of the year are expected to have a much smaller impact in Q4 and will be more than offset by lower raw materials and restructuring benefits. EPS is expected to grow by 54% at the midpoint mainly from higher earnings. I will now hand the call over to Andrew to cover some financial items, including cash performance and outlook. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks, Pierre. I'll start this morning with a review of some key income statement items. FX was a 3% headwind to revenue growth in the third quarter, largely stemming from the Brazilian real. For the remainder of 2024, we anticipate continued low single-digit FX headwinds in revenue, again, driven primarily by the Brazilian real. Interest expense for the third quarter was $58.7 million, down nearly $6 million compared to the prior year period, driven by lower debt balances. For full year 2025, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the range of $235 million to $240 million, essentially flat year-on-year at the midpoint with the impact of higher rates on domestic debt offset by lower overall borrowings. We've lowered our outlook for effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for full year 2024 to a range of 13% to 15%, reflecting improved clarity on the impacts of recent tax law changes on FMC's 2024 tax rate. In light of this, our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 11.8%, bringing our year-to-date accrual for income taxes in line with the 14% midpoint of this range. Moving next to the balance sheet and leverage. Gross debt at September 30 was approximately $4.1 billion, down $110 million from the prior quarter. Cash on hand decreased $55 million to $417 million, resulting in net debt of approximately $3.7 billion. Gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 5.0x at quarter end, while net debt to EBITDA was 4.5x. Relative to our covenant, which measures leverage with a number of adjustments to both the numerator and denominator, leverage was 5.0x as compared to a covenant of 6.0x. As a reminder, our covenant leverage limit will step down to 5.0x at December 31, 2024. We expect covenant leverage to be approximately 4x by year-end, reflecting both year-on-year EBITDA growth in the second half as well as the receipt of proceeds from the sale of our Global Specialty Solutions business, which, as Pierre noted earlier, is expected to close in early November. We remain committed to returning our leverage to levels consistent with our targeted BBB/BAA2 long-term credit ratings. We will do this through EBITDA growth and disciplined cash management with all discretionary free cash flow directed towards debt reduction until we return to our targeted metrics. Moving on to free cash flow on Slide 9. Free cash flow in the third quarter was $132 million, an improvement of $100 million versus the prior year period. Improved cash from operations and lower capital additions more than offset somewhat higher legacy and transformation spending, resulting from our ongoing restructuring program. Year-to-date free cash flow of $225 million is an increase of over $1 billion compared to the prior year period. Cash provided by improved accounts payable and inventory more than offset increased cash used by receivables, lower EBITDA and restructuring spending. We continue to expect free cash flow of $400 million to $500 million for full year 2024, driven by significant cash release from rebuilding accounts payable and reducing inventory, partially offset by higher accounts receivable due to revenue growth in the second half of the year. I'll now hand the call back over to Pierre for some closing comments. Pierre Brondeau : Thank you, Andrew. The crop protection industry is in the process of recovering although at different paces depending upon the region. In this context, we delivered on our Q3 targets and a highly positive momentum heading into Q4. The growth embedded in the guidance we put forward for the fourth quarter is sizable, but it is centered largely around sales of new products and improved cost, both of which are real under our control. This should pave the way into 2025, where we continue to expect solid earnings growth driven by cost favorability along with moderate top line growth as demand continues to recover. Before we open up for Q&A, I want to provide a brief look forward to our earnings call and 2 key areas will cover. I mentioned on our August call that we are introducing 4 new active ingredients and developing a post pattern defense strategy for diamides. On our next call, we will focus on these 2 pillars of growth and how they will contribute to the new 3-year target, which will demonstrate the strong revenue and earnings growth potential for the company. With that, we are now ready to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Joel Jackson : Here, Andrew, you were very gracious a few months ago to give some building blocks for what the bridge for '25 look like. I was hoping if maybe you could give an update on that. So I think you talked about targeting 6% revenue growth next year, which would be volume growth with maybe some price contraction on flattish pricing. Talked about $150 million to $200 million of cost favorability, talked about $35 million of lower EBITDA, of course, from the sale of GSS. Are you able to update those numbers or reiterate today? Pierre Brondeau : Thank you, Joel. Yes, we pretty much have the same \u2013 same view for 2025. But let me maybe give you some more detail around the latest thoughts. So yes, we are \u2013 we believe in a growth of around 6%, 6% range next year. This being said, when we say 6%, we made no assumption on pricing, which was pretty much pricing flat and didn\u2019t make any assumption on FX. At this stage, could we be facing more challenging pricing, possible. But frankly, we do not know yet. We have not been able to go deeper into those considerations. On the other hand, on the positive front, I think with the progress we have made on the cost front, we are heading more to the higher end of the range we gave at the last earnings call, so closer to the $200 million than the lower end. So still 6% range, undefined pricing situation at this stage, we are not able to make assumptions. We need to see how Q4 is going to be unfolding and maybe stronger savings than we were expecting and toward the higher end of the range. Operator : The next question is from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Aleksey Yefremov : Pierre, I mean, you stated that Latin America was worse than expected in Q3. Is it getting any better in the fourth quarter? And also, if you could just describe why Q3 was worse specifically, was it more weather issues? Was the drought in Brazil? Or was it just fundamentally the market is weak due to low crop prices? Pierre Brondeau : Yes. I think Q3 was a bit more difficult than we were expecting for multiple reasons. First of all, I think that the weather did not help at the beginning of the quarter with delayed rain. Rain came in, and it\u2019s actually right now in a pretty good situation, but in Q3 and beginning of the quarter, it was delayed. I think overall, the pricing situation remains challenging. The region is still with a \u2013 channel inventory situation, which is a couple of quarters before going to normal. I also think that it was a bit more difficult for FMC than some of the competitors for multiple reasons. Versus where I was when I gave the first call, just a couple of months coming back. I\u2019m more and more convinced that FMC was later than some of the other competitors in adjusting pricing. So I believe we\u2019ve lost market share, more toward some of the peers like the Bayer, BSF or Syngenta of this world. There is pressure from generics, but I don\u2019t see a big change versus the past. But the lack of adjusting our pricing is forcing us to keep market share, and we\u2019re making the intentional decision to keep market share, we had to accelerate pricing adjustment. On top of that, we had to do it in the face of losing a very large customer. You know about the bankruptcy of a large distributor. We were highly exposed to that distributor. And we\u2019re clearly not wanted to lose that volume. So we had to go get that volume elsewhere. And there is always a price to pay when you have to go to find two customers, what [indiscernible]. So on in on, the situation was not helping with increased rates, weather, delayed rain, the loss of a large customer for us, and the deliberate decisions we have made to stay where \u2013 to keep our market share position and maybe get back more to all the market share we have pre-downturn than where we are today. Operator : The next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy from VRP. Kevin McCarthy : Pierre, can you elaborate on the forward price trajectory. Maybe you could comment on your experience in diamides versus non-diamides. What is behind the competitive intensity that you alluded to? And what does the path to 0 price look like in your crystal ball as we progress into 2025? Pierre Brondeau : Certainly, yes. I think the pricing situation is -- the way we look at it, we believe that the #1 correlation to pricing is the state of the channel. Certainly, farm income has an impact. But by far, when you are in a shrinking market and all of us -- suppliers of products, trying to retain market share, you create a competitive situation, which has a negative impact on pricing. So that's why we want to stay underground in Latin America because we do believe that pressing the strongest correlation is with the state of the market. And that's why we saw maybe the latest pressure on price in North America while Latin America and Asia were the place where we had the highest pressure. Diamides, there is no more pressure on pricing in diamides, except maybe in places where we are -- in countries where there is not the same consideration for patent protection. And I'm mostly talking about India -- India and in China. In other places, the pricing situation is not worse for diamides than it is for other products, it's even better when the -- in the countries where there is a stronger respect for patent protection. But going back to 0, I think it's going to highly depend upon the recovery of the market. Operator The next question is from the line of Stephen Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Steve Byrne : With respect to your volume gain in North America, can you split that into 3 buckets -- how much of that increase was to your diamide partners? And then for the balance that's targeting the North American market, what fraction do you sell to wholesalers versus retailers that sell directly to growers? Pierre Brondeau : The growth to diamide\u2019s partners, I think is \u2013 as a percentage of diamide growth, it\u2019s going to be more than half of the growth of the diamides. In terms of the selling, I would say 100% of the sales are going toward the wholesalers. Then from this point, it goes into the channel toward the growers. But wholesellers represent our customer base. Operator : The next question is from the line of Laurent Favre with BNP Paribas. Laurent Favre : Generally, my question is around R&D. And I think on the cost reduction plan is about $50 million. I think this year that will come from lower R&D. I was wondering if you could talk about the approach that you're taking there, whether the reduction is temporary or whether you're actually structurally being more selective in the areas where you're investing? Pierre Brondeau : Yes. Thank you. I think it\u2019s more of a sustainable cost savings. We might be sell at some point in the future to increase because of specific reasons. But \u2013 let me talk to you about how and why we are reducing our R&D spending. First of all, just to make sure we\u2019re very clear on this one, there is absolutely no impact on the launch of the four products, new molecules Ronaldo described at the last earnings call. Some of all, a large part of the saving is coming from the discovery part of our process. We have now a process where we are much more strict on the decision to hold in the pipeline in discovery, low probability products. We had a tendency maybe to keep them longer \u2013 and usually, it comes with significant expenses. And we have a process, which allow us to grow faster in making those decisions. We also have developed better screening tools. And I think I wasn\u2019t there, but I think they were presented at the Investor Day, but those are also allowing us to make faster and better decisions in early-stage research. The last point is we\u2019ve changed the governance process for R&D. You know that about \u2013 if you take the spending in R&D, about half goes to central R&D and half spending goes to regional R&D. We are increasing the coordination between the original research center and the Central Research Center, in order to make sure we do not have duplication and we create synergies. So we are just changing the way we work to make those savings not negatively impacting the quality of our innovation pipeline, but at the same time, reducing our cost. Operator : The next question is from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Josh Spector : I wanted to ask a couple of things about volumes. So 3Q came in better than expected. You talked a little bit about pull forward, but your fourth volume guidance is still kind of the same ballpark, mid-20s-ish plus year-on-year growth. So one, what happened there? Is there any increased confidence, I guess, in fourth quarter? And then related to that is with the diamide sell in North America. Is that a headwind we need to worry about next year? Or is that not at the magnitude where that's a risk? Pierre Brondeau : I think regarding sales, we pretty much took our full year forecast we gave in Q2 and removed the sales, which we knew were expected to be delivered in Q4. So we just took the overselling in North America and remove that from a full year target in order to stay at the same level we were initially planning, of course, adding the correction for the GSS business. Regarding diamide in 2025, I must confess that we have not yet done a 2025 precise budget. We are in this process right now. We are going through it. It\u2019s complex because we have to look at all of the branded diamides and the sales with the partners, all of those negotiations are taking place right now. I cannot answer specifically on the year-on-year growth of diamides in \u201825 versus \u201824 at this stage. I almost have one certainty is that sales at here will be doing very well in 2025. It\u2019s a product \u2013 it\u2019s a good product. We have a very, very strong demand. There is very little competition. There is no generic, but the overall diamide, [indiscernible] it\u2019s a bit early for me to comment until we move \u2013 we\u2019re more advanced in terms of a contract with our partners. Operator : The next question is from the line of Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research. Chris Parkinson : Pierre, just thinking about things, I'm not going to ask you to forecast the weather for 2025. But at the same token you know how should we be thinking about the new product introductions in terms of the cadence in the '25 as that relates to the growth rate you've already given as well as your own registration losses. And as just a real quick corollary of that second part, do you view your competitors' registration losses or likely registration losses over the next two years as more of a -- as a potential tailwind for your new products? Pierre Brondeau : Well, I think those are two separate events. We have the registration lots, which are mostly happening in Europe, where we know it's been there for many years. And -- so it's going to be part of the forecast going into next year, and then there is the new products. New products are usually more than cover on a global basis, whatever registration loss we have. The new product also we are introducing next year and especially fluindapyr and Isoflex, those 2 molecules will be a little impacted by the channel situation. Those products are not in the channel. They are new. So pretty much we believe will be required, will be solved. So on balance, 2025 is going to realize the growth is going to rely a lot only product. We do not believe -- it's hard for us to think about taking into account potential whether it's how to do, but that's one of the parts, which will be the most certain part of our forecast will be the new product. Registration loss, we usually know them pretty well in advance, especially for Europe. So we're expecting the balance of the 2 to be a significant positive. The more question we have looking to next year is how fast the channel we recover and the overall growth of the portfolio. As I said, we are not excluding a big bump in H2 2025. We just can't predict it. Overall do you have any comments around new products and the restriction side? Ronaldo Pereira : What I can share is where these products are expected to be sold in 2025. So registrations, Pierre already mentioned, the importance of Europe. That is already embedded in our plans. You asked, Chris about whether or not we benefit from those. The overall market in Europe has been flat despite of the registration. So I think the short answer is yes for the products that remain in the market. There is an increased opportunity because of the lack of options driven by those registration losses across the entire industry, the same way that -- sometimes it hits our products. It also benefits us throughout the quarters. We -- for next year, we expect though in the period to continue to grow, and I think the #1 geography for that product will continue to be LatAm followed by U.S. That means that most of that growth should come in the second half of the year just because of seasonality in LatAm. The U.S. portion of that will come probably between the second and third quarter of 2025 in the U.S. We also expect to launch the first launches in Europe for Isoflex, but that is more on the U.K. side, the broader Europe registration, we expect in a couple of years. So not 2025, but for the near-term future. Operator : The next question is from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Maybe on the fourth quarter, I just want to dig into two things you mentioned before. First, on the incremental cost out that you announced -- how much of that was already achieved in the third quarter? And how much of that can you account on for 4Q? And then at the same time, you referenced 4Q being heavily a function of new product introduction. What's your visibility on those sales are those orders? How much do you already have in hand versus how much are you still waiting to achieve? Pierre Brondeau : Maybe I'll take the savings and Ronaldo you take the orders in hand. I'm going to do -- all right, I'm going to do a high-level math under the control of my CFO here, so you correct me, Andrew, if I'm not -- if I'm not correct. So off the top of my head, we said $50 million of savings in H2. So think about it that way roughly will be to Q3 by $20 million EBITDA $10 million came from sales, which were higher than expected. And we also faced about a $20 million price decline. That leaves you -- lead to about a $30 million savings. So your $20 million bid is plus sales 10, plus 30 in savings, minus 20 in price. So which means that for the remainder of the year for Q4, we're expecting about $20 million. So the $30 million in Q3, $20 million in Q4 is about the break that we see for the overall $50 million additional savings. Andrew is not reacting, so it must about right? Andrew Sandifer : It\u2019s about right here. So as for the orders, we track that more closely in Brazil, as you know, the other countries, we tend to get the orders and start shipping right away. And Brazil, today, we have about 40% of the orders that we forecast for the quarter. This is better than we had last year, and it\u2019s lower than we had in the best years in the region. So it\u2019s more or less in between, which is in line with our view that, that market is still recovering. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeff Zekauskas : We think that prices -- or it may be the case that prices of technical grade, CTPR active ingredient in your diamides in China have fallen from maybe I don't know, $350,000 a ton to $30,000 a ton over the past 2 years, and it may be that new product registrations have, I don't know, tripled or quadrupled over that time. What do you see -- if you think that's true, what do you see as the analytical significance of CTPR prices coming down so sharply in China. And if you can remind us, how big is your diamide business in China roughly, and what's happening to it in terms of prices and volumes? Pierre Brondeau : I'll let Ronaldo helping with that question around the pricing. The size of the China market for us in terms of diamides is more. It is not a major, major market for us, but Ronaldo around the pricing, you want to make your comments. Ronaldo Pereira : We have seen different references for pricing. Way more references that we have seen products flowing around the world. So it's still unclear in terms of capacity and how much of that -- those prices are real or not. What we have seen is in the two markets that they are commercializing China and India, as you pointed out, the prices have come down. I'll just make a correction for the price that I mentioned. It's for the kilo of technical product, not for the ton of technical products. We do believe, though, that some of the prices that we have seen in reference are lower than the production cost of even the low-quality providers, which would suggest more of a dumping of existing inventories in the market. We calculate how low it can be and some of those products are being offered, not necessarily sold but offered at costs that are lower -- prices that are lower than the production cost. So I think that gives you a sense of how we think about this going forward. We do not believe those are the stable prices of the diamide. Pierre Brondeau : I think I want to -- and I hate to do that. But -- we are truly doing a deep dive in our diamide strategy. We intend to be very open at our February call on what future we see for diamide. We're actually pretty optimistic, but we're going to have to explain how we see a way to expand this market. I am not right now too much concerned by the kind of pricing we see in India or China. As Ronaldo said, a lot of inventory was built which could not be sold because we want multiple litigation in other countries, creating very, very high inventory people had to get rid of at price, which seem to be incredibly low versus even a low manufacturing cost. As part of the diamide strategy, we do have a -- we are working on a very aggressive manufacturing cost road map, allowing us to compete in a different way. So all of that is being put in place right now. We do have time because besides China and India, we do not have to worry about this kind of pricing, which do not seem to be sustainable and be the pricing will be facing when we are off patent in the future -- in the regions where we are competing. So hand to that to you. I think it's a very valid question, but I want to come with a more complete and [indiscernible] call. Jeff Zekauskas : Well, if I could follow up, just in terms of descriptively what's happening to your business -- in Asia, what's happening to your diamide volumes and prices quantitatively, roughly? Pierre Brondeau : So right now, what is happening to a market \u2013 to a diamide market right now, okay? And it\u2019s difficult because we are combining a situation where we have 2 countries which are accepting illegal sales of products below production cost in the middle of the downturn. So it\u2019s not a very normal situation. But today, overall, diamide are growing, driven by very strong demand of sales at the -- I think when we talk diamides, we have to separate [indiscernible] is growing very fast. Rynaxypyr is \u2013 because \u2013 and mostly because of Asia has a negative growth in the low single digits globally, driven by Asia. So I think about it overall, growing positively. But at the same time, I think our overall market for diamides global is up 10%. It\u2019s driven by sales [indiscernible] being up in the 50% to 60% and Rynaxypyr down mid-single digits driven by Asia. That\u2019s what is happening today to the overall diamide portfolio. This answers your question. Operator : The next question is from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Laurence Alexander : Could you just characterize how your production capacity is positioned for the signals you're getting from the distribution channel. That is, do you have any product areas where capacity is down and you won't be able to ramp up fast enough to meet what distributors are saying they may need this winter? Or do you think you're appropriately positioned to get the full operating benefit and the leverage that would come with a restock cycle? Pierre Brondeau : No, I think we\u2019re good. We do have capacity that being said. We are much more I would say, manufacturing is much busier than it was a year ago. Most of the lines are actually operating, but we do have capacity to face the demand to come and the increase we are facing. So we\u2019re not concerned about capacity. From a raw material supply, we are also in a good shape. We are securing the product we need. As we said before, it\u2019s going to be a tailwind going into next year. But this is not a concern at this stage. Operator : The final question comes from Patrick Cunningham with Citigroup. Patrick Cunningham : And just on the pricing challenges in Latin America, how should we think about additional incremental incentives to gain or maintain share in the fourth quarter and perhaps any into 2025? Pierre Brondeau : Yes. So the forecast we've made for this -- the fourth quarter includes a mid-single-digit price decrease year-on-year for the fourth quarter. We still believe we are in a challenging situation. We still believe there are going to be price pressure. I would say until the end of the second quarter of the season, which is the end of the first quarter in 2025. I believe the pricing pressure is going to start to relieve significantly when we -- as we move into 2025. As we say, the pricing is linked to how competitive the situation is versus the market. Plus, as I said before, it is very much also an FMC situation where we decided to reposition a market share where it was pre-downturn, and we had to do what we had to do to get to this position. So Ronaldo, maybe you want to comment on anything else specific on pricing in Latin America? Ronaldo Pereira : Particularly in Brazil and Argentina. What I can share is there are some products that we have been very stable in terms of market share traditionally. I can talk about sulfentrazone and sugarcane, [indiscernible] and cotton. Those are products that are very traditional products from FMC. And those are the products that we priced at a point that we allowed growers to make a decision on replacement. And we are now fighting back for share -- getting back to the share that we had before the downturn on those products. So there specifics -- that our pricing actions are specific to some products. They are primarily very traditional products in our portfolio. And it takes us back, those actions take us back to the share that we used it to hold before the downturn of the industry. Pierre Brondeau : And I will just add something I\u2019ve already said and it\u2019s been \u2013 because there has been many comments, generics are not the drivers of what we do. Generic pressure is here. It\u2019s always here, but there is nothing which has fundamentally changed the last couple of quarters versus where it was before. It is truly positioning of pricing against our peers, competitors also technology-based where we think we\u2019ve lost ground from a volume standpoint because of a more aggressive pricing strategy, we need to reset. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the FMC Corporation conference call. Thank you all for attending, and you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] And I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Curt Brooks, Director of Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Please go ahead. Curt Brooks : Thanks. Good afternoon, and welcome to FMC Corporation's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Pierre Brondeau, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Ronaldo Pereira, President. Pierre will review our fourth quarter performance, provide an outlook for first quarter and full year 2025 performance, and share our 2027 financial targets. Andrew will provide an overview of select financial results, followed by a strategy update from Ronaldo. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our earnings release and today's slide presentation are available on our website and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call. Let me remind you that today's presentation and discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including but not limited to those factors identified in our earnings release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's understanding. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. Today's discussion and the supporting materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, and organic revenue growth, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that as used in today's discussion, earnings means adjusted earnings and EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Pierre. Pierre Brondeau : Thank you, Curt, and good afternoon, everyone. When I returned as CEO, we started the process to improve the market visibility and deliver a more predictable performance for FMC. Equally important, we also focused the organization on defining and implementing a diamized growth strategy and accelerating the introductions of fluindapyr and Isoflex active, all while increasing our cost-cutting targets. We are making good headways here and delivered two strong quarters with earnings above our guidance. The work we have done has also led to a new way of thinking about the portfolio with products being considered as either part of our core portfolio or growth portfolio. Framing the products, as you can see on slide three, in this way, we'll shape a lot our commentary on today's call. Our efforts to improve market visibility and deliver more predictable performance have progressed. However, after eight months in a row, I have modified my view of what needs to be done for FMC to fully benefit from the market upturn when it happens and the quality of the portfolio. The company needs a stronger reset than what I thought initially. We learned a lot in the fourth quarter and it has become clear that we need to take more aggressive actions to reposition FMC. Above all, we need to significantly lower FMC inventory in the channel much beyond what we were expecting. We also need to give a higher priority to the implementation of a newly developed strategy for Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr, including accelerating the implementation of the manufacturing cost-reduction efforts. These actions will have pronounced negative impact on 2025 performance -- financial performance beyond what we anticipated. Additionally, we will need to provide additional resources to strengthen the commercial development of new active ingredients or AIs, which is critical to 2025 revenue and beyond. It also became clear to us that beyond inventory level, we missed the impact of an evolving distribution channel in LATAM, which will require us to invest to expand a sales organization to explore new routes to market in that region. We will go into more detail on this topic later in the presentation. 2025 is a pivotal year. Let me give some more details about the actions we are undertaking. It is highly feasible to have all of this in place in the next few months. We will greatly benefit from these actions starting in 2026, but it will penalize our short-term financial performance. First, we are committed to decreasing the level of FMC products in the channel. We will make certain that our products move from the channel to the ground faster than our sales to the channel. This will be a high priority for the company. Critically, this means the volume growth we are forecasting will be heavily driven by new routes to market, and new products where channel inventory is not an issue. Second, this quarter we are completing the first phase of significant manufacturing cost-reduction of Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr. These cost reductions are critical to delivering a future growth plan. But as I mentioned earlier, it will create some year-on-year negative comparison in revenue in 2025. It is important to remember that Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr sales have two critical components, which are managed separately. They are branded diamide products that are sold directly to the market by FMC. In 2024, this was about 75% of diamide sales. Then there are partner sales, which are solo molecules sold to competitors. A number of the most significant contracts are based on cost-plus pricing. A significant manufacturing cost decrease will impact the sales value to our partners as product prices will decrease with manufacturing cost reductions. In 2025, we expect branded Cyazypyr sales sales to continue to grow. However, we are forecasting overall Rynaxypyr sales to be down as a key partner sales are impacted by a -- our cost-plus contracts and as we position our branded product lines for a new market strategy. In addition, we continue to see generic versions of Rynaxypyr sold in India and China as well as generic offering now in countries such as Argentina, Turkiye, Mexico, Pakistan, and Peru. The presence of this generic is not unexpected, but negatively impacts price and initially some volume. Third, we are preparing our diamide product lines for the next phase of their evolution. We view FMC's product as two parts : a core portfolio and a growth portfolio. The core portfolio includes products for which the base molecules used to develop new formulations are already or about to be without patent data protection. The growth portfolio, by contrast includes product, for which the base molecules are data or IP protected. Cyazypyr, the four new active ingredients, fluindapyr, Isoflex, Dodhylex, and rimisoxafen and plant health portfolio constitute a growth portfolio. Rynaxypyr is a part of the core portfolio along with the rates of our legacy products. As we'll explain later, the market for Rynaxypyr will transform in the next few years, expanding to new markets and offering strong growth opportunities. The other diamide product, Cyazypyr is a differentiated product with longer patent and data protection, stronger performance, and a more complex manufacturing process. Cyazypyr also offers opportunities to develop higher-performing formulation. Today, no generic companies are selling this molecule in any major market. Fourth, as we have delivered savings well beyond the restructuring target, we are investing in the expansion of the sales organization to support the growth of our new active ingredients and to begin to develop new routes to market we have not explored, especially in LATAM and EMEA. As we'll discuss further in a moment, LATAM Q4 sales were disappointing. In addition to the channel inventory situation, we believe a shifting market structure is also impacting sales. The distribution channel in Brazil has gone through a strong wave of consolidation. Territories that were well-covered and served are not performing as well anymore. This is one of the reasons we have decided to explore new routes to market, including a more direct approach to large growers. That will require increased investments, which will be reflecting in our selling cost this year. This is a critical part of our strategy as it generates growth without impacting our efforts to lower FMC channel inventory. With these four steps in place, we believe we are well-positioned for growth in 2026 and 2027. And we have strong confidence in our products. FMC, like all technology-based ag companies, has an evolving product portfolio. Our strategy is to drive commercialization of innovative growth platforms while maximizing the value of our order of patent core product through formulations and nature. We view our core and growth portfolio as well-balanced with a core portfolio able to grow at or slightly above the market, while the growth portfolio is expected to grow significantly above market. Sales in the core portfolio will be driven by market demand, new formulation developments, and new routes to market. As you will hear later, Rynaxypyr has high single-digit growth potential after the planned 2025 correction with the market growing exponentially. In the growth portfolio, the four new AIs have excellent sales potential. The market introduction of the first two molecules fluindapyr and Isoflex is progressing as planned with sales approaching $130 million in 2024. The other two molecules, Dodhylex, and rimisoxafen have at least an equivalent peak sales potential, but have later introduction dates. In addition and most importantly, all four of these new products allow us to penetrate large market we don't participate in today. The combined sales of these four molecules at maturity is expected to be substantially larger than the total diamides portfolio today and potentially beyond the $2 billion we previously announced as we find more applications for these products. Regarding plant health, we expect the platform to grow at an annual rate in the mid-20% range out to 2027 with growth rate potentially exceeding that in later years as pheromones scale up. The actions we take in 2025 will allow our portfolio to deliver substantial growth in 2026 and 2027. I want to shift now and provide more details on our fourth quarter, which are detailed in slides four through six. Q4 revenue of $1.22 billion were below our guidance range. Revenue grew 7% versus 2023 and 9% excluding sales from the divestiture of the Global Specialty Solutions or GSS business in November 2024. The sales increase was heavily attributed to volume gains in our growth portfolio. Sale of these products accounted for over 75% of the growth. That includes sales at year and new AIs, as well as the Plant Health business, which grew 33%, mainly from Biological. Lower pricing of 3% was slightly better than we expected, but an FX headwind of 5% was higher than the low-single-digit we had forecasted. LATAM sales were the most disappointing as high competition led to prices, and terms that we were unwilling to meet, which in addition to credit risks led us to pass on some sales. As we were confident that we would meet our EBITDA and EPS targets, we have the flexibility to walk away from unattractive sales opportunities. Additionally, we saw lower-than-expected demand across most regions as customers lowered the amount of inventory they are willing to hold versus historical level. While we did anticipate customers would hold less inventory in an environment of higher interest rate, lower commodity prices, and the perception of secure supply, we were not expecting behavior to change to such a degree. Given the above assumptions and the current high levels of FMC product in the channel, we now believe we have elevated channel inventories in some countries in LATAM, including Brazil, Asia, including India, as well as Canada and Eastern Europe. We reported fourth quarter EBITDA of $339 million, which was 33% higher than last year and $3 million higher than our guidance mid-point. Lower pricing and FX headwinds were more than offset by higher volumes as well as favorable costs, including continued contribution from a restructuring program. Input costs were favorable due to lower raw material cost with much lower unabsorbed fixed cost than we recorded in previous quarters. The reduced cost coupled with sales growth led to a strong EBITDA margin of 27.7%, an all-time Q4 high. Slide 7 shows the return of full-year 20 -- the results of full-year 2024. Sales declined 5% as higher volume, mainly in the second half of the year was more than offset by lower pricing and FX headwinds. Although EBITDA declined 8%, we posted EBITDA margin of 21%, which was only a slight decline versus prior year despite the drop in sales. Part of this was due to the strong cost including $165 million of cost benefits from our restructuring actions. Looking at 2025, we can see our full year expectations on slide eight. We are expecting full-year sales of $4.15 billion to $4.35 billion, which is flat to prior year at the midpoint and up 3% excluding approximately $110 million of lost sales from the GSS sale. We are forecasting moderate gains in volume driven by a -- our growth portfolio as well as the expansion of our customer base. This volume growth is forecasted to be partially offset by deliberate actions we are taking to reduce channel inventory in many countries. Pricing is expected to be down low-to mid-single digits with the vast majority of the pricing headwinds due to our diamide partners. As we discussed earlier, those contract adjustments will have the most impact in the first half of the year due to the timing of those sales. We are forecasting FX to be a low-to mid-single digits headwinds for the year as the U.S. dollar is projected to remain strong. Despite these challenges to sell, we expect to deliver higher EBITDA versus the prior year with an expected range of $870 million to $950 million, which is up 1% at the mid-point. Excluding the GSS impact, the mid-point of guidance is up about 4%. We expect COGS to be favorable $175 million to $200 million due to lower raw materials, favorable fixed-cost absorption, and restructuring benefit. Offsetting these benefits are expected to be lower price, a $65 million to $75 million FX headwind and investment in sales organization. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be between $3.26 and $3.70, which is flat at the midpoint to prior year. As shown in our Q1 guidance on slide nine, we expect a low quarter -- a low first-quarter as we aggressively start the correction process early in the year. Sales are expected to be $750 million and $800 million, a decline of 16% against prior year, due to negative price FX and volume. Excluding an estimated $24 million of loss, GSS sales, the decline is 13% at the mid-point. We expect lower volume for two reasons. One is excess levels of FMC inventory in the channel in many countries, which is amplified by customer prioritizing much lower than historical inventory level. The other is specific to the United States. In the second half of 2024, our distribution customers in the United States replenished their depleted inventory in advance of the growing season. Normally, retailers and growers would start pulling that volume through during Q1. However, this year, due to initiatives to keep inventory low and cautious purchasing from commodity from low-commodity prices, we are making the assumption that pull-through by retailers and growers will occur more evenly over the three quarter season than in prior years. This is expected to delay reorders from distributors, and will result in weaker volume in Q1. While this creates a significant challenge for our Q1 outlook, we want to make sure we are setting expectations that reflect our belief over how the U.S. market could behave this year, which is much different than our historical view of this market. We expect Q1 price to be lower in the mid-to-high-single-digits with over two-thirds of this due to the price adjustments for diamide partner contracts. FX is also expected to be a mid-single-digit headwind. Similar to a full-year expectation, we are forecasting continued expansion of our growth portfolio in the quarter. We are guiding Q1 EBITDA at $105 million to $125 million, which is a decline of 28% at the mid-point. Lower pricing and FX headwinds are expected to be partially offset by reduced COGS, including lower raw material and favorable fixed-cost absorption. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $0.05 and $0.15. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew to cover some financial items and how this guidance impacts our balance sheet. Andrew Sandifer : Thanks, Pierre. Before I get into the normal review of key financial results, let me start this afternoon with an update on our restructuring program on slide 10. When we initially announced our restructuring program in late 2023, we targeted delivering $50 million to $75 million of net savings in the 2024 P&L with $150 million in run-rate savings by the end of 2025, both measured against the 2023 baseline. As we progress through 2024, we identified a number of areas where we could move more aggressively to reduce our cost structure, raising our targets at our second-quarter earnings call and again on our third-quarter call to $125 million to $150 million in 2024 net savings and more than $225 million in run-rate savings by the end of 2025. While there were many factors that contributed to these increased targets, the biggest factor was a major revamping of sourcing for raw materials for our diamide products. I'm pleased to report that we exceeded our increased targets, finishing 2024 with net savings delivered in the P&L of $165 million, largely in operating expenses, but with savings, and cost-of-goods-sold as well. We also now have a clear line-of-sight to run-rate savings of more than $250 million by the end of 2025 with a very significant contribution from lower-cost of goods. Our restructuring program has impacted every part of the company, resulting in fundamental changes in our operating model, including how we are organized, where we operate, and the way we work. While we do have some remaining in-flight projects to finish delivering the full savings run-rate in 2025, we've incorporated the expected year-on-year benefits of our restructuring actions in our outlook for 2025. As such, we consider our restructuring program to be essentially complete and we will ensure delivery of the remaining savings through our normal management of delivery of our guidance. Moving next to some key income statement items. FX was a 5% headwind to revenue growth in the fourth quarter, primarily stemming from the Brazilian real. For full-year 2024, FX was a 2% headwind at revenue with the Brazilian real and the Turkish lira the largest contributors, followed by smaller headwinds across a number of Asian currencies. For 2025, we anticipate a low to-mid-single-digit headwind in revenue from FX with the Brazilian real, the Turkish lira, and the euro being the most significant drivers. Unlike 2024, we anticipate a meaningful EBITDA headwind from FX in 2025, and the range of $65 million to $75 million. 2024 EBITDA benefited from the timing of currency movements during the year that created favorability against the hedges we had in place. In 2025, we continue our normal systematic approach to hedging, but with the strengthening of the dollar that happened in late 2024, and into 2025, and with the current forward curves, we do not expect to see a repeat of the favorability we saw in 2024. Rather, we expect to see a more normal relationship between FX impacts at revenue and EBITDA with our hedging program dampening, but not eliminating the impact on EBITDA and negative FX movements. Interest expense for the fourth quarter was $51.8 million, down nearly $5 million compared to the prior year period, driven by lower debt balances, and lower interest rates. For full year 2025, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $210 million to $230 million, down roughly $15 million year-on-year at the mid-point, reflecting the benefit of debt reduction in 2024 and modestly lower interest rates in 2025. We ended 2024 with a lower-than-expected effective tax rate on adjusted earnings of 10.9%. The mix of earnings by jurisdiction shifted meaningfully versus our expectations in the fourth quarter with substantially less profit attributed to high-tax jurisdictions like Brazil. The fourth-quarter effective tax rate of 7.9% reflects the true-up to the full-year rate relative to the 14% rate that have been accrued through the third quarter. With the impacts of lower effective tax rate for 2024, adjusted earnings per share for Q4 were up $0.72 or 67% versus the prior year period, a significantly higher increase seen at EBITDA. The biggest driver of increased earnings per share remains increased EBITDA, representing $0.59 of the $0.72 increase in EPS year-over-year, while lower tax contributed $0.11. For 2025, we anticipate that our effective tax rate should be in the range of 13% to 15% with approximately 3 percentage point increase at the mid-point, driven by the expected mix of profit by jurisdiction. Moving next to the balance sheet and leverage on slide 11. Gross debt at December 31st was approximately $3.4 billion, down nearly $600 million versus the prior year. Debt reduction came both from the proceeds from the sale of our GSS business, which closed on November 1st, as well as from discretionary cash flow. Cash-on-hand increased $55 million to $357 million, resulting in net debt of approximately $3 billion. Gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 3.7 times at year end, while net debt to EBITDA was 3.3 times. Relative to our covenant, which measures leverage with a number of adjustments to both the numerator and denominator, leverage was 3.7 times as compared to a covenant of 5.0 times. As we announced a short while ago, we recently amended the leverage covenant of our credit agreement to provide additional headroom, and duration of covenant relief given our outlook for 2025 through 2027. We expect to end 2025 with leverage metrics essentially flat to 2024 and then to show improving metrics with rapidly accelerating EBITDA growth in 2026 and 2027. This is coupled with disciplined cash management, including continuing to direct all discretionary free cash flow to debt reduction. We remain committed to returning our leverage to levels consistent with our targeted BBB/Baa2 long-term credit ratings. While this will take a bit longer than we previously hoped, we are confident we're on the right path to get our leverage metrics back in line as our business more fully recovers. Moving on to free cash flow in slides 12 and 13. Free cash flow for full-year 2024 was $614 million, an increase of more than $1.1 billion versus the prior year. The year-on-year increase was driven by a $1.04 billion improvement in cash from operations, which benefited particularly from improved payables, and inventory despite over $100 million of cash restructuring spending. Capital additions and other investing activities were down substantially as we constrained spending to only the most critical projects. Cash flow from discontinued operations improved in part due to a one-time insurance element. For 2025, we expect free cash flow of $200 million to $400 million, a decrease of $314 million at the mid-point. Cash from operations is the key driver of the decrease with normalization of working capital after the pronounced correction in 2024. Capital additions are also expected to be up somewhat, but with continued focus on only the most essential projects, including capacity expansion to support new products. Cash flow from discontinued operations is also up slightly, but in line with our multi-year average. Free cash flow conversion from adjusted earnings is expected to be approximately 69% at the mid-point. With that, I'll hand the call over to Ronaldo. Ronaldo Pereira : Thanks, Andrew. I want to start off by providing an update on our diamide strategy, which is supported by slides 14 through 21. As we look ahead, it's clear that our commercial strategy is evolving, driven primarily by the upcoming patent expirations, particularly for Rynaxypyr. While this presents challenges, we see it as an opportunity to transform, compete, and advance in new ways. Like other products that transition to the post-patent phase of life, when we look back at the makeup of our diamides business years from now, it will look much different than it does today. Over the past several quarters, we have spoken to the broad strategy for these products as they shift to their post-patent lifecycle. At a high level, the strategy that we've communicated, which you can see on slide 15, is that we will continue to offer the basic solo formulations under the trusted FMC brand names at lower price points to compete with generics entry in the market. At the same time, we will offer high-value versions of diamides via new often patented formulations and mixtures. This evening, I'll share in more detail how we're enacting to this strategy, and share how we see the next few years unfolding for this product class. Going forward, you will hear us start talking about the two distinct products, Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr, rather than just simply referring to them as the lead diamides as we've done in the past. Both products are very potent tools for growers to control insects. But as you can see in slide 16, there are some key differences between the two products. Rynaxypyr has a more limited spectrum, but that spectrum is focused on controlling lepidoptera insects or caterpillars, which is the most valuable addressable market at nearly $5 billion. Cyazypyr, on the other hand, has a much broader scope in terms of types of insects it can control. Our Rynaxypyr sales have outpaced Cyazypyr with roughly a 70-30 split. This is partly due to Rynaxypyr's larger market-share for caterpillar control and also has been by our own design due to its somewhat simpler manufacturing process and lower cost profile. The market for Chlorantraniliprole or CTPR, which is a chemical name for the active ingredient behind Rynaxypyr will undergo a series of changes over the next few years and our strategy reflects that. As Rynaxypyr enters the next phase of its product life, it has been included in the core portfolio along with the other legacy products that are off-patent, like Sulfentrazone. All composition-of-matter patents have expired for Rynaxypyr and by the end of 2025, almost all process patents will also have expired. We expect generics to enter all major markets with Rynaxypyr with solo formulations of CTPR by the end of 2026. As we mentioned earlier, we are already observing generic CTPR sales in some countries today. As generics enter the market, we will continue to offer solo formulations at lower price points under the trusted FMC brand to compete with the new market entrants. Based on the latest data from international shipments, we believe we are competitive on costs with lower price generics offering the solo molecule, thanks to our recent restructuring actions, which have significantly lowered our cost of sales. Lower pricing for the solo formulation will coincide with a significant expansion of acres treated with CTPR. Slide 17 and 18 illustrate how this is likely to occur. Slide 17 shows the global foliar insecticide market, which is about $22 billion at the farm gate. Diamides as a class of chemistry are estimated to be about 9% or a little under $2 billion of that overall market with FMC's branded diamides making up about 55% of that share. The remaining 45% is made up of FMC partner sales, generic CTPR, and competitor products within the diamide classes that is not -- that are not Rynaxypyr or Cyazypyr. As you can see that the -- you can see that the majority of diamide offerings are on the higher end of the treatment per acre price curve with prices ranging from $20 to over $40 per acre. There are almost no diamide products offered below $10 and FMC's diamides are virtually non-existent in this space. When generics first enter the market, we expect growers, who are solely driven by price to be their key customers, which should be less impactful to FMC. The entrance of generics will certainly create competitive pressure against some existing FMC products, but as slide 18 shows with our lower manufacturing costs and technology roadmap, there will be substantial opportunities Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr to take share across all points of the price curve from other insecticides such as Neonicotinoids and organophosphates. The more favorable environmental profile of both Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr versus these other insecticide classes would further aid market expansion. As seen on slide 18, we expect that the diamide market will grow from $2 billion up to an estimated $5 billion over time. As volume expands, we will continue to differentiate our Rynaxypyr products from other CTPR offerings with new formulations and mixers. These new products, which are listed on slide 19, will deliver additional attributes. This innovation can be in the form of adding a second mode of action to combat potential resistance or adding a mixed partner to broaden the spectrum of control, while expanding the addressable market. Rynaxypyr is expected to continue to show sales growth, although not at the high levels we observed when the product was earlier in its life cycle. Following the 2025 correction year, we expect overall Rynaxypyr to report a growth rate in the high single digits. On slide 20, you can see the upcoming products in our Rynaxypyr pipeline. Many of these products -- these new products will offer additional value to growers. This can be in the form of reduced labor for application by offering rice growers a much lighter weight tablet formulation or it can be through new mixtures with pheromones and insecticide from other groups that combat resistance and it strengthens performance in existing segments. Finally, we plan to introduce seed treatment products, which is an unexplored segment of the market for our branded offerings, as well as a mixture with a Bionematicide. While the core portfolio grows at or above the market, we expect Cyazypyr and the rest of our growth portfolio to grow at multiples of the market. For Cyazypyr, we have process patents in place in major markets through 2025, with Brazil not expiring until the middle of 2026. In addition to the process patents, we also have a key formulation patent for Cyazypyr through 2027 in key markets, and data protection in place in major regions such as Brazil, the U.S., and Europe. Depending on the country, this can extend the protection granted to the regional molecule. Data protection creates an additional and costly hurdle for generics to register products even after process patents have expired. Slide 21, shows some of the products in our Cyazypyr pipeline, including mixtures with insecticides from other groups that will broaden the spectrum of control as well as slow down resistance. Our high-load formulations are not only easier to handle for growers, they also improve our cost position. To serve growers in the fruits and vegetables space, we'll be offering a fruit flight bait that is a unique and sustainable solution that leaves no residues and has no restrictions for export. Compared to Rynaxypyr, Cyazypyr has a more complex and more expensive manufacturing process. These factors may cause fewer generics to enter the market compared to Rynaxypyr. Cyazypyr has a broader spectrum of pests it can strongly control, including whitefly, fruit fly, leaf miner, and Psyllid. Given the broader spectrum and our reduced manufacturing costs, we believe we have a sizable opportunity to expand the market for this product. Similar to Rynaxypyr, we are actively promoting and developing new formulations and mixtures to position ourselves well when all patent protection has expired and generics enter the market. Following the 2025 production year, we expect sales of Cyazypyr to grow in the low-to-mid-teens. The most exciting parts of the growth portfolio are the new AIs that we're launching and expanding over the next few years. We have mentioned before our high expectations for the contributions of these molecules and we've not shared more details about what these expectations are and what supports them. Let me start with the two products already in commercialization. The first one is fluindapyr. It is one of the newest active ingredients of the SDHI fungicides, a class of very active products with a strong commercial success. Together, SDHI fungicides represent 15% of the global fungicides market with around $3 billion in combined sales in 2023. SDHI fungicides are known for being very effective when used to prevent crop disease. This is also the case for fluindapyr, however, what sets it apart from the other active ingredients is the especially broad-spectrum of control that covers many diseases of economic importance, such as Asian soybean rust, corn tar spot, coffee rust, and damping off in young cotton plants. Fluindapyr also protects crops for an extended period lowering the need to respray. These technical attributes are enough to support our confidence in the success of Fluindapyr. But there is another aspect that is equally important. Fluindapyr has given us access to some large market segments that we haven't -- have never served before. In aggregate, we believe that its addressable market exceeds $2 billion. Soybean rust in Brazil alone is a $3.5 billion market, just to mention one example. In many of these market segments, fluindapyr will be the first technology that we will sell. Going into these new segment segments with a product that is patent-protected, technically-differentiated and biologically strong, we open access to sales of other FMC products. As shown on slide 22, fluindapyr is already registered in Brazil, Argentina, the United States, and Paraguay with some other important countries pending registration in the next three years. Sales are expected to be more than $150 million in 2025, exceeding $300 million by 2027. The second product is Isoflex Active, a herbicide based on bixlozone that offers a new mode of action in cereals such as wheat and barley. It's most effective at controlling difficult grasses as well as some key broad leaf weeds. We have been selling this product in Australia with strong results. With recently approved registrations, it has expanded to Brazil, Argentina, India, and the UK. European Union registrations have been submitted and we expect to begin selling there during 2027. Given the size of cereals market in the EU, Isoflex sales in those countries will provide a substantial boost to the product's global sales. We estimate that the addressable market for cereals in Europe to be about $5 billion. Isoflex sales are expected to be about $100 million in 2025 with sales approaching $250 million by 2027. We expect sales to continue strong growth beyond 2027 as the product becomes more widely used. Our third product is Dodhylex, the first herbicide to be introduced in the market with a new mode of action in over 30 years. In our Q2 call, we described it as a patented rice herbicide. I want to correct that statement. Dodhylex is a novel patented and versatile herbicide. While its development in rice is more advanced, our confidence that it will be sold on other crops in the future keeps growing every day, suffice to say that it can be safely applied on several broad-leaf crops such as soybean, sunflower and others. And we believe there are meaningful opportunities to expand the product to these crops beyond 2027. But for today's discussion, let's just stay with rice. There are 165 million hectares of rice planted globally. To put this in perspective, this is 25% more land than soybeans and not so far from corn. Because of cultural reasons, the vast majority of the countries currently have strict regulations that prevent the introduction of genetically modified rice varieties. As a result, decades of weed control with herbicides with similar modes of action have led to a substantial increase in weed resistance, probably more so than in any other major crop. Although it's hard to estimate the size of global rice area infested with resistant weeds, in U.S. alone, some Universities estimated that resistant weeds are present in more than half of all the rice fields. Weeds like barnyard grass and sprangletop are present in virtually every rice field. And in many of them, they have become resistant to existing herbicides. Differently from other crops, there are many agronomic variations on how rice is planted from country to country. Direct seeded versus transplanted, variety types, irrigated versus rainfed, different irrigation methods, et cetera. Today, all these variables result in limitations on which herbicides can be used. A product that can be safely used on transplanted rice can be harmful to the crop when used on direct seeded fields. Dodhylex is highly safe on rice plants independently of the agronomic practices. Once we launch it, almost all the rice growers will be able to use it without being forced to choose between their herbicides, and their preferred agronomic practices. High versatility, strong performance on resistant weeds, unparalleled crop safety on a crop that is planted in all continents, and potential to expand even further in traditional crops. These are the key reasons behind our high expectations on Dodhylex commercial performance in the next few years. Looking forward into the future, we continue to believe that our new active ingredients can achieve or surpass $2 billion in revenue at maturity. Beyond our new synthetic pipeline, our plant health business is expected to grow at a rate in the mid 20% range out to 2027, led by biologicals with a smaller contribution from pheromones. We still believe there is an excellent opportunity for outsized growth for pheromones, but meaningful growth is not likely to occur until after 2027. In summary, there is enormous potential for expanded sales from our growth portfolio when you consider the new active ingredients and the potential for Cyazypyr to broaden its market reach. In addition, we also have a growing portfolio of biological products, including pheromones that are positioned to provide even further growth. With our core portfolio providing a solid foundation for sales and earnings in a market that is in the midst of recovery, the differentiated nature of our growth portfolio puts us in a strong position to outgrow the market over the coming years. Pierre will now discuss specifically what our expectations are for the next three years and provide some closing remarks. Thank you. Pierre Brondeau : Thank you, Ronaldo. Our 2027 targets are laid out on slide 23. We are focusing here on the growth of the company post-2025, which we believe will act as a correction year to reposition our portfolio. The growth rates post-2025 are more representative of the future growth of FMC. The sales of our core portfolio from '24 to '27 are expected to grow at 2% per year. Following the 2025 correction year, we expect total Rynaxypyr growth in the high-single-digit. The rest of the core portfolio is forecasted to grow at the market rate of about 3% every year. Our growth portfolio is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 24% from '24 to '27. Following the '25 correction year, Cyazypyr growth is projected to be in the low to mid-teens with growth of both branded and partner sales. The new active ingredients are expected to reach $600 million by 2027. The growth will mostly come in from fluindapyr and Isoflex with a small contribution of Dodhylex based on the launch calendar. The plant health growth rate is expected to be in the mid-20% range with a potentially high-growth pheromones product expected to meaningfully accelerate growth of plant health after 2027. From '24 to '27, the growth portfolio contribution to total company sales is expected to grow from 19% of total company to 30%. Looking beyond 2027, the ramp-up of Dodhylex and the addition of new products such as expanded biological offerings, the pheromones, and the new dual-mode of action herbicide rimisoxafen will all contribute to further growth for the company. Combining the core and growth portfolio leads to expected 2027 sales of about $5.2 billion. EBITDA is expected to be about $1.2 billion, equating to a 23% EBITDA margin, which is at the higher end of our industry. This is a revenue annual growth of 7% from '24 to '27 with EBITDA growth at 10%. From '25 to '27, revenue grows at an annual rate of 11% with EBITDA growing at 15% rate. We are highly confident in the growth path of the company. This confidence comes from the already strong performance of our growth portfolio. I believe FMC has the strongest pipeline in its history. But we are also conscious that taking full advantage of it requires a repositioning of the company in 2025. That is why we will realign our inventory level, implement the newly developed diamide strategy, and invest in our sales organization to support a growth portfolio and develop new routes to market. We can now open the line for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Pierre, could you help us understand how you expect Rynaxypyr from 2026 and beyond to evolve. You're talking about high-single-digit sales growth, but could you maybe help us think about the shape of volume and price over the coming years? And within that, could you let us know your view of price gaps and how you expect to manage them as the generics proliferate? Thank you very much. Pierre Brondeau : Sure. From a pricing standpoint, we believe we are in place right now, where we can compete with generics at the price we understand at the -- at the price which are being practiced by generic companies as reported in the latest import data we have. So, there are two aspects of it. There is the aspect of the market where we will sell a solo molecule. And there, we will have to make a decision of how deep we go into this market to go further into hectares, which are lower-cost -- using lower-cost product and to decide where we go and how much of this market we decide to take versus today where we do not have any of this market. So that's what a lower manufacturing cost and new pricing will allow us to do to expand the market we will reach in term of hectares by going after different type of pesticides. Then there is the high-end, as you've seen on the slide presented by Ronaldo, we are actively working on new mixtures of products, which are increasing the efficacy of the product, fighting the resistance, and those products will allow us to differentiate ourselves from the solo molecule, which will have a way less efficacy and do that at a price premium. And finally, we're going to be developing products, which will be beneficial from a cost standpoint for us and growers, we talk about high concentration and pallets. So it's a mixture of moving products in two directions. One is to the higher-end with the high-level formulation, which are significantly increasing the efficacy of the product together with having the capability to expand to lower-end market because we will have a much lower price allowing us to go into those markets. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Spector with UBS. You may proceed. Josh Spector : Yes, hi. I had a question on your volume guidance for 2025. So, a lot of the prepared remarks talk about weakness at the end of the year, more channel inventory you're dealing with in first quarter, and that's clear in your 1Q guidance. But if our math is correct, it looks like you're expecting volume growth of something like high single digits for 2025 as a year. Previously, you talked about that as 5%, something in that range. So it just seems really odd to us that you're increasing confidence in volumes when the near-term outlook looks a lot worse than you previously anticipated. So can you help us out there, please? Pierre Brondeau : Yes, absolutely. It's a very appropriate question. We are -- one of the very key decisions we've made is to lower the inventory of FMC products in the channel. So all of the core products we have or the product part of the core portfolio, we're going to make sure that we are selling more on the ground than we are selling into the channel. Initially, when we gave some directional numbers, we talked about a volume growth in the 6% range. Today, we are at a higher number. But it is a strategy we have developed during the fourth quarter when we understood better the market we were facing. If you think about when we talked about 6%, we are thinking more out of a general growth of the demand from the market, which would have recovered. Here we are excluding that part of the growth. And if you think about the range of growth, it is something like $250 million to $350 million. That's the kind of range we talk about today in terms of volume growth, 75% of that is coming from a growth portfolio and it is coming from -- mostly from the new molecules, the new AIs and also from the biological product. The rest is coming, and the vast majority of the remaining growth is coming from the plant health portfolio. So there is very little growth in the $250 million to $350 million growth, which is coming from the core portfolio. So it's a very different profile. It's a very different approach. There is a downside to it, let's face it, it requires investment in the first quarter to develop a new sales organization to go after the growth in the new routes, which is more direct sales to large growers, but it's a very different growth profile than what we're expecting and where we intend to grow, the 250 to 350 do-not-touch places where we have high inventory level. Andrew Sandifer : If I may add to that, Pierre, Josh, we are investing in expanding and exploring new routes to market. The combination of new products and new customers, that is really where the growth comes from. It is not from traditional products and traditional customers. As we just stated that our focus there is actually to decrease the existing inventory. So, it's new products to new customers driving the volume growth. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research. You may proceed. Chris Parkinson : Hey guys. I was just hoping you could help me triangulate a few things. It just seems like the 1Q guide is the vast majority of the delta of what the Street was increasingly kind of factoring in for your '25 guidance. And we all understand there's a lot going on with Brazilian credit and increasing competition not only across the big six, but also generics within the Americas, wholesale-retail holding less inventory. But just can you help us just given even Latin-America is a smaller portion of the first calendar quarter, just what's your confidence 2Q onwards that you're doing everything in FMC's power to ensure that you can ultimately hit that annual guide, if not exceed it once all the dust settles? Thank you. Pierre Brondeau : I think Chris, I would say the first quarter number are showing that we are taking very significant market approach to a lower level of FMC products in the channel. So certainly our numbers for the first quarter are showing that we're going to have a very, very prudent approach to the market with a high focus on preparing the following quarters. The second-half of the year will also benefit a lot of the new products, the new route to market for the new product, because lots of the registration except the U.S. are coming from countries in Latin-America where you will have the growing season and the new routes-to-market with the new growers we are targeting are also in Latin-America. So the two actions, structuring our sales for growth in the second half plus the actions we are taking in the first half of the year should make us successful to deliver what we are planning in the second half of the year. Do you want to add something, Andrew? Andrew Sandifer : Yes. Chris, I'd just add as well just that as Pierre commented, we do have some major timing shifts in the U.S. business happening this year as well that calls for some shift of sales we would normally expect to make in Q1 to happen later in the year. So, I think that's a part of this low Q1 and stronger Q2 through Q4 that you're pointing to in your question. It is that combination of both the back-end weighted new product growth that Pierre mentioned, the actions we're taking earlier in the year, broadly speaking to reduce channel inventories. And then finally, the bit of the change in sequence during the year of sales in the U.S. market with later replenishment by growers and retailers pulling from distribution. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Richard Garchitorena with Wells Fargo. You may proceed. Richard Garchitorena : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. I just wanted to touch on the pricing outlook. And it looks like in the fourth quarter, you saw pricing decline across basically most of the segments -- most of the regions with the exception of EMEA. In terms of the outlook, you talked about cost-plus contract adjustments. Was that in any specific region? How is pricing currently in Latin-America, which has been the weakest, I guess that you had been seeing? And then when you look at the 2027 revenue guide, is expectations that these contracts are reset in '25, and then they're going to be flat to potentially higher as we move forward over the next couple of years? Thank you. Pierre Brondeau : So, to answer your last question about the contract, there is for some of the very critical contracts, an indexation of the pricing to customers to a manufacturing cost. The biggest jump in terms of lowering our manufacturing cost is taking place now from '24 to '25. After '25, we're going to have incremental evolution of our cost, which will go lower and beyond where we will be in '25, but not at all to the same extent. So there will be less of an impact of the price adjustment to the technical sales in '26 and '27 versus '25 as most of the hit will be taken in 2025. From a pricing standpoint, I think the guidance we are giving and Andrew, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the guidance we're giving for 2025 is 3% with about two-thirds of that coming from those manufacturing contract or those sales contract to our partners. Now, Q4, -- about Q4 and the 3% decline, which was slightly better than what we were expecting. And that's related to the comment I made initially, we had good line of sight in the fourth quarter to deliver the EBITDA and the EPS. We decided to walk away from sales when there was too much of a demand for price or term. We did not want to get into a situation where we would be competing at any cost to go as high as we could on the selling front, and just rather stayed below the number we gave as our expectation from a price decrease knowing that we could deliver earnings without doing it. Operator : The next question is from Arun Viswanathan with RBC. You may proceed. Arun Viswanathan : Great, thanks for taking my question, understanding that you guys have done a lot of work to get inside the channel a little bit more, it sounds like you will be continuing to increase your visibility there. But maybe you can just highlight, Pierre, some of the some of the learnings that you have found there. It sounds like that was an area of particular interest, but now you're also shifting your strategy as well, and further solidifying the growth versus core strategy. But what else are you doing on the inventory side to get a better handle on the channel? And will all of those issues, you know be mainly addressed through your Q1 actions? Thanks. Pierre Brondeau : Yes, thank you. I would say that most of our inventory actions are going to take place in the first half. I think that's -- that it will take more than one quarter. We're going to be very aggressive in the first quarter, we will carry that on the second quarter. I think, there are two issues I did not personally appreciate in the first couple of months I was here. I focused a lot on the overall inventory, but there is clearly some places for different reasons where we would have higher than the average inventory level, higher FMC inventory level. So we have now identified and it's a country per country set of action, and it's going to be India, it's going to be Brazil, it's Eastern Europe, it's Asian. So we have a series of six or seven countries where we went in-depth to tackle the inventory issue. And the way we truly realized that was going through studying the selling process and why things were not happening the way we were expecting. There is also the fact we spent a lot of time talking to our customers that we are dealing with a moving target. Inventory target at the end of the season, we believe is not the same today as it was in the past. I think people are -- I mean, there is some region, I'll give you an example, there is some regions where people were comfortable ending the season in the 30%, 35% range of a full-year or full-season inventory at the end of the season. Most people now are targeting the 20%, 25% range. So, it's a moving target. So we have to deal with those two issues, the moving target in terms of what our customers want plus the identified places, maybe six or seven countries, but including some large countries like India and Brazil, where there is specifically high level of FMC inventory. Operator : The next question comes from Ben Theurer with Barclays. You may proceed. Ben Theurer : Yes, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to kind of get a little bit more of the -- like medium-term picture. And as you think about the rollout and the cadence for '25 then into '26, obviously, with the backdrop of what you've just guided for Q1. So if things move the way you suspect right now, and as you would have to anticipate maybe a little bit of that step-in between versus what is this year's outlook and the '27 path to it, how should we think about the cadence into 2026, just given the rollout of products and your ability to gain back some market-share and to gain some -- back some customers that seem to be lost for now. Pierre Brondeau : Yes, I think the -- it is not -- if I look at the three-year plan, it's not a back -- back-end-loaded three-year plan excuse me, you will see significant improvement of the numbers starting in 2026. The new products, you've seen the numbers shown by Ronaldo going to $600 million. It's going to be a pretty evenly growth you're going to see over the three-year period. The new routes-to-market, we hope to be ready to have that in place in the second quarter to start to be very active in the third quarter and be even more implanted in 2026. So certainly there is an acceleration of the growth from '26 to '27, but you will -- there will be a significant step-up coming from a correction year. By '26, we will benefit from a market growth of the core business and the full growth of our growth business. So it is not a back-end type of three-year plan. Operator : The next question is from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. You may proceed. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you. For Rynaxypyr volumes in 2025, what are you expecting the percent decline to be? And what was the change in your outlook for the global market versus your prior expectations? Was this primarily due to just greater-than-expected capacity expansions in China? Is that what was the primary change? And if so, why do you think you could get back to high single digit growth in 2026? Pierre Brondeau : Yes. I think we want to be careful in not talking about specific percentage for products. In next year, we do expect Rynaxypyr to be down both branded Rynaxypyr and Rynaxypyr sold to our partners. We do expect Cyazypyr sales, branded Cyazypyr sales to be up. Going forward, I think, first, the different thinking we have about the Rynaxypyr business is twofold. First, we believe that we can expand with a new manufacturing cost. The market we can address with Rynaxypyr as a solo molecule formulation. Like I talked about, we talked about Dodhylex or we talked about the high concentration or the mixtures -- with mixture partners. So we do believe that we can expand the number of acres where we can be competitive, and we can also improve the efficacy of this product, allowing us to go to market, which will be beneficial from a usage standpoint to growers. So, we do believe to play in a much larger market starting this year and mostly in 2026 than we've done before without moving away from staying in the high-end with specific formulation, which are giving benefits to growers. To your questions around the change in the landscape, what I believe is, like it is very often the case, when you have a patent protection, which is a composition of matter, that is very solid across the world. When you have a patent protection, which is process-based, not all jurisdiction or countries do have the same attitude towards those patents. And I believe that with India and China starting to sell products, even if we are taking legal actions, and even if there is a high probability, we will win those legal actions, there is no injunction. Competitors are not stopped by court and that gave the example and the courage to those companies to expand that behavior into other countries, and that's why we saw them coming into Argentina, for example, into Turkiye. So I think there is an expansion when you are just one year away from the end of your process patent protection where people are less worried about the legal action we could be taking and it's happening -- it's happening maybe faster than what we're expecting. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. You may proceed. Frank Mitsch : Thank you and good afternoon. I want to come back to the price question. Pierre, you indicated that two-thirds of the price decline you're anticipating to come from the manufacturing contracts with your diamide partners. So if you could talk a little bit about the other third where you're seeing the price declines in that area. But coming back to the diamide partners, am I to understand that as you improve your manufacturing process, that you are giving that back to the diamide partners. So as you spend money to improve your manufacturing for the restructuring costs, et cetera, that is flowing through in a lower -price to the diamide partners. I mean, I certainly can understand if raw-material costs come down and so forth that, that would flow-through to your partners. But I was just struck that it sounded like it was also if you're making improvements and spending money to do so that you're giving some of that up. So any color there would be very helpful. Thank you. Pierre Brondeau : Absolutely. So yes, the contract we have with those diamide partners are the fact that -- and once again, it's not all of them. There is some of our diamide partners where we have a very different cost structure. But important diamide partners to have what we call a cost-plus, which is not the exact terminology that's a fact we -- the way we called it, but the pricing is indexed on our manufacturing cost. And it is a commercial decision we have taken. You know, we knew that over time, those partners would have the choice between working with us, and working with people who potentially would come with price, which would be more competitive. So, when you say mid-term, long-term contract with those partners, they're willing to stay with you, but they also have to be sure that their source of product will remain competitive. So in some cases, there is no cost plus contract, but then what you end up doing is having a commercial negotiation every year or every other year when the contract has to be renewed with some other partners, we do have longer-term contracts. And one of the benefits they get is they give us longer-term contract and we give us a guarantee that we will optimize the price even if we are the one spending money to lower the cost. It's just a commercial practice. We have to secure some large contracts with important partners over a longer period of time. Regarding the -- regarding the remaining the one-third of the price decrease, it is actually, we believe some of the normal market competitiveness, which will still exist for the time being until the market has completely recovered. And the fact that in Asia, we still are in a very, very competitive situation where the -- and especially India, where the channel is very full. So I would say, it's not as simple as two-thirds technical -- what we call technical product sales to a partner and one-third of Asia, but it's not far from being the truth. Operator : Next question comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners. You may proceed. Mike Harrison : Hi, good evening. I was hoping, Ronaldo, given your experience in Latin America, maybe you can give us a little bit more detail on the changes that you're seeing in the Latin America distribution channel, I know that your restructuring plan included some rightsizing of the organization in Brazil. And now it sounds like you're seeing a need to invest in new routes to markets or different ways to access that market. So can you help us understand what has changed in the market and also what has changed about your approach to the market in Latin America and your organization? Thank you. Andrew Sandifer : Sure, Michael. A few years ago, the retail distribution system went through a consolidation, a wave of consolidation. And some of the consolidators started acquiring some retailers that were family-owned businesses, very traditional and small -- covering small territories. And these platforms became large and very diverse in terms of geographic expansion, and also the making of their, I'll call, network for the lack of better name. What we have seen is that the market-share that some of those original businesses had with our products is not the same that we are seeing with the consolidators today. Because the market is evolving, the compliance need is different, the credit requirements are different. And as a result of that, there are more and more growers going directly to companies or we could put in reverse as well more and more companies going direct to growers, and approaching them directly and establishing that direct relationship between manufacturers and large growers. You may ask well and why didn't you follow that wave before or you adjusted before? And the answer is actually pretty simple. To go -- I'm talking about soybean and corn and to go and approach growers directly, you need a technology that is specifically important to those growers. We now have it. I talked about fluindapyr and I talked about that product being a key tool in controlling Asia's soybean rust. There are new -- renewed brands and versions of our diamides. We are now approaching those growers with some new technology to show them. So the difference between where we were before optimizing and now that we're making investments is; one, when we rightsized it the organization, we rightsized it to the total size of the market. Now the type of investments that we're making, the people that are joining the company are people that are more skilled on soybean and corn, segments that we didn't serve before, and especially approaching directly growers not focusing 100% on retailers. In other words, though the skills are not the same, and the fact that we let go people before and now we are adding, it's not the same type of people, it's just different skills, different networks and different connections that are required to implement this new stage of the strategy. But I do want to stress, we can only do that now because we have the right technologies to do so. Operator : The last question comes from Kevin McCarthy with VRP. You may proceed. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, thank you and good evening. Pierre, if I look at slide number eight, you're guiding to adjusted EBITDA that's either side of flat, and that is the case, notwithstanding what looks to be $175 million to $200 million of favorability on COGS. I think you have additional restructuring benefits flowing through as well? So my question would be, can you speak to some of the headwinds that would cause the flat EBITDA? I do see the foreign exchange that you quantified, or perhaps you could speak to the level of the incremental investments that you're making in SG&A to go direct in Latin America and other cost headwinds that would complete the bridge, so to speak. Pierre Brondeau : Sure. I think I would say there are multiple ways to look at it, but there are three key headwinds. One is price with what we explained around the price we have to give back to our -- to some of our partners on diamide. So, price is overall $130 million, I think in the range of $130 million of headwind. And secondly, we do have FX, which is much beyond what we would have thought a few months ago in the range of about $70 million. And we believe we're going to be investing in the first quarter about $25 million to create a new sales organization. So, you have here about $200 million to $250 million of headwind for the three main ones. Andrew, have I missed any or those are the three biggest ones? Andrew Sandifer : Yes, that's the biggest one. And obviously, we did forgo about $25 million in the profit we've made in the GSS business in the prior year that obviously we won't have this year finish out the\u2026 Pierre Brondeau : That's a full thing. Andrew Sandifer : Smaller piece. Pierre Brondeau : So those together go beyond $250 million. Operator : Yes. This concludes the FMC Corporation conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",
