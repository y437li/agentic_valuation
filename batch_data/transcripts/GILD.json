(Operator instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patrick O'Brien: Thank you, Stephanie. Good afternoon, everyone. We issued a press release this afternoon providing earnings results for the first quarter, which is available on our website where you can also find detailed slides that support today's call. For our prepared remarks and Q&A, I am joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John Martin; our President and Chief Operating Officer, John Milligan; our Executive Vice President of Research and Development, Norbert Bischofberger; our new Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations, Paul Carter; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Robin Washington. Before we begin our formal remarks, we want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations, with respect to our product candidates, financial projections, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. We will be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release as well as on our website. I will now turn the call over to John Martin. John Martin : Thank you, Patrick, and thank you all for joining us today. The first quarter of 2014 was an important step towards realizing a number of milestones for the business, particularly in hepatitis C. Earlier today we reported product sales of $4.9 billion, an increase of 104% year-over-year. This increase was driven by the launch of Sovaldi. Sovaldi's profile has the potential to transform the treatment of hepatitis C and the rapid uptake speaks to a significant unmet medical need. I couldn't be more proud of the teams at Gilead, who rapidly brought this product to market supported by a robust data package of data from many clinical studies. Paul Carter will discuss the launch in more detail. Moving to other advances in hepatitis C, FDA granted a PDUFA date of October 10, for the single tablet regimen of once-daily combination of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection in adults, and also advised us that an advisory committee would probably not be necessary. In addition, the European Marketing Authorisation Application for ledipasvir/sofosbuvir has been validated and has been granted accelerated assessment by the European Medicines Agency, a designation for new therapies and medicines of major public interest. If approved, this STR could be available for marketing in EU by the end of 2014. On April 2, in a press release, topline data were disclosed from a Phase 3 study of sofosbuvir/ribavirin dosed for 12 weeks in genotype 2 hepatitis C infected patients in Japan. In this study, 98% of treatment na\u00efve and 95% of treatment experienced patients achieved SVR12. This study will support regulatory submission in Japan by mid-year. Earlier this month, at the 49th Annual European Association for the Study of the Liver, EASL, was held in London. At this meeting, new data on Gilead's products and liver diseases programs were presented in 15 oral talks and over 40 posters, including results from three Phase 3 studies, ION 1, 2 and 3 on the ledipasvir/sofosbuvir fixed-dose combination. Concurrently, the results of these three studies were also published online in the New England Journal of Medicine. Other presentations at EASL show that both, sofosbuvir/peg/riba and sofosbuvir/ledipasvir with or without ribavirin are viable regimens for the retreatment of patients who had failed previous regimens, including sofosbuvir and containing regimens. In these studies, retreatment resulted in SVRs of 74% to 100%. In addition, results from our Phase 2 study evaluating GS-5816, the next generation pan-genotypic NS5A inhibitor were presented. Treatment of patients with genotype 1 through 6 with GS-5816 with sofosbuvir for 72 weeks resulted in SVR12 rates of 86% to 100%. Initiation of Phase 3 studies of a fixed-dose combination of GS-5816 and sofosbuvir are expected later this year. Earlier this month, WHO published guidelines on screening, care and treatment of persons with HCV infection. This quick action by the World Health Organization signals recognition of the recent advancements in the treatment of hepatitis C. Now, turning to HIV. The two Phase 3 studies comparing the single tablet regimen of ECF TAF in Stribild in treatment na\u00efve patients are fully enrolled and we expect data to become available in the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition, this STR is being evaluated in a number of other studies, including treatment experience patients, patients on stable therapy, who are switched to ECF TAF, patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment and also in adolescent patients. We currently anticipate filing for U.S. and European approval of ECF TAF in the first quarter of 2015 for na\u00efve, experienced and switch indications. In oncology, we continue to prepare for the potential approval and launch of idelalisib. The relapsed CLL application was assigned a priority review with a PDUFA date of August 6, and the relapsed refractory iNHL application was assigned a standard review with the PDUFA date of September 11. As I mentioned earlier, I am proud of what the team has accomplished with the launch of Sovaldi, and I also want to acknowledge the contributions on other important activities by more than 6,000 employees at Gilead. I will now turn the call over to Paul Carter. Paul Carter : Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. In the first quarter of 2014, our worldwide total net product revenue increased to $4.9 billion, representing growth of 104% over the prior quarter of last year. U.S. sales exceeded $3.6 billion and for the very first time European sales exceeded $1 billion in a single quarter. This performance has been driven mainly by healthy demand in our core HIV business and the launch of Sovaldi, which itself had sales totaling $2.3 billion in the quarter. Off that number, $2.1 billion represent the U.S. sales and most of the remaining revenue came from Germany and France. We had Sovaldi sales in 13 countries worldwide and that number will continue to increase as regulatory approvals and reimbursements are achieved. Beginning with the United States and HIV, underlying demand was healthy for all products. Nine out of 10 patients new to treatment were prescribed the Gilead medicine, with Gilead's single-tablet regimen being used by seven out of 10 patients new to treatment. Stribild continued to be the leading HIV regimen for patients that were beginning therapy, capturing three out of 10 prescription growth that Gilead's single-tablet regimens, including Stribild, Complera and Atripla is just under 20% year-over-year. ADAP purchasing in the first quarter was strong, consistent with expectations for the last quarter and ADAP fiscal year. During our fourth quarter call, we highlighted that approximately $130 million to $150 million of our fourth quarter revenue were related to inventory build across the supply chain to yearend. In the first quarter, as expected, we saw a drawdown at this inventory, as the big 3 wholesalers' inventory levels declined to near the bottom of established ranges. In addition, we also saw a drawdown by sub-wholesalers. This is in fact a similar dynamic to that which we've seen in first quarter over the past several years. This collected inventory drawdown resulted in a sequential decline in HIV net product revenue. The underlying demand for Gilead HIV product is however strong and growing, especially for our newest single-tablet regimen Stribild and Complera. Moving to U.S. hepatitis C performance. Sovaldi sales of $2.1 billion show strong patient demand and the increased inventory levels necessary to support this demand across the supply chain. Since launch, approximately 30,000 patients have begun treatment for hepatitis C with Sovaldi and these have come from all the main pair groups. The first patient who began 12 weeks of treatment around the time of approval last December have yet to reach the timeframe, when they can achieve an SVR12, which occur the further 12 weeks after completing treatment. Nevertheless, we continue to hit positive reports from physicians about their experience with Sovaldi. The prescribing of Sovaldi in the U.S. has been driven mainly by hepatologists and gastroenterologists, but internal medicine specialists and primary care physicians, many of them also treat HIV patients have also prescribed. Despite the broad spectrum, we estimate that only half of the physicians visited by our therapeutic specialist have prescribed Sovaldi to date. This leaves us optimistic about the opportunity that lies ahead. In fact, with an estimated 1.7 million diagnosed patients in the U.S. and around 400,000 under treated care, we have to take just a small fraction of those who can benefit from treatments in the future. The genotype distribution of patients that have received treatment is representative of the U.S. HCV population. With around 70% usage in genotype 1 and the majority of this usage is being with the so called NEUTRINO regimen or a 12 week regimen in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. On the payer front, access to Sovaldi has been as we expected, with its formulary status consistent with our experience in HIV reimbursement. Most commercial, Part D and state Medicaid plans take full six months to review new drugs. Turning to Europe. We are very pleased with our strong HIV performance, which like the U.S. is underpinned by our belief in the benefit the patients of single-tablet regimen. Eviplera is the most prescribed regimen for treatment na\u00efve HIV patient and also continue to expand its lead over Atripla as the regimen most commonly switch to in the big 5 European market. By the end of the first quarter, we have launched Stribild in 19 countries across Europe. This includes recently in France, which represents the biggest single HIV market in the EU. It is also just this month been launched in Italy, so is now available to patients in all of the European Union big five market. I would like to highlight that in early launched countries like Germany, the performance of Stribild has been approximately double out of Eviplera at the same time point. Regional reimbursement in Spain and Italy is expected to continue to roll out during the rest of the year. Moving to Hepatitis C. The European sales for Sovaldi totaled a $164 million in the quarter. While Sovaldi has regulatory approval in the European Union, full pricing and reimbursement, is a country-by-country process with some countries completing that process more quickly than others. Today we have reimbursement in Germany, Austria, Sweden, Finland and to some extent France. As mentioned in the prior earnings call, we have filed health economic dossiers with all the major reimbursement agencies and we are following the normal process that leads to price and reimbursement approvals. In France, after completing or completion of the temporary authorization for use or ATU program, but prior to completion of full reimbursement stages, we continue to provide Sovaldi to patients who have pre and post-liver transplant and also patients with advanced liver disease who have failed other HCV treatments or are interferon intolerant. This is in line with the ATU scope and will widen when full reimbursement is agreed. In the U.K., the National Health Service in England has recently issued a statement confirming that they have approved the filing to Sovaldi for approximately 500 patients. Notably, this is funding pre-NICE approval and recognizes the urgent need for Sovaldi for sicker patients. The European Association for the Study of the Liver or EASL, just last week published their clinical practice guidelines on the management of HCV infections. Sovaldi is recommended in combination with other agents across all genotypes as well as in several difficult-to-treat groups. These EASL guidelines come soon after newly issued guidelines in Germany and France, which also both recommend Sovaldi. Outside of North America and Europe, we continue to expand our geographic footprint. I would like to highlight that we are making good progress building out our Gilead organization in Japan in the anticipation of sofosbuvir approvals during 2015. In closing, I'd like to provide an update on our commercial readiness for oncology. As John mentioned, we have filed for regulatory approval in both the U.S. and EU for idelalisib for using iNHL and CLL. We have completed hiring the U.S. therapeutics specialist team and have fully trained in end-markets. So we are ready and excited to launch idelalisib. A similar process is being followed in Europe consistent with anticipated regulatory and reimbursement timelines. I'd now like to hand the call over to Robin. Robin Washington : Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon everyone. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for our first quarter 2014 were $1.48. Total revenues for the first quarter were $5 billion, up 97% year-over-year. As Paul mentioned, similar to prior year's strong wholesaler and sub-wholesaler purchases in anticipation of January 1 price increases for HIV and cardiopulmonary products results in an inventory drawdown in the first quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 87.4%, up from 74.5% largely driven by Sovaldi sales and an favorable HIV product mix. Sovaldi's impact to gross margin is a combination of Sovaldi revenues as a percent of total net product revenue and the geographic mix of these revenues, which were 92% U.S. sales in the first quarter. Product gross margin for our HIV franchise was favorably impacted, primarily by lower Atripla revenues. Turning to expenses year-over-year. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were up $98 million reflecting the progression of clinical study activity, primarily in oncology and HIV. Non-GAAP SG&A spending was up $167 million to support the ongoing lunches of Sovaldi in the U.S. and in cautionary as well as the anticipated launch of idelalisib. Cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion. During the quarter, we raised $4 billion in debt financing for general corporate purposes, including repayment of debt, working capital and share repurchases. We also repaid $840 million in debt from previous finances and purchased $450 million in shares. Finally, we are reiterating full year 2014 guidance, which excludes Sovaldi product sales and is outlined on Slide 45. The metrics we provided in February for the impact of Sovaldi product sales still applies to our full year results and includes the following estimates. Non-GAAP product gross margin will increase by approximately 0.75% to 1% for every $1 billion of Sovaldi sales and non-GAAP effective tax rate will decrease approximately 0.75% to 1% for every $1 billion of Sovaldi sales. In closing, we look forward to updating you on our continued progress in the coming months. We would now like to open the call for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Geoffrey Meacham with JPMorgan. Geoffrey Meacham - JPMorgan: So there's been a lot of payer noise, obviously a lot lately. So I just wanted to get you guys perspective on how you think you could change kind of the conversation from cost benefit to sort of the value of a payer, and this would be for public and private payers. Are there any sort of pharmacoeconomic studies that you guys are doing coming out or just help us a little bit with how to deal with a lot of the headlines that we've been seeing almost everyday from commercial payers and government payers? John Milligan : Geoff, its John Milligan. So, yes, there is a number of things, I think it's important that we talk about. First and foremost, the value of a cure I tend to think it's under estimated in terms of the overall advantage to the healthcare system receives from it. And I do know, as we have talked to doctors and certainly the tone coming out of EASL has been one of greater understanding of the value that it provides to patients and healthcare systems. And then, in fact, HCV patients cost a lot of money. The all cost mortality, the overall healthcare cost for an HCV patient is very high. And we are seeing more and more papers now being written on this, as there is a possibility of curing a larger number of patients. And so we do think that's an important part of the dynamic of talking about this, and also talking about the priorities that healthcare systems will likely make as they do choose to treat certain patients now and for certain patients to later. And these will be difficult conversations, but important ones for doctors and the payer community and public health officials to undertake, as they understand the benefit that they get and try to outline the timeframe from which they wish to tackle this very difficult problem of trying to eradicate HCV from as much of the population as we can. And so we will be talking quite heavily about these things. There are publications out there not by Gilead, but by respected people in the field, who understand this very well and whoever can start these conversations and more of an academic collegiate way. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group : I was just wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about -- I mean there has been this conversation out there, but perhaps restricting over time the access for the drug, the patients that are perhaps the most at need, people talk about certain levels of fibrosis. I'd love to get your perspective on that, if you think that that is medically and what your view on that is if you think if that's medically appropriate? And then on the commercial side, just the same question by the way. Do you have any statistics on the market that might help us understand what percentage of patients are F3 and F4, so that we can sort of run those scenarios through our models? Norbert Bischofberger : I am going to try to answer the first question. So with regards to the price and volume and the overall cost, there are four points to make. The first one is that regimen cost of Sovaldi/peg/riba for 12 weeks is not dissimilar from standard of care, either simeprevir or [ph] faldaprevir or peg/riba for the respective period of time. Number two, Sovaldi provide shorter treatment durations, higher cure rates and is better tolerated. So there is the value. But the value goes beyond just treating hepatitis C, there is value, as John Milligan mentioned, there is more disease in HCV that is non-hepatic. So if you look at the extra Hepatic mortality, non-HCV related is much higher in the HCV infected population than the control group. Thirdly, curing somebody for hepatitis C has benefits that go beyond the liver. It's recognized now that hepatitis C is a chronic inflammatory condition that over time leads to more diabetes, more heart disease, more CNS disease and you could certainly reasonably argue curing somebody of their hepatitis C infection has collateral benefits that go beyond the liver. And we've actually shown that in our own Phase 3 studies. It's a result that's somewhat underappreciated. We have looked at PRO, patient reported outcomes, and we have shown in a blind fashion that the people in the studies that achieve an SVR, they had much better outcomes than those that didn't. And the better outcomes were they felt better, they had less bodily pain and they had even better mental health status. And we're working as John Milligan said, in putting all of this together into a bigger pharmacoeconomic argument, but to summarize a short answer to your question, I do not believe its medically to prioritize and restrict the cure of hepatitis C. It maybe necessary economically and that's what is going to address. Paul Carter : Mark, it's actually, this launch is absolutely unprecedented as we've already sort of agreed I think. The data coming in and the kind of patients sort of being treated is not absolutely clear yet. I mean, we got a sense of the genotype, but we don't have a good sense about the severity of fibrosis scores. We have, call it, a sort of qualitative anecdotal comments coming in, but I don't think I'm in a position really to say that proportion of F3 and F4s. I would get it's about maybe 30% or 40%, but that's just a personal guess. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Sanford Bernstein. Geoff Porges - Sanford Bernstein : So I suppose I better change the direction just a little bit Robin. Given the cash flow that you reported in the quarter and the new debt you've taken on in a position to be pretty aggressive about either share buybacks or anything else that you would like to do, and yes, the share buyback in the quarter was relatively modest. Could you give us some sense of your thinking about how that might play out? What you'd like to be doing with your cash? How you view the stock here for the balance of the year, because I think that's something that people are starting to ask? Robin Washington : Absolutely, Geoff. Thanks for the question. I mean our plan has always been to accelerate our repurchases, post the launch of Sovaldi. So you could definitely expect to see larger share repurchases, cash flows and recent debt raise. We have the liquidity to be able to do that. And as you mentioned just given our current stock prices something that we would be able to take further advantage of and reduce the number of shares outstanding. Geoff Porges - Sanford Bernstein : Robin, do you have sort of goal in terms of percentage of cash flow or amount of cash that you'd like to deploy? Robin Washington : Not at this point, Geoff. We haven't kind of recalibrated to that. We haven't provided guidance. Again, I'd say, definitely it will be north or higher. But we haven't necessarily rethought our capital strategy, where I can give you a percentage of free cash flow at this point in time. Operator : Your next question comes from Matthew Roden with UBS Securities. Matthew Roden - UBS Securities : So I also want to change directions, Norbert, maybe a pipeline question for you. When I look across your pipeline programs here in your slides, it really striking how many indications maybe addressable with Simtuzumab? So I was just wondering if you can review why you think that that's a drug, what the cadence of readouts will be across the indications? And then lastly, is there any of these Phase 2 readouts could possibly from the basis of an early filing in any of the indications? Norbert Bischofberger : Simtuzumab was always the preclinical data strongly supported both fibrosis and solid tumors, and lots of [indiscernible] involved than necessary in both and expressed to high levels and both. So we decided to enter solid tumors. We chose pancreatic and colorectal cancer. And we chose to go into fibrosis and we chose IPF in Liver. And I have to say, all of these studies were done so that when if we see a spectacular effect, that we could potentially file with the Phase 2 data. For instance, the liver study, as I stressed many times, it's powered on HPVT, hepatic venous pressure gradient, that's an approval endpoint according to FDA and NASH, under accelerated approval guidelines. And the IPF study is similarly powered that we could file with the Phase 2 data, if the data is good. So you know, we feel very comfortable with the program. I know it looks like a lot when you look at the slide, but it's certainly a risk worth taking, this Simtuzumab if it works, it could be a really big drug, a successful drug for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen. Phil Nadeau - Cowen: I did want to circle back on to the payers, just for a bit. Could you give us more of a sense of how the negotiations are going, so how many of your target accounts are currently under contract and how does the progress compare to kind of where you thought you would be at this point in time in the launch? Paul Carter : Well, we can't tell you too much is the honest truth, because we're in negotiation, but everything is pretty much in line with our expectation and our experience with HIV and other drug. So we're in negotiations. We're making good progress. And that's really all I can say at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets : My question is as it relates to sustainability. First part of question is in Europe, I think some of the feedback was that based on the way the budgets are obviously run that one way to control it under a line item annualized budget is to limit it to more of the sicker patients. I guess the first question, do you expect that to happen and should that be your expectation for our revenue models? But the second part of that is that's also creates a longer tale. Do you expect that that could at some point happen in the United States, does that create a longer tale? How should we think sustainability and as it relates to what you're going to see in Europe? Paul Carter : Michael, this is Paul here. I think you've got it in one there. Its how to going to be big in short-term or it's going to be longer-term and less each year and I think the European markets, market-by-market have their own economic circumstances. A lot of the Southern European countries that you're fully aware have really tight squeezes on their healthcare budgets. And they will have to probably prioritize patients at this point or significantly increase the amount of money going into Hepatitis C. So I think we're very confident in our clinical position and the science and our pipeline. So to us, we're very, very comfortable about it. But I think you're right, it's going to be spread out in Europe, typically some of the Southern European countries over a longer time period. Norbert Bischofberger : Michael, I would like to add something also in this pharma-economic debate and that is that there was a paper published in 2012 in hepatology that looked at the cost of caring for a Hepatitis C infected person and what is apparent from that paper that the cost of not treating is fairly substantial, and actually that paper claims it ranged from $7,000 for a cirrhotic early disease patient to $42,000 per year for somebody with end-stage lever disease. Those are the annual cost of just doctor visits, tests and other care. So that clearly has to be entered into this debate also, although I'm not sure how much of that is applicable to Europe, the cost might be different there. This was a really large U.S. study. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo. Brian Abrahams - Wells Fargo : Coming out of the full data presentations and publications for IM1, IM2 and IM3, what your sense as to how physicians might be thinking about optimizing duration of therapy for the overall across different patient groups. For instance, how much eight week usage might expect among treatment na\u00efve genotype 1? How much longer than 12 week usage amongst the treatment experienced cirrhotic? And I'm curious how this as well as some of the current reimbursement buzz we're hearing about factors into your pricing decision for the fixed=-dose combo? John Martin : Brian, let me answer the first questions, then Paul will talk about the price issue. So we have proposed in our regulatory filing that eight week treatment duration should be for everybody who is treatment na\u00efve and non-cirrhotic. People who are treatment experienced and/or cirrhotic will 12 weeks of treatment and this is really based that thought process. This follows a thought process where we asked ourselves if we take everybody 12 weeks, how many of the patients would be over treated, would get more than they need. And there were way too many, was north of 90% depending on which population you looked at. And if you were in London, you may remember, [indiscernible] who did one of our IM presentations. He actually mentioned this at the podium. And given the fact that you can't justify not medically, but certainly not economically over treating patients that for one-third of the duration, they need only 8 weeks, but they get a 12. That I think is a reasonable proposal. And our of course it has too to be agreed upon with regulatory authorizes, but that was our proposal in the filings that we have made. John Milligan : And I guess, I'll take the second part, this is John Milligan, again. So just thinking about, your question was what do we take into account where putting the price of Sovaldi and Sovaldi was I think price appropriately based on the benefit that it provides today, but we were aware that a significant percentage of patients, particularly those with low risk factors, a new to therapy could benefit from eight weeks in the future with the combination of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. So we did think about this very heavily as we weighed into our debate on what the final price of Sovaldi would be and of course it will weigh into our picking on the next generation of pricing as well as we mature to no ribavirin, no interferon simple regimens for shorter duration still and so we will provide additional benefit to those medications that we have taken always into account as we think through pricing strategies. Operator : Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Citigroup. Yaron Werber - Citigroup: Two questions. One give us a little bit of sense, if you look at the IMS data, which we know on the reports, I mean you've sort of beat at the top end of that handedly, so was there any stalking? And then two, give us a little bit of a sense, what's going on in the VA and in the prison systems. So how much usage are you seeing in those verticals? And if you don't mind, what's your strategy, how to deal with pricing in those verticals, especially if it gets more competitive? Paul Carter : I think there is three questions. So Robin, do you want to start. Robin Washington : Yaron, we're only 17 weeks in, in our market at this point and our IMA agreement are not totally inter-passed as we've previously communicated in case of Sovaldi nine months or so to fully get through that process. So while we know that inventory was build this quarter, it is difficult for us to fully quantify it at this point in time in the launch. But I would say, as we continue to get more clarity around demand et cetera going forward, we'll be better able to provide that in the future, but I would say there is inventory, but unfortunately we're not able to quantify it at this point. John Martin : Maybe I'll just add a couple of comments on VA. So Sovaldi was added to the VA National Formulary during the first week of April. And ultimately be a potentially the largest federal purchaser of healthcare for Hepatitis C in the U.S. We haven't seen a huge amount of orders come in yet, but this is really because it's very, very early days for them. In the prison system, Federal Bureau of Prisons is updating basically the treatment guidelines and we understand those are going to be released imminently and we do anticipate that Sovaldi will be included in those guidelines. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Barclays Capital. Ying Huang - Barclays Capital : Firstly, can you give us a little bit idea in terms of the payer mix you saw in first quarter? How many patients taking Sovaldi are insured by commercial insurers and then how many coming from Medicare, how many coming from Medicaid? And then also would you mind giving us also the so called growth net adjustment for the first quarter sales of Sovaldi? Paul Carter : So again, its very early days and our data to some extent is reflecting that. We think about 90% of our business so far in the first quarter has come from both the private and the Medicare sector. And I think that that's probably split roughly half and half. Medicaid is about 70% and the rest is the small balance left over. Robin Washington : Relative to growth to net, again similar to Paul's response, it's still very early in the launch and as he previously described we're still in the midst of contracting process. So I would say our growth to net percentage now is not necessarily predicted of what it would be going forward, but it is lower, lower than HIV and kind of lower than we project the whole year to be? Paul Carter : Yes, the mix will change at a time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank : So on this whole concept of prioritizing patients by fibrosis, how would that be implemented? Would it be implemented by the doctor potentially or could it be forced by the payer, and in conjunction with that how do payers and doctors view eight weeks versus 12 weeks. And is eight week an advantage, if you're in that situation where you have prioritization by fibrosis score. Paul Carter : So there is a healthy, I'm not sure it's healthy, I see tension between payers and clinicians I think at this point. And it's clear that some payers are trying to restrict or prioritize patients with say higher fibrosis scores or sicker patients. And I think clinicians are some times taking a different view of that and it's very hard for us to see how that's worked out from here, but we do hope that the clinician and the science prevails, but over time we're pretty confident that would be the case as payers starts to get used to and to predict better the volumes of patients that require treatment. Norbert Bischofberger : The other equation is an interesting one that maybe I could summarize it by something that a well-respected thought leader told me. He said, he would prefer 12 weeks of treatment over eight, simply because it is something that's really safe, well-tolerated, why not go for the safe path and give them 12 weeks, it's not that much more. But then he went on to say that he is ultimately not the one that will make that decision, but that decision will probably be made for him by the payers. And how that's exactly worked operationally, I'm unsure, but that's probably what we're thinking. Operator : Your next question comes from Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse. Ravi Mehrotra - Credit Suisse : Obviously you are now in very different league from a sales perspective, the market cap perspective, and actually a future-pipeline needs perspective in the long-term. Cognizant to that, you got a lowest R&D budgets, yet the highest operating margin. So philosophically how do you think about R&D and B&D in the long-term to fill out your long-term pipeline? John Milligan : Our R&D as a percentage of sales has been down fairly dramatically this quarter as you know, which means you can't grow that up to a level that might be more appropriate for a company with the sales levers we're seeing in a very short period of time. It takes a long time to hire the people and to put thoughtful programs into place. So with regard to R&D, our philosophy is simple, would be to continue to grow, but to grow a reasonable sustainable pace as we add more pogroms and as things mature from research into development. We're seeing quite a number of those happening this year and that I think is quite exciting for us. In terms of BD, it's somewhat of a similar issue, we're looking for to licensing programs, but we can only grow so fast based on a number of people we have, the complexity of the business and also just the capability of bringing in and bringing programs in and then doing a very good job on them. So I think we've got a very full pipeline right now. I think it's going to be a thoughtful way forward as we grow the company, and I think we have most of what we need to continue to grow this company for years to come. So that would be very, what I call very targeted kinds of transactions that can help further us along. John Martin : And if may add something, John, we're going to continue to be disciplined about all of this just because we have more money available, it doesn't mean we're going to spend it. The science has to be right and the medical need has to be right, that's when we're going to do it and not in any other -- under any other scenario. Operator : Your next question comes from Ian Somaiya with Nomura Securities. Ian Somaiya - Nomura Securities : On the fast launch, had a question regarding, again, on the pricing front, and actually just wanted to revisit maybe some prior comments that you have made in terms of how we should think about pricing for the combination, specifically that most of the value that was being derived from Sovaldi and that's the way we should think about from a pricing perspective that most of the contribution from price would be from Sovaldi and there would some incremental value or cost associated with the second drug. So I wanted to gets your thoughts on that whether that still holds? And related question is the conversations that we have with payers are not really focused on Sovaldi on its own, they're focused on the combination and the price point they all seem to have in the mind, whether we think about the U.S. payers or European is the off-label usage of Alicio and Sovaldi and the $150,000 of our price point, but if you could just sort of comment on those things that would be really appreciated? John Milligan : Ian its John Milligan. It's always difficult to talk about pricing. And let's not forget, we don't have approvals for those products. But as you know as you think about it there were natural limits on what I think is appropriate for a next generation products. And for example, with 5885, we're essentially replacing pegylated interferon and ribavirin, which over a 12-week duration is much less expensive for example than Sovaldi. So first of all it is the driver, the value in that combination. And then I tend to think about it in that sort of way. And so I think you're right. People are concerned about the combinations of things like Alicio and Sovaldi. And that's really not how we're thinking about next generation products. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joel Sendek with Stifel. Joel Sendek - Stifel: I had a question about just the duration of therapy that you're seeing so far. You mentioned about the use with interferon in Roche's report that the sale of the peg didn't really got that much. So I'm wondering if can you just help us with the average duration for example, how many patients or what percentage are on the 24 week Sovaldi ribavirin regimen as opposed to the 12 week combination then what we would expect for the trend in that duration over the next couple of months? Paul Carter : The data we have is only for the U.S. We think about 70% of patient's are genotype 1 and also 70% -- we think about 65% to 70% are on so called NEUTRINO regimen at 12 weeks of sofosbuvir plus peg/riba. So I think that that's 12 week piece, the 24 week piece we're not at all sure on. John Martin : The combination of patients who are on genotype 2 taking 12 weeks and genotype 3 who are taking 24 weeks, but anyway you doing the math with the shorter duration and a high percentage of patients now taking non-interferon-based regimens is not surprising that the interferon sales are declining. Paul Carter : We think there is about, the U.S. so far around about 7% to 30,000 have been genotype 3. Operator : Your next question comes from Jim Birchenough with BMO Capital. Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital : Just a question, as you think about potential competitors coming in later in the year and into next year. Is there anything you can do with payers right now to try and preempt what could be price competition and aggressive discounting just to preserve some level of pricing in this market? John Milligan : Well, Jim, it's not generally prudent to talk about strategies in public, so that others know what you're doing. So I'm going to decline making any comments on that. Although I do note that it looks to us based on today's filing of the AbbVie regimen with the five drug regimen that they're putting out there, that we should have a considerable leads to market from where they are, since they are over two months behind us in terms of their filing, so that could be an advantage for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Howard Liang with Leerink. Howard Liang - Leerink: Can you talk about what next in HCV? There's some chatter out of EASL that your dataset in cirrhotic patients now is as big as AbbVie, do you have a plan to do a cirrhotic study? And then also what's the next the regimen you take to Phase 3 in HCV? John Martin : I'm not sure I understood all your question. You were asking about the comparability of AbbVie's cirrhotic population results with ours? Howard Liang - Leerink: You've got a big enough -- do you need another study dedicated to cirrhotic patients? John Martin : Well, I think we have answered the question. AbbVie chose to do a separate cirrhotic study. We have included our cirrhotic patients, and by the results were in that population, AbbVie had 88% and then our subpopulation of treatment experienced cirrhotic patient was 86%, so a similar number. The only thing to remember is AbbVie didn't have experienced patient, really as experienced patients in their study, we did. So comparing the two studies is a difficult thing to do, you'll have to do a head-to-head study. And I think you asked about what's next about, the thing would be 5816. So what we have now filed ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for genotype 1 and we're repeating this now with a pan-genotypic NS5A inhibitor in as GS-5816, which would be the one pill, once daily for everybody for all genotypes. We're finishing up some studies, one the result was disclosed at EASL by Emerson, that show it works against all genotype sofosbuvir GS-5816 combination. We still have with data are coming in right now on the same regimen cirrhotic and we're also looking at shorter treatment durations. When all of that is in we'll make a decision to go in Phase III some time in the second half of this year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison - Morgan Stanley : I wanted to ask a little bit back on the payer side and we've heard some commentary out of some of the payers that have already reported about sort of patient volumes and UNH was one of them and they had suggested that based on patient volumes, we're actually peeking for them in the first quarter. So I guess I was wondering, a, if you agree with that? And then, b, sort of as it related to that, what kind of information do you need where you feel like you'll be in a position to give us Sovaldi guidance. John Milligan : So Matthew, its John Milligan. In terms of the patient numbers, I mean you see the prescription rates as much as we do. We don't necessarily know where those patients come from, so I can't speak to the United Health population whether that is an accurate portray all or not, I assume they know more than we do about those patients and their system. But as Paul had talked about we have less than 50% of physicians who can prescribe Sovaldi, who have prescribed Sovaldi. And so we also look at the fraction of patients who've been treated relative to the total patients and it's relatively small. In a typical year about 60,000 patients are treated, near about 30,000 last quarter, and so that put us certainly in a faster pace than the last few years, but certainly far below some of the peak years and well over 140,000 patients were treated. So for one believes there are many, many patients out there who will continue to seek some Sovaldi therapy or who might be looking forward to the combination therapy, as we get later into the year. So I think there is plenty of opportunity out there for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Thomas Wei with Jefferies & Company. Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company: I wanted to ask a little bit about some of the discussion at EASL on the EU countries banding together potentially buying antivirals beyond pandemic vaccines and your take on. How likely is something like that to happen and how the mechanics of that might work? Any insights that you have to share would be very helpful? Paul Carter : I think this is a wonderful idea and if it could work, it will be great, because we could have one price and access at the same time across Europe. But as we've often said, you can't change a thousand years of history, and if Europe ever managed to get back together on this, I would be absolutely amazed. So that's really my point of view on it. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Skorney with Robert Baird. Brian Skorney - Robert Baird : Let me congratulate you and maybe then one up by saying I think this was actually the biggest single quarter for a pharmaceutical product in U.S. history. It's probably tied I think a couple of quarters in '06 with Lipitor. But anyway, I just wanted to know kind of got going off of John's comments about the number of patients that are out there. Do you have any sense that there is a warehousing going on ahead of all approval? I mean it just seems with six months to go before interferon is totally out of the equation that it'd be a little bit of -- there won't be much rationale for starting non-symptomatic na\u00efve patients. So do you anticipate a depth in new prescriptions in the coming months and anticipation of that? And do you have any kind of guidance on what sort of acceleration we might anticipate post the launch of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir? John Martin : It's very hard to determine, if there is warehousing, except by talking to physicians, and we've talked to some of the top KOLs, and it's clear that they are thinking they would like to hold back some of their less sick patients to put them on all oral therapies later on the year. But as I mentioned there is a whole host of the middle-tier physicians, people who don't attend, so who are just now becoming Sovaldi prescribers, who seem to be having a very good experience. And we don't get any sense that they are all that aware of the next generation coming out or that they wish to slowdown their own practices in order to wait for business later on the year. So I kind of doubt that those physicians would have significant amounts of warehousing, and in fact could likely accelerate their use of Sovaldi as they get into the second part of this year. Operator : Mr. O'Brien, we have time for one more question. Your final question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs : Just two quick ones from me. John, I was just wondering on the prescriber mix, you mentioned you reached out about 50% or 50% of the targeted audience prescribed. Can you tell us what historically they represent in terms of volumes for those 50%? And then the second question was just, any early feedback on the DTC campaign and what metrics are you guys using there to evaluate the effectiveness of that program? John Martin : These are getting into the middle-decile of the doctors represent that mix, where they'll exclude the lower tiers, because we tend not to hit those decile one and two doctors frequently. But it's a real middle mix of these doctors who are geographically difficult to get to in some cases and some times could be difficult to see. So that is a really good piece of business for us as well. And the second question was the DTC -- Paul Carter : DTC campaign. We really don't have any idea if the unbranded campaign of awareness have had an impact other than a few anecdotes of patients calling their physicians. I think give the stronger than expected early demands, those campaigns, of course, are being rolled back very substantially and you'll see less and less of that in the coming weeks and months. Patrick O'Brien: Thank you, Stephanie, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and the team here looks forward to providing you with updates and future progress. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference.

My name is Samiya, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only-mode and as a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patrick O'Brien: Thank you, Sam. Good afternoon, everyone. We issued a press release this afternoon providing earnings results for the second quarter, which is available on our Web site where you can also find detailed slides that support today's call. For our prepared remarks and Q&A, I am joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John Martin; our President and Chief Operating Officer, John Milligan; our Executive Vice President of Research & Development, Norbert Bischofberger; our Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations, Paul Carter; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Robin Washington. Before we begin our formal remarks, we want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations, with respect to our product candidates and financial projections, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. We will also be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release as well as on our Web site. I would now like to turn the call over to John Martin. John Martin : Thank you, Patrick, and thank you all for joining us today. I am pleased with our progress and would like to highlight a number of key milestones achieved during the quarter. Just today the U.S. Food & Drug Administration approved Zydelig for the treatment of three B-cell malignancies, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular B-cell lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma. Zydelig is the first in our new class oral medicines that targets PI3K delta and we are pleased to provide this additional treatment option for patients. Moving to hepatitis C, the rapid adoption of Sovaldi reflects wide spread recognition across the medical community as the benefits of this break through products can brings two patients suffering from hepatitis C. Since approval more than 70,000 patients in United States and 10,000 patients in the EU have been treated with Sovaldi containing regimens. Sovaldi offers higher cure rates with shortened treatment duration at a cost that is comparable to that of alternative treatment options and for many patients who have failed treatment with older regimens Sovaldi provides a new possibility for a cure. Gilead has generated and is continuing to generate clinical data that support the scientific and medical evidence for treating hepatitis C as many stages of the disease. In fact across all our hepatitis C clinical studies over 6,000 patients have been treated and cured to-date. In Japan our new drug application has been submitted to Japan\u2019s pharmaceutical and medical devices agency for approval of sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of genotype 2 infected patients. In the Phase 3 study supporting this application, 97% of patients, dose for 12 weeks with sofosbuvir ribavirin achieving an SVR12, this filing represents Gilead\u2019s first drug application in Japan and they have approved Sofosbuvir would be the first product to be launched and marketed by Gilead in that country. Our innovation and investment in improving the treatment for hepatitis C continues with the single tablet regimen of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for patients infected with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus. FDA has assigned a PDUFA date of October 10th and the European Union approval is expected to come later in this year. In Japan the ledipasvir/sofosbuvir marketing authorization application will be filed in the fourth quarter of this year. This application will be supported by results of a Phase 3 clinical trial conducted in Japan in which genotype 1 infected patients were treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin for 12 weeks. 22% of the patients have cirrhosis. Overall the SVR12 rate was 99% and the cohort that received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir without ribavirin the SVR rate was 100%. Ensuring patient access to Sovaldi and all our medicines has been and will continue to be a top priority for Gilead. And we have been actively engaging with payors compelling the benefits of Sovaldi. In addition, we are committed to making Sovaldi available to patients in developed countries and have recently entered agreement with Egypt a country that has the highest presence of hepatitis C in the world. In HIV, the single-tablet regimen abbreviated ECF TAF is being evaluated in a number of studies including treatment experienced patients, patients on stable therapy switch ECF TAF, patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment as well as adolescents. Data from our two Phase 3 studies compared to ECF TAF to Stribild in treatment na\u00efve patients should become available in the third quarter of this year. We anticipate filing for U.S. and European marketing authorization of ECF TAF in the first quarter of 2015 for the treatment -- for the use in treatment naive, treatment experienced and renally impaired patients. TAF as a single agent is also being studied in chronic hepatitis B infection. Two studies in 1250 patients are 30% enrolled, one study is e-antigen positive and the other an e-antigen data of hepatitis B infected patients. We expect to complete enrollment of these studies around the end of this year. We have significant activities ongoing across other therapeutic areas as well. A number of studies of Simtuzumab, our investigation of monoclonal antibody to organic LOXL2 protein are ongoing in a variety of fibrotic diseases and solid tumors. The Phase 2 study and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is fully enrolled and data are expected in the middle of 2015. We also look forward to providing updates for the Simtuzumab studies in pancreatic and colorectal cancer and myelofibrosis before the end of the year. GS-9620, a TLR-7 agonist has been evaluated in our Phase 2 study as a potential cure for hepatitis B in with the first patients have been screened at the beginning of July. GS-5745, a MMP9 monoclonal antibody inhibitor is firmly in Phase 1 and has been explored in Ulcerative Colitis and solid tumors. The synergistic activity of Ranolazine in combination with dronedarone an Atrial Fibrillation and the activity of GS-6615 and long QT-3 syndrome were presented recently at the annual Heart Rhythm Society meeting. While I am only highlighting a few of our R&D accomplishments for this year I\u2019m very pleased with our high level of innovation and productivity I would like the thank the more than 6,000 employees at Gilead and our collaborators and partners around the world for their dedication and immeasurable contributions for the Company. Their work and commitment have enabled us to achieve a number of milestones across different therapeutic areas of the business. And importantly continue to bring life changing therapies to patients and communities of need. I would now like to turn the call over to Paul. Paul Carter :  Thanks John and good afternoon everyone. In the second quarter of 2014 our worldwide total net product revenue increased to $6.4 billion representing growth of a 141% over the second quarter last year. U.S. sales exceeded $4.8 billion and European sales exceeded 1.3 billion. This performance has been driven mainly by healthy demand in our HIV business and the uptake and stability which had sales totaling $3.5 billion. Of that number $3 billion represent U.S. sales with most of the rest of the remaining revenues coming from France and Germany. Patients are now being treated with Sovaldi in 34 countries worldwide and that number will continue to increase as further regulatory approvals and reimbursements are achieved. Beginning with the U.S. and HIV, prescription volume continued to grow on our HIV products. Nine out of 10 patients new to treatment were prescribed to Gilead medicine, with seven out of 10 receiving one of Gilead\u2019s TRUVADA-based single-tablet regimens. Of these Stribild continued to be the leading HIV regimen for patients who are beginning therapy, capturing three out of 10 stops. Prescription growth of Gilead\u2019s TRUVADA-based single-tablet regimens including Stribild, Complera and Atripla is 13% year-over-year. I\u2019m pleased to report that Stribild prescriptions alone grew 19% in quarter two over quarter one this year and Stribild is now approaching a $1 billion annual run rate in the U.S. ADAP purchasing in the U.S. was in line with expectations and historical norms and we did not see any unusual movements in wholesaler inventory levels. Moving to U.S. hepatitis C performance, Sovaldi sales of $3 billion showed strong patient demand and rapid adoption by physicians. We estimate that approximately 70,000 patients have now prescribed Sovaldi in U.S. since launch. The prescribing of Sovaldi in the U.S. has been driven mainly by hepatologists and gastroenterologists, but internal medicine specialists and primary care physicians, many of whom also treat HIV patients have also prescribed the treatment. Approximately 70% of the physicians visited by our therapeutic specialists have prescribed Sovaldi to-date. We are seeing signs that physicians have begun delaying treatment for some patients also known as warehousing in anticipation of the approval of the single-tablet regimen of the differences across the derivatives. The initial patients who started a Sovaldi-based treatment in the U.S. became aware they were cured late in the second quarter. Based on prescription data and our cure rates in Sovaldi clinical trials we estimate that around 9,000 individuals have been cured to-date and that number will continue to accelerate as the year goes on. Of the patients treated so far we believe that around 80% are new to therapy. The genotype distribution of patients that receive treatment is approximately representative of the U.S. HCV population with around 60% usage in genotype 1, 25% in genotype 2, 10% in genotype 3 and 5% in genotypes 4, 5 and 6 combined. We have noticed the reporting of an increased use of the interferon free regimen used in the Phase 2 Cosmos study comprised of Sovaldi with simeprevir and we estimate that during quarter two 70% of Sovaldi usage was in interferon free regimens including Cosmos. On the payor front most commercial Medicare policy and state Medicaid plans take a full six months to review new drugs and we\u2019re working with these plans to facilitate patient accessibility to Sovaldi. As anticipated we saw a slight shift in the payor mix in quarter two due to more patients from the BA and other non-retail coming on to treatment. As we exited the second quarter the overwhelming majority of state Medicaid all covering Sovaldi roughly half of them with a prior utilization to label and the other half with restrictions around fibrosis scores. Only three states are not covering Sovaldi pending completion of their review or the establishments of prior utilization criteria. In the U.S. we have one of the most comprehensive patient assistance programs in the industry to help ensure cost is not a barrier for patients. The components of that program include providing coupons to bring the co-pay down to as low as $5 per month and paying the entire cost for the eligible uninsured. We also provide financial support to an independent non-profit organization offering assistance to patients who cannot cover their out of pocket medication costs. Turning to Europe we are very pleased with our strong HIV performance again underscoring our confidence in the benefits of TRUVADA-based single-tablet regimens. Gilead single-tablet regimens have grown over 20% in volume year-over-year in the big five EU markets. Of these Eviplera is the most prescribed regimen for treatment naive HIV patients and also continues to extend its lead over Atripla as the most commonly switched to regimen. Despite the availability of generic fibrates in Europe 70% of switches out of Atripla in quarter two went to Eviplera which since the beginning of the year has been actively promoted to switch in most countries where approved. This again demonstrates the value of TRUVADA-based single-tablet regimens. In fact we have seen little impact to our business from generic fibrates so far. By the end of the second quarter we have sales from Stribild in 19 countries across Europe including all five EU big five markets. Stribild is now the second most prescribed regimen for switches after Eviplera, gaining most of these switches from previous protease inhibitor or raltegravir containing regimen. Moving to Hepatitis C, we estimate approximately 10,000 patients have now received treatment with Sovaldi in Europe, where sales were $400 million in quarter two. The vast majority of these patients are in France and Germany. While Sovaldi has regulatory approval in the EU the full pricing and reimbursement process varies by country, with some countries completing the process more quickly than others. Negotiations are ongoing in the majority of EU markets, indeed we have filed health economic dossiers with all the major reimbursement agencies and we\u2019re following the processes that lead to final price and reimbursement approval. In France Sovaldi was given high marks in a recent government health technology assessment in which it was recognized as demonstrating a high level of innovation and is recommended to reimbursement consistent with Sovaldi\u2019s label. While we are going through the rest of the pricing process with the French Ministry of Health we continue to make Sovaldi available to patients in the pre and post liver transplant setting and also for patients with advanced liver disease who failed other hepatitis C treatments or are interferon intolerant. This is in line with the temporary authorization for use or ATU score and is used for widening and full reimbursement is established. In Germany just last week the government AMNOG process completed its review of Sovaldi, also recognizing the additional benefit that it brings to patients. The AMNOG process will continue over the next month. In the UK the National Institute for Clinical Excellence or NICE has requested additional consultation before a final recommendation on reimbursement can be made. We are confident that upon the completion of the process NICE will be able to make a positive formal recommendation that acknowledges both the clinical and health economic benefits that Sovaldi can bring to the broader UK population. In the meantime the National Health Service in England has approved funding for approximately 500 people recognizing the urgent need to sicker patient. It is also worth noting that Sovaldi has pre-received a positive HTA review in Scotland and this has been accepted by the Scottish Medicines Consortium on the behalf of NHS Scotland.  In Australia Sovaldi was recently approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration or TGA and discussions for pricing and reimbursements are ongoing. Outside North America and Europe we continue to expand our geographic footprint, the build out of our Gilead organization in Japan is going according to plan, in anticipation of the approval of sofosbuvir in early 2015 and the single-tablet regimen of the difference we\u2019re supposed to get later in 2015. In closing I\u2019m excited to share that earlier today as John mentioned the FDA granted approval of Zydelig for use in three B-cell malignancies. Our U.S. commercial team has been prepared for this day and will immediately begin to promote Zydelig. We\u2019re very excited to have our first commercial product on oncology. The approvals in Europe are pending and our teams there will be ready for commercial launch consistent with the anticipated regulatory and reimbursement timelines. I\u2019d now like to turn over the call to Robin. Robin Washington :  Thanks Paul and good afternoon everyone. Total revenues for the second quarter were 6.5 billion, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $2.36. As Paul covered the key commercial drivers and performance for the quarter, I would like to briefly discuss Q2 inventory dynamics for our core business and our recent Sovaldi product launch. As mentioned during our Q1 earnings call, we experienced an inventory draw down in the first quarter for our HIV and cardio pulmonary products following strong wholesaler and sub-wholesaler purchases in December 2013 in anticipation of January 1st price increases. During the second quarter inventory levels remained at the low-end of the range as we did not see a rebuild of inventory within the channel. Turning to Sovaldi, we estimate the vast majority of U.S. sales for the second quarter were related to demand. Inventory across the supply chain for Sovaldi were at levels necessary to support demand during the quarter. And while the provisions for the inventory management agreements for Sovaldi with the big three wholesalers do not start until September; inventory levels were already within the range of those provisions as of the end of the quarter. As anticipated we have started to see some patient warehousing in advance of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir approval. If this warehousing continues it may have a downstream impact to Sovaldi inventory held in the distribution channel. Turning to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were up 54 million year-over-year reflecting increases in headcount to support clinical study activities, geographic expansion and marketed product support in addition to infrastructure costs related to expansion of our R&D activities. On a sequential basis, non-GAAP R&D expenses decreased 16 million to 542 million in the second quarter primarily as a result of the ramp down of Sovaldi and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir Phase 3 studies. During the second half of 2014 we expect non-GAAP R&D expense to increase relative to first half 2014 levels to support expansion of studies in HCV, HIV, inflammation and respiratory therapeutic areas. Non-GAAP SG&A spending was up 193 million year-over-year to support Sovaldi sales, ongoing geographic expansion and the anticipated approvals of our HCV fixed dose combination and idelalisib. On a sequential basis, non-GAAP SG&A increased by approximately 70 million driven primarily by the support of Sovaldi\u2019s launch. We expect continued and incremental investments in these areas in the second half of 2014. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter decreased to 14.6% primarily due to increased sales of Sovaldi and a cumulative touch up adjustment of 3.6 percentage points to the first quarter tax rate to reduce the year-to-date non-GAAP effective tax rate to 18.2%. We have included a reconciliation of this change on Slide 40 in the earnings deck. The first half revenue performance resulted in another strong quarter of cash flow from operations of 4.2 billion. This reflects strong collections in the current quarter and a larger than normal component of Q1 collections given the ramp of Q1 Sovaldi sales. As committed we increased our level of shareholder return this quarter by repurchasing 15.2 million shares, utilizing 1.2 billion in cash. As of June 30, we had 1.7 billion remaining on our 5 billion repurchase authorization from January 2011, which we will complete in the third quarter prior to its escalation in September 2014. In addition in May 2014, our Board approved an additional 5 billion in purchase authorization. During the quarter we repaid the remainder of outstanding May 2014 convertible notes as outlined on Slide 56. In first third quarter the warrants related to the May 2014 convertible debt will expire which if settled in cash will result in cash utilization of approximately 3.1 billion to 3.7 billion. Finally, we are updating full year 2014 guidance which is outlined on Slide 43, to include HCV revenues for 2014. We expect Gilead total net product sales to be in the range of 21 billion to 23 billion. I would like to caution you that it is very difficult to accurately predict revenues from HCV products, which are now included in our total net product sales. As a result, the following factors specific to HCV products could cause our net product revenues to be higher or lower than projected. These factors include the ledipasvir/sofosbuvir single-tablet regimen not being approved by the PDUFA date of October 10, 2014. The level and speed of market acceptance of the STR, the pricing and rate of reimbursement for the STR, the amount of patient warehousing and wholesaler inventory decreases prior to approval of the STR which could negatively impact sales of Sovaldi. And finally the launch timing and market acceptance of competitive drugs already on the market or scheduled to enter the market later this year. Turning to expense guidance, our non-GAAP product gross margin is expected to be in the range of 85% to 88%. We\u2019re increasing our non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in the range of 2.3 billion to 2.4 billion as we continue to invest in our pipeline. We\u2019re increasing our non-GAAP SG&A expenses to also be in the range of 2.3 billion to 2.4 billion, which assumes the continued build out and expansion of our commercial infrastructure in Europe and Asia to support HCV product launches and increased marketing and sales efforts related to the launch of our first oncology product. For the full year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 17.5% to 20.5%. As Congress has not extended the federal R&D tax credit for 2014, we have excluded the credit from our guidance. If the R&D tax credit is extended in 2014, we would expect an additional 0.4% reduction in our annual effective tax rate. We\u2019re anticipating the full year diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related restructuring and stock-based compensation expenses to be in the range of $0.63 to $0.66 per share. This range includes the full year effect of the amortization of end process R&D related to Sovaldi. Thank you and we look forward to updating you on our progress during our next call. We would now like to open the call for questions, operator? Question: and: Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, we will be taking a maximum of one question per person at a time. If you have further questions you are welcome to rejoin the queue. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Geoff Meacham :  So the cost benefits of Sovaldi seems pretty straight forward but there is still are a lot of public comments. So my question is there any color you can give us on the progress you\u2019re making in Washington or private payors in this front? And then very related, what can be done to more rapidly increase and have budgets in the space for Medicaid patients and also across Europe? Thanks.  JPMorgan:  So the cost benefits of Sovaldi seems pretty straight forward but there is still are a lot of public comments. So my question is there any color you can give us on the progress you\u2019re making in Washington or private payors in this front? And then very related, what can be done to more rapidly increase and have budgets in the space for Medicaid patients and also across Europe? Thanks. John Milligan : Geoff its John Milligan. Yes that\u2019s a complicated question that you gave us there. So a number of things are being done of course, we have had a number of healthcare economic outcome research programs that we\u2019ve commissioned and have published. We\u2019re talking about the revalue of Sovaldi. There is clearly a lively debate within the press. There is a lively debate within the payer community and of course the interest of Washington on this. It is just now really that we\u2019re starting to see some of the benefits of Sovaldi and we\u2019ve been talking about this during the script, the fact that we can estimate that over 9,000 patients have now being cured in our commercial programs, that we\u2019ve cured over 6,000 patients across a wide range of disease stage in HCV and our hepatitis clinical trial programs. And we\u2019re starting to see some of these benefits. So this is the leading edge of benefit that you will see and that will clearly accelerate as we get into later in the years, more and more patients will have reach that important time point of 12 weeks past of their treatment periods. So I think there\u2019ll be a positive momentum and a positive series of stories coming out of that which will be quite helpful. Of course the discussions with the payors center around the volumes that they are seeing. I don\u2019t think anybody disagrees with the fact that Sovaldi is a remarkable drug, it\u2019s been called an outlier in some segments, I agree with it. It\u2019s an outlier, because we\u2019re curing people of horrible disease in a very rapid timeframe and that\u2019s a very unusual thing for payors to think about. So we have noticed some positive movement of some payors indicated that they have budget in the second half of this year for this product, that is not been universal but we\u2019re in discussions with them and talking about Sovaldi use and importantly the next generation product ledipasvir, sofosbuvir coming forward. Interestingly, if you picked up on Paul\u2019s script, we\u2019ve noticed that the interferon regimens are becoming increasingly important. I think it is important that a high percentage of patients to be getting Sovaldi plus simeprevir indicating that all regimens are being approved by the payors and are considered important part of the way to treat these diseases going forward. As it\u2019s a long answer to your long question. And the final part with regard to things like the Senate we of course are complying with their request for information and look forward to the opportunities to discuss the value of Sovaldi with members of the senatorial staff. Operator : Thank you, our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Bernstein; your line is now open. Geoffrey Porges - Bernstein:  Thank you very much and congratulations again also on a remarkable quarter. Just a question on timing so, you mentioned the October 10 PDUFA dates for the fixed dose combination and that\u2019s a eight months review cycle from filing and it has been given breakthrough status. So, is there anything going on in your interactions with the agency that suggest that might be expanded and just related question if Paul, could comment on TAF and Stribild another new combination just a little bit about, what you are seeing in the market in terms of the appetite for replacing the existing combinations with the TAF formulation? Norbert Bischofberger :  Hi Jeff, it\u2019s Norbert; I will take your first question. The renew of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir is moving ahead nicely. We\u2019ve had all the unusual questions from agency about clinical CMC, we have had clinical inspections that are done manufacturing and certain at this point, it\u2019s all moving ahead nicely but it would be too much to speculate about the approval date. All we really know for certain is that PDUFA date is October 10. John Martin :  And Jeff, on your question about TAF clearly this drug is not approved yet and we haven\u2019t completed our clinical trials and data really will instruct this on how this is going to play out? I think it\u2019s worth mentioning though that single-tablet regimen are way ahead in our opinion and we hope very much that the data coming out of the tough trials will underscore the importance of get out single-tablet regimen. Operator :  Thank you, our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of ISI Group. Your line is now open. Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group :  Hello, thank you very much for taking my question, I appreciated. I just wanted to ask about the progress maybe this question is for Norbert or John but the progress for your triplet regimen. Obviously Merck\u2019s doing a trials four week dated at the end of the year and there\u2019s a possibility they could shorten the duration with the triple regimen down to four weeks. And I know that you have explored triplet regimens in the past, a little update as to where you guys are with that if needed, how quickly you could move forward if to react to the Merck data if indeed it hits the high bar and it looks pretty good? Thank you. Norbert Bischofberger :  Mark, its Norbert. Very quickly to remind you, we actually disclosed data from a NIH study which was in early month this quarter and there we show that you can indeed take six weeks of three drugs, so in that case protease inhibitor 9451 (ph) ledipasvir/sofosuvir and you get a 100% cure rates. Of course in operating new dose data before we quite a while before we presented it so we have undertaken now to look at eight weeks in Sovaldi patients, we are looking at six weeks in Sovaldi patients, we are looking at four weeks in naive patients both takes three drugs and four drugs, you will see some of these data that are emerging hopefully at ASLD. It\u2019s been we see that at certain regimen as the profile that we hope that it has to happen remember the hurdle bar has gone way up below 95% I don\u2019t think we will consider anything taken forward into Phase 3. We can then move fairly very quickly into phase 3 with whatever regimen we decide we want to do that the experiment on. Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group : Thanks, very helpful. Operator :  Thank you, our next question comes from Brian Abrahams of Wells Fargo; your line is now open. Brian Abrahams - Wells Fargo :  Hi, thanks very much for taking my question. I guess following up on Mark\u2019s question, can you maybe clarify what regimens you are going to view at you are looking at with the three and four DAA combos from four to eight weeks that you just mentioned Norbert, I mean, are there other ways beyond those triplet regimens that you could potentially maintain your per patient hep C revenues should others add on and get down to four weeks? Thanks. John Martin :  Yeah hi, Brian. So, we have ledipasvir/sofosbuvir reports that\u2019s under review that\u2019s genotype 1, initial approval, we have 5816 sofosbuvir combination that it\u2019s going into phase 3 and you will see some then very soon in the second half on clean trials then we have HIV a genotype 1 specific protease inhibitor 9451 and right we have a genotype 1 specific NS5B non-nucleus side inhibitor 9669. In addition, we are now moving very soon into Phase II, with a expansion of the protease inhibitor. So again to summarize all of this we are aiming for a genotypic regimen that either can be three drugs and it\u2019s probably going to be sofosbuvir with 5816 and the expansion of the big protease inhibitor. And we just have to establish the minimum treatment duration and we are conscious that we want to be the treatment duration not only for treatment na\u00efve non-cirrhotic patients to be shorter but also more difficult to treat treatment experience and cirrhotic patients to apply the same concept. And again we hope if everything goes well we will go into a larger Phase 2 study in the second half of this year or if we so choose, we could use 9451 and go directly into Phase 3. That all depends on what the emerging data looks like. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Roden of UBS. Your line is now open. Matthew Roden :  Great, thanks very much for taking question and congrats on the real nice launch here. So on the guidance where you\u2019ve included Sovaldi for the first time so you beat on HIV and you beat on hep C so far I think that I want to enter from the delta and sales guidance would imply straight line hep C sales in 3Q and 4Q despite current trends in the upcoming single to launch. So what I\u2019m trying to understand is, is this just a conservative and given the uncertainties Robin that you mentioned or is there specific reason we wouldn\u2019t see an uptake in the sales with the single pill? And the just related real quick for Paul, in the hep C launch, is it possible for you to breakout the portion of patients for fibrotic and cirrhotic relative level of confidence that the less urgently sick patients will ultimately be treated down the line. UBS Securities :  Great, thanks very much for taking question and congrats on the real nice launch here.

And the just related real quick for Paul, in the hep C launch, is it possible for you to breakout the portion of patients for fibrotic and cirrhotic relative level of confidence that the less urgently sick patients will ultimately be treated down the line. Robin Washington :  Hi Matt, its Robin I will take the first part of the question. I think the variables that we discussed are the one I mentioned and it came from lower to high range. I would remind to keep in mind than unlike HIV which is kind of care in HCV, we cure patients. So it\u2019s not necessarily as linear. But all the things that I talked about patient warehousing movement in inventory levels, the approval date, payor discussions all of these could price some variability in the range provided. John Martin :  Okay. And just add the comments on the fibrosis scores, this data is inaccurate I would say, but our best estimate is it around 40% of patients are F3, S4, 60% patients treated to date are zero to F3. We don\u2019t have data on the cirrhotic level. But I did mention earlier that 80% of the patients treated are new to treatment, so consequently 20% are experienced patients and with the sicker ones. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Michael Yee :  Thanks. A quick question initially there was a lot of focus around you getting numbers around how many patients in U.S. were under care by an expert and I notice the numbers gone up a little bit to 93,000. Presumably that could be busted through over the next few years based on your trajectory. So just want to understand how you\u2019re thinking about opening up that 700,000 or so I guess 1.4 million to get to the point diagnosis number. So we can think about just beyond the next couple of years. And then simultaneously Europe a similar thinking but presumably much low price so when you think out maybe with long-term, what percent of U.S. sales do you think in Europe or U.S. could be? RBC Capital Markets :  Thanks.

And then simultaneously Europe a similar thinking but presumably much low price so when you think out maybe with long-term, what percent of U.S. sales do you think in Europe or U.S. could be? John Martin :  With regard to the number of patients diagnosed and we are seeing certainly and your probably right about this as well a lot of doctors now reaching out the patients to have previously been diagnosed but have not been under care in the last 12 months. So that\u2019s why you see that numbers shift. The learning patients know that new options are available and better options are coming so there has been an increase in the number patients seeking care. So I think that\u2019s been an important dynamic that we're witnessing, just really the beginning of this as we\u2019re launching Sovaldi and as this is now become available in certain plans and certain stage.  We are confident that the increased cure rates it is treatment and the very important regimens that act more broadly across different types of patients will encourage patients to go get tested and bringing the care as well. So we think two thing will happen, one we\u2019ll test the higher percentage of people increasing the diagnose number and those patients who diagnosed will eventually seek care. I have to say the controversy Sovaldi is a constant daily reminder the patients it gives a very important new option available for them as well and I have to think that\u2019s been helpful as well. So we have a high degree of confidence in the future that more and more people now seeking care from the herpetologist as they have those options available. Norbert Bischofberger :  Paul, you want to take the second part? Paul Carter :  I don\u2019t remember what it was? Michael Yee : Your percent of sales for U.S. RBC Capital Markets : Your percent of sales for U.S. Paul Carter :  I think that\u2019s really hard question Michael. It\u2019s going to be a different timing its reality because the countries in Europe are going to be slow to reimburse and improve the product. But I think the prevalence in Europe is just marginally below the U.S. So I think in volume terms the numbers could end up being very similar, the price point in Europe, it\u2019s going to be slightly less than Europe the ASP probably. So I think we can figure out -- the numbers are going to be fairly similar, some of the US probably slightly bigger than Europe in the end. It\u2019s spread over on the timeframe. Operator :  Thank you, our next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Company:  Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I do have one on reimbursement. Could you give us some sense for the portion of people who are currently being denied coverage for Sovaldi? And how many people need for example to have their fibrosis status determined before they do get coverage. And then relatively what\u2019s your most recent thinking on the pricing for the combo pill, I think in the past you said Sovaldi contributes the most, the highest percentage of value to the pills, is that still your position, any updated thoughts would be appreciated, thanks. Paul Carter :  I think I will have to come back to you on the fibrosis scores though, I don\u2019t know the answer to that. This is Paul by the way. I was thinking about the fixed dose combination pricing, we haven\u2019t come to a conclusion yet but I do think philosophically we feel the majority of the value in the fixed dose combination is within Sovaldi. Norbert Bischofberger :  So your question about reimbursement and denial of care, I mean we do have a significant number of patients who are getting some form of help from Gilead especially through patient assistance programs we do know that prior authorizations are being used in most of the plans, especially the Medicaid plans with a sense to slow down the rate of patients coming in to care and then we also know that this is now delaying putting patients on treatment, waiting for the fixed dose combination. So, it\u2019s a difficult thing to say who\u2019s being denied versus who\u2019s being delayed waiting for the all oral regimens to come on the market. It is difficult and I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll have a better answer for you anytime in the future either. Operator :  Thank you, our next question comes from Yaron Werber of Citi; your line is now opened. Yaron Werber - Citi :  Right, thanks for taking my question, so I\u2019m sort of maybe a little bit of a follow on, on Phil\u2019s question and it\u2019s sort of in two parts. One, can you think of, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense; this is a unique situation where we\u2019re talking about an approved drug with a broad label and potential coverage denial. I mean, is that something that you can recall in the past even from a legal standpoint, are payers allowed to reject coverage? And then secondly, just a little bit from the Federal Trade Commission perspective. If you price the fixed dose combo in the way that\u2019s competitive and then Sovaldi plus another drug is materially more expensive, is that an issue from a federal trade given that you\u2019re going to be owning the market, thank you. John Martin :  Yaron, your first question is kind of a broad one, has this ever happened in the industry and I don\u2019t know that I can speak to that, I certainly can\u2019t think of any situations that are similar to this. Although this drug is different than other drugs you know in many ways we were in the HIV field we were limiting the patients who are coming -- via guidelines not specifically through FDA labeling, so there were consideration there that we\u2019re not part of the FDA label and that\u2019s the one that comes to mind. Obviously we\u2019ve broadened those guidelines over time as the medicines got better and doctors got more comfortable putting patients on a higher and higher CD4 count and I think that\u2019s probably most analogous. But again since it\u2019s the care market we know you can make rational choices about who should come onto care today knowing that eventually you\u2019ll be able to get to all the patients, even though that may take many-many years to do so and will naturally take many-many years. I think the second part of your question was about pricing and so simply, we can\u2019t comment on pricing, our thoughts around pricing for an unapproved product and so I can\u2019t really comment and won\u2019t speculate on the outcomes that may happen with regard to that. Operator :  Thank you, our next question comes from Ian Somaiya of Nomura Security; your line is now open. Ian Somaiya - Nomura Security :  Thanks, I\u2019m going to follow the trend and maybe ask one question two parts, completely unrelated. Just on maybe switching topics a little bit, maybe starting off with NASH and maybe Norbert if you could provide us a update on the, what you feel on the regulatory requirements to get a drug approved for NASH in the US and Europe, and then just on pricing, following up on an earlier question, I know the thought seems to be that Sovaldi should be driving most or is providing most of the benefit so it should engender most of the pricing power, how do you balance that with a payer environment US and Europe which is basically reimbursing two drugs unless you are on Sovaldi which affects very similarly. Norbert Bischofberger :  So Ian quickly the approvable end point and I\u2019m simply telling you about the conversations we\u2019ve had with FDA as little as six months ago, US FDA felt that histology even for accelerated approval is not an approvable end point, they wanted to have some clinical evidence of efficacy and after a lot of conversations and forth involving experts, FDA agreed that changes in hepatic Venus pressure gradient at 48 weeks they would accept as a clinical end point and that\u2019s the study we\u2019re doing right now. Our study in NASH with people with cirrhosis actually uses hepatic Venus pressure gradient that week 48 as the end point, and that will of course -- we have to have a NASH study in bridging fibrosis patients and in those patients it will be histology. But the histology would be kind of the link between the two studies so that ultimately the end point must be hepatic Venus pressure gradient. Ian having that said FDA could change their mind, so I am simply telling you what we were told six months ago. John Milligan : And your second question about pricing, this is John Milligan. These are always complicated things to think about in terms of the value that a product brings. The types of patients that would be appropriate for and the appropriate level of pricing based on that. And so due to things that we have to take into consideration as well as the external environment we\u2019re in and the competitive nature of future residents when we think about pricing. All those will factor into what the ultimate pricing decision will be on a fixed dose combination. So I obviously can\u2019t tell you more than that because these things can\u2019t be talked about until after approvability, but these are the various factors that we used to think about that at ultimate price. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Mehrotra of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Ravi Mehrotra - Credit Suisse :  Obviously you guys are taking cash generation. So you\u2019ll like to pull some capital allocation policy you previously talked about dividends. Are you any nearer to that? And concomitant to that, any philosophical change you are thinking how you accelerate your pipeline breadth, given your need arguably for higher future revenues given your higher current base. Robin Washington :  Ravi I\u2019ll take the first part, I mean I think overall our capital structure practices remains similar to what we\u2019ve communicated in the past. We\u2019re committed to effectively leveraging our strong cash flow. And we\u2019re disciplined in thinking about it relative to the investments in growing our pipeline selective M&A as well as returning capital to shareholders. The vehicle that we used to date our share repurchases with the increased level of cash flows and the repayment of debt we expect to continue to use share repurchases over and beyond the 1.7 billion year to date. We announced as we did on call that we will repurchase another 1.7 billion this quarter. And as you know we have a larger 5 billion repurchase program outstanding. So at this point should we still believe that that\u2019s the best vehicle for us to use, and it\u2019s consistent with our belief that we feel our shares are currently under value. We continue to have discussions with management about using other vehicles. So we could in the future think about a dividend in addition to share repurchases. John Milligan : Just income highlight the second part of your question about the accelerated amount of cash generation change thinking about bringing in our pipeline. Really the cash generation isn\u2019t material to our thinking this way. We have a lot of good things in the pipeline, as John Martin mentioned. He was only able to highlight a few of the many exciting things that are going on in our pipeline. We never had so many things going forward as we do today and we feel very, very confident in the pipeline that we have today. So our focus will be on selective deals in order to augment our pipeline in certain key areas. But with all the things going on so well, we fell that there isn\u2019t a strong need to do anything more than that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank :  Just to switch actually on HIV. So it looks like this drive build, your new patient share is going up and we\u2019ve done some math from the metrics you provided, looks like the amount of patients were switching of the current drug to sort of stable. So I just wanted to check and see if the math is right, that patients on current drugs switch is sort of stable? And then how do you see that influencing that switch market? And so you have any sense of how quickly that could occur over time? John Milligan : I\u2019ll take this question. So single tablet regimen growth Robyn both in the U.S. and in Europe continues a nice steady trajectory upwards. We\u2019re seeing some switches out of the fab ring (ph) contained products within our single-tablet regimen. So patients are switching out of Atripla to some extent that is fairly slow and the majority, the vast majority of those switches out of Atripla are coming to either Stribild or Complera in the US or Eviplera in Europe. So we are pretty comfortable with that and pleased the way things are going. Your question on TAF is really too early stage because the data coming out of the Phase 3 studies will be highly instructive as to the feature of our single tablet regimen treatment going forward. Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank : As a follow up, our math says about 6% of people have switched and that has a sort of unstable over the last few quarters. Do you have any sense of how high that could go? Or is that important or not important to you? John Milligan : It\u2019s very stable, I can\u2019t confirm the number you just quoted but I think it\u2019s ahead of low single digit levels and we are comfortable with that. Operator :  Thank you, our next question comes from Joshua Schimmer of Piper Jaffray; your line is now open. Josh Schimmer - Piper Jaffray :  Thanks for taking my questions. Prior to the Sovaldi launch, you indicated you\u2019re actively preparing payors for its impact, can you comment on how effective that\u2019s been today, where as you think you may have been able to improve their preparedness for next during beyond and to what extent do you think that may help curtail some of the constants during the compliance we read about in the press on price? Thanks. John Milligan :  Hey Josh, it\u2019s John Milligan. So we did talk to payers about the impact I think they frankly thought they were going to see something was much more like a vertex launch for Incivek and so they were surprised that the knowledge is a product launch at such a high rate but also that will continue to grow where it is popped out very quickly with Incivek which is of course going to happen and a drug that is a high touch point for physicians with lots of labor necessary and long duration of treatment. So, I think that is simply didn\u2019t understand technically what happens if we only treat patients for 12 weeks and so they clearly understands a dynamic much better now, they understand also that the demand for all oral regimen is very high so the interest is high and I hope that will be preparing for this but it\u2019s hard for me to know exactly what they are going to do and how they are going to think about something like our all oral picks those combination which is coming out later this year. Josh Schimmer - Piper Jaffray : Do you believe that\u2019s been a prime driver for kind of pricing noise concerns and complaints we have heard this year and will that a bet next year\u2019s result? John Milligan :  Well, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s been the prime driver it\u2019s better to speak to the payors individual to have been saying these things and to me I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to have abatement next year or not I do know that has the value story growth I think that will be a greater appreciation that affect these patients have been appeared a lot of ancillary problems that they had will simplified and we believe that over time the healthcare system will save a lot of money by these patients being healthy again. Josh Schimmer - Piper Jaffray : Okay, thank you. Operator :  Thank you, our next question comes from Howard Liang of Leerink. Your line is now open. Howard Liang - Leerink:  Thanks very much. Regarding the three phase 2 trials that read out in the fourth quarter for Simtuzumab in pancreatic, colorectal and myelofibrosis, what would you be looking for if you move forward and if can you talk about how important these oncology indications are for the amount of seven indications that you have at your testing for Simtuzumab? Norbert Bischofberger :  We look into two solid tumor studies of course the end point is PFS and we will be looking for a convincing difference of PFS on the active arms versus the placebo and how convincing I can\u2019t tell you. Also both of them are have two doses of Simtuzumab 200 and 700 milligram. IV every two weeks and what would nice disease some dose response anybody something that would convince us to spend the money and time and resources going to phase 3 and as you may also know the end point in the myelofibrosis study is histology so again, we will be looking at something that just convince us that its worthwhile to put these drugs into further development. How important these things are, I would say very important I mean I always said with Simtuzumab it\u2019s high risk because it\u2019s a novel target and as you know the lot of drugs against novel targets had never gone anywhere but if it works, this could be the really really useful drug for solid tumors. So, we are looking forward to learning more about the phase 2 data and that should happen in the October the second half of this year. Howard Liang - Leerink: Thanks very much. Operator :  Thank you, our next question comes from Brian Skorney of Robert W Baird. Your line is now open. Brian Skorney - Robert W Baird :  Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess I\u2019m thinking a lot about the shortening duration of hep C therapy and I wondered if you can just comment strategically what options you have with Sovaldi in terms of pricing and access should data justify a four-week regimen through two company combination where Sovaldi is one of the agents I\u2019m thinking in particular of Bristol-Myers forward study if that does show four weeks of ISVR, in their scenario were next year in a price competitive way, you would see potentially a 50% reduction in the overall price per patient if Sovaldi remains at the same price. So, I guess if you could give any color on other options to change Sovaldi\u2019s pricing as a result of that? John Martin :  Brian, again we are not going to speculate on any pricing or regimens in the future that have been tested, we have a lot of options within our own regimens and we will undoubtedly options with the combinations of regimens in the future as there is the potential to get down to shorter and shorter durations certainly we have already shown that six weeks is possible at their own combinations until there maybe others that can get better as well. But I don\u2019t want to I\u2019m not going to publicly speculate about what we might not do with regard the pricing in the future we\u2019ll just have to see how these things play out and we\u2019ll make decisions accordingly in the future. Operator :  Thank you. Our next comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Matthew Harrison :  Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask change the topic and ask about idea less, obviously you got approval today on both indications I just wanted ask one obviously coming much earlier than you expected and if that change so how do you think about the launch and then also what you think about the impact as the black box is relative requirement of the EMS. Thanks. Morgan Stanley :  Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask change the topic and ask about idea less, obviously you got approval today on both indications I just wanted ask one obviously coming much earlier than you expected and if that change so how do you think about the launch and then also what you think about the impact as the black box is relative requirement of the EMS. Thanks. Norbert Bischofberger :  Matthew thanks for asking about that. Idelalisib it first this comes up with great news for us it\u2019s our first oncology product and we\u2019re all proud and happy about it, a goodness of price the one that it came sooner because we always new FDA was working towards this we have breakthrough status on one of the indications and the other make a comment about the black box from the clinical point of view. So first all Idelalisib is a highly effective drug for certain patients and we believe a lot of patients were benefiting from it actually in our clinical studies looking at some of the statistics eight out of 10 have benefit. Secondly, you have to realize the data sets that we submitted to FDA both for the NHL, the two NHL and the CLL indications were relatively small. And to study one month fix with 110 patients on one arm and the total of the SLL and FL patients in the NHL study was about a 100. So we\u2019re left with a relatively small data set. And the data is the data. These events were observed, we did have fatalities. This is in patient population that is otherwise old age mostly very sick that takes other medications and we together with FDA felt that it was appropriate to include conservative warnings in the prescribing information. I also like to remind you we have a total of five additional clinical studies ongoing, two in CLL which in the month or two should be volume rolled, two in NHL both for relapse and one in front line therapy CLL to a five additional clinical studies and from these studies, this was inform us further about the safety profile of Idelalisib and as the data merged we may update the legal. Paul, do you want to add anything? Paul Carter :  I just like to add that our commercial scene has been preparing for Idelalisib launch a quite a well now. We have a fully recruited team with recruited some very high kind of the people from companies that have high levels oncology experience while they seem trained they are in field and they are promoting the product as of today, we\u2019re really very excited about it. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Wei of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Thomas Wei :  Thanks. A question on top with data coming up in the third quarter I wanted to get your perspective on why you think is a clinically meaningful improvement on either the bone side or the renal side when comparing a TAF versus a regimen. Thanks.  Jefferies & Company:  Thanks. A question on top with data coming up in the third quarter I wanted to get your perspective on why you think is a clinically meaningful improvement on either the bone side or the renal side when comparing a TAF versus a regimen. Thanks. John Martin :  Thomas, we obviously thought a lot about this and so if you look at the totality of the VF data I think we can comfortably and confidently say that the BMD effects overall are not clinically relevant. We can also say that with the exception of a few patients that this continues also small degree of decrease in creatinine clearance does not have any clinically significant effects. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see this in the Phase 3 study Thomas but I think what we will see will be what we saw regular Phase 2 study that there will much less or no decrease in BMD, there will be much less or no decrease in creatinine clearance but I think with the clinical relevant is from the renal impairment study. We have a study about 290 patients where we are testing the easier ECF TAF rate down to creatinine clearance of 30. And that would be a really important point if you could see there is no renal effect in laboratory while there is no BMD effect, moreover you don\u2019t have to dose or dose interval just down to creatinine clearance of 30 and if the regulatory authority accept this we also don\u2019t have to do regular creatinine checks. So I think it would be a very safe much more -- physicians and patients would feel more comfortable with this and then we would be ahead, if we didn\u2019t have these laboratory abnormalities. Operator :  Thank you. And at this time we have time for one last question. Our final question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Terence Flynn :  Hi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just follow up on that TAF can you quantify for us the percentage of patients with HIV that have renal impairment and then also maybe stratify by age now the HIV patient cohort that maybe would be at highest risk for having fracture or low BMD given their age, and then the second part of the question is, I noticed during your remarks you said you\u2019ve seen a minimal impact from generics Incivek in Europe right now on market share, but what about pricing, any impact there either now or maybe in the future, thank you.  Goldman Sachs :  Hi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just follow up on that TAF can you quantify for us the percentage of patients with HIV that have renal impairment and then also maybe stratify by age now the HIV patient cohort that maybe would be at highest risk for having fracture or low BMD given their age, and then the second part of the question is, I noticed during your remarks you said you\u2019ve seen a minimal impact from generics Incivek in Europe right now on market share, but what about pricing, any impact there either now or maybe in the future, thank you. John Martin :  Yes so, Terrence just quickly from a -- you know I can\u2019t give you specific numbers but qualitatively of course you know that the HIV population in the US and in other parts of the world is aging. With increasing age creatine or renal function declines and this will be just more convenient and safe for use of the drug if you have borderline creatinine clearance of 60 or 50 you will not worry about any adverse, renal adverse events to be happening with TAF whereas [indiscernible] as you know has to be dosed in a well adjusted when you come down to creatinine clearance of 50 or 70 in case of Stribild. Paul Carter :  Yes, and maybe I can just comment on the pricing question to Steve in Europe, so, the product that is affected is Atripla and we price Atripla on a one plus one basis. What we have seen is the branded prices, Sustiva has followed down to some extent the generic price of generic efavirenz, nevertheless the price of Atripla we managed to keep above slight that one plus one level and that recognizes the value of the single tablet regimen, and as I said also earlier where patients are switching out of Atripla for CNS reasons associated with efavirenz, most of those switches are coming to Gilead products notable 70% in quarter 2 went to Eviplera. John Martin :  Thank you, Sam and thank you all for joining us today, we appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on our future progress. Operator :  Thank you sir, ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference, this does conclude today\u2019s program, you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

My name is Kate, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only-mode and as a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patrick O'Brien: Thank you, Kate and good afternoon, everyone. We issued a press release this afternoon and our earnings results for the third quarter. The press release along with the detailed slide is available on the Investor Relations section of our web site. Speaking on the call today are John Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Carter, Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations; and Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room for Q&A, are John Milligan, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research & Development. Before we begin our formal remarks, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations, with respect to our product candidates and financial projections, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation [audio gap] any forward-looking statements made during this call. We will also be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation is provided in our press release as well as on our website.  I will now turn the call over to John Martin. John Martin : Thank you, Patrick and thank you all for joining us today. The third quarter was highlighted by continued strong financial performance as well as scientific, clinical and regulatory progress that we believe will benefit the patients and communities Gilead serves over the near and longer term. During the quarter, we generated a total of $6.0 billion. This performed - revenue of $6.0 billion this performance coincided with advancing numerous clinical programs across core therapeutic areas. I will touch on the most significant milestones that occurred in the last few months. In the HIV therapeutic area, the first TAF based single tablet regimen of elvitegravir, cobicistat, FTC and TAF or E/C/F/TAF met its primary efficacy and safety endpoints in two Phase 3 studies in treatment na\u00efve patients. The results show that E/C/F/TAF was non-inferior to Stribild with regard to the proportion of HIV infected patients with viral load of less than 50 copies/mL and demonstrated statistically significant fewer renal abnormalities and also lower decreases in bone marrow density. Additional Phase 3 studies evaluating E/C/F/TAF in multiple HIV patient populations are ongoing including patients who switched to E/C/F/TAF from TRUVADA containing regimens. Patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment and treatment na\u00efve HIV positive adolescents. Submissions for regulatory approval of the E/C/F/TAF regimen will occur in both the United States and Europe by the end of the year. In addition, TAF as a single agent is being studied for the treatment of HPV infection. Two Phase 3 studies with 48 week primary endpoints should complete enrollment by the end of the year.  Moving to HCV, Harvoni which was approved by the US FDA on October 10, is the first single tablet regimen for patients infected with genotype 1 HCV, the most prevalent genotype worldwide. We also received approval in Canada earlier this month, a positive recommendation for approval in Europe in late September, and we filed up for approval in Japan, also in September. Harvoni is a major medical advance in the treatment of HCV. It's simple, one tablet taken once a day, it eliminates the need for both interferon and ribavirin which cause difficult side effects and it results in high cure rates, with treatment durations as few as 8 weeks. Harvoni builds on the progress of the past year during which time approximately 100,000 patients have been treated with Sovaldi in the United States and approximately 17,000 in Europe. This represents a fraction of the estimated 185 million people in the world suffering from HCV, who have the potential to benefit from sofosbuvir-based regimens. The rampant adoption of Sovaldi continues to reflect recognition within the medical community of the substantial benefits the drug offers patients, particularly when compared to prior treatment options. The goal of Gilead's development program is a pan-genotypic single tablet regimen. To this end enrollment of four Phase 3 studies has begun for the pan-genotypic combination of GS-5816 and sofosbuvir. We anticipate being in position to share data in the second half of 2015. In two weeks, the annual AASLD meeting will take place from November 7 to 11 in Boston. Over 90 abstracts by Gilead or by Gilead collaborators will highlight our various disease programs in hepatitis B, hepatitis C and liver fibrosis. 65 abstracts deal with the use of sofosbuvir containing regimens in various populations across various genotypes. In particular, an oral abstract will describe the use of Harvoni in genotype 6 and Harvoni in combination with ribavirin in genotype 3 hepatitis C infected individuals. Another presentation will describe a real world experience of Harvoni in combination with ribavirin in cirrhotic patients, who have previously failed a PI, peg-interferon ribavirin containing regimens. And three other abstracts will provide safety and efficacy of Harvoni in 500 patients with compensated cirrhosis and in a combination with ribavirin in 300 pre and post liver transplant patients. These existing and accumulating data continue to demonstrate that sofosbuvir-based regimens provide savings to payors, providers, patients and our entire healthcare system over the long-term given high cure rates and subsequent reduction of cost associated with managing HCV over patients' lifetime.  Now let me touch briefly on Zydelig and Letairis. Zydelig is a first in class, oral PI3K delta inhibitor. It was approved both in the US and Europe in combination with Rituximab for the treatment of certain patients with CLL and certain patients with NHL. Zydelig is the first to what we hope will be many therapies Gilead develops to improve treatment for a range of cancers. The Letairis AMBITION study has demonstrated the potential for a new standard of care in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension called PAH. Data from this study were presented at the annual meeting of the European Respiratory Society in September with an additional analysis from AMBITION presented during a late breaker session at a CHEST meeting, earlier today. The study was conducted in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline and Eli Lilly and was a randomized double blind multi-center study comparing first-line combination therapy with Ambrisentan and Tadalafil to monotherapy with either Ambrisentan or Tadalafil alone in patients with PAH. The study showed that the combination of these therapies reduced the risk of clinical failure by [15%] [Ph] compared to the pooled Ambrisentan and Tadalafil monotherapy arms. The combination was also statistically significant versus the two individual Ambrisentan and Tadalafil monotherpay arms were the primary endpoint. Based on these data submission of a supplemental NDA for Letairis to FDA is planned before [Inaudible].  As we continue to advance treatment options across a range of therapeutic areas, we are working to enable access of our drugs for people who need them across the world. During the quarter, we signed non-exclusive licensing agreements with seven India based generic companies to manufacture Sovaldi and Harvoni for distribution in 91 developing countries. In those countries, more than 100 million people are estimated to be infected with HCV, which translates to 54% of the total number of people affected by HCV worldwide. We also announced agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool, MPP, under which MPP can sub-license TAF to generic companies in India and China for manufacturing and distribution in 112 developing countries. Many initiatives are in place to expand access for patients in both the US and around the world and represent a continuing effort that our entire organization is committed to and of which we are very proud. I will now turn the call over to Paul Carter to provide a commercial update. Paul Carter : Thanks, John and good afternoon, everyone. Gilead's total net product revenue in the third quarter increased to $6 billion representing growth of 120% over the same period last year. US sales grew to $4.2 billion and we had $1.4 billion of sales in Europe. There were a number of factors underlying our sales growth during the quarter. The primary driver was Sovaldi and we've also experienced healthy demand in our HIV business. Beginning with hepatitis C, we generated Sovaldi sales of $2.8 billion during the quarter including $2.2 billion in US sales with most of the remainder coming from farms in Germany. Sovaldi is now available in 40 countries around the world. The 20% reduction in Sovaldi revenues compared with the second quarter is related to physicians delaying the initiation of treatments in the US, in anticipation of Harvoni's approval. As we expected the third quarter also saw a reduction of our Sovaldi inventory across the channel, consistent with demands and in line with our normal contractual ranges. Since launch, nearly a 100,000 patients in the US have been treated with Sovaldi. According to data available, as at the end of the second quarter approximately two-thirds are genotype 1, 20% are genotype 2, 10% are genotype 3 and the rest are genotype 4, 5 and 6 combined.  Approximately, 95% of US patients starting therapy in 2014 receive Sovaldi. We estimate that 80% of these patients were treatment na\u00efve and 20% were treatment experienced. In the third quarter, we saw an increase in non-retail use as a percentage of the US total sales. At this point only two state Medicaid programs have yet to allow access to Sovaldi. In Europe, approximately 17,000 patients have been treated with Sovaldi. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence or NICE, issued further draft guidance recommended Sovaldi as a treatment option for certain patient sub-groups. We were very pleased to have NICE's endorsement of Sovaldi as a clinically and cost-effective treatment and look forward working with officials in the UK to ensure maximum patient access to this drug. We've now reached agreements on reimbursement in many countries of Western Europe. The fact that many of these agreements are progressing faster than would typically be the case following standard timelines, is a testament to the unmet medical need that Sovaldi addresses and the value it brings. Let me now turn to Harvoni. As John mentioned earlier in the month, we received FDA approval for Harvoni. A simple, safe and highly effective oral single tablet regimen for hepatitis C. the 12-week regimen price for Harvoni is $94,500 which is in line with the regimen cost of the previous standard of care as in 12 weeks of Sovaldi plus pegylated interferon and ribavirin. We expect over time that up to half of genotype 1 patients may benefit from just eight weeks of therapy meaning the cost will be reduced by one-third for many patients. We are supporting the launch through a targeted promotional effort designed to build awareness amongst the specialist communities who are already familiar with Sovaldi including hepathologist, gastroenterologist and infectious disease physicians. Moving now to HIV, prescription growth continue to grow for us, for all of our products in the US as nine out of 10 HIV patients new to treatment were prescribed the Gilead medicine. Seven out of 10 received one of Gilead's TRUVADA based single tablet regimens. Stribild continues to be the leading HIV regimen for patients who are beginning therapy, capturing three out of 10 starts. And Stribild has also become the number two regimen across all treated patients in the US behind Atripla. Gilead's TRUVADA based single tablet regimens including Stribild, Complera and Atripla grew 29% year-over-year. The new single tablet regimens remained on a strong growth trend with Stribild up 22% sequentially to $279 million and Complera up 19% sequentially to $183 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we saw inventory levels for our HIV products finish at the upper end of the contractual range. Moving to Europe, revenues for TRUVADA based single tablet regimens have grown 17% year-over-year. TRUVADA based single tablet regimens continue to lead the market with Eviplera remaining the most prescribed regimen in both na\u00efve and switch patients, and Stribild strengthening its position as the second most prescribed regimen for switch and it's the fourth most prescribed regimen for treatment na\u00efve patients. By the end of the third quarter, we have [Inaudible] Stribild in 20 countries across Europe. This includes all EU big five markets with notably the biggest HIV market in Europe being France where Stribild was launched in late March. We are engaged with public and private payors around the world to help them understand the significant unmet medical needs we are working to address and the positive impact we believe our products can have on healthcare systems over the long-term. In the US, our comprehensive patient assistance program continuous to help make Gilead therapies accessible for patients who need financial assistance. We are always looking at how we can partner with countries in need to enable access to our therapies. This has been and will continue to be a top priority. In closing we are extremely pleased to have taken so many important steps forward with our business during the quarter, and with that I will now turn it over to Robin. Robin Washington : Thanks, Paul and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report strong third quarter results with total revenues of $6 billion and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.84 per share which includes a cumulative catch up of $0.21 per diluted share related to the branded prescription drug fee for the final regulations in the Affordable Care Act issued during the quarter. Excluding this one-time adjustment EPS for the quarter would have been $2.05 per share. Worldwide product sales growth of 120% year-over-year was driven by strength across Gilead's product portfolio including continued uptake of Sovaldi coupled with the growth of our HIV single tablet regimen Stribild and Complera, Eviplera across geographies.  Sequentially, product sales excluding Sovaldi increased by 8% with steady growth in our HIV franchise. Sovaldi product sales were robust at $2.8 billion for the third quarter, but decreased compared with the second quarter which likely resulted from physicians holding up initiation of treatment in anticipation of Harvoni. In Europe, Sovaldi product sales increased 31% sequentially, as more patients initiated therapy during the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were up $609 million year-over-year. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were up $98 million year-over-year reflecting increases in headcount and infrastructure cost related to the growth of our R&D portfolio and progression of oncology and liver diseases clinical studies. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were up $511 million year-over-year driven by the branded prescription drug fee. As mentioned earlier, the IRS issued final regulations which required manufacturers to recognize an additional [year-up] [Ph] expense which resulted in a non-tax deductible cumulative catch up of $337 million within the quarter. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses also increased due to product launch expenses for liver diseases and oncology, patient support program, head count growth and investments in our infrastructure and geographic expansion. Our cash flow from operations was $4 billion for the quarter. We continue to focus on shareholder return and accelerated our level of share repurchases to 19.1 million shares and an average price of $89.10 per share utilizing $1.7 billion in cash during the third quarter. This completed the January 2011 share repurchase plan where we re-purchased a total of 92.9 million shares at an average repurchase price of $53.83 per share for a total spend of $5 billion. This month we began utilizing the May 2014, 5 billon share repurchase plan and expect cash allocated in the fourth quarter to share repurchases to be similar to the third quarter. During the quarter we also paid $4.1 billion in cash to settle the warrants related to the May 2014 convertible debt which reduced diluted shares by 10 million for the current quarter. Turning briefly to taxes, as many of you are aware. The Irish Finance Minister announced the proposed 2015 budget for Ireland, which included a number of changes to their residency rule. We are still evaluating the proposed changes and the related impact to Gilead, if any. The proposed changes include a six-year grandfather period through 2020. If we determine that the final rules will impact Gilead, we believe that our worldwide revenue base and operations in Ireland will provide us with options for structuring alteratives in the future. Finally, we are updating full-year 2014 guidance which includes HCV product sales and is outlined on Slide 44. The changes are as follows : Net product revenue guidance is now $22 billion to $23 billion. Gross margin guidance is now 86% to 88%. Tax rate guidance is now 17.5% to 19.5%. We are raising SG&A expense guidance to $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion. This increase is fully attributable to the impact of the IRS regulations related to the change in accounting of the branded prescription drug fee, which represents approximately 21% of SG&A expense in 2014. All other components of our 2014 guidance remain unchanged.  Overall, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress. At this point, we would like to open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Today's question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions) our first question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein. Your line is open. Geoffrey Porges \u2013 Bernstein: Congratulations on all the progress in the results. Could I just ask a related questions on HCV, could you give us a sense of how Harvoni is going? I mean you have more visibility than we do in terms of comparing it to the Sovaldi launch, do you get the sense that it's tapping into that warehouse group of patients and just related to that could you give us some color pull on what proportion of patients that are being treated are F3, F4 in the US? And whether you expect that to become a more or less de-facto reimbursement standard as we get into 2015 for HCV reimbursement? Thanks. Paul Carter : Yes, Geoff, I think there is two questions there actually, but I can give you a little bit feedback on Harvoni's launch, as you pointed out we only have one data point like you do, but I can tell you a little bit more what we are hearing, but first of all the data point is prescriptions last week was for prescriptions that are actually filled. We are hearing that many more prescriptions are being written during these first, two or three weeks of launch. We have to be careful, I think comparing apples-to-apples though with the Sovaldi launch, if any of you remember, Sovaldi was approved at the beginning of December and there was a reticence I think at that point for many physicians to write prescriptions starting patients off from interferon regimen just prior to the Christmas and holiday period. So there is a slight apples-to-apples comparison, I think we need to take into account. However, we are seeing a few things. We are seeing a broader group of physicians writing scripts. I think than with Sovaldi, several physicians we know have written scripts that never wrote one for Sovaldi before and I think this reflects the simplicity of the Harvoni regimen. We are also seeing the rate of adoption, I think a little bit faster this time. So some physicians who took many months to write their first prescription of Sovaldi seem to appreciate again the simplicity of the Harvoni regimen and are writing scripts earlier. With regard to payors, we are feeling reasonably confident with their reaction. I think they're very pleased to see that in GT 1 patients, up to half we estimate of those patients will be eligible for eight weeks of therapy in due course because they're either treatment na\u00efve non-cirrhotic and with a low baseline viral load, and I think also when they compare the cost of the treatments of Sovaldi plus Olysio, which we saw ramping up during the course of the year and in fact I think in the second quarter or possibly in the third quarter or even maybe 50% of patients, were on that very expensive regimen costing around $150,000 there is a sense of relief now that a large number of patients will be able to access the eight-week regimen at substantially reduced cost. So that's very positive I believe. It's very early really to characterize access through the state payer systems and really too early to say that. I do think it's worth pointing out that Sovaldi will continue to co-exist with Harvoni. So I think in the month going forward, we should look at the overall Gilead position in hepatitis C as Harvoni plus the Sovaldi prescription, but we're going to continue to see because Sovaldi remains the best on label options for genotype 2, 3, 6 and for various other patient sub-groups. So pretty early days, but I think good signs. We also just had a satellite symposium hosted last week by several hepatitis C thought leaders and we had 1,900 healthcare providers join that symposium. So I think it's a very high level of interest and so we are quietly confident in the success of this launch. I think the second question was about fibrosis score, we've seen a surprisingly large number of patients actually treated with low fibrosis scores. I think our estimate, so far in the year-to-date is that, zero through two is about 60% of the patients treated. So the balance would be F3s and F4s, Geoff, I hope that answer the question. Geoffrey Porges \u2013 Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much for that color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo : Congrats on all the progress as well. Just following up on Geoff's question. I was wondering, if you could talk more specifically about this potential backlog of prescriptions for Harvoni. Do you have any sense for patient throughput on the drug relative to prescriptions written? How quickly you might expect to see these patients get insurance authorization to start treatment. I guess, I'm just trying to understand both the initial insurance hurdles as well as how best to reconcile the prescriptions, we're going to see in the launch relative to actual patient demand? Thanks. Paul Carter : Yes, so it's a really hard question to answer. We really don't know, I mean I think the apples-to-apples comparisons with Sovaldi again, we need to take into consideration that I think insurance companies were somewhat unprepared for the volume of patients when Sovaldi was initially launched and certainly in the first few weeks, a lot of prescriptions I think went through very quickly. This time insurance companies are more organized and prepared around the Harvoni launch, so there may be a slightly more -there may be some more constraints initially. But as I said Harvoni is an incredible step forward. You know the single tablet once a day, interferon free, ribavirin free regimen, many patients able to be prescribed for just eight weeks. So I would hope that the economic benefits, even at the eight-week potential might expedite proceedings, but is a bit difficult to tell, there are some swings round about on this. Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo : Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Your line is open. Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group : I noticed in your slide deck this quarter, you didn't provide us the waterfall plot that you often provide for the hepatitis C market starting with infected patients, then going to diagnosed patients, then going to patients under the active care of a treating specialist. I was wondering, if you could update us on those numbers if possible especially now that we're all trying to model the Harvoni launch. And then just related, you said that the two state Medicaids have allowed access only to Sovaldi. What's your expectation for how that's going to roll out, how the state Medicaid situation will roll out in '15? Thanks, so much. John Milligan : Mark, it's John Milligan, I'll start with the waterfall question. We were taking a look at that plot and recognized that the data we have on the patients under care are at least a quarter old if not older, and so we no longer felt that we had an accurate picture of where are those patients are coming from, so we don't know exactly how many patients were under care anymore and how many of the patients that went through care would have been characterized as part of that bucket prior to this. So we felt it was misleading to put a number out there that you would then rely on for understanding how the dynamic is going. We are trying to figure out where those patients are going to come from and we will take some time of course to understand how many patients came directly into care from nowhere, which was common in this field, patients who typically had better care suddenly seeking care and how many of those patients are still on that bucket. So this very dynamic process may not lend itself to a typical waterfall that we've used in the past for HIV and we are trying to figure out a better way to convey what those numbers might look like as those patients come into care and as those patients are driven into care by increased knowledge of the product and of course many of you have seen awareness ads on TV already from various companies, which will of course help drive awareness and patients into care as well. So it\u2019s a very dynamic process and we'll try to do the best we can, but I don't have a good handle on what that number is today. Paul, the second was about Medicaid. Paul Carter : Yes, I think we should anticipate, certainly for modeling, I would anticipate the same sort of timelines for Harvoni through the state Medicaid systems. Although, I would emphasize again, the eight-week regimen, you would hope the economic benefits of the shorter treatment might expedite that process somewhat. Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group : Thanks a lot. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Your line is open. Matt Roden \u2013 UBS Securities : So there's been a lot of debate about the importance of short duration therapy and I noticed for your GS-5816 program in Phase 3 that you're really, really looking at 12 weeks treatment duration. So, I realized the Phase 2 data, next on eight weeks there, but should we just think about this combination for June type 2 and 3 and then I guess related, can you update us where you are, with your next gen PI and what the plans are and timelines for additional combos to get to shorter durations? Norbert Bischofberger : Yes, Matt. Hi, it's Norbert. Matt with regards to 5816. The way, we are thinking about this, is it would be one pill, simple regimen 12 weeks for everybody, now you can make the argument in the US, it's probably genotype 2 and 3, but you know for instance, if you look at the UK, they have 30% genotype 3 and another part of the world is the most prominent genotypes are not genotype 1. So we are looking at this really as a global solution so to speak for all genotype for hepatitis C. With regards to shorter treatment durations, Matt we are still pursuing shorter treatment duration. You may remember, we have presented data actually, NIID presented data on six weeks treatment na\u00efve non-cirrhotic 100% response rates with ledipasvir sofosbuvir 9451, can't remember the numbers. Sorry. We are now looking at, what happens in with eight weeks and six weeks in treatment experience cirrhotic. There is a presentation by [indiscernible] at AASLD that looks at eight weeks in treatment experienced cirrhotic and you can see, while the response rate are still reasonably high, almost 90% not as high as we would like them to be and we are looking four weeks right now, within treatment na\u00efve non-cirrhotic. With regards to the [indiscernible] that has just entered Phase 2, so we are doing those ranging in or combination studies, again looking at shorter treatment duration. So I don't have any specific data to tell you about hopefully [indiscernible] we will be able to say something about, before treatment duration and the six weeks in cirrhotic patients. Matt Roden \u2013 UBS Securities :  Thanks very much Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael Yee \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : My question is in regards to, some reimbursement criteria for different payors suggesting the need for high risk, hepatitis C disease in order to get treated. Anecdotally or once you think, only do you think that is going to be any impact or do you think that's basically going to be similar to what we saw in Q2, I think a lot of that criteria, was trying to be implemented and then I guess similarly to US, how do you see that being played out cirrhotic versus non-cirrhotic. In other words, high-risk versus low- risk. John Milligan : Hi Michael, it's John Milligan. Your first question is just going to be segmented into higher risk HCV patients for treatment only, I think that's the way you phrased it and I would say, it's very difficult to characterize across the very different payor groups, who respond differently to the people, who of course are paying the premiums and so there is a wide range of behaviors that we are seeing out there.  There are certainly some groups, are trying to segment more for the high risk nations, but of course some groups are more open ended as to what kind of patient can come on board. So you could be higher risk by a number of criteria including our physician judgment based on co-morbidities, you can get therapy based on other criteria. Interesting, if you look at for example Metacare [ph] patients, there have quite a range of patients, who were able to be treated under Medicare and CMS is sort of dictated currently that all patient should be allowed therapy. I think what you'll see overtime is, rather than a restriction more of a loosening of the guidelines over time much like we saw with HIV. I should think, guidelines that are loosening of the criteria for reimbursing which was just typically what happens overtime as more patients get treated, who are the worse end of this spectrum, there will be more capacity and more money that will be freed up to treat people, who are earlier on in their disease. We also think the eight week, the cheaper option is going to be very favorably looked up the payors as well. We think also that treating earlier is you best chance to save the most money for the healthcare system overtime and so we would encourage people to think about that way as well, so you will see some restrictions currently and I think for example in the Medicaid, which have fixed budget, so be greater restrictions than anywhere else, but I can't give you one answer, I just think it's an evolving feel, which will eventually allow most patients to be treated but I do think, they'll be a triage system set up over the coming years to the get to the right number of patients. Michael Yee \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : How is that different that US? For example, that's why with the pie charts, you don't have that for US? John Milligan : Thanks, Michael. I'm going to turn it over to Paul Carter for the answer about the ex-US piece of this. Paul Carter : So we are making very good progress in terms of reimbursement agreements with most of the major European countries, what we have in Europe is somewhat why the state Medicaid assumes fairly inflexible budget to healthcare generally and specifically in the hepatitis C area, having said that, I think there is very clear recognition of the unmet medical need and particularly in some countries, the very large number of patients that really need to be treated as soon as possible. We would expect, as government to prioritize the patients just because of the inflexible nature of the budget and therefore, I think at the stage, the sicker patients clearer would be the first ones to be treated. Having said that, ironically John pointed out, the best way to save money per patient is to treat early and in fact treat these, less cirrhotic patients on the eight weeks, type of therapy that will be available shortly in Europe. Michael Yee \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Phil Nadeau \u2013 Cowen & Company: Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question, I had a follow-up actually on the ex-US launch. We recently saw in the web, it looks like you've reached agreement with Italy and Italy expects to, I think treat more patients than any of the other big five nations, is that correct is Italy to inline and what are you expectations for the launch there? Similarly in Egypt, where there is a huge patient population, what are you expectations for revenue out of Egypt and how did that ramp? Paul Carter : So I'll take the Italy question first of all, Italy does have the highest prevalence of any of major EU countries for sure and they do recognize the healthcare issue staring them in the face now. So we have been in close negotiations with the Italian Government, we have signed an agreement with them and that agreement is now working through the Italian system. We expect the first patients in Italy, hopefully to get treated next month as part of this agreement. So Italy is moving forward and we are very pleased about that. Do you want to talk about Egypt, John? John Milligan : So with regard to Egypt, obviously we've announced that we have a program to have, a specific program for Egyptian citizens to get access to Sovaldi for genotype 4. There are some pretty high expectations within the Egyptian Government about the number of patients, who can be treated. We have yet to actually see those orders materialized, we are working with them and with a proper forecast and supply because it look like, so this time, I can't give you anything to other than to say, we are very, very small for 2014 and as you get into 2015 and approach talking about the year, guidance than perhaps the deficit [indiscernible] good component, we would call it out at that point in time, but given this is a public health initiative. Obviously the revenue number is small per patient, though with the large our patients could be an important part of ex-US, ex-European revenue line. Phil Nadeau \u2013 Cowen & Company: Just in places like Egypt and Italy and other places with high prevalence, to basically set up an annual budget beforehand and did they tell you, what that is or is there more demand base order for those countries? John Milligan : So specifically to Italy and to Egypt there is a specific amount of money that they're setting aside to try to treat the disease to my knowledge, those numbers aren't public, but if we have been, they have for the size, special public funds because of the important health need for each of those countries, yes. Paul Carter : And I can just add, certainly speaking for Italy the budget will be a significant step up from previous hepatitis C budgets, with the ambition of treating a lot of patients, over the next few years and with a recognition that they can't possibly treat all patients you know the first year or two, this will be spread out over many years. Phil Nadeau \u2013 Cowen & Company: Great thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi. Your line is open. Yaron Werber \u2013 Citi: I've a question, of inventory and then a question on 5816. Inventory wise for Sovaldi, it looks like about 30% of sales sort of are out there, to genotype 1 that's going to be obviously the strong suit kind of going forward to Sovaldi, but you mentioned that, within the IMA sort of the contractual, usually I think you guys have been two to three weeks. So I'm trying to get a sense, kind of where do you think inventory will go and how much is it going to get compensated by Harvoni next quarter? And then just in terms of 5816, is there any discussion internally about also doing an eight week regimen before you actually file for approval? Thank you. Robin Washington : Yaron, its Robin. I'll take the first part of your question, as we kind of outlined on the call we know Sovaldi inventory stayed overall for the quarter within the ranges, but it did go down to mention with the decline and demand that we saw in anticipation of Harvoni. This quarter, Q4 we'd expect the Harvoni inventory to ramp up and Sovaldi to continue to ramp down. I can't say exactly, how that's all going to play out. I mean, overall, when we bring on a new product, you do have a few quarters to ramp up inventory overall. So that is something we will have to see, how it plays over the rest of the quarter. Norbert Bischofberger : Yaron, currently we don't have any plans for the filing for the first NDA filing of 5816 to include shorter than 12-week treatment duration arms, but we are as I said exploring shorter treatment duration arms with adding a third agent in, and in this particular case the pain treatment for these enabler 9857, those studies are currently ongoing. We would like, we attempt for the shorter treatment duration to be applicable to all patients, not limited to a certain non-cirrhotic treatment na\u00efve low viral load segment, but it should work for everybody, that's what we are attempting to do. Yaron Werber \u2013 Citi: Robin, I don't know if I can maybe ask a different way, in Q4. Are you guys expecting sales in hep C in the US to be higher than Q2, I guess that's sort of I'm trying to get to? Robin Washington : I understand your question, I can't necessarily project that. we've given kind of overall guidance for the full period, as we talk about, we do expect to see somewhere housing and we'd expect to see that ramp up a bit. Are lot of uncertainties, you still got to go through the reimbursement process, there is a potential for our competitive lines etc. year around. So I can't necessarily say this early, whether it's going to go up or down, but we do feel comfortable with our guidance. Yaron Werber \u2013 Citi: Okay, great. Figured I'll try. Thank you. Operator : (Operator Instructions) our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Nomura Securities. Your line is open. Ian Somaiya \u2013 Nomura Securities : Thank you, just one question on sort of sustainability of pricing in Hep C, as you and your competitors all start to shorten their treatment duration, as wondering if we should assume pricing is maintained at the current eight-week mark or should we assume the savings are passed on whoever? Paul Carter : Until we see the product profiles, I think if the shorter week durations, I think it's actually impossible to answer that question. I think, that what we do have there with Harvoni is a really, really strong clinical profile and high efficacy, low side effect, one pill once a day, no interferon or no ribavirin. A great profile, so that's what. Norbert, wants to say something. Norbert Bischofberger : Ian, the other thing I would like to add, as far as I know nobody has yet shown any shorten of treatment duration with the exception of Gilead. The other thing, I would like to point out, the regulatory hurdle to get anything approved is very, very high. You actually want to look at the Harvoni label, how the eight-week the IM-3 study was labeled, you know we had overall 96% response rate with the treatment arm versus 98% in the 12-week treatment arm and yet, while showed up in the label was. It should be used for 12 weeks with the footnotes saying that, it can be considered for certain patients with an eight-week treatment duration. I'm just telling you, this is our regulatory authorities think about this. They do not trade two-week treatment duration, if you have to pay 2% penalty in relapse rates. Ian Somaiya \u2013 Nomura Securities : But really the question was more your effort, as you're looking at potential three drug combo and that could support shorter treatment durations, does the price naturally come down or should we assume it kind of stays regular? John Milligan : I think, first to, John Milligan, Ian. So you have to think about the overall patient population that we're looking at right now and it will depend heavily on we were able to drive the different treatment durations, there are patients now who are considered for 24-weeks and so as we drive those patients down to lesser duration, we will have to take a look at the totality of the day, that they figure out, which patient population is appropriate for three drug combinations at which durations and at which price and so we may have to make some choices in there as to what we intend to do. So we have, the next thing, the most of the drug combinations we have, as we have flexibility across the regimen to do the best thing as that we can for the company and for the patient simultaneously. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Robyn Karnauskas \u2013 Deutsche Bank : First for Robin, I know you've deployed less dividend and thinking about capital allocation, what are the next things that have to happen to make a decision on whether that's a choice, you would make or not and then regarding patient flow. I know initially you said that, with Sovaldi launch that you're seeing doctors prescribe much quicker than you thought, day one what are you seeing with Harvoni that might surprise you, what are your thoughts on patient flow? Thanks. Robin Washington : Hi, Robin, just answer the first part. You know we continue to peak our consistent capital structure focus in place and that's focusing on the reinvestment of our pipeline, M&A and returning excess value and we think, right now given our current valuations, share repurchases, is a more optimal way for us to return value to shareholders.  You know, we continue to look at our future cash flows, to your point. How do we think about it going forward. This is something that, we're discussing with management and the board as to whether there are other vehicles that we might want to consider, at the most importantly, we're trying to looking at our return relative to free cash flow, going forward. So there are various vehicles that we might choose to optimize in the future, but right now share repurchase is our area of focus. Paul Carter : Robyn, I couldn't actually hear very clearly the second part of the question, would you mind repeating it? Robyn Karnauskas \u2013 Deutsche Bank :  Sure, you're mentioning when Sovaldi launch, that you saw doctor prescribed neatly all at once, so I was asking more about patient flows for Harvoni, with what are you thinking about? Do you still expect even patient flow is anything that surprising you at heart, how many patients are coming in for treatment? How many doctors are prescribing? Paul Carter : Well again, very, very early days on Harvoni specifically. We are not seeing anything sort of really unexpected. We knew there was a quite a lot of patients warehouse. We saw the prescription, new prescription let's say to Sovaldi reduce between quarter two and quarter three by about 20% and you can assume, those are the warehouse patients.  Other than that, I think we are assuming that there are still plenty of patients under care, there are plenty of diagnosed patients and it will take years to work through those. Robyn Karnauskas \u2013 Deutsche Bank :  Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America. Your line is open. Ying Huang \u2013 Bank of America : First of all, I guess you know you guys are still very much in process of securing reimbursement and pricing in Europe that, when shall we expect a significant pick up in European revenues beyond just France and Germany? And then secondly, Sovaldi is being in the market for three, four quarters now. Do you think have you reached the study growth from that adjustment and what is it right now in 3Q? And then lastly I guess, Norbert you mentioned that regulators such as FDA will not sacrifice even 2%, FCR for a shorter duration, so it sounds like, we could assume that maybe a forward duration is not critical commercially? Thank you. Paul Carter : Well, there are three questions in there. Let me just quickly, deal with the first one, which is, we have made good progress with reimbursement in Europe. Several of those countries, notably Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium we have signed agreements with, but those patients haven't really started yet, we're expecting those over the next month or two or three. France, we are still working with the pricing committee there. We are close, we believe to having an agreement and as I mentioned earlier about nice in the UK, where we have their endorsement, but we still don't have full access from NHS in England, but that we hope is close. So we can anticipate over the next month, to European sales of Sovaldi beginning to ramp up. Having said that, the European sales of Sovaldi to-date I think are pretty impressive given the limited access that we've had so far, I'll hand over to Robin, for the next part. Robin Washington : Hi, Ying in regards to your second question about steady state for growth in that. As we've been saying, we've had four non-retail customers and payers come onboard, state Medicaid, MD&A as of Q2 and Q3. I'm a little hesitant to give a steady state because just as we start to get there with Sovaldi and we've now launched Harvoni. So I think it's going to take us a couple more quarters to get to the right, mix between Sovaldi and Harvoni and what that grows to that, to be particularly since we may have more patients on different periods of treatment overtime. So I'd say probably Q2 or Q3 of next year, we will have a better idea of what steady state is, as we get through the second product launch and get Harvoni, on the docket relative to reimbursement. Norbert Bischofberger : And Ying, your last question on my comment, had to do with that hurdle bar is really high for short treatment durations and as I said you know regulatory authorities do not consider price, when they think about this and they want you know with Harvoni, a drug that is so safe and well tolerated with no identifiable side effects, there is not much of a willingness to save four weeks of treatment duration, if you have to increase or decrease the response rates by a few percentages and again I will urge you to look at our IM-3 study and how it is labeled. I mean, I agree, what this by the way from a scientific point of view, of course the payors, may have a slightly different opinion on this shorter treatment duration. John Milligan : Well Norbert, whether the question was it, is it commercially competitive, you know these things if somebody else has a shorter duration than you do, with all the activity, than that becomes a competitive advantage, so that's why we are continuing to innovate across our portfolio to try to drive things to the simplest, safest, shortest, duration and that's why you'll continue to see Norbert and his crew try to innovate with other three drug combinations in the future. Ying Huang \u2013 Bank of America : Thank you for that profile answer, you all. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Howard Liang with Leerink Partners. Your lines is open. Howard Liang \u2013 Leerink Partners : Question on, what's your treatment duration in the real world with Harvoni probably for Paul, as Norbert mentioned earlier the label, recommends 12 weeks for actually for all treatment na\u00efve, not cirrhotic patients, but recommends eight weeks for those with low viral load. I'm sorry, saying the low viral can be considered for eight weeks. Some of the physicians we talk to say that, they intend to give 12-week to everyone, with treatment na\u00efve with non-cirrhotic, with no cirrhosis. In absence repair, requiring a further duration. But my question is, how live spread is this approach among physicians and how are pairs, [indiscernible] mandating eight weeks for those people to get eight weeks. Norbert Bischofberger : So, Howard the latter question, I don't know how widespread it is, but the few folks I've talked to, they told me the same thing. These are obviously the well-known academic thought leaders, they said you know why do you want to treat for eight weeks, if there is a slight change, you might have more relapse, so just treatment 12 weeks, there is no medical or adverse event price to be paid, but those same people then said, in the next symptoms that they're probably not the ones, making this decision anyway, but it's probably the payors. Paul Carter : It's far too early for us to know, what kind of patients have been treated. I think it's instructive to look further into the third quarter, where we did see very high usage of Interferon-Free, Sovaldi plus Olysio is very high premium price about $150,000. I think that will end with the arrival of Harvoni, but it will be interesting to see how long it takes to kind of to get to steady state when the usage of the eight-week regimen reflects the Epidemiology of the GG1 patients US and indeed European due course. John Milligan : Howard, I would just add we are going to make sure our sales reps are on label with this, the eight weeks is the right duration for patients, who are below 6 million international units of baseline, there is no evidence that more is better in any of these patients and that's the data that will emphasize as we go out and educate about the value of eight weeks and so I think, at the end of the day, it's very clear cut that eight weeks is a better thing for patients and over prescribing is not a good thing in this world. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Ravi Mehrotra \u2013 Credit Suisse : A little bit of left field question on Ambrisentan and given that John flagged, the AMBITION study results in his opening remarks, how do you see those results changing your marketing message in the PAH market, given the changing message for competitors which themselves have moved to [indiscernible] morbidity message. I guess, I'm asking whether you see PAH franchise as a legacy line or an opportunity for growth, which gives you an opportunity to talk about 4997? Thank you. John Milligan : Ravi, it's John Milligan. I just, when you look at the timeline for the AMBITION data that we put in the label. We'll file this before the end of year, but that means it won't be until the latter part of next year, that we'll be allowed talk about this with physicians. So we are anxious to be able to do so, it is clear that it has had an impact with the top KOLs, with regard to how they think about what the best thing is to do. I can't tell you to change prescribing habits, I don't know that, but I do know that it's becoming clear in their mind that this is the new standard or care and what we hope is, there will be further discussions and potentially guideline changes that were to allow, people to have access to this very important combination and the data, we are very crystal clear because we were better than either the individual treatment arms, not just placebo. So this was an important different that haven't been see in pulmonary arterial hypertension before. We think, this will be an important part of the armamentarium for doctors. I think your last part of the question is, does this do it for our franchise. Certainly, we are very interested in PAH, we are continuing through our own portfolio to see if other products, that we have, could be also be useful in the field of PAH and so. We'll see how things progressed, but there are some options for us to do things organically and that can be quite interesting. Ravi Mehrotra \u2013 Credit Suisse : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney with Robert W Baird. Your line is open. Brian Skorney \u2013 Robert W Baird : I guess, I'm not a little more in the Harvoni label, could you kind of walk us through in your conversations with the FDA, how they segregated the label, I here I point that they have a very high hurdle at this point, but looking at how they evaluate it, is there a point estimate in their mind that they think is necessary at this point or is it just based on looking at sub-groups that there is a specific delta at which point, they're uncomfortable with a specific duration, one over the other. Norbert Bischofberger : You know, Brian this was a long process and it was a collaborative process, we did analysis and they did analysis, the one thing you might notice in the label, the ribavirin arms aren't even in there and that was a decision that was made early because consistently across all three Phase 3 studies addition of ribavirin didn't make any difference to non-ribavirin arms and then you know, to proceeded then you look at relapse, so what are the relapse rate in the eight-week arms compared to the 12-week arms, there were 5% to 1%. Even though the numbers are fairly small and you know things evolved from there, sometimes there was a statistically significant difference, when arms were pooled. Sometimes that wasn't, but you know we ended up in this mutually acceptable situation that we are conservative, we here on the longer treatment duration arm, if there is a chance that you jeopardize response rates, that's going to, was the summary of it. And the similar thing is, by the way the case in Europe. Brian Skorney \u2013 Robert W Baird : Great and just real quick, any idea on the mix between CLL and NHL for Zydelig? John Milligan : [Indiscernible] in prescriptions? Brian Skorney \u2013 Robert W Baird : Yes, in terms of do you have any idea in terms of the patients, you're seeing or they primarily refractory, NHL patients or CLL patients. Paul Carter : Too early to tell you that, but I don't know. Brian Skorney \u2013 Robert W Baird : Okay, thanks. Paul Carter : Very early days. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Matthew Harrison \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Two parts, you mentioned something on HIV being near the high end of the range. Are you expecting some inventory to come out of the channel in the next quarter? And then just separately on patient share, I think in HCV you said that 80% of the patients you treated are na\u00efve. I'm just wondering if you can walk through that versus I think, you've talked about sort of 45%, potentially using the eight-week duration with Harvoni, so maybe you could just help us think about what percentage of those na\u00efves were cirrhotic? Thanks. Paul Carter : I was going to mention the inventory, I think one of the features of the HIV inventory build slightly, this quarter was because the quarter ended on Tuesday, which is a day typically where we get our sort of three main orders in the week, whereas the previous quarter ended on day, I can't \u2013 which day it was, but it was at the lowest end. So we did have a slight build, I think specifically at the quarter four, we should anticipate neither a build nor a flattening out of inventory probably. Matthew Harrison \u2013 Morgan Stanley : The second question was on the na\u00efve patients and the. Paul Carter : 8% of those patients, so I guess a best way to think about this in the way, we've been talking about is, of the patients we've looked across, who are treatment na\u00efve and non-cirrhotic that comes to about 45% of patients, so in looking at that 80% of patients slightly more than half of those, who would come onboard, should be eligible for that eight-week of therapy based on just a map that we've seen across large data set.  We are not 100% certain, if those patients are represented. So those that were describing in this pie chart, Slide 24 are representative of the overall datasets, when we looked at large sets of patients out there. So I don't really know that we can compare with apples-to-apples but overtime, we would expect it to be about 45% of patients. We don't know if there will be buyers early on, towards longer duration in more cirrhotic patients or not, but it seems to us, that it should even overtime at 45%. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Wei with Jefferies. Your line is open. Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Company: Just a question on, how you think about long-term HIV sales. Now that you have the TAF data in hand, when we look beyond 2017 and in the 2020's. Do you think your HIV sales will be lower than similar to higher relative to the [indiscernible] patent expiration year? Paul Carter : Well, we started with the great data on TAF and we anticipate more data coming through in the next month. So that's a very good place for us to being, the process now of thinking through our HIV portfolio. The big bucket of patients of course is a patients that already are on the treatment and will switch. What we think historically is, that kind of, when you have conversion situation, which is really the way the way that we are thinking about this from [indiscernible] to single tablet regimens to TAF based single tablet regimens. We intend to ensure, that happens and it won't happen by itself, but that's our clear intention. Operator : And O'Brien, we have time for one more question, from the line of Jason Kolbert with Maxim. Your line is open. Jason Kolbert \u2013 Maxim Group : Given the success of Sovaldi and given what's happening in the dynamic with the combination product Harvoni, how does that influence the decision to launch Sovaldi particularly in country like Japan, where you're you know haven't really launched yet, so can you just help us understand also where is the Japanese infrastructure at this date? Norbert Bischofberger : Yes, so I'll quickly talk about the launch, so as you know, we filed Sovaldi for genotype 2 only, which is about the quarter of the Japanese population and that's in combination with ribavirin, we got very high response rates and we filed Harvoni up for the remainder mostly genotype 1B patients, again we are [indiscernible] high response rate. So Japan is very bifurcated, Sovaldi with ribavirin for genotype 2, Harvoni is for genotype 1B. Paul Carter : Yes and the second part is about our infrastructure build out in Japan, which we are very, very happy about. We got over 200 Gilead employees now in Japan and getting ready for launches as in when we get approved, which we hope will be in the first half of next year for both products. Jason Kolbert \u2013 Maxim Group : That's awesome, thank you so much guys. Congratulations. Patrick O'Brien: Thank you, Kate and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and the team here looks forward to providing you with updates and future progress. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a good day.",

My name is Janney, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and as a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir. Patrick O'Brien: Thank you, Janney and good afternoon everyone. As you will have seen we issued a press release earlier this afternoon and our earnings results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2014. The press release along with detailed slides is available on the Investor Relations section of our Web site. Speaking on the call today will be John Martin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Carter, our Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations; and Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room with us for Q&A, are John Milligan, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research & Development. Before we begin our formal remarks, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations, with respect to our product candidates, estimates for the number of HCV patients we believe the U.S. Medical System will treat in 2015, estimates of the blended rebate percentage for government and private payors in our HCV franchise and financial projections, all of which involves certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and the recent press release. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. We will also be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release as well as on our Web site. I will now turn the call over to John Martin. John Martin : Thank you, Patrick and thank you all for joining us today. I will mention a few highlights for the past quarter and then make brief remarks about the year ahead before turning the call over to Paul. 2014 was marked by the launch of our first oncology product Zydelig, our second Hepatitis C product Harvoni, regulatory filings for the next-generation HIV medicine E/C/F/TAF and a doubling of product revenues relative to 2013. We are entering 2015 with financial strength, a portfolio of 19 marketable products that address significant unmet medical needs and a pipeline for which we respect a number of milestones and data readouts during the coming year. Regarding HCV since the launch of Sovaldi in December 2013 and Harvoni in October 2014 more than 170,000 individuals around the world have been treated with the sofosbuvir-based regimen. Harvoni has become the most widely used Hepatitis C regimen since its approval in October 2014 and prescription data at year-end indicate that for each Sovaldi patient, three patients started therapy with Harvoni. Gilead continues to investigate the use of Harvoni in different patient groups including non-genotype 1 infected patients and HIV co-infections and in patients with advanced liver disease. Data from these studies support the utility of Harvoni in these patient populations and the results will be presented at upcoming scientific conferences. In addition to sofosbuvir we are exploring other potent pan-genotypic agents. A single-tablet of sofosbuvir and GS-5816 is currently being evaluated in four Phase III studies and top-line data from all these studies will be available in the third quarter of this year. Moreover, we are exploring GS-9857 a pan-genotypic protease inhibitor in combination with sofosbuvir and GS-5816 to potentially further reduce treatment duration from eight to 12 weeks to four to six weeks. Even though great progress has been made in the treatment of HCV worldwide, only a fraction of the people infected the large majority who lives in lower income and middle income countries have been diagnosed to treat it. Progress is being made to expand access in less developed countries. Data presented at the first Hepatitis Conference last month showed that in Egypt since initiation of a national program in October 2014 738,000 patients have been registered, 40,000 have been selected for treatment and 15,000 have started Sovaldi therapy. Sovaldi has been approved in India and marketing authorization applications have been filed in 12 additional emerging and developing market countries. In HIV, regulatory submissions for our first TAF contained product, the single-tablet regimen of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and TAF abbreviated E/C/F/TAF have been submitted in the EU, and the U.S. The application was validated in the EU and in the U.S. it will undergo standard review with an anticipated FDA action date of November 5. The E/C/F/TAF NDA was one of our largest HIV submissions and included data from two large Phase III studies in treatment na\u00efve individuals. One study in which fully suppressed patients were switched to E/C/F/TAF, a study in renally impaired patients and a study in adolescence. Detailed data from these studies will be presented at an upcoming Scientific Conference this quarter. Our agreement with Janssen R&D Ireland was expanded to include the development of a single-tablet regimen of rilpivirine, emtricitabine and TAF. In addition, we are pursuing the development of a fixed dose combination of emtricitabine and TAF. We expect to file for approval of all the products before the end of the year. Progress also continues in oncology and the inflammation. In the year since John McHutchison\u2019s role was expanded he has recruited Philippe Bishop to lead Oncology Hematology and also John Sundy to head up the Inflammation Respiratory Therapeutic area. A number of additional hires have been made to strengthen these teams. Our oncology pipeline is expanding, we recently entered an exclusive license agreement with ONO Pharmaceuticals for the development and commercialization of what is now called GS-4059, a BTK inhibitor for B-cell malignancies and other diseases. With this agreement Gilead now has compounds targeting four signaling pathways associated with B-cell malignancies, PI3K Delta, Syk, JAK und BTK. The use of this BTK inhibitor will be studied in combination with Gilead\u2019s other kinase inhibitors with the goal of achieving more pronounced and more durable response rates. GS-5745 the anti-MMP9 antibody is undergoing evaluation in ulcerative colitis and gastric and pancreatic cancer. Based on promising safety and efficacy data we anticipate moving the compound forward in clinical development for ulcerative colitis and gastric cancer in 2015. In addition, Phase II studies are planned in Crohn's Disease. Simtuzumab the anti-LOXL2 antibody has been in evaluation for myelofibrosis, pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer. In these three indications there was no evidence of efficacy although Simtuzumab was safe and well tolerated. Simtuzumab is undergoing evaluation and NASH, PSC and IPF, with the Phase II NASH and PSC clinical studies fully enrolled and the Phase II IPF study approximately 80% enrolled. Also for NASH an ASK-1 inhibitor and FXR agonist will be advanced into clinical development. Right to FXR agonist were acquired through an agreement with Phoenix that we announced in January. The ASK-1 inhibitor is currently into Phase II studies for diabetic neuropathy and pulmonary arterial hypertension. And we will begin a Phase II study in NASH in the first half of this year. Finally the Board has approved a quarterly cash dividend program to commence in the second quarter of this year and a new $15 billion five year repurchase program, Robin will provide more details on these items in a few minutes. The year ahead is expected to be as busy as 2014 and all of us across the organization and in collaboration with our many partners are working toward a shared goal of developing new treatments and providing access to Gilead\u2019s medicines for patients in need. I am pleased with the progress we have made and look forward to updating you as the year progresses. I will now turn the call over to Paul Carter to provide a commercial update. Paul Carter : Thanks, John and good afternoon, everyone. Gilead achieved $7.2 billion of net product revenue in the fourth quarter, representing a 137% year-over-year growth. Net product revenue for the quarter consisted of $5.5 billion U.S. sales, $1.4 billion of European sales and more than 300 million sales from the rest of the world, the primary drivers of the Company\u2019s strong performance during the fourth quarter with a continued uptake of sofosbuvir containing HCV regimens and the continued healthy demand in our HIV business. I'll start with some commentary around our HCV business. Hepatitis C revenue increased to $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter. In the U.S. revenues were 3.2 billion with 1.2 billion from Sovaldi and 2 billion from Harvoni. We estimate that 43,000 patients started treatment on a sofosbuvir-based regimen in the quarter with 31,000 of those starting on Harvoni following its launch in October. To-date approximately 140,000 patients have started HCV therapy on a Gilead product in the United States. Harvoni's launch in the U.S. is going well with filled prescriptions tracking above Sovaldi\u2019s at the same time point. The base of treated is expanding with more than 10,000 physicians now having prescribed a sofosbuvir-based regimen about 11,000 of who began subscribing after the launch of Harvoni. Indeed seven out of 10 HCV patients initiating treatment in the fourth quarter started on Harvoni the remainder on a Sovaldi containing regimen. Across our franchise about three quarters of patients treated were genotype 1, 16% were genotype 2, 7% were genotype 3 and 3% were other genotypes. As in prior quarters we saw prescriptions written for all stages of fibrosis. Although after the launch of Harvoni we saw payor restrictions increasingly in place across all patient types and especially for those with lower fibrosis scores. As expected there was a net inventory build in our HCV business in the fourth quarter following the launch of Harvoni. This was partly offset by a decrease in Sovaldi inventory and we believe that in total HCV inventory ended the year at the higher-end of the normal range necessary to support demand. As we've seen in years past we think that treatment inventory could draw down in the first quarter and then track more normally with demand through the rest of 2015. In the fourth quarter price volume negotiations for Sovaldi were finalized with a number of countries including France, Italy and Spain and the product is now being sold in the majority of countries in Europe. Overall Sovaldi contributed more than $1.5 billion to European sales during 2014. Harvoni was improved in the EU in November and the product is now available in Austria, Sweden, Finland and Germany. In France and the UK it is available under early access program. Across the EU 32,000 individuals have started treatment with a Gilead HCV regimen approximately 26,000 of those are in the EU big five countries and of these 4,000 have initiated treatment with Harvoni. We are in the process of securing reimbursement for Harvoni across numerous countries in the EU and we expect this to be completed at least as quickly as we experienced for Sovaldi. We expect both sofosbuvir-based therapies to continue to perform strongly in 2015. And we are confident in the differentiated clinical profile of our products. Harvoni offers an unparallel combination of efficacy safety and regimen simplicity for Hepatitis C genotype 1 patients including treatment na\u00efve and treatment experienced patients and patients with and without cirrhosis. Our new arrangement with the majority of National Pharmacy Benefit Managers or PBM will ensure that Gilead\u2019s drugs are readily available for patients within these systems. We anticipate far fewer restrictions on reimbursement and the updated professional guidelines will likely open up treatment to many more individuals. This should reduce hurdles and the time it takes the medical stuff to navigate the reimbursement process, particularly for patients with earlier stage disease. There has been as you're all aware a substantial amount of public discussion about the payor landscape. As a Company we believe that treatment decisions are best made by doctors and their patients. We will however continue taking the steps necessary to ensure as many patients as possible have access to our best-in-class Hepatitis C treatments. We expect our 2015 growth to net adjustments for our HCV products in the United States to be approximately 46% or a little more than double of that where we ended 2014 which was around 22%. This increase is the result of the recent and ongoing round of negotiations with payors and PBMs and includes the shift towards a higher proportion of public payors and high prescribing of Harvoni amongst those payors with rebates to payors such as the Medicaid and the VA exceeding 50%. Again these higher levels of rebates are tied directly to opening up access and streamlining the process of starting a patient on therapy. Overall with these new arrangements in place we are confident that a substantially higher number of patients will be treated in the United States in 2015. We think that there is capacity to treat at least 250,000 patients across all genotypes. Before I move on I wanted to mention that we are well prepared for launch of Sovaldi and Harvoni in Japan in anticipation of their respective approvals during 2015. As you know a significant number of patients are suffering from HCV in Japan and the country has one of the highest rates of liver cancer of any industrialized country. Moving on to HIV, in 2014 Gilead continued its commercial and clinical success. In the U.S. our HIV business generated $1.9 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter and 6.3 billion for the full year. While underlying demand was strong HIV inventories ended the quarter at the high-end of the inventory management agreement range. Full year growth of 17% was driven by our Truvada-based single-tablet regimens Complera and Stribild. In particular volume for Stribild doubled year-over-year and the product passed through $1 billion of revenue in 2014. More than 80% of new patients initiated therapy on a Gilead product with nearly 70% on one of our Truvada-based single-tablet regimens. Stribild remained a number one most prescribed regimen in treatment na\u00efve patients, Complera number two and each of the top-five regimens across treated patients included the Gilead Truvada back pain. In Europe our HIV business generated 3.2 billion in sales for the year with Eviplera and Stribild more than doubling versus 2013. Eviplera remained the most prescribed regimen for treatment na\u00efve patients and our very latest information shows that Stribild in fact has moved up from fourth to second position. As a reminder, the data shown in the slides we provide on our Web site reflects a one quarter lag. Eviplera and Stribild also remained the most prescribed regimen for switch patients. I also wanted to mention the approval of two new fixed dose combinations that combine Gilead\u2019s cobicistat or boosting agent with protease inhibitor. Cobicistat is of course part of Stribild and a component of E/C/F/TAF. Bristol-Myers Squibb announced approval last week of Evotaz a once-daily pill combining atazanavir with cobicistat and Johnson & Johnson announced approval of PREZCOBIX a combination of darunavir and cobicistat. FDA approved both products to use in combination with other anti-virals for the treatment of HIV in adults. We are very pleased to expand the use of cobicistat with these new options to patients. With regards to our cardiovascular portfolio Ranexa and Letairis together represented more than $1.1 billion of revenue during 2014. We submitted a supplemental NDA with the data from the Letairis AMBITION study in December and anticipate inclusion of these data in the U.S. label during 2015. In summary I am very pleased with the efforts of our team and our results in 2014 and excited about the progress we will make in 2015 across Gilead\u2019s areas of therapeutic focus. And with that I will now turn it over to Robin. Robin Washington : Thank you, Paul and good afternoon. For the first time we have announced the initiation of a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share that will begin in the second quarter of 2015 subject to a declaration by our Board of Directors. The quarterly dividend is equivalent to a $1.72 per share on an annual basis and approximates an annual yield of 1.6% based on yesterday\u2019s closing stock price. Also the Board of Directors authorized a new 15 billion five year share repurchase program, which we will initiate in 2013 on completion of our currently authorized $5 billion program. The initiation of a dividend and our increased level of share repurchases underscore our abilities and the strength of our future cash flow. Consistent with prior communication we also believe our future cash flow will provide us with adequate financial flexibility to support our pipeline growth in any future M&A opportunities or collaborations that we might consider. Turning to the financial results. Total revenues were 24.9 billion for the year, up 122% year-over-year and 7.3 billion for the fourth quarter up 21% sequentially. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $8.09 per share for the year. Net product sales for the year were 24.5 billion ahead of our 2014 revised guidance. Our product sales for 2014 excluding HCV products were 12.1 billion an increase of 13% compared to the prior year, driven by continued uptake of our HIV single-tablet regimen across geographies. During 2014 Complera, Eviplera and Stribild product sales each exceeded the $1 billion mark for the first time. Our HCV product sales were 12.4 billion for 2014 and 3.8 billion for the fourth quarter, an increase of 36% sequentially, driven by continued launches of Sovaldi across geographies and the launch uptake of Harvoni following U.S. and European approvals during the fourth quarter. Turning to expenses for the full year 2014. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were 2.6 billion, up 33% compared to the prior year and reflecting the continued progression of our product pipeline. In particular in oncology and liver disease and supportive geographic expansion as well as one-time items such as our collaboration with ONO Pharmaceutical and the purchase of an FDA priority review voucher during the fourth quarter. Absent these one-time items R&D expenses would have been within our guidance range. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were 2.8 billion up 77% compared to the prior year driven by the commercial launch of our HCV and oncology products and as discussed last quarter an increase in the planned prescription drug fee of $481 million for the full year, resulting from the issuance of final regulations by the IRS which required manufacturers to recognize an additional year of expense in 2014. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter decreased to 17.3% primarily due to the extension of the federal research tax credit in the fourth quarter reducing the full year 2014 non-GAAP effective tax rate to 17.9%. We generated 12.8 billion in cash from operations for the full year 2014. During the fourth quarter, we raised 4 billion in debt financing for general corporate purposes including share repurchases, repayment of debt and working capital needs. We also repaid 1 billion in previously outstanding debt during the fourth quarter. We utilized 5.3 billion in cash to repurchase 59 million shares at an average price of $90.29 per share in 2014. In the fourth quarter, we utilized 2 billion of the May 2014 5 billion share repurchase plan. Finally, I would like to cover our full year 2015 non-GAAP financial guidance summarized on Slide 56 in the earnings presentation available on our corporate Web site. We expect product sales to be in the range of 26 billion to 27 billion, an increase of 6% to 10% over 2014. Our guidance for product revenues is subject to a number of uncertainties including the continuation of a challenging macroeconomic environment in Europe, inclusive of the potential adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce HCV spending. The potential for continued volatility and foreign currency exchange rates inaccuracy in our HCV patient estimate and increase in discount, charge back and rebates due to the ongoing commercial payor contract negotiation and a larger than anticipated shift in payor mix to more highly discounted payor segment such as PHF, FFS, Medicaid and the VA and the commercial launches of Sovaldi and Harvoni in Japan. Our non-GAAP product gross margin is expected to be in the range of 87% to 90%. We expect our non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in the range of 3 billion to 3.3 billion as we continue to invest in our product pipeline. We expect our non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in the range of 3 billion to 3.3 billion, which is due to the continued build out and expansion of our commercial infrastructure in Europe and Asia to support Sovaldi and Harvoni. For the full year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 18% to 20%. This excludes any impact from the 2015 federal R&D tax credit which if extended this year would lower our overall effective tax rate. We anticipate the full year diluted EPS impacts of acquisition related restructuring and stock-based compensation expenses to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.87 per share. In closing, we are pleased with our 2014 results and our ability to provide additional clarity around our capital allocation strategy. We look forward to the opportunities ahead in 2015. We would now like to open the call for questions. Operator? Question-and: Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Geoffrey Porges from Sanford Bernstein. Geoffrey Porges : Many items to ask questions about, but first and could you just quickly give us a comment on your intentions with the dividend is this something that we should expect you to continue to grow in the future or is it sort of static as it is? And secondly, is your guidance assuming 250,000 patients treated and a greater than 40% gross to net or is it assuming something different to that? Thanks very much. Robin Washington : Hi Geoff, it's Robin, I\u2019ll answer the first part of the question and I\u2019ll turn the second part over to Paul. It is our intention to grow the dividend overtime, but I would say at the moment we still use share repurchases as the component that would be the larger percentage of our share return strategy, it will be larger than dividends for the foreseeable future. Geoffrey Porges : And thanks very much. Paul Carter : Yes Geoff, I mean in terms of our guidance we have still some variables ahead of us here, but mainly the number of patients that are coming through, we believe that the system has the capacity to treat as I said in my script in excess of 250,000 patients and the agreement that we have entered into, a design to open up access and we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re going to see a large increase in the number of patients across the U.S. So yes, our guidance does consider the patient numbers that we think, plus the gross to net, that we just described. Operator : The next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoff Meacham : So just want to know what you guys have learnt from the field in Hep C in the U.S. and in Europe that supports the market that\u2019s just different from older stats some of the stats that we see out there are pretty tired and maybe decades old? And then how does it speak to the sustainability of patient inflows and I guess for that part of the question you may be consider the volume increases that you may expect to see for the next several year from the launch? Thanks. John Milligan : Geoff this is John Milligan just to be clear you said the stats that are getting a little tired are you meaning the number of patients who are available for treatment? Geoff Meacham : Correct yes some of the prevalence and in incident stats I think are pretty dated I know you guys have updated on one of your slides. But I wanted to kind of get your view from the field John and maybe some of the sources of some of the stats that you guys have collated? John Milligan : Yes thanks for clarifying that. So it's pretty clear based on our field-based research and the comments from the doctors that there are a lot of people continuing to seek therapy who were denied therapy and it was getting pretty difficult through the last part of last year for patients even as high as F3 scores to get some treatment. So we believe based on this and trying to triangulate with the numbers that are in the public domain that there is a very considerable number of patients who will seek therapy for 2015 thus the numbers that we're talking about in terms of the potential of patients who could seek care. Looking beyond that we still feel that it is a number that\u2019s pretty strong is the 1.6 million people who are currently diagnosed and have been under care at least at some point in the past and we see there is great opportunity for Gilead in future years to drive those patients into care. And so there are a number of program that we'll be embarking upon this year. Educational campaigns, with things like primary care not with the intent of them treating but with referring and identifying the disease and all the way through advertising campaigns that in 2016, 2017 and 2018 and beyond and probably a number of years beyond that we will continue to strive those patients into care. I think additionally as these therapies have gotten both more affordable for the system and better because of the simplicity of use we will see those other patients that roughly 3 million to 4 million people who are out there. The additional two plus million who are out there or above the 1.6 we'll also have an opportunity to seek care and we do see a great opportunity to drive those patients. So we do see this as a long-term sustainable business based on what we\u2019ve seen to-date despite the rapid influx that we saw in 2014 and the continued influx that we anticipate in 2015. Geoff Meacham : The same situation John in Europe? John Milligan : In Europe the situation is actually quite sustainable I think for a number of years. What we're seeing our commitments from the public sectors to treat a certain number of patients and in most of those cases it's a considerable higher number of patients and have historically been treated. But when we look at the denominator the total number of patients who could be treated this is something that plays out roughly 10 to 15 years or in the cases some of the high prevalence countries like Italy even beyond that. So we do think it is quite a sustainable market through Europe. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI. Mark Schoenebaum : Just a clarification on Geoff Porges\u2019 question I am not sure you answered if you did I apologize. But within your guidance rather than passing the system what actually is your patient estimate AbbVie of course on their call mentioned they thought 175 roughly to 215 a U.S. G1 patients would be treated would actually be treated in 2015 I was wondering if you would be willing to tell us what you're actually, how many patients are actually assuming will be treated? And then what was your government to private mix in '14 and what do you expect it to be in '15? Thanks. John Martin : So Mark let's just start with the first part of that question in terms of what our guidance provides and so there is a specific patient number that I'm going to give to you. What we have in there is the range of different prices depending on the mix of private to public and there are a range of different discounts offered across all those areas. There is a range of market share assumptions that we have put in there and then of course there is a range of patient numbers in there and I thought the AbbVie sort of general range of patients was a reasonable one we think there could be capacity to go up as Paul said up to $250,000 but our assumption on total patient numbers isn\u2019t actually $250,000 it's less than that. Sorry $250,000 patients it\u2019s less than that, so it's fair to say that there is a range of things that will come into play and that will determine how we do on a quarter and on yearly basis as we hit that different mix of patients across those segments. Your second question was about last year and about 70% of our patients last year came from the private sector. Mark Schoenebaum : And this year? John Martin : This year we're not actually sure because there is a number, so I can't tell you that number because there is too many factors that flux right now. Including the different contracts that we and AbbVie are competing for in the Medicaid sectors we do anticipate that these contracts will get signed earlier than they have historical in fact some are being signed now. And so you will see a sort of historically if you think about Gilead it starts very private with our launches and then it eventually becomes to sort of a steady state with the public and private mix, we will get to that mix much more quickly this year because of the acceleration and the negotiations and so we should have a better handle on that as we get into Q2, but I don\u2019t know exactly where it\u2019s going to shake out right now because there are so many contracts in flux right now. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Roden from UBS. Matt Roden : And also thanks for the increased clarity on the gross to net, that\u2019s obviously been a major issue for people. You obviously felt confident enough about that number to disclose it, but you mentioned contracting is one of the uncertainties reflected in your guidance the range of payor mix et cetera. So how confident are you that you can hold that level for this year? And then what would you expect when additional entrants come to market next year and years to come? Thanks. John Martin : So, we think that as of today and some of the negotiations are ongoing but about 60% of the covered lives across the U.S. have now been negotiated and signed on, and of that 60% Gilead we think has access or patients have access around 80% of those, of that 60% will access to Harvoni. The rest of the 40% is still in play. But I can say for the 60% part of covered lives that we are very confident that the terms that have been negotiated will last through the rest of this year. And as I already said those terms have been designed to increase access. So we do expect to see a significant number of patients increasing through those PBMs and payors compared to 2014. Matt Roden : Okay, and for the coming years when there is additional entrants to the market? John Martin : Well, I think the real life-data first of all on our products is going to be a key piece here. And I should say I would like to emphasize that in our negotiations already with payors most of those payors have really taken into consideration the highly differentiated product that we offer compared to competition and have made a full assessment of that. So I think we have to wait until we see the profile, the real-world profile of our existing competition and of course the data with the future competitors before we start. We are very-very confident in Harvoni with its one pill once a day and the ability to treat perhaps 50% of GT1 patients in the U.S. with just eight weeks with no need for ribavirin issues, no need for drug-drug interaction issues with tenofovir and for most classes of patients absolutely fine to take Harvoni unlike our competitors. So I think time will tell a little bit before we can see what happens. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets. Michael Yee : One question is you have been talking about government versus non-government or commercial versus non-commercial, versus in the patients treated in 2015 what do you think that breakout is between those two buckets 30-35 or 65 closer to 50-50 how should we think about those two buckets which obviously have different rebates? John Martin : As John said in 2014 the proportion of private to public was about 70-30, we expect during 2015 it might be a little bit more public but I suspect it will be more in that type of proportion. Michael Yee : Well how does that differ in Europe, because we are thinking about one payor system but there is obviously competition and should we be thinking about similar negotiations where they are thinking about exclusives or we should be thinking about equal parity and they are offering both the drugs just so we understand the stuff that come across the table in the course of your negations, countries getting deals? John Martin : Yes, we have negotiated for Sovaldi with most of the countries in Europe and these have not been on an exclusive basis, but the nature of the arrangements are tied directly to increasing access to patients. So we have volume type incentive to try and encourage a much higher number of patients treated going forward than has ever been seen in the past. So, I think our competition will be doing similar kinds of arrangements but again we are very-very confident in the clinical profile of our drug and we hope that will be very successful in Europe as we have been so far. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Abrahams from Wells Fargo. Brian Abrahams : Just curious of the plans that allow access to both Harvoni and the competitive drug Viekira what proportion of patients are you seeing go on to Harvoni. And you have patients with relative use to be eight week or 12 week Harvoni regimen? Thanks. John Martin : It\u2019s just too early, I think as a launch of the Viekira Pak is less than a month old, so we don\u2019t really have any good data to suggest how our competition is fairing versus how we are fairing. So it\u2019s too early to say in terms of how these parity deals are working out for either of us. And many of these things have just been point of high so it\u2019s very early day so please be patient with us. You had mentioned also whether the eight week versus 12 week. It was our expectation and our continued expectation that in the initial launch of Harvoni far more patients to go on to 12-week than the eight-week because there were the more severely ill patients and that in fact is what we\u2019ve seen that the very small percentage of patients perhaps that has used at least 20% of patients going on the eight weeks versus the 12-weeks. We do anticipate that that will increase overtime as restrictions go down and as less severely ill patients come onboard and those patients get benefit from the eight-week therapy. Operator : The next question comes from Yaron Werber from Citigroup. Yaron Werber : If you don\u2019t mind I just have a follow-up and the new question, the -- if I sort of listen to what you're saying and I am sort of backing into the commercial discounts, I am still getting about sort of 40% range assuming just a slight year-over-year increase in the component of public over private, am I sort of in the right ballpark? And then secondly, when you look at Europe, Europe grew by 10% quarter-over-quarter, how fast should we think about the volume increasing in Europe, now that you have reimbursement? Thanks. John Martin : Yaron, yes, let me just talk about the European peace and I\u2019ll hand back to John. So, the European part we\u2019re seeing most of these agreements have only really been finalized in the last quarter of 2014. So, I would say, I would characterize Europe as really just beginning access to the majority of patients, and what we\u2019ve tried to do though is with each of our agreements is work with the governments to assess that budgetary constraints, the prevalence of patients in the country and then tried to come to an arrangement which as John had alluded to earlier, probably the kind of longer-term approach to addressing their HCV challenge. So kind of lower proportion of the total diagnosed patients will be treated each year, but we do think there is going to be a significant increase in patients treated across Europe and we\u2019re starting to see the first signs of that as we exit 2014. John Milligan : And Yaron, we\u2019re just not going to be able to give you any greater conformation of any specific discount, I just want to remind you of a couple of things, this is a blended discount that is across those Sovaldi and Harvoni inclusive of public and private and I want to remind you as Paul said in the lot of these private negotiation this were related to certain relaxation of restrictions so that more patients could get access and so that was factored into this as well, but other than that I can\u2019t give any more color on what the exact specific discount would be. Operator : The next question comes from Ian Somaiya from Nomura Securities. Ian Somaiya : Just trying to get a I guess a better handle on how we should model what are the essence of the cost of cure, and I know you mentioned that the duration of treatment therapy is roughly 20% it reached 30% I think 12 weeks. How should we think about that going forward and given the more moderate pace of patients being treated in Europe, how will that differ relative to the U.S.? John Martin : So I mean Ian, I think we\u2019ve given you all the things that you need to model this, we\u2019ve given you the specific gross to net, we\u2019ve talked a little bit about where this eight-week versus 12 could come out, we think it could grow to close to half of U.S. patients, I can\u2019t tell you how that\u2019s going to play out during the course of this year as some doctors still prefer 12 and we don\u2019t know what the percentage of patients with different underlying for gross disclosure would be that would preclude them from the eight-week. So it's challenging for us as it is for you, but I think we\u2019ve given you the -- as many details as we can to build out a model to get to where we are in our guidance as well. Operator : The next question comes from Phil Nadeau from Cowen and Company. Phil Nadeau : First, on the gross to net that seems to be taking everyone by surprise, you qualitatively discussed whether this gross to net is about where you thought it would eventually get to or because of the things that you're doing to open up access is the gross side a bit bigger than you would have anticipated? And secondly in Europe, it sounds like you have a lot of information on budgets and whatnot. Can you give us a sense of overtime more proportion of your HCV revenues in any given year do you think will come out of Europe? Thank you. John Martin : Phil, I am trying to figure out how I would answer this question but what my expectations were, my expectation that overtime prices in this deal would go down based on two things; one would be, increased competition and the other would be decreasing time of therapy and both of those things are occurring and so I guess my expectation is that it came down a little bit more than we thought but at the end of the day we felt that it would come down to a level of about this for the treatment of HCV. And so I think we\u2019re at about where we thought we would be in this area. On the Europe part, I think it was just proportionately we\u2019re going to head, I mean I think overtime we\u2019ll see Europe as a bigger proportion relative to the U.S. and that is partly because of the time lag on the regulatory process and agreeing pricing and really kind of Europe getting into a swing. But I would caveat that by just kind of repeating that there are these clear budget caps across European countries which will slow things down there. So, I think probably our HCV business will be proportionately same to the U.S. as it is in HIV overtime when we kind of get to that sort of steady state they and just to emphasize again we do see Europe as having a long sort of time tail to it. So we should see our business continue to grow there for many years. Operator : The next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank. Robyn Karnauskas : But I am just trying to think about the discount I think are ahead of what the street is thinking and as a blended rate and we know that other competitors are coming on in the market. How aggressive how low can we go, can you give us any comfort on these gross to net can't erode significantly over the next year or two? And then a question on the volume side as I'm looking at what you're saying like the 250 range you\u2019ve mentioned before as being a really great year. How much do you think the system can handle is 250 like what these payors have said that they actually could handle so they will control volumes to keep it that way? Or do you think eventually we could higher and they may be willing to go higher if prices remain relatively stable? Thanks. John Martin : On the first one as I look at our products then I look at the future competition that we're going have and I look at our emerging really remarkable profile of our Harvoni it's proving to be useful on a far greater range of patients than we thought. And look at our next-generation opportunities and I think we have by far the most competitive portfolio out there and that gives me great confident that we will be able to continue to have good product pricing throughout our segments. I am not at all concerned about future competition that people seem to be concerned about I think it's a very as it is a very strong category for us with our profile. So I think this first decrease in gross net is getting everybody to about where they want to be for the industry and for the patients as well. I forget the second question circle you can remember what it was? Robyn Karnauskas : The volume so you've mentioned like 250 being a good year and like the question is, can the system handle more at the same price like overtime or would they keep it in that range managing by fibrosis score, do you think that that\u2019s like what they could handle overtime? John Martin : So right now that number is not a number that\u2019s being managed. Paul did mention some things in Europe for their accounts. This is not a specific number that our managed care is working towards this is our estimation of what the capacity of this system would be and an estimation of what we think the patient inflows could be for 2015. The capacity of this system will depend on quite frankly on how well these products perform how many patients it cures and how many of the restrictions are really taken away for the physician and patient to get on therapy. And there are commitments that we have seen to remove those restriction we will have to wait to see how that plays out and whether those restrictions will capped at a certain level or not in the future. I don\u2019t know beyond 2015 what our expectation is yet because I have to see how things perform in 2015 so it\u2019s very difficult for us to predict. Paul Carter : Yes, and would add our sales team has been spending a lot of their time focused on kind of securing access during 2014 and we do see them being able to shift to really driving demand for the products and differentiating product benefits going forward. So it\u2019s a good thing. Operator : The next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Cory Kasimov : I'll get off with the HCV market dynamic questions for a minute and go back to the dividend. So I don\u2019t think many people are expecting you to start paying one just yet. I am curious have anything changed with your thinking on this front and does this imply anything about the acquisition opportunities that you currently see in this market? Thanks. Robin Washington : Hi Cory not at all this is Robin and may be John will chime in as well. But no really the timing of our dividend really reflects a confidence that we have in our business and our robust balance sheet as well as just the strength of our future cash flow as we look at it and again as we said all along there are no so vehicles that we can use to return free cash flow this gives us a disciplined approach of having a portion of it regular and something that people can count on or bake into their models and the rest will allow us to be flexible. But also as I mentioned it doesn\u2019t in anyway prevent us from invested in our business our pipeline or M&A it be between our free cash flows as well as our access to borrowing capacity we don\u2019t feel constrained in anyway by issuing a dividend. John Martin : I think Robin you said it all very well. I agree with that. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : I just wanted to ask specifically about access restrictions. We saw in the Express Scripts\u2019 release where they talked about specifically lowering the fibrosis status we haven\u2019t seen that out a lot of the releases that have gone for a Gilead product can you just maybe specifically state what sort of access restrictions have you gained with the discounts and what do you see is sort of the ability of patients to access. Are we talking all the way up to zero or are we talking only F1 sort of just top categorize that a little bit? Thanks. John Martin : Yes Matt as I said negotiated with the aim of increasing access and we've submitted during those negotiations what I describe as a kind of big metrics in order to secure those agreements and those bid matrices encourage why the access base on fibrosis scores amongst other things. So the agreements we have signed will not be going to any specific ones do go as far as opening up to F0 but if actions don\u2019t mean words then those rebates wouldn\u2019t be given. So that\u2019s kind of how we are looking at it. And I can confirm that in some agreements we have got full access signed up, in terms of fibrosis scores. Matthew Harrison : And maybe just the follow-up the 46% growth there that you talked about, what kind of access on that metrics are you assuming? John Martin : Well we cannot go into any detail on that. I mean as John said earlier it\u2019s a whole mix of product mix of payor mix of timing and it\u2019s a calculation we have done but I wouldn\u2019t want to equate that to any kind of access criteria. Operator : The next question comes from Howard Liang from Leerink. Howard Liang : So maybe I will have some R&D question. Could your three HCV regimen the 9857 Sovaldi and 5816 could be four week and six week data to be available earlier than second half of \u201915 than to the start of in the fourth quarter. And could you start a Phase III this year? Norbert Bischofberger : And so Howard this is Norbert. Thanks for asking and non-gross to net non-capital allocation question. I really appreciate it. So, yes, we are looking at the three door combination in pan-genotypic and we are currently looking at four weeks, six weeks, cirrhotic, non-cirrhotic treatment experienced treatment na\u00efve. You should see some of those data in EASL in April in Vienna. And based on the emerging data and it\u2019s really just merging we will then make a decision to go into Phase III and that could happen sometime in the second half of this year, yes. Howard Liang : And just a follow-up, have you made it into a single tablet? Norbert Bischofberger : Yes, it kind of goes without saying that all the combination we will doing the single-tablet regimens, yes. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Skorney from Robert W. Baird. Brian Skorney : Just on the 250,000 patient number that you have been talking about for this year, if we look back last year at IMS and something health data, NRx is actually a really good surrogates for the numbers you have being given us for new patients. But if I look back like the last couple of weeks of total NRxs I mean it would indicate that if annualized and it actually sees somewhere around 300,000 patients in 2015 and that\u2019s it looks so on a pretty early growth curve trajectory and that is assuming that Viekira is not being underreported at what you with the at least says but it is, -- I guess where is the disconnect there? Or what we are seeing in IMS data not actually a reflection of what you are seeing in terms of new patients coming on anymore? John Martin : Well Brian we have put a lot of faith in a couple of data points, and so that would be my main concern there is if you are taking two points and drawing a line out for the future and there is a lot more variability that than, since we are just getting into the early part of a launch. So we will continue to monitor as will you and come up with some better idea what the long-term sustainable rate of patients is for the year. Brian Skorney : And if I could just ask on Sovaldi can you give us any indication in terms of the breakout of usage over the last couple of months say, are we still seeing genotype 1 new patients or has this kind of become now a non-genotype 1 market here? John Martin : Brian there a are few genotype 1 I would say that Sovaldi according to the latest research we have which is mainly around quarter four I would say that about 30% of Sovaldi use is in genotype 1, but we would imagine that would disappear fairly quickly during quarter one and quarter two. Operator : The next question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America. Ying Huang : First question how should we think about European pricing, because we know that Sovaldi is priced at about 20% to 40% discounts the VAT pricing for U.S. pricing. Should we think about a Harvoni pricing in Europe at that range of discount on top of the 46% growth in that already? And then second quarter is exactly in terms of the patients taking Harvoni today, what is the percentage of patients that are F0 to F2 and how much more relaxation do you think you will get from the payors if you already have seen a significant amount of patients who are early stage? Thank you. John Martin : Yes the European prices we are not going to go into any detail of any of our arrangements there between countries, what I can say is that we have public prices, list prices in several of the countries which are in the public domain most of those are underpinned by the positive endorsement that NICE gave in the UK which shows Sovaldi is the highly effective at that price. We do have and I have alluded to this some rebate arrangements in place which encourage significant increase of volumes in those countries. And I think that\u2019s all I can really say about the European arrangements. Ying Huang : Sure. John Martin : F0 to F2 we don\u2019t have very good data on this. What we do have data on is what the intension to describe rather than the prescriptions that are actually filled. So, I can say F0 to F2, the intention to describe as defined by prescriptions written in the U.S. is actually around -- a surprisingly high around 50%. We believe that the actual prescriptions filled for those fibrosis types is significantly lower historically because of all these restrictions that were put in place. So, we would anticipate that that number would increase during the first couple of quarters this year in line with the arrangements we\u2019ve signed up. Operator : The next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Just wondering if you guys have, thought about a target payout ratio with respect to buybacks and dividends overtime? And then second question is just regarding, you gave us some pretty detailed data on U.S. capacity, but what about EU capacity, any color there long-term? Thanks. Robin Washington : Hi Terence, I\u2019ll start with the first part. We don\u2019t really want to set a target, again as I mentioned earlier our focus will still be primarily share repurchases for shareholder returns and that\u2019s the level and aggressiveness with which we do them will really be based on how we feel about our evaluations. If you look over the past several years, we returned about 50 a little over 50% of our free cash flow and based on our evaluation, I mean that\u2019s an area that we\u2019re comfortable with, but we reserve the right to ratchet that down overtime I think particularly as you think about a dividend for the second half you\u2019d expect us lower share repurchases a bit. John Martin : And the European capacity, I mean I said in my script, that so far up till the end of 2014 with just Sovaldi really in the EU we treated we think around 32,000 patients last year. Now we\u2019ve only really timed up several of the governments on Sovaldi towards the end of last year and we\u2019re moving fast with Harvoni and we would anticipate Harvoni being a far more attractive product because of its simplicity and all the other very clear benefits it has. So it's hard to say, but I think that we have got a substantial number of patients in Europe that could and should be treated it will depend somewhat on the budget tax as I\u2019ve already alluded to how strictly those are enforced. But I think we have a large and healthy growing and sustainable market in Europe for many years. Terence Flynn : But can you give us directionally versus the U.S. the 250, the same magnitude lower or higher? John Martin : I think it's just a really hard question to answer, I am sorry, I can\u2019t answer that, but I think that if you thought of a number north of a hundred thousand that would kind of seem logical. Operator : The next question comes from Thomas Wei from Jefferies. Thomas Wei : Just wanted to ask about the waterfall part perhaps fee and the bar that\u2019s missing on the diagnosed patients that are under the care of a physician? And then also wanted to ask about Simtuzumab, I thought I heard you say no activity in myelofibrosis, I thought you were looking at bone marrow biopsies there and does that mean you did not see any effect as like any anti-fibrotic effect and what do you think that in terms of NASH? Thanks. Norbert Bischofberger : Yes, so Thomas it Norbert I\u2019ll answer the last question first, quick. And so we\u2019re looking at it in myelofibrosis, pancreatic and colorectal cancer in all of those three educations there was no activity and you're right in myelofibrosis we looked at histology at the end point and the other two indications that was PFS. But I would like to point out that it's -- myelofibrosis is biologically different from liver and pulmonary fibrosis and I do not think you can extrapolate those two diseases. So, we still have hope and somewhat confidence that it's different and we\u2019ll see that in Phase II for NASH or PSC and for IPF. John Martin : And Thomas your first question was about the missing bar in the waterfall and we just didn\u2019t have any confidence in what number to put in for patients who are under care, we\u2019re confident in the 1.6 million people who have been diagnosed, we do recognize that a number of those have soft care directly from that bar if you will and many of if any care over the course this year and sort of bypass that middle part of the waterfall and because it's such a fast moving field and because our data is a quarter to rare as we felt it was no longer representative and so we stopped using the draft ball together the last quarter, but brought back the diagnosed bar and the overall bars for more confident that those two numbers are reasonably accurate. We just can\u2019t tell you who is in the care right now because it is moving so quickly. Operator : And Mr. O'Brien, we have time for one more question. Our final question comes from Josh Schimmer from Piper Jaffray. Josh Schimmer : Just given that you\u2019ve experienced rapid acceleration and then deceleration in earnings growth, is it a priority to find a more stable and sustainable face of EPS growth, and so when do you think you\u2019ll become or you\u2019ll move on to a more stable trajectory and do you believe that over the long-term you can continue to deliver double-digit earnings growth despite some of the mid to long-term headwinds? Thanks. John Martin : Josh there is a lot of pronouncements in there. We have certainly made great progress over the last year I think we continue to make great progress and have a very reasonable stable base of business. But as always we're going invest in numbers pipeline and continuing to bring products out we have some really interesting things going on as we announced today the MMP9 antibody is moving ahead because it shows activity in two different times of very interesting long-term diseases and we'll continue to invest in products by licensing. So I feel we have as Robin said the capability financially to buy back shares to pay dividends and to invest heavily in the pipeline for the future. I frankly never have felt like the Company has been in better shape in terms of our stable base of business and our way forward. So we'll continue to focus on that. Patrick O'Brien: Great and thank you Janney and thank you all for joining us today, we appreciate your continued interest in Gilead, the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on future progress. Many thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentleman that does conclude the conference for today. Again, thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a good day.",

My name is Ashley and I will be the conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and as a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Patrick O\u2019Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patrick O\u2019Brien: Thank you, Ashley and good afternoon everyone. Just after market closed today we issued a press release with the details of our earnings results for the first quarter of 2015. The press release along with the detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead Sciences\u2019 website. The two speakers on today\u2019s call will be Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And based on a great deal of interest in Gilead\u2019s R&D pipeline, Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer will provide an update on our R&D progress. Also in the room with us for Q&A session are John Martin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Milligan, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Paul Carter, our Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations. Before we begin our formal remarks, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to our product candidates and financial projections, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and the recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. We will also be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release as well as on our website. I will now turn the call over to Robin Washington. Robin Washington : Thank you Patrick and thank you all for joining us today. The year is off to a great start and I am pleased to summarize the results of the first quarter of 2015. Gilead performed well across all therapeutic categories, achieving an all time high in net product revenues. We continue to invest in research and development, commercial operations, and initiatives to increase access to treatment, and importantly our medicines are now reaching approximately 10 million people around the world. The company also continues to execute on our capital allocation strategy. Earlier today, we reported non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter of 2015 of $2.94 per share and total revenue of $7.6 billion, an increase of 99% and 52% respectively compared to the first quarter of 2014. HCV product sales were $4.6 billion for the first quarter, a doubling year-over-year and an increase of 19% sequentially, driven by continued launches across many geographies. This quarter alone, we estimate that approximately 90,000 patients started on a sofosbuvir based therapy in the U.S. and Europe. Product sales excluding HCV were $2.9 billion, an increase of 10% compared to the first quarter of 2014, driven by continued uptick of our HIV single tablet regimen. Underlying prescription demand grew for our new single tablet regimens Stribild and Complera compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Overall, HIV product sales were down 16% sequentially, primarily due to an inventory decrease in the U.S. following an inventory build that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014 and a higher proportion of sales into Medicaid and ADAP programs which are more heavily discounted. Turning to the U.S. in more detail, Q1 2015 net product revenues were $5.2 billion. HIV net product revenues increased 15% year-over-year to $1.4 billion. Growth was driven by our single tablet regimen with Stribild increasing by more than 50% and Complera by 24%. The recently updated HIV treatment guidelines from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, reinforced the benefit of improved single tablet regimens like Stribild. Atripla was appropriately downgraded in the guidelines as we anticipated. As such underlying prescription demand for Atripla declined 8% year-over-year and we expect it will continue to decline as it is replaced by better single-tablet regimen. U.S. HIV revenues declined sequentially by 24% due primarily to decreased inventory across the supply chain. Wholesaler inventory levels declined to the near bottom of established ranges and we also saw a drawdown by sub-wholesalers. Both of these trends are similar to what we\u2019ve seen in the first quarter over the past several years. In addition, HIV sequential revenues were impacted by a one-time favorable accounting accrual in Q4 and a shift payor mix in Q1 as I previously mentioned. U.S. HCV revenue increased 8% sequentially to $3.4 billion, as an increase in patient volume was partially offset by a higher level of rebate for commercial plans that were executed throughout the first quarter of 2015. Many of these agreements became effective during the quarter, so we expect to see the full gross to net impact in the second quarter of 2015. In the U.S., approximately 70,000 patients initiated treatment with the Gilead HCV product in the first quarter, an increase of more than 50% over the prior quarter. Since the December 2013 approval of Sovaldi, more than 210,000 U.S. patients have started on a sofosbuvir-based therapy. We estimate that at least 90% of genotype 1 HCV patients beginning treatment in the quarter started therapy on Harvoni and that greater than 80% of genotype 1 patients have direct access to the product through either preferred or parity formulary status. Turning to Europe, Q1 2015 was a record quarter with $1.8 billion in product revenues inclusive of currency headwinds. HIV revenue growth was driven by our single tablet regimen. Eviplera together with Stribild grew by 55% year-over-year and for the first time combined quarterly sales exceeded sales of Atripla in a quarter. More than half of new patients initiating therapy started with the Gilead single tablet regimen with Eviplera and Stribild being the first and second most described regimens in Europe. These two regimens were also the most prescribed for patients switching therapy. HCV revenues in the EU approximated $1 billion in Q1, which reflects the first quarter where Sovaldi was prescribed in each of the big five countries. In some countries, most notably the UK, restrictions have resulted in limiting treatment to sicker patients. Uptake for Sovaldi was particularly strong in Spain, driven by a rapid achievement of regional reimbursement. Harvoni access is progressing at a faster rate than we saw with Sovaldi. Harvoni reimbursement is already in place in smaller countries of the EU and we expect reimbursement in Italy and Spain to be in place in the second quarter. In Europe, we estimate 21,000 patients started therapy with the Gilead regimen in the first quarter and that the total number of patients treated since the approval of Sovaldi in January 2014 has now surpassed 50,000. Turning to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses for the quarter were $651 million, up 17% compared to the prior year due to the continued progression and expansion of our clinical studies, particularly Phase 3 studies in the liver disease and oncology areas. Additionally, personnel and infrastructure expenses increased to support ongoing clinical study activities, geographic expansion and marketed product support. Sequentially, non-GAAP R&D expenses decreased by $248 million, driven by one-time M&A related costs that occurred in Q4 2014. We expect that our R&D expenses will continue to ramp up during the remainder of 2015, as our level of clinical activity increases. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the quarter was $600 million, up 20% compared to the prior year, driven by the growth in our business and geographic expansions during the past year as we continue to launch Sovaldi and Harvoni. Sequentially non-GAAP SG&A expenses decreased by approximately $200 million, driven primarily by favorable cumulative adjustment for the U.S. branded prescription drug fee, based on the receipt of the preliminary invoice from the IRS. Turning to cash flows, during the first quarter of 2015, we generated $5.7 billion in cash from operations. It is important to note that this figure includes unpaid rebates associated with the launch of Harvoni and future cash flows will be impacted as these payments are made. We utilized $3 billion in cash during the quarter to repurchase 29.6 million shares at an average price of $101.38 per share which completed our May 2014 $5 billion share repurchase program. As of April 1st, we initiated purchases under the recently authorized $15 billion share repurchase program. Earlier today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.43 per share of common stock with the payment date of June 29, 2015 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on the record date of June16, 2015. This is the first quarterly dividend declared under our dividend program announced in February 2015. Initiating the dividend reflects our continued confidence in our business and financial position. This dividend complements our share repurchase program and gives us an additional vehicle to return cash to our shareholders in a consistent and predictable manner. Finally, I would like to update our full year 2015 financial guidance, provided to you on February 3rd and summarized on slide 31 in the earnings presentation available on our corporate website. We now expect 2015 product sales to be in the range of $28 billion to $29 billion, an increase of 14% to 18% over 2014. Our guidance for product revenue is subject to a number of uncertainties including the full year impact of our discounts, charge backs and rebates associated with pricing negotiation with payors in the United States and Europe. Market share and full year effects of competition, potentially incorrect assumption regarding HCV patient flow, a larger than anticipated shift in payor mix to more highly discounted payor segments such as PHF, FFS, Medicaid and the VA, the timing and success of our commercial launches up Sovaldi and Harvoni in Japan, the effects of new HIV treatment guidelines downgrading Atripla to an alternative therapy and the potential for continued volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, all other components of our 2014 guidance remain unchanged. I would now turn the call over to Norbert. Norbert Bischofberger : Thank you Robin. Over the past 25 years at Gilead, I\u2019ve often been asked about the source of our next phase of growth and I\u2019ve never been more confident because of the numerous program we have to address unmet medical need. I will spend the next few minutes detailing some of our programs underway across the therapeutic areas of HIV, liver disease, cardiovascular, oncology and respiratory inflammation. In HIV, we\u2019re advancing various tenofovir alafenamide or TAF containing regimens. TAF is a nucleotide HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor and some of the key clinical data were presented in February at the CROI conference in Seattle. In two large Phase III studies, the single tablet regimen of E/C/F/TAF were shown to be non-inferior to Stribild with improved safe renal and bone laboratory parameters. And the data from these two studies were published in the April 16 issue of The Lancet, given cadence to these results. Another study demonstrated that E/C/F/TAF could be safely administered to patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. And this study in which nearly 1,500 patients on various regimens were switched to E/C/F/TAF is currently ongoing and we will share the final body of each data from the study at an upcoming conference. The marketing authorization applications for E/C/F/TAF have been submitted in a number of countries. U.S FDA has a assigned a PDUFA date of November 5, 2015. This application was followed just this month by F/TAF, the fixed dose combination of TAF and then emtricitabine, representing an improvement over Truvada. And the third application R/F/TAF a new single tablet regimen combining rilpivirine with the F/TAF backbone is on track to be filed in the third quarter of this year. For the R/F/TAF application, we will be using the Priority Review Voucher which was acquired from Knight Therapeutics in November last year. If all applications progress successfully to approval, we would be able to launch three new TAF containing HIV regimens between November 2015 and the middle of 2016. Based on promising Phase I PK and viral dynamics data, dosing has begun the Phase 2 study of GS-9883 a novel once daily integrase inhibitor which does not require boosting in combination with the F/TAF backbone. If successful this could yield a third TAF containing single tablet regimen to offer to patients. Also at CROI, we presented data on the ability of a TLR7 agonist to induced viremia in SIV infected monkeys completely suppressed on antiretroviral therapy. Based on these encouraging results, we have initiated a clinical study of GS-9620 of potent TLR7 agonist to potentially eliminate the [indiscernible] and achieve a functional cure of HIV. Now turning to liver disease. The pan-genotypic regimen of sofosbuvir in GS-5816 is currently being evaluated in four separate Phase 3 studies, all with a 12-week treatment duration. Based on the data to date and the success of Harvoni, we believe the best medical use of sofosbuvir in GS-5816 would be a non-genotype 1 infected patients where unmet need is the greatest. We should be in a position to share the top-line results from these four Phase 3 studies with you in the third quarter and hope to find marketing authorization applications towards the year-end. Last week at the annual EASL conference in Vienna, a number of presentations confirmed the high efficacy and good safety and tolerability of Sovaldi and Harvoni in different patient populations in non-genotype 1 HCV infection and in real world use. Data were also presented on the use of the pan-genotypic triple combination of sofosbuvir GS-5816 and GS-9857. GS-5816 is a pan-genotypic NS5A inhibitor and GS-9857 is a pan-genotypic protease inhibitor. The data indicate that the short-term treatment duration of less than 12 weeks but more than four weeks could be feasible for all patient populations. Based on these results, we have initiated two Phase 2 studies with this triple combination regimen to compare treatment durations of eight, 12, eight and six weeks. On March 25th, Sovaldi in combination with ribavirin was approved by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for the suppression of viremia in patients with genotype, hepatitis C infection. This is the first all-oral interferon-free treatment for genotype 2 infection in Japan. This was an expedited review and approval, based on the unmet need and lack of alternatives for the modern 200,000 Japanese patients infected with genotype 2. Also in Japan, Harvoni is under regulatory review and we expect approval by the middle of this year for the treatment of patients with genotype 1B infection. For most patients, treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection is lifelong and we continue to pursue research in that identifying finite treatment durations that may lead to a functional cure for hepatitis Bs antigen conversion. Two approaches, GS-9620, the TLR7 agonist and GS-4774 a therapeutic yeast-based vaccine are currently in Phase 2 studies in virally suppressed chronic hepatitis B infected patients. Data from these studies are expected in the second half of this year. In addition, TAF as a single agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B is in Phase 3. TAF would represent an alternative to Viread for the treatment of hepatitis B. And data from the Phase 3 studies are expected early 2016. In non-viral liver diseases, simtuzumab is undergoing evaluation in two studies for liver fibrosis due to NASH and in a study for primary sclerosing cholangitis. These studies are fully enrolled and the 96-week endpoint data should be available in the fourth quarter of next year. NASH is a disease with a complex biology and one that might require more than one approach for effective treatment or different options at different stages of disease. So, in addition to simtuzumab, two other mechanisms are being explored. The first, GS-4997 and ASK-1 inhibitor will be evaluated in the Phase 2 study, both by itself and in combination with simtuzumab and the second mechanism is GS-9674 an FXR agonist which we obtained through the acquisition of Phenex and hope to have in the clinic before year end. In our inflammation respiratory area, simtuzumab is in Phase 2 evaluation for IPF. This randomized placebo controlled study has now completed new patient screening and completion of enrolment is anticipated in the second quarter. This is an event driven study and results are expected in 2016. As reported on our last quarterly call, the MMP9 antibody GS-5745 has shown promising efficacy and safety in a Phase 1b study in ulcerative colitis. Based on these findings, we will advance this program into Phase 2, 3 in the second half of this year. GS-5745 is also in early clinical testing for its potential utility in COPD, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn\u2019s disease. Many advances are also happening in our cardiovascular area. The NDA for the use of the combination of Ambrisentan and Tadalafil for frontline treatment of PAH was submitted to FDA in December and the PDUFA date of October 5 was assigned. Ranolazine in currently being evaluated in more than 2,600 patients as an adjunct to percutaneous coronary intervention to reduce hospitalizations driven by ischemia or the meaningful revascularization. This study has met the required number of events and we hope to be able to unblind the study in the coming weeks. If the results are positive, a supplemental NDA submission is planned towards the middle of the year. The late cardiac, sodium channel inhibitor, GS-6615 is in clinical development for four indications, Long QT-3 Syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation and is ischemic heart disease. This is a low dose once daily compound than may provide options for these patients who are not exist today. [Ph] In addition we\u2019re exploring the use of GS-6615 for Long QT-2 Syndrome and for drug induced QT prolongation. And now moving to oncology. Oncology is an important area of unmet medical need for which scientific advances allow us to explore combination products and novel targets. We now have a strong oncology program with 30 ongoing implant clinical studies of which 10 are Phase 3 studies. Idelalisib is being evaluated in number of Phase 2 and Phase 3 study programs in CLL and NHL, both in the frontline setting and in previously treated patients. We continue to be excited about the profile of idelalisib including results in relapse CLL in combination of ofatumumab which will be presented next month at the ASCO Meeting in Chicago. Like many experts in the field, we see the future of hematology oncology in the use of chemotherapy free drug combinations to drive deeper and more durable responses and to achieve a cure. We now have four classes of kinase inhibitors, PI3K; Syk, JAK and BTK, a program which was recently in-licensed from ONO Pharmaceuticals. With these agents that target multiple signaling pathways, we\u2019re in a favorable competitive precision and our programs lend themselves nicely to pursuing combination therapies. In addition, we\u2019re also pursuing collaborative arrangements with other companies. An agreement was recently signed with AstraZeneca to explore the combination of idelalisib with AstraZeneca\u2019s checkpoint inhibitor in diffuse large B cell lymphoma in triple negative breast cancer and we hope to initiate clinical studies in the second half of this year. There are two additional promising new opportunities for our portfolio of kinase inhibitors, the first is the use of this in solid tumors and the second is in the emerging field of immune-oncology where there is evidence that kinase inhibitors have immunostimulatory effects through inhibition of regulatory T-cells and/or myeloid derive suppressor cells. Based on this concept and following preclinical and clinical data, we will initiate a Phase 3 study in the second half of this year of momelotinib in frontline metastatic pancreatic cancer where patients will be randomized through momelotinib or placebo on the background of gemcitabine and Abraxane. The Phase 1 study in second line pancreatic cancer is currently ongoing. Additionally, momelotinib is undergoing evaluation in EGFR-mutated first line non-small cell lung cancer and in combination with a MEK inhibitor in KRAS-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. We will be initiating additional Phase 1a studies on momelotinib and idelalisib in solid tumors in the future. We will keep you appraised as we make additional progress with our portfolio of kinase inhibitors. As indicated on our last earnings call, the anti-MMP9 antibody GS-5745 has shown promising efficacy and safety in a cohort of gastric cancer patients. Based on these results, we are proceeding directly into a Phase 3 study in which 430 patients with gastric cancers will be randomized to the current standing of care or standard of care plus GS-5745. We hope to initiate this study in this third quarter. And GS-5745 is also undergoing the evaluation in the Phase 1b study in pancreatic cancer. In closing, Gilead has a broad discovery and development pipeline. Moreover strong financials and cash flow allow us to take advantage of external opportunities as they arise. As we have stated before, we strategically evaluate opportunities carefully for the scientific merit and commercial potential. Thus the depth and breadth of our current programs together with the myriad external possibilities give us great confidence in our future. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize our 7,500 employees for their continued hard work and dedication and their willingness to successfully collaborate with external organizations. With that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is open. Geoff Meacham : When you guys think about durability of the Hep C market, what have you learned so far about the capacity to treat in the U.S. and EU and the cure patients that are waiting therapy also U.S. and Europe? Paul Carter : This is something clearly on our mind as well as we asses and think about our guidance going forward during this year. So the U.S had 70,000 starts in quarter one and a large number of those, the vast majority of those were Harvoni starts in GT1. We think that there are various dynamics here that probably were some patients being warehoused at the end of quarter four waiting for Harvoni. We then had the impact of all the contract negotiations early in the year and we had a widening of the pipeline in a sense of intensive fibrosis restrictions by many of the payors that we have made contracts with. Going forward, we see the prescriptions, the same data as you see and we do see a kind of flattening off at the moment. But we also think that in general we\u2019re very early days into this launch. So, the run rate would imply that with somewhere north of the 250,000 patients that we indicated last time with all this possible in the U.S this year. I was at EASL last week myself and spoke to a number of physicians who I asked this question, did I think they were seeing physician capacity being reached. And the answer was not physician capacity per se but really back office capacity to deal with the bureaucracy and paper work. And whether that thins out a little bit in the rest of the year is to be seen. But I think the run rate we\u2019re seeing with some of these dynamics of fibrosis restrictions opening up with prior authorization, sort of patient flow stemming to ease up a little bit. But at the same time with the physician office capacity sort of challenges, it\u2019s kind of somewhere between 250 and the high 200, I think the patients will probably see being treated in the U.S. this year. Going to Europe, we\u2019re also very happy to see a large number of patients being treated in Europe for the first time, around 20,000 in the first quarter. The majority of which were in the big five countries. And what we\u2019re seeing in Europe is Sovaldi now approves in the big five countries and Harvoni available in Germany and in France under the French ATU system. And we signed agreements where we should see Harvoni in both Spain and Italy quite soon. This is great news. The capacity constrains in Europe is really the budget that have been set by the governments and we work for the government in terms of the prevalence, the number of patients that they hope to treat and we encourage them to really maximize the amount of budget they could put towards hepatitis C. Nevertheless, they are single payors with budget. And we think that we should get to the sort of top of those budget this year. So, we previously said we thought in Europe roundabout 100,000 patients was probable for 2015 and I think that\u2019s kind of our thinking at the moment. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI Group. Your line is open. Mark Schoenebaum : Great Hep C number, congratulations. I was just wondering that the IMS data that we all watched for the hepatitis C market, seem to indicate a flattening and then a decline in the new prescriptions which has now translated in due an apparent flattening to decline in the total prescriptions. So, I guess I\u2019m wondering should we view -- interpretation that data be that the U.S. hepatitis C market has peaked or is there something relative to IMS data or alternatively is there a reason that we should think of a reacceleration coming up in sometime this year? Paul Carter : That\u2019s a hard question to answer. I think again I would just emphasize it is early days still in the U.S. as some of the contracts that payors we contracted with in the first quarter that starts to sort of unfold. Some of them have very open fibrosis restrictions, some of them are still fairly restricted to sicker patients. We have this dynamic of warehousing; we also have things like being direct to consumer campaign that you may have just noted starting. And I think all of these things of dynamics that are moving. Again the data points that we\u2019ve seen I agree with you would imply a slight flattening of the U.S. market. But I would say there is still a possibility of further growth in the rest of the year. But again, I\u2019d just emphasize it\u2019s very early days to make a prediction on that. Operator : Our next question comes from Geoff Porges of Bernstein. Your line is open. Geoffrey Porges : Thank you very much and add my congratulations on remarkable quarter and progress. May be just change gear a little bit, Robin could you update us on where your cash is and where your cash flow is? And then really phenomenal cash flow, are you sort of thinking about how else you might use that other than the dividend and the share repurchase; I mean obviously just kind of have massive amount of cash flow? Related to that, can you raise debt in Europe against that cash flow, is that something you\u2019ve done or just to be punctual? Robin Washington : Sure Geoff, so just to get the stats out of the way, if you look at our cash, and the full year we expect our cash balance, 40% or so that we expect to be onshore. And relative to cash flow, it\u2019s slightly less. About a third of our cash flow is generated in the U.S. We still think we have fairly significant capacity to borrow in the U.S. If we do discuss borrowing externally, it\u2019s not something we plan to do it immediately relative to our overall cash balance, very similar to what we\u2019ve been saying all along. And we\u2019re very focused on investing in our pipeline, we continue to look at strategic opportunities that may make sense for us with the focus on Phase 2 or earlier stage assets and the rest as you see that we\u2019ve been doing is we will redeploying and returning it to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber of Citi. Your line is open. Yaron Werber : It\u2019s a question I guess for whoever wants to pick it up, just a little bit of understanding. Where are you in the peer mix and sort of the rebid mix in the U.S. Hep C market. And can you give us a sense, what\u2019s going on with Medicaid? I mean it was about $1 billion book of business for you last year, a very much mix geographically around the country, how is the ramp going there? Paul Carter : So we have negotiated and signed contracts I think now with about 90% of the covered lives in the U.S. Of that 90%, 83% have direct access to Harvoni, either through an exclusive arrangement or through a parity arrangement. I would take this opportunity to say once more that Gilead really believes prescribing should be in the hands of doctors and their patients, not through these exclusive arrangements. The payor mix is around 70% what I would call commercial and 30% public. And within that commercial that includes Medicaid Part D at roughly half that amount. And the reason I made that split is because the rebates associated with those covered lives, would be in the same sort of ballpark with clearly higher discounts with the public payors. Medicaid, I am not going to comment on extensively except to say that we have ongoing negotiations. And I am sure you appreciate from a competitive point of view why I can\u2019t talk too much about that. Nevertheless, we are winning some exclusive arrangements and our competitors are winning some exclusive arrangements. And I think that\u2019s all I can say really at this point. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is open. Matthew Roden : At the EASL meeting last week, nice to see you out there. Dramatically, one of the things that was emerging is a lot more emphasis hepatitis B drug development. And you guys have your two programs where I think you\u2019re going to see data this year. So Norbert, can you just talk about these programs and what you are looking for as basis for go no go in Phase 3 decision? And I guess are you looking for a functional cure in these studies or are you looking for a basis to come define the right combinations to move that forward? Norbert Bischofberger : With the TLR7 agonist 9620, we\u2019re looking for S reduction. So it doesn\u2019t have to be complete S conversion but if we will see like you know too long [ph] or so. So I mean that clearly indicates S-antigen goes down, that would be in to go into Phase 3. And with the 4774 the therapeutic vaccine, yeast-based vaccine, we\u2019re looking more of immunological parameter. So we see a robust anti S-antibody or S-antigen or anything that would indicate a specific hepatitis B infected either antibody or T-cell immune response. The other thing I would like to point out Matt is hepatitis B cure as we call it here is one of our largest research programs right now. So, we have a fair amount of headcount particular biology. We\u2019re looking at you know compounds that could inhibit cccDNA, that could make cccDNA go away, we\u2019re looking at epigenetic approaches and few others that I don\u2019t want to talk about because it\u2019s too early and too confidential. But that is a big area of focus for us and we hope to see something towards the second half of this year. I would like to point out one last thing Matt, these two studies both the TLR-7 agonist and yeast vaccine are in virally suppressed patients. So whether or not we see anything with these virally suppressed patients, we will then go into treatment na\u00efve non-virally suppressed and actually have initiated already the study with the TLR-7 agonist that\u2019s the second follow-up study that looks at the same compound in viremic patients because there were reasons to believe why immunologically good work and viremic patients that it couldn\u2019t work in virally suppressed. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael Yee : Norbert, you made some comments on BD and whatnot. I just wanted to ask broadly what you can say to your appetite for deals whether small, medium or big, specifically John Milligan, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s in the room, had commented earlier that as a corporation are not really ready for a big transaction. I wonder if anything has changed and how you should be thinking about your capacity for deals, small, medium or large as we get through Hep C? John Milligan : We have talked about this in the past about having constraints on what we could do basically, the limitations on the kinds of activities we\u2019re going to undertake because of how difficult it was to get Sovaldi and then replace it with Harvoni in such short order. And as we exited last year, we really thought that we had achieved a greater balance across the company and that we had the capability to do more things and to look at more things than we had in the past and that has as each month and quarter goes on, we actually gained more ability to do those things as we move forward. Now Norbert highlighted all the very exciting opportunities that we have in our pipeline. So, we do feel that we have a very full pipeline. But I think with our position as a company with the cash flow that we have and with our appetite to continue to do more things for more patients around the world, there are some good opportunities, some good time -- it would be a good time for Gilead to consider wide range of things. But I can\u2019t tell you that we have an appetite for things large or small, it has to be kind of the right fit for Gilead. We typically like things where we can have impact on Phase 3 and where we can accelerate those products either into the approval process or integrator indications after the approval process. And I tend to think still we\u2019re looking for things where we feel we can catalyze the development of those products and have a greater utility over them overall. So, we are open to suggestion; there have been many mentioned out there. But I would say that I want to sick very closely to kinds of areas we\u2019re in here today. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya of Nomura Securities. Your line is open. Ian Somaiya : I was just looking at your slide 22 where you speak to the patient dynamics in the U.S., the ones that are considering sofosbuvir and wondering how that\u2019s going to change or if you could speak to how that could change by the time some of the companies reach the market, some of the further combination products to reach the market? And maybe taking a step further just thinking about your triple combo. Teams like the goal likely be limited to an eight-week regimen and how we should think about the competitive implications of that as other companies also pursue a triple combination? Paul Carter : Just on slide 22, which is the type of patients that are being treated in terms of genotype, fibrosis score and whether they are na\u00efve or not. I think there will be some dynamics through this year as the sicker patients get treated. And I think payors that are currently restricting fibrosis scores will start to open up a little bit. That\u2019s something I would imagine will stop to happen in 2016. Although there are plenty of patients that seems through all scores at the moment. We have some data on intent to prescribe during the first quarter, which shows that physician level in the U.S. where doctors intended to prescribe actually slightly more than half of their patients being fibrosis scores zero through S2. In reality, we know that the payors are putting some restrictions, not all payors but some of them. And so most likely the actual treatment is going to be towards the sicker patients and that will start to unfold. We also saw very, as you can see from the chart, 82% of patients na\u00efve to treatment. I guess that would stay the same, possibly even increase the experienced patients get addressed. You asked about how we would see that change with other competitors in the market. I would just emphasize, we are extremely pleased with the chemical profile of Harvoni and at EASL last week, we saw more data showing how Harvoni can deal with -- really sick patients extremely effectively and some other genotypes. And that clinical profile will only get stronger during the course of this year as we -- an incredible amount of real world data. And I think that data will be very advantageous for us as are the competitors with no real world data and to the market next year. So, I think the dynamics of type of patients will change a little bit over time, but there\u2019s plenty of patients out there and we\u2019re seeing plenty of patients coming from the diagnosis pull into treatment and plenty to keep this market going for a number of years. John Milligan : You asked the second part of the question about the triple and the duration of therapy. And I would say we have some conflicting reports coming out of EASL. But I can tell from our own interactions with physicians and thinking about the dynamic of the market, we do think it could get down to a shorter duration, I think certainly as Norbert said that 12, 8 and 6 week durations that we\u2019ll be looking at our triple combination. It\u2019s our goal to try to collapse the most number of patients down to the shortest duration possible. And it will be interesting to see how this triple works across the wide range of different kinds of diseases, both by genotype and by stage of diseases, still those severely ill patients have fewer options because many of these agents can\u2019t be used in severely ill patients. And they don\u2019t tend to cure as higher rate; we\u2019ve seen that certainly as you get into Child\u2019s B and Child\u2019s C scores. I think what will happen here is that it will go down to some easy duration to use. But the pushback we\u2019ve been getting from doctors and from regulators is that six versus eight doesn\u2019t really matter to them. In fact I\u2019m not sure eight versus twelve matters all that much. As long as it\u2019s simple; as long as it\u2019s safe and as long as there is surety that they will get high cure rates, that\u2019s what they\u2019re looking for. So it\u2019s the outcome that seems to matter more than the duration. And we can also tell you from the regulators\u2019 point of view, they don\u2019t view shorten duration as an important parameter at all. So that will create even a further bearer on all of us as we try to get to shorter durations, if we can\u2019t provide that simplicity across a wide range of patients and that will make it more difficult for those products to come to market. Operator : Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Phil Nadeau : On simtuzumab, Norbert, it sounded like in your prepared remarks you said we\u2019re going to get the 96-week data at the end of 2016. I think in prior calls suggested that the 48-week data to come out late this year. So, I guess two parts to the question. One, are we now not going to get the 48-week data from simtuzumab and then two, what\u2019s your most recent thinking on the ability of Gilead to file for approval of simtuzumab on its Phase 2 data? Norbert Bischofberger : So, there is a 48-week analysis but it\u2019s a utility analysis that is being done by DSMB. So, if the DSMB comes to the conclusion, there is absolutely no change that will ever rich the end point then they will recommendation to stop this study and then of course the decision is up to us. If they don\u2019t see that then they will simply tell us continue. And the real end point is 96 weeks and by the way this was negotiated and agreed upon with FDA. FDA felt for somewhere NASH that is a chronic potentially lifelong disease 48 weeks is not enough of a treatment duration; they would like to see 96 weeks. But if we can show a convincing reduction in the Sovaldi study, so there are two NASH studies one is in Sovaldi. And the end point there has been pressure going, if we see a clinically meaningful reduction at week 48 and week 96 in HVPG; that would get us potentially accelerated approval under the sub part. I can\u2019t remember what it\u2019s called for biologics; it\u2019s sub part agent for small molecules guidelines. Phil Nadeau : Would you care to elaborate on what\u2019s clinically meaningful? Norbert Bischofberger : So, FDA was -- to be answering that, completely informed about HVPG. So we have to have another meeting with them to talk with the thought leaders. But the thought leaders felt 20% reduction would be a huge clinically meaningful benefit. Operator : Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Robyn Karnauskas : So, I guess just as follow-up to the color you provide on Hep C discount. So, does your guidance of 46% still hold? And how do we think about this quarter stocking for the quarter? And then lastly, when you think about that hitting that 46%, how do we think about when you\u2019ll start 46%? Paul Carter : So, we made a very atypical last quarter by describing gross to net. And by the way gross to net is not as same as discount to rebate; there are other items in that. And we\u2019ve taken a view that for competitive reasons, I hope you appreciate why we don\u2019t want to discuss gross to net really ever again this year. Having said that during the first quarter, some of the contracts and Robin said this in her script that we signed -- started to be executed during the first quarter. So, I would say we\u2019re in steady state really from quarter two and the guidance that we just we\u2019ve given absolutely reflects our assumptions around gross to net in the U.S. hepatitis market. I hope that answers. I didn\u2019t very last part of the question. Stocking, yes. There was actually very minimal stock increase during the first quarter, I would say not material in the hepatitis market; a very slight increase of Harvoni stocking matched by a slight decrease in Sovaldi stocking. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Matthew Harrison : May be if I could just ask something, so both you and your competitor AbbVie have indicated that most of the contracts have started to come in but didn\u2019t fully come in and there is potentially an acceleration, at least AbbVie has of their run rate and the market share into April. I am wondering if you can just comment on dynamics in April. I know you said during the quarter you had about a 90% share, I am just wondering if that has shifted dramatically if some of these additional contracts that come in. And if I can sneak one in for Robin. Can you just say what the one-time impact was from the branded prescription to you on SG&A? John Milligan : So the April share data, I actually don\u2019t have anything on my fingertips Matthew, but I am not sensing any dramatic change whatsoever in the dynamics and the share and the prescriptions that we\u2019re getting. Robin? Robin Washington : So to your point, the majority of the SG&A quarter-on-quarter decline was driven by the one-time impact and then like sort of further decline because we got a preliminary invoice from the IRF. So we took down our accrual a bit with under 200 million associated with the new estimate that we\u2019ve got and I\u2019ll reemphasize that it is just an estimate. So we will see what happens longer terms when we get the final invoice in August. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov of JP Morgan. Your line is open. Cory Kasimov : Most of questions are already asked, but for Robin, can you comment more on the impact or magnitude of the unpaid rebates and from the cash flow standpoint that you alluded to in your prepared remarks? Robin Washington : So, as you know we had a significant increase in contracting that\u2019s occurred in Q1 primarily related to Harvoni. It usually takes the payors and governments up to about three months to six months, sometimes even nine months to ultimately come back and charge us for those rebates or charge backs. So, if you look at our cash flow it grew over $2 billion quarter-on-quarter. So, what we were seeing is that shift because that cash hasn\u2019t actually been paid out. So, our run rate really is not at the $5.7 billion going forward in further quarters. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes Howard Liang of Leerink. Your line is open Howard Liang : Regarding the patient treated, the fibrosis side of the patients treated, you gave us a stats in U.S., can you talk about similar information for Europe? And can you also give us a sense of the pricing point that you negotiated in Italy and Spain and the budget cuts? Paul Carter : Sure. So fibrosis scores in Europe interestingly do very somewhat between countries. So in fact in Germany there\u2019s fairly opened treatments restrictions, therefore there\u2019s a range of patients from sick to not sick being treated; that\u2019s different in France and in Italy and Spain in particular where the budget constraints are really ensuring that only sickest rate patients are being prioritized at this stage, so really in Spain and Italy for example and a majority of the French patients are S3 and S4. Howard Liang : Price point? Paul Carter : I wouldn\u2019t comment on the price points except that the listed price points are between EUR 41,000 and EUR 45,000 for Sovaldi and we would anticipate probably a premium of around 15% for Harvoni when those numbers get announced. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Terence Flynn : Just wondering on HIV franchise, now that you have a very broad strategy with respect to the TAF combos, can you help us think about just the longer term market share that you think you can retain post the entry of generic Viread and may be some other generic competitors down the road as you think about the longer term longevity of that franchise? Paul Carter : Well that\u2019s a really tough question, predicting into the future. I mean today as I think everyone knows, we have a very substantial market share in the HIV world. And even in this quarter, we see in the U.S. about eight out of 10 patients na\u00efve to treatment going for Gilead product but six out of 10 are getting a Gilead single tablet regimen with Truvada backbone. And we\u2019re seeing very good growth of our Truvada based single tablet regimens like Stribild which is going 75% year-on-year Complera 33% year-on-year. And you can see both in Europe and in U.S. that the top three or four regimens remain Gilead\u2019s single tablet regimens. So we\u2019re in a very, very kind of strong position today. And we\u2019re competing with the GSK products and we do see their impact. I mean for example we were getting seven out of 10 patients in the U.S. on a Gilead single tablet regimen; we\u2019re getting about six. But I do think that emphasizes the single tablet regimens are the way forward here. We have very strong data with E/C/F/TAF and we hope to have switch data launch. And as we mentioned earlier PDUFA date is 5th of November this year. We are getting our organization very much tuned up for that launch and we will be focusing of course on really trying to bring the conversation back to the importance of a great backbone. And we have great confidence that the F/TAF backbone is a great innovation over Truvada with very high efficacy and safety benefits which are really increasingly important for the ageing HIV population. So, I think that it\u2019s all about whether doctors feel that the F/TAF backbone warrants a priority. And we\u2019re going to make sure that our medical organization and our therapy -- our specialists out in the field convey that data very clearly. Operator : Mr. O\u2019Brien, we have time for one more question. Our last question comes from Ying Huang of Bank of America. Your line is open. Ying Huang : Firstly, I want to look at the Sovaldi weekly and NRx number which is about stabilizing at about 600. What are those patients, are those just genotype 2 or genotype 2 and 3, currently being treated with Sovaldi? And shall we use that as a study rate if we do GT1 versus GT3 at about 4 :1 ratio in the U.S. in the steady state in the future? And then the second question here is about the -- I guess payor mix. So you said that in the first quarter 70 :30, but in the next three quarters, what is your assumption for the payor mix that you see the market in U.S.? John Martin : So, two questions in that. The second question, I think we think that the payor mix will stay relatively steady and the reason as I said earlier the 70 :30 was because these are broad buckets of rebate kind of rates. So, we think that that will remain steady. John, do you want to answer the first question? John Milligan : Well first question was about where we think Sovaldi to be used and it is principally used in genotype 2 and genotype 3 patients. As we exited the quarter it was clear there were still some patients on simeprevir, probably patients finishing out their regimen from last year. We don\u2019t know how that will continue now, but I expect there is a smattering of use in certain patient types for that. And there is probably still little bit of use for patients who are in combination with interferon. And your question is about the run rate; I think there seems to be a steady flow of patients for genotype 2 and genotype 3 in the United States, but Harvoni is quickly making Sovaldi obsolete in many areas. And I suspect that more data rolls out, there will be more and more Harvoni use and less and less Sovaldi use. Paul Carter : There is a little bit more of a different genotype profile in Europe, some of the countries have more genotype 2 and 3, UK actually is an example of that. So, we would expect Sovaldi to continue to have some utility, especially in some countries like the UK for example. Patrick O\u2019Brien: Thank you, Ashley and thanks to all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and the team here looking for [indiscernible] we will update on future progress. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

My name is Candice and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and as a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Patrick O\u2019Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patrick O\u2019Brien: Thank you, Candice and good afternoon everyone. Just after market closed today we issued a press release with the details of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2015. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead Sciences\u2019 Web site. The speakers on today\u2019s call will be John Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Paul Carter, our Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations and Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room with us for Q&A session are; John Milligan, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer. Before we begin our formal remarks, let me remind you that we'll be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to our product candidates and financial projections, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and the recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. We will also be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release as well as on our Web site. I would now turn the call over to John Martin. John Martin : Thank you Patrick and thanks everyone for joining us today. Paul and Robin will elaborate on our commercial and financial results in just a moment. I would like to first comment on our HIV and HCV development programs. Our newest antiretroviral agent TAF which is under review as part of multiple products for the treatment of HIV has a superior safety profile compared to TDF. This is important because most newly diagnosed patients would now be treated for decades and at the same time many HIV infected individuals who are in treatment particularly in the U.S. and Europe are advancing NIH. It has also become clear that upon diagnosis HIV patients should immediately begin treatment; this point was driven home by the presentation of the NIH-sponsored start study results last week at the International AIDS Society Conference called IAS in Vancouver, and the concurrent publication of results in the New England Journal of Medicine. The start trial was a two arm randomized study in which patients with CD4 count counts of greater than 500 were randomized to immediate treatment versus deferred treatment until their CD4 count had declined to 350. The study was stopped after it was apparent that there was a clear net benefit in the immediate treatment. For patients facing decades of therapy it's a profile of task suggest that it will be view favorably as a new treatment option. We now have three TAF containing products under review. Two single tablet regimens and a TAF and emtricitabine co-formulated tablet. Important data from Gilead study 109 were presented last week at IAS. Study 109 is an open label clinical trial with more than 1,400 biologically suppressed patients. Who are randomized to switch from a TDF containing regimen to E/C/F/TAF or to remaining on their TDF containing therapies. The study made its primary endpoint and shows statistical superiority of E/C/F/TAF in terms of proportion of patients with HIV R&A less than 50 copies per meal at week 48. The study also demonstrated statistically significant improvement in bone and renal laboratory parameters. E/C/F/TAF is poised to be the first half based regimen on the market with an FDA PDUFA date of November 5, and regulatory decision expected in Europe before year-end. Our second TAF single tablet regimen or F/TAF was submitted for FDA review earlier this month. We're using our Priority Review Voucher which shortens review by four months and means that expected FDA action date in March of 2016. Submission of a regulatory file application for R/F/TAF EU is planned for the third quarter. In the developing world more than 30 million people are living with HIV and nearly 8 million now receive TDF based treatment regimens. The switch data presented at IAS and overall safety profile of TAF make it an important option for these patients and Gilead has already licensed the technology to our generic manufacturing partners with the goal of expediting access as soon as initial regulatory approvals are received. Turning briefly to HCV since the approval of Sovaldi in December 2013 approximately 470,000 patients globally have initiated treatment with Sovaldi or Harvoni. The rapid uptake and utilization of these medicines is a testament to the fact that the real world safety and efficacy parallels the results obtained in our controlled clinical studies. Three supplemental new drug applications for Harvoni were submitted to FDA last quarter, each of which has been granted priority review. If approved these applications will expand the indicated use for Harvoni to include HCV, HIV co-infected patients, patients with genotypes 4, 5, or 6 and treatment experiencing cirrhotic patients. A decision from FDA for each of these three sNDA is expected by November 15. In closing I would like to thank Gilead's dedicated employees for their tireless efforts and collaboration with our partners to develop new therapies and deliver them to people around the world. I will now turn the call over to Paul. Paul Carter : Thanks, John. I am pleased to provide an update on our commercial business which in the second quarter generated $8.1 billion in worldwide net product sales. U.S. revenue was $5.6 billion at 7% sequential increase and a 16% increase compared to the second quarter of last year. European revenue was $2 billion during the second quarter, up 8% sequentially and more than 50% on a year-over-year basis despite the foreign exchange headwinds. Beginning with hepatitis C, as John mentioned earlier, we're very pleased with the number of patients we're reaching with Sovaldi and Harvoni which have now approved in 51 and 40 countries respectively. Total HCV revenue for the second quarter was $4.9 billion. In the U.S. HCV product revenue totaled $3.4 billion with Harvoni representing 2.8 billion of that amount. In the first half of 2015, an estimated 130,000 U.S. hepatitis C patients started treatment on a Gilead product almost matching the number of treated patients to all of 2014. While this demonstrates that improvements in assets have been made there were still many new prescriptions been written then been filled. Following the nearly 70,000 patients in quarter one more than 60,000 additional patients started therapy on a Gilead hepatitis C product during the second quarter, this represents the Gilead market share over 90% of all HCV patients with Harvoni alone representing approximately 85% of all patients captured in the standard third-party tracking data. We have also maintained our very strong position with U.S. payers as reflected by our formulary status across all payer segments, 83% of genotype 1 patients have direct access to Harvoni, a percentage that has remained stable since the first quarter. In Europe hepatitis C revenue was more than $1.1 billion this quarter with over 30,000 estimated new patients start. We saw particularly high patients' initiations in Spain, Italy and Portugal in the second quarter. As one example of this Sovaldi uptake in Spain was driven by unprecedented regional access and a significant increase over historic hepatitis C treatment rate. Additionally Harvoni was launched in April and has surpassed the success of Sovaldi with more than 6,000 Spanish patients got in treatment in the second quarter. We have seen a continued broadening of access and reimbursement across multiple European markets. Harvoni is now reimbursed in four of the five big EU countries and in France we completed pricing negotiations for Harvoni in June opening access to all five all patients with the fibrosis score of F2 and to all HIV co-infected patients. This is a broader group of patients in those previously treated under the French ATU or early access program. Looking ahead we are confident in the opportunities to reach more patients in Europe including in the UK where Sovaldi reimbursement is expected to come on online more broadly later the summer and Harvoni will follow after that. In both the U.S. and Europe we're starting to see average treatment durations shortening. For example fewer patients have been treated for 24 weeks and in the United States approximately 40% of Harvoni used in quarter two was for eight weeks. This is an encouraging trend as it suggests the payers should be seeing the value of earlier treatment for appropriate genotype 1 patients. And we believe this makes us strong case for payers to further ease restriction on patients access. In the U.S. we saw an unusually large number of patients starts in the first quarter, reflecting warehousing of patients in anticipation of access to Harvoni. In the second quarter we saw the number of total descriptions declined from a peak in the month of March reflecting a smaller pool of patients who were in need of immediate treatment. We\u2019re thinking about hepatitis C patient numbers going forward, this market is still in its early days with many patients identified and waiting to be treated. As I mentioned earlier many prescriptions go unfilled due to denials in the prior authorization process. Going forward we believe more payers will lower restrictions allowing patients with lower fibrosis scores to access treatment. The increasing amount of real world data that should reinforce the confident that are highly differentiated product provide high cure rate that are in line with our clinical trial. Additionally we and others are increasingly active in generating awareness of hepatitis C and communicating the benefits of hepatitis C testing and early treatment. We believe our efforts of bringing a new patients to care and we'll do so in the future. So while the number of new patients starting on treatment will continue to be influenced by the retractions applied by the payers we see encouraging trends and remain highly confident both for the remainder of this year and for the long-term sustainability of the hepatitis C market in the United States. In Europe the dynamics of our hepatitis C business are defined by each country and their respective launch timings. Like in the U.S. at launch we've seen unusually high numbers of patients being treated as there has been some warehousing and especially so for Harvoni GT-1 patient. We also see a changing mix at the high volume Southern European countries like Spain, Italy and Portugal start to treat patients. Our pricing arrangements took into consideration macroeconomic circumstances hepatitis C prevalence and countries intend to increase treatment rates from past level. As a result we\u2019re likely to see a changing mix in patient volumes as well as average selling prices over time. We've recognized that there remains a huge unmet medical in Europe and there is just a small fraction of diagnosed patients have so far been treated. As in the U.S. our European teams are working hard to encourage diagnosis and increasing levels of treatments in the years ahead. Turning to Japan. We\u2019re pleased with the initial introduction of Sovaldi for genotype 2 patients, I'm excited about the prospects that Harvoni in genotype 1. With the approval in July we expect reimbursement for Harvoni to be in place in Japan later this summer. There is consensus within the medical community that Gilead Medications offer patients the simple and effective cure for hepatitis C. This is evidenced in treatment guidelines around the world and from the real world data that have been continue to be generated and presented and published in peer review forums. We\u2019ll continue to work to bring these treatments to more patients as quickly as possible. And now turning to HIV. This quarter HIV revenues increased 8% year-over-year to $2.7 billion as our sofosbuvir based regimens continue to hold their market leadership position. In the United States revenues were $1.8 billion for the second quarter, showing sequential growth of 21% mostly driven by the price increase on April 01 and favorable sub-wholesaler inventory levels following the draw down in the first quarter as well as increased demand. In the second quarter we saw the big three wholesaler inventory levels remain at the bottom of established ranges. Underlying prescription demand remained strong, for Stribild and Complera driving the year-on-year revenue growth of 58% and 35% respectively. Gilead's HIV medications continue to be prescribed for approximately 8 out of 10 treatment naive patients initiating therapy. Six of 10 patients initiated treatment with the Gilead single-tablet regimen and our newest single-tablet regiment Stribild and Complera collectively captured five out of ten new patients. In Europe HIV revenue was $742 million for the second quarter. Despite strong competition volume has grown in line with overall market growth. Overall sequential revenue growth declined due to the impact of negative foreign currency movement net of our hedging activity. Eviplera and Stribild remained the most prescribed regimens to na\u00efve patients in the EU big five and half of new patients started on Truvada based single-tablet regimen. Eviplera and Stribild also remained the most prescribed regimens for switch patients. Looking to the future of HIV John already gave the detailed accounts of where we stand on the regulatory front and bringing our TAF based treatments to market. And I can say that the Gilead commercial organization is focusing on insuring a successful launch around the world. We\u2019re excited to introduce the TAF portfolio products to our customers and to all the patients who can benefit from them. In closing we\u2019re very pleased with the commercial results for the second quarter. And now I'll turn the call over to Robin. Robin Washington : Thanks Paul and good afternoon everyone. We\u2019re pleased to report solid second quarter results with non-GAAP diluted EPS of $3.15 for the second quarter, up 33% year-over-year. Total revenues were 8.2 billion up 26% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. Despite currency headwinds net product sales for the quarter were 8.1 billion up 27% year-over-year, driven by the launch of Harvoni across various geographies continued growth of Sovalid outside the U.S. and increased sales of our newer HIV single-tablet regimen. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 90% for the second quarter of 2015 compared to 89% for the second quarter of 2014, benefitting from changes in product mix, including a year-over-year decline in Atripla sales which had a lower margin. Turning to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $702 million for the second quarter, up 30% compared to the prior year due to the continued progression and expansion of our clinical studies, particularly Phase 3 studies in the liver disease and oncology areas. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $761 million for the second quarter, up 34% compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in our portion of the branded prescription geography and higher costs associated with the growth of our business including commercial expansion to support our HCV products. Turning to our balance sheet we ended the second quarter with 14.7 billion in cash and investment and generated cash flow from operations of 5.7 billion. On June 29 shareholders received their first quarterly cash dividend of 633 million or $0.43 per share. Our Q3 2015 quarterly cash dividend of $0.43 per share was announced this afternoon. During the quarter we repurchased approximately 9 million shares at an average price of $102.14 pursuant to our 15 billion share repurchase plan approved in January 2015. As of June 30th we have 14.1 billion remaining under the current plan and remain active in repurchasing shares. Additionally we utilize 3.9 billion in cash for the early retirement of 46 million warrants which will result in a third quarter decline in diluted shares outstanding of approximately 25 million shares. Approximately 9 million warrants remain outstanding at the end of June. Finally we are updating full year 2015 guidance which is outlined on Slide 46. The changes are as follows we expect product sales to be in the range of 29 billion to 30 billion an increase of 18% to 23% over 2014. Our guidance for product revenues is subject to a number of uncertainties including inaccuracy in our estimates of HCV patients starts a larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segment such as PHF, FFS, Medicaid and the VA. The commercial launches of Sovaldi and Harvoni in Japan the potential adoption in Europe of additional pricing measures to reduce HCV spending and the potential for continued volatility foreign currency exchange rates. Product gross margin guidance is now in the 88% to 90%. We are lowering R&D expense guidance to be in the range of 2.8 billion to 3 billion driven by cost efficiencies in our clinical development activity and faster than expected enrollment of HIV and HCV studies. We are lowering our SG&A expense guidance to be in the range of 3 billion to 3.2 billion primarily driven by the favorable one-time adjustment to be expected in place from the IRS for the branded prescription drug fees. Our tax rate is now anticipated to be 17% to 18% all other components of our 2015 guidance remain unchanged. In summary Gilead had another very solid quarter and we see strong prospects for the remainder of the year with higher than originally forecasted revenues and lower than originally forecasted expenses. Thank you and we look forward to updating you on our progress during our next call. We would now like to open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from the line of Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open. Geoff Meacham : Congrats on the quarter very impressive. Want to ask you an excess question about hep C from par. If I look on Slide 25 and you\u2019ve broken out new patients by fibrosis states I have a couple questions one what trends have you seen for F0 and F1 patients. And what could be the tipping point for new starts for F0 and F1 and then how important is that when you guys view in the durability for U.S sales. John Martin : The data that we have on intense to prescribe. We've seen that in this quarter the data we have the intend to prescribe was about 55% of prescription where F0 through F2. Now we actually don\u2019t believe that nearly that many prescriptions were actually filled. By the definition of intend to prescribe is prescription that have actually been written not necessarily filled. So there is still a lot of restriction in place in the United States and I think this is the variable which really will influence the number of patients that we see being treated or the rates of number of patients been treated in the rest of the year and through the next few years. So clearly what we're hoping is those restrictions start to unwind somewhat, we're encouraged by a couple of things so we're encouraged that the number of people been treated for eight weeks and genotype 1 patients has started to increase that\u2019s now at about 40% of Harvoni prescription. So that kind of implies that less sick patients have been treated and we also hope that as I said in my script starts to provide some encouragement to payers in terms of value as they think about curing patients. But we'll have to sort of wait and see over time how these restrictions unfold. I do think that as the market starts to become a bit more predictable now in terms of the numbers of patients coming through that the hopefully payers will also feel more encouraged to sort of open the gate slightly. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Mark Schoenebaum : If I may John Milligan perhaps three pharma CEOs companies with market caps some cases smaller than your have said something in fact that mid cap biotech is priced to perfection, one even said it's an bubble, the biggest question on everyone's mind for Gilead is who you're going to buy, who you're going to buy, who you're going to buy, who you're going to buy, who you're going to buy, everyday it's what we talked on investor circles, so I was wondering, A, if you could apply on the general state of evaluations in midcap, midcap small and midcap biotech then? And B, just kind of give us an update about what you're thinking on acquisitions, are you ready to do them now, if so, would you be willing to do a series of smaller ones and would you be willing to do for example a very large transformative type of deal? John Milligan : Thank you for that one question. A couple of things so one number where you've talked about valuation of our industry, and we have seen the dramatic growth in the valuation of the lot of companies certainly the small and midcap company. I have to say that it has been a company by some really significant increases innovation and some very interesting and innovative products that have come along as I do think the innovation revolution that we're seeing has driven greater value creations that we've seen in the past and so it's a little hard to say that when a bubble when you've seen some dramatic innovations and I've got a lot of that value to innovate. So that's how I think about it. So the second thing I believe was about what are we going to buy? And so what I -- I think I am going to give you the answer that I usually give which is Gilead is in terrific shape, we've got a very strong work force, we've got a really strong balance sheet. We have great scientific expertise on board so that give us the capability to do a wide range of things as you suggested we could contemplate small deals, we could contemplate larger perhaps in transformative deals. And we're in position to strength we could be fairly selective in terms of the things that we like to do and take our time to make sure that those things that we do choose to do we can execute on them fairly effectively, bring new products to market and continue to grow our top line revenue and EPS and so we'll take all those. And obviously further than that I can't comment specifically on any kinds of targets that would be inappropriate. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Geoffrey Porges : Congratulations on the quarter probably the most remarkable sort of guidance we've seen in a long time, I have a question for Paul on HCV, you've traded roughly 300, when you and your competitors have actually traded a few as well, 300,000 patients in the U.S. over the last 18 months or so. And Paul my question is, is the patient pool that is still to be treated being replenished via a new diagnosis or new patient identification at the same rate does that 300,000 depletion or faster or slower in that 300,000? Paul Carter : The answer is yes, kind of correctly, so we have some quantitative evidence, we have some quantities evidence; we have plenty of anecdotal evidence. So we talk to doctors the whole time and positions such as in U.S. and all of them tell us that they have many patients in the queue if you like waiting for treatment and really the barriers of them be treated is the restrictions of the payers are putting on. We're also ourselves and competitors and but also a lot of stakeholders working hard to encourage awareness of hepatitis C, encourage testing, encourage people to think about how they link their status to treatment. And we do try and measure that to some extent as well, so we do measure the number of patients that are coming from diagnosis to undertreated care. And our definition is that we have better patients who visited doctor in the last 12 months with hepatitis C and we're seeing around at 30 stable rates actually around 30,000 a month moving undertreated care. So that is the answer why I give you guess. We're selling that number I think quite consistently. And as I said we\u2019re doing a lot, and it takes time to actually get traction on some of these things. We\u2019re doing a lot of things now with the view to the longer-term future as well to really try and think about how do we increase diagnosis rate. We've got about 1.6 million people in the U.S. diagnosed we've treated as you said maybe 300,000 in the last year or two, there is still a long way of diagnosed but we\u2019re not resting on those, we\u2019re thinking about how do we start to increase those diagnosed rates as well. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is now open. Matt Roden : I just wanted to ask about the product sales guidance nice deep raise in the quarter here, but if I plug in your half year sales of about 15.5 billion and look at your full year sales guidance of 29 to 30. That seems to demonstrate you are probably not thinking that hep C sales are going to roll off the cliff in the U.S. in the back half of the year. So could you talk a little bit more about your assumptions that went into your sales guidance raise here for this year in particular around the product mix and geographic mix? And then lastly I know you only provide guidance for this year's numbers but anything you can share about your thinking on the outlook in the 2016 in terms of the mix to the extent you can. John Martin : We don't think as many patients in the U.S. will be treated for hepatitis C is in the first half and the reason for that really is not that we feel that profoundly patient numbers are being treated less than that, but we did see a very big spike in quarter one as I mentioned in the script because there was such a warehouse of patients waiting and people really needed to be treated waiting for interferon free Harvoni to come along. And I do think that we should put in perspective Harvoni really did change everything for patients waiting for treatment. And to give some context to that, in quarter four last year Gilead treated about 45,000 patients. In quarter two we just had treated over 60,000 patients, and that -- and as two data points but that\u2019s a 40% increase in patients. So we don't feel that the overall trend is this market is going down and down, but we did have this very big spike in quarter one and we don't see that that\u2019s going to be repeated in the U.S. during the rest of the year.  And we\u2019re still subject to how the restrictions by payers play out in the rest of this year, so I think we've been fairly conservative in our view, we also have the VA situation which is well publicized where the VA is depleted funds at the moment, we've already seen VA purchase drop off towards the end of quarter two. Our assumption is that those purchase will start to come back again when their fund hope to get -- that bucket of funds gets filled hopefully from October, so we've taken that into consideration. And then outside of the U.S. we've got various dynamics going on. And as I said country-by-country in Europe we\u2019re launching Harvoni and we\u2019re seeing somewhat like the U.S. kind of early spike in volumes as these people who are very sick and really need immediate treatment do get treated. And then it started to stable off. We also see in Europe budget ceilings, the level of treatment in some of the countries is so high at the moment that we do recognize this budget ceilings maybe reached and we\u2019re taking fairly conservative view of that as well. Then we have Japan I touched on we\u2019re off to a good start but still a lot of uncertainty as the how our launch is go a very encouraged Sovaldi posted the only product interferon free GT2 patients, Harvoni has had incredible 100% FBR clinical data to support its filing for GT1 patients and we should hope to get pricing agreed in the next couple of months. So we\u2019re excited about Japan. But I think overall we\u2019re taking a fairly conservative view U.S. is still the big market for us and we\u2019re recognizing that the second half is probably going to be smaller than the first half, that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. Going into 2016, we hope all the efforts that we\u2019re putting into increasing diagnosis, increasing linkage to just to -- just to cast off too -- we're putting a linkage cure now, because our SVR rates really are so high in real life starts to play out and we\u2019re see that still a lot of patients in the U.S. in Europe around other countries in the world to be treated, we've only touched that top of the iceberg and I should mention countries like Canada, Australia, some of the Asian countries that will be coming on stream in the next year or so. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Michael Yee : Just a follow-up on a couple of these things I guess taking a step back. Should the takeaway be that U.S. patient treated continued to get a bit smaller here over the next few quarters but it's offset by OUS and to get people comfortable with the U.S. where do you think it's starts to stabilize or bottom out, how do you get comfortable with that and then start to pick back up. And to that is Medicaid a big part of that I know that you were talking about medication contract and there started to come on and haven\u2019t really heard much about that but that\u2019s part of the population. But with those contracts where is that in all editions where do you think U.S. can start to stabilize and stop declining. John Martin : We don\u2019t know for sure yet whether the U.S has actually stabilized but we have a sense that directionally it will stabilize and it will stop to grow as the payer restriction start to get loosen up. I mean we feel very clear about that we mentioned the VA of now VA should start to come back on three I think in the fourth quarter. And we will see a gradual shift that makes the payers in the U.S I think slightly towards the public payers, year-to-date we're about 70 to 30 public and Medicare to private Medicare to the public payers, and we would anticipate that might grow to 60, 40 let's say in the second half of the year. So I'm not sure I've answered your question really but\u2026. Michael Yee : Well I guess the Medicaid population. John Martin : Yes the Medicaid population will start to come out. Our competitors have exclusive access to some Medicaid we have to other, Harvoni is patient in Medicaid around about 34 states have signed deals with to make Harvoni available that\u2019s about two thirds of the patients covered by Medicaid. So we're getting reasonable access there and as I said I think that mix will start to shift very slightly towards Medicaid during the rest of the year. Operator : And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Matthew Harrison : So I guess I wanted to ask a little bit more about the access expansion that you\u2019ve talked about in the U.S. What's the biggest hold up in the access expansion obviously you put rebates in place it sounds like you put a lot of ways to help people and plan whether it's eight weeks or things like that to help them expand access. So what is stopping them and are there anything that you can do or I guess what your confidence that just taking a little bit extra time will allow them to expand access. John Martin : I think our confidence is high Matthew the restrictions will start to loosen up. The question really is how long will that take? And I think real world evidence is a great help there. So as I said a couple of times we are seeing a numerous studies now being publish and presented which demonstrate that real world data matches or even it better than our clinical data in some cases. So I think it give payers a level of confidence that an expensive investment is worth making and I think that will start to play out. I think also the patient stories and there family stories really do resonate very strongly and when people hear of friends and relatives who been cured in a very simple way and in some cases in a shorter date week. That is a very strong message and a great encouragement. We are hearing stories show you but some patients are actually taking legal actions against their insurers because there insurers are not paying for them, paying for their treatment despite the fact they are insured. So I think it's a whole lot of things gradually put pressure. And as I also mentioned earlier not least as we start getting to slightly more predictable environment without despite of patient that just immediately need treatment and warehousing and so on, once it gets to a more predicted situation this kind of works with the models of the private payers and hopefully again they will feel more confident in opening up restrictions. Operator : And our next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Phil Nadeau : Just a specific question on gross to net adjustment HCV franchise on the Q1 call you highlighted the fact that had enough we adjusted during the quarter. In your prepared remarks this quarter you suggest that the full effect of the payer contracts is being felt. But your last comment it does sound like you still going to give more adjustment in future quarters because of public pay becoming of your portion of reimbursement. So could you kind of discuss where we are in evolution of gross to net in this quarter's run rate good for the second half of the year or is there is more net adjustment to come? Robin Washington : This is Robin, I would say this year is far articulated script. We do feel that we got more towards what we'd expect with having a full quarter of the contract in place and that impact on the growth to net was thus probably the biggest adjustment got to near the point estimate that we talked about at the beginning of the year which we don\u2019t necessarily want to repeat. I would say also as Paul mentioned you can't expect the little further adjustment based on the payer mix going into the second half again going from 70 to 30 to 60 40. But for the most part in few added stage we don\u2019t anticipate significant changes quarter-on-quarter at this point relative to growth to that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov of JP Morgan. Your line is open. Cory Kasimov : Just following up on Phil's gross to net question. Would you expect to go through another round of payer negotiations upon the potential approval of Merck's regimen early next year? John Martin : Cory I'll try on that one We have agreements in place and I think if we look at all the lives in the U.S. about 96% of lives now so the covered have been agreed and Harvoni has access to 83% either as an exclusive or a parity access. I would take the opportunity to just emphasize yet again and the Gilead does not believe in exclusive access, we believe in physicians and their patients having the rights to prescribe whatever they want to prescribe and not been kind of dictated to by payers. So certainly we're not aiming to establish any more kind of exclusivity in a competitive way. So we have agreements in place with most of the payers most of those agreements are multiyear and we hope that we can compete on our products and we think that that's the way it's going, but we will depend on market share vigorously. We have competed before with the competitors want to compete on price and I think the results speak for themselves, so we will consider every scenario and be ready to for it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Robyn Karnauskas : Just to focus on something just for on the oncology area you have Celgene very aggressive in the blood cancer space with acquisitions and you've also mentioned I think many times probably about thinking about immuno-oncology, so just wondering, how aggressive you think you have to be in oncology to compete and do you think and I think you've said before blood cancer is crowded, do you think it's more like ready to in solid tumor reduction and how you're thinking about blood cancer versus solid tumor in new competitive landscape? John Milligan : Robyn, this is John Milligan. That's a good question, how aggressive you want to be in the certain areas, so it has been fascinating again the rate of innovation that we've seen in the blood cancers space and it has gotten extremely crowded leaving fewer opportunities I think for new products or follow-on products to make headway into this area, so it has got quite crowded. So we're broadening our criteria for the things that we would be interested in and are looking at a wide range of things. I think you've mentioned immuno-oncology specifically we've not called that out specifically as an area of interest also partially due to how crowded it is and certainly in the PD-1, PD-L1 space, but we wouldn't us keep from thinking about areas that were novel and could provide further benefit to patients in those areas. But I don\u2019t know on what scale we can talk about aggression, but I do think it's clear where it's going to be active will be opened to opportunities that can benefit our portfolio and the best we think possible. John Martin : Yes, Robyn, I would also like to point out that we are pursuing solid tumors we have our MMP9 antibody in gastric cancer pancreatic cancer and lung cancer. So you know there is of course evidence that these compounds do have effect on myeloid derived suppressor cells which is in a way of immuno-oncology as well. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Skorney of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Brian Skorney : I guess just looking at Sovaldi, it looks like it's pretty big quarter in the U.S. it didn't quite match with the prescription data relative to the last few quarters, so I was just wondering if you could give any color is there some source of Sovaldi revenue that isn't getting captured in there or was there any one-times last quarter or this quarter that we need to keep in mind? And also I am just curious if there is specific midcap company who you think role in the biotech innovation wave that you've mentioned is maybe underappreciated by the public markets? John Martin : I don't think it was anything particular about the Sovaldi, there was a tiny little bit of inventory growth. Sovaldi seems to be in a pretty stable at this point in terms of patient number, so I don't think there was anything special about Sovaldi. John Milligan : And in terms of your question undervalued small midcap stock, I am not into business of giving stock tips to folks but I think I'll continue to decline that. Operator : And our next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Terence Flynn : Maybe just two part for me, so first it just looks like if we take sale to buy about patient numbers in the U.S. looks like average price per patient was higher this quarter versus last I was just wondering if that's simply a mix question meaning more Sovaldi patients versus Harvoni? And then the second question was just as we think about 5816 Phase 3 date now, just how to think about positioning there relative to Sovaldi. Would you guys pull Sovaldi from the market or would you keep it on the market and then anything to think about on pricing? John Martin : Yes, Terrence, the first question on -- it's a mix is the answer to your question. And I hand it over to Norbert. Norbert Bischofberger : And Terry with regards to 5816 one clearly opportunities here treatment of genotype 3 patients there is still an unmet need. You have might have seen the clatters we're in combination with Sovaldi, that we've got approved a few weeks ago and the response rates while substantial there suboptimal and particularly in cirrhotic patients they have response rates or SVR12 rates about 60%. So that's clearly an unmet need but we're also looking at other genotypes. And with regards to Sovaldi, no, we would absolutely not pull Sovaldi from the market Sovaldi still has a lot of value in subpopulation and then use other agents like the Gilead is here so et cetera. Operator : And our next question comes from Ying Huang of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Ying Huang : First of all can you talk about Europe? Do you think the growth could be meeting a bottleneck as restricted by the governments' budget process in the second half and also next year. And then secondly your competitor AbbVie commented on the earnings call that they thinks the U.S. GT-1 patients being treated will be annualized at about 175,000 to 180,000, do you agree with AbbVie or do you think you're going to see actually higher number of patients being treated in the U.S.? John Martin : So let's just deal with the U.S. patient number question. I think that we feel that -- I think we feel that the AbbVie fee numbers are little bit low, we\u2019re fairly confident and this depends somewhat as I said on the payers in the second half of the year, whether they open restrictions further or not, and it also to some extent making some assumptions about that VA coming back on stream. But we see no reason why there shouldn't be 250 plus patients treated in the U.S. next year, that total patient not just GT-1 and its total patients not Gilead share. We've said in the past I think we still feel that the capacity in the U.S. to treat HCV patients is around 300,000 we've no reason to believe will be higher than that at this point. So I think in the years going forward we\u2019ll see 250,000 to 300,000 patients being treated in the U.S. and that will even flow somewhat but the main variable would be restriction by payers. And then the European question, well I said that the agreement that we had made with European government taken to consideration ability to pay and that defined by some of the macroeconomic metrics on countries by the prevalence of HCV in those countries, but probably most importantly by the political will of those countries to increase treatment rates above historical level. And so we work with them to agree a kind of volume based rebate structure that encourages high number of patients to treat and we\u2019re seeing those becoming sort of executing now. And as I said in Southern Europe Italy, Spain, Portugal we\u2019re seeing a substantial number of patients being treated. We\u2019re also very aware of the fact that these countries single payer systems do you have finite budgets and the countries have made great efforts to increase those budgets to treat more patients because they do see the value of treating hepatitis C patients. Whether we hit those budgets or not, I can't predict at this moment, but one thing is for sure that either at the rate of patients being treated they allow have to slow down somewhat in some of those countries order have to increase their funding over the next couple of years if they want to keep it treating at the rate they are doing. But anyway we\u2019re greatly encouraged that a lot of patients have being treated and we\u2019re greatly encouraged that the real world data really support that investment in treating patients and we hope that will encourage further increases in budget. Operator : And our next question comes from John Sonnier of William Blair. Your line is now open. John Sonnier : The question is for Paul, with the Japan coming on line can you talk a little bit more about the HCV market opportunity there. And I'm particularly interested in how the pricing mechanism works and whether or not there is any statutory discounting downstream or based on volume? Paul Carter : So Japan is exciting opportunity for us and as you may know it's the first product we've launched in Japan. So on the back of this we\u2019re actually establishing or have established our Japanese entity and we hope that, that entity will be a platform in the future for us to launch whole series of future products, not just in the hepatitis C space. So it's exciting, we've launched Sovaldi for GT-2 we've launched that late in May, 25th of May we've got pricing agreement and launched and it's got off to a good start although it's extremely early day. They are around 200,000 GT2 patients in Japan who are diagnosed and as I already mentioned have really no interferon free option other than Sovaldi so we\u2019re very happy to be able to help meet that unmet medical need. We\u2019re working to agree pricing on Harvoni, we should have that agreed fairly soon and we\u2019re confident that, that will be a happy outcome for everyone and we shouldn't have any delays in launch. There are no statutory discounts on pricing in the first years, there is a statutory system and it's typically 2% to 5% discount every two years or so that we've seen historically and we would envisage that that would happen. There is also a mechanism whereby you have to forecast your revenues going forward and there is a system of capping prices based on whether you go through that ceiling that you've sort of self agreed. So there are mechanisms but no discounts per-se on a day-to-day basis, and we wouldn't expect any discounts on Sovaldi or Harvoni at least for the first two years. Operator : And our next question comes from Jason Kolbert of Maxim Group. Your line is now open. Jason McCarthy : This is Jason McCarthy for Jason Kolbert. My question is in terms of building the market for Harvoni in the U.S. How do you see it, I know it's been discussed before? The cost cutting insurance carriers and discount is like with express script trying to control pricing and how that could have impact the growth of Harvoni going forward? John Martin : Well I think we have to stand back and look at our products and recognize if there is incredible amount of value and incredible amount of innovation. First of Sovaldi then Harvoni and then in what we're calling our wave 3 and wave 4 products. And I think it's that innovation that is our negotiation strength really and I think all payers would like fundamentally to make highly innovative medicines that work incredibly well available to their patient. And so we have to negotiate and come up with terms that work for both sides. But we're very optimistic and we work very hard to keep good contact with the payers across the U.S to make sure that fully aware off and what's coming next and making sure that we\u2019re all on the same page. And so I think we we're quietly confident that we can continue to have strong and good relationships and high levels of excess to all of our medicines and especially our next HCV innovations. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Alan Carr of Needham and Company. Your line is now open. Alan Carr : Could you comment more about the R&D and SG&A spend this year? Why this quarter is a bit lower than expected. I know you comment, if you could take a bit more about that and then your thoughts on long-term trends from that into '16 and '17. Robyn Karnauskas : Sure the overall year-over-year basis both of SG&A and R&D kind of increased and again the R&D was driven by discontinued acceleration of our pipeline. But as we always do and look we've had really good enrollment levels with those trials. So as we look at our out year or second half guidance you're able to turn it back again still making progress but doing it even faster than we have initially thought. On the SG&A side the one big adjustment that you saw Q1 versus Q2 related to the branded prescription drug fee. The rest is just related to the ongoing commercial advance since they were making Paul talked about the launch in Japan the other launches is ex U.S as well as just a direct to consumer investment that we're making. Even with all of those as we looked at our guidance again we've always been focused on conscious expense management and ended up being able to do a little bit at your given thoughts since reducing the guidance. The most of the SG&A reduction was related to the one-time adjustment in the brand and prescription drug fee. Alan Carr : And then with respect to a longer term trend here. Do you expect this to continue these levels in the '16 or '17? And any reason to believe will be any dramatic growth here or it might come down? Robyn Karnauskas : Yes it's a good question we haven\u2019t really given long-term guidance. I think overall relative to our launches we continue to expand geographically which will drive some of the cost and as Paul articulated we're focused a lot on brining additional patients to care and look at care I don\u2019t see that being major incremental step up in terms of SG&A. So there is no significant trend difference in what I'd say but I'm hard press to kind of give too forward look forward without providing additional guidance. Relative to R&D I think we've always taken approach that we'll advance things in the clinic as it makes sense right. We feel good with the level of spin we have today but we're very optimistic about our pipeline. So you could see absolute dollars go up where that falls relative to percentage of revenue that is something that will to be determine if we provide guidance in '16 and beyond. Operator : Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I like to turn the conference back over to Mr. O\u2019Brien for closing remarks. Patrick O\u2019Brien: Thank you Candice, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on future progress. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Have a great day everyone.",

My name is Candice, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Patrick O'Brien - Senior Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, Candice, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today we issued a press release with the details of our earnings results for the third quarter of 2015.

We will also be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release as well as on our website. I would now like to turn the call over to John Martin. John C. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Patrick, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Paul and Robin will address commercial and financial highlights in just a moment. I would like to first comment on some of the significant progress we have made on our drug development programs during the quarter. First, as you are aware, three NDAs and marketing authorization applications for TAF-based regimens for the treatment of HIV are currently under review by FDA and European Medicines Agency, which could lead to approval of three new products in the next six months. The PDUFA date for the first TAF-based regimen E/C/F/TAF, or GENVOYA, is next week on November 5. In September the European CHMP adopted a positive opinion on the Marketing Authorization Application for GENVOYA, and the final regulatory decision is expected by the European Commission by the end of this year. Our second TAF containing product, F/TAF, has been assigned a PDUFA date of April 7, 2016. And in the EU, a CHMP opinion could be adopted in the first quarter of 2016. F/TAF met its primary 48-week objective in an ongoing Phase 3 study conducted among 663 HIV-infected virologically suppressed adults who were randomized to either maintain their TRUVADA-based regimen or switch to an F/TAF-based regimen. At week 48 the F/TAF-based regimen and the TRUVADA-based regimens achieved similar rates of virologic suppression based on the proportion of patients with HIV RNA of less than 50 copies per mL. The safety profile of F/TAF was consistent with that observed in previous TAF studies, including improvements in bone and renal laboratory parameters. Marketing Authorization Applications for R/F/TAF were submitted in the U.S. and the EU in July. FDA assigned a PDUFA date of March 1, 2016, and a European Commission decision is expected in the second half of 2016. The application is supported by data on the use of R/F/TAF for the treatment of HIV infection in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older. Finally, we are investigating two additional TAF-based single- tablet regimens : TAF emtricitabine, and GS-9883, Gilead's proprietary integrase inhibitor, for which we'll initiate Phase 3 studies this quarter; and TAF emtricitabine/cobicistat and Janssen's darunavir D/C/F/TAF, which is being developed and will be commercialized by Janssen. HIV patients are living longer, thus facing additional health challenges to those experienced by newly diagnosed patients a decade ago. Our teams at Gilead and the healthcare community overall are motivated to continue improving on existing treatment options. The need for efficacy together with improved long-term safety has driven Gilead's development programs and the design of the studies we have completed and those that are planned. We look forward to introducing this new generation of F/TAF single-tablet regimens that we have created to address the evolving needs of people living with HIV. TAF is also being evaluated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Data from two Phase 3 trials may be available before the end of the year, with regulatory submissions expected in the first quarter of 2016. Moving to prevention of HIV infection, there is a clear and growing enthusiasm for PrEP. WHO issued new guidelines that will significantly increase the number of people who are eligible to receive TRUVADA for PrEP. We continue to work across multiple fronts to help ensure that TRUVADA for PrEP is used safely and appropriately as part of a comprehensive strategy to prevent HIV transmission and preserve health. Turning to HCV, one of the biggest achievements we have made as a company relates to the manufacturing of our NS5A inhibitors, ledipasvir and velpatasvir. API production is complex and involves multiple novel steps. Both molecules are high molecular weight compounds that need to be spray-dried in order to improve their oral absorption. We have increased production capacity around the world to meet the unprecedented demand for our HCV therapies, and this continues to be a focus as we bring forward the next generation of pan-genotypic fixed-dose combinations to patients around the world. Last month we announced positive top line results from four international Phase 3 ASTRAL studies evaluating our fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir, or GS-5816, for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C across genotype 1 through genotype 6. The ASTRAL study results demonstrate that a 12-week course of therapy with the first fixed-dose combination of two pan-genotypic compounds can provide high cure rates for patients across HCV genotype 1 through genotype 6. Sofosbuvir and velpatasvir has been granted accelerated assessment in the EU, potentially shorten the review period by four months. We expect to file for regulatory approval in the United States in the coming weeks. The detailed results from these Phase 3 ASTRAL studies and other data will be presented at the annual AASLD [American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases] meeting, which will commence on November 13 in San Francisco. More than 70 Gilead program-related abstracts have been accepted, highlighting the scientific progress across our liver disease pipeline, including HCV, HBV, NASH, and PSC. Finally, we received European approval on several supplemental new drug applications for HARVONI that expand the indicated use to include HCV/HIV co-infected patients, advanced liver disease and post-liver transplant recipients, and patients who have previously failed treatment on a sofosbuvir-based regimen. In the U.S., we are awaiting FDA action on our application to expand the indicated use of HARVONI to include HCV/HIV co-infected patients, patients with genotype 4, genotype 5, or genotype 6, and treatment-experienced and cirrhotic patients. A decision from FDA for each of these sNDAs is expected by November 13. Another sNDA was filed on August 28 to expand the indicated use of HARVONI in the U.S. to include advanced liver disease and post-liver transplant patients. In the area of cardiovascular disease, on October 2 FDA approved the use of LETAIRIS in combination with tadalafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension [PAH] to reduce the risk of disease progression and hospitalization for worsening PAH and to improve exercisability. The new labeling is supported by data from the AMBITION study. In this clinical trial, first-line treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension with the combination of LETAIRIS and tadalafil reduced the risk of disease progression by nearly 50% compared to either therapy individually. This combination represents a new treatment strategy for patients living with this debilitating and life-threatening disease. Our partner GlaxoSmithKline, which commercializes LETAIRIS outside the United States, announced on Friday that the CHMP granted a positive opinion to expand the indication for Volibris, as ambrisentan is known in Europe in combination treatment for PAH. Lastly, I wanted to mention our work on Ebola. In the summer of 2014, news of an Ebola outbreak consumed the world, with the virus infecting approximately 30,000 and killing almost half of those individuals. Commerce, travel, and healthcare systems around the world were impacted. At that time, our scientists had engaged in an extensive evaluation of nucleotides with activity against RNA viruses. We were able to quickly select GS-5734 as a candidate for development. All necessary IND-enabling studies were completed, and we initiated a clinical trial in healthy volunteers in August of this year to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of the drug. In parallel, convincing efficacy data obtained from studies in Ebola-infected animals were presented at the IDWeek meeting earlier this month in San Diego, showing full protection of animals treated up to three days after infection with a lethal dose of the Ebola virus. As you may know, Royal Free Hospital in the UK announced last week that they dosed a relapsing Ebola-infected patient with GS-5734 following a request to Gilead for compassionate access. This is another example of how individuals at Gilead take initiative to address unmet medical needs. I will now turn the call over to Paul Carter to provide a commercial update. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President- Commercial Operations : Thank you, John. I'm very pleased to provide an update on our commercial performance, which in the third quarter generated $8.2 billion in worldwide net product sales. U.S. product revenue reached $5.6 billion, which was in line with the prior quarter and up 33% compared to $4.2 billion for the same period in 2014. European product revenue reached $1.7 billion, which is down 15% sequentially from the second quarter, mainly reflecting expected summer seasonality, but up 17% on a year-over-year basis despite absorbing a negative 11% foreign exchange movement. For the rest of the world, which includes Japan, product revenues were $958 million. Beginning with hepatitis C, we continue to be pleased with the number of patients we are reaching with SOVALDI and HARVONI, which are now approved in 57 and 44 countries respectively. Total HCV revenue for the third quarter was $4.8 billion, a 2% decrease over the second quarter and a 70% increase year over year. In the U.S. HCV product revenue totaled $3.2 billion, with HARVONI representing more than $2.5 billion of that amount. We saw a gradual downward trend in demand for the retail market during the third quarter but less so in the non-retail sector, largely due to increased spending by the VA. Since the beginning of the year approximately 190,000 U.S. HCV patients started on treatment on a Gilead product. This represents a Gilead market share of more than 90% of HCV patients, reflecting the positively differentiated profile of HARVONI in particular. In fact, HARVONI and SOVALDI continue to perform well in real-world settings, with safety, tolerability, and cure rates comparing favorably to those observed in our clinical studies. Several of these real-world data sets will be presented at the upcoming AASLD conference in San Francisco. That being said, payer restrictions, including eligibility criteria based on fibrosis score or other patient characteristics, still remain to varying degrees. We expect those restrictions could lessen over time as patient volumes become more predictable and payers recognize the benefits of treating less sick patients earlier and further benefiting from the value of just eight weeks treatment for many GT-1 patients. As I commented last quarter, we saw an unusually large number of patient starts in the U.S. in the first quarter of this year, which reflected the rapid access to treatment for many warehouse patients. It is clear that the number of warehouse patients has now diminished. We anticipate that the rate at which new patients start treatment at the end of this year may be more indicative of the pace of new patient starts in 2016. Turning to Europe, HCV revenue was approximately $870 million this quarter, with around 80,000 patients beginning treatment with HARVONI or SOVALDI since the start of the year. We saw strong demand for HARVONI, particularly in recently launched markets like Spain and Italy. In early launch markets like Germany, which as in the U.S. saw an initial large spike in warehouse treatments in the first few months after launch, we are now seeing a lower but more predictable and consistent level of patient starts. In the UK, we're delighted that NICE, the government's health technology assessment agency, issued its final appraisal determination for HARVONI. NICE has found HARVONI to be cost effective and recommends that the National Health Service fund HARVONI to treat the majority of adult patients with HCV genotype 1 and genotype 4 in England and Wales. On the reimbursement front, we have recently received expanded approvals in Austria and Sweden. We also received broad approval in the Netherlands and Poland during the quarter and will launch SOVALDI and HARVONI in both countries next month. Looking ahead in Europe, we anticipate that our HCV revenues will be constrained by country-specific budgets rather than the number of patients in need of treatment. We will continue to work hard to educate governments and other groups about the benefit of diagnosing and treating HCV-infected people as early as possible. Turning to Japan, we are very pleased with the execution of the launches of our two HCV products. HCV revenues for the third quarter were $454 million. Since the launches of SOVALDI in May and HARVONI in September, through the end of the quarter we have generated sales of approximately $515 million in Japan. The Japanese Society of Hepatology has recently updated HCV treatment guidelines to reflect HARVONI as well as SOVALDI in combination with ribavirin as first choice in treatment for patients with genotype 1 and genotype 2 respectively. To conclude my comments on HCV, we recognize that there remains a huge unmet medical need around the world and that just a small fraction of diagnosed patients have been treated so far, even in the early launch markets. A key objective for Gilead moving forward is to bring diagnosed and undiagnosed patients into care. It's clear that governments, healthcare systems, policy makers, payers, patients, and healthcare advocacy groups recognize the opportunity to treat many more people now that we have simple, safe, and highly effective medicines for HCV. We're working together with them on a number of fronts, with the aim of bringing all diagnosed yet untreated patients into care over time while recognizing capacity and budget constraints. We're also working on programs to encourage more screening and increase the level of diagnosis and subsequent linkage to care. This is akin to the work we have done over the years with HIV in both the most developed and the poorest countries, where step by step we have seen great progress. Today we have Gilead teams around the world focused on collaborating with these diverse groups and supporting their efforts towards a long-term ambitious goal of controlling and possibly eliminating HCV. Indeed, we have several collaborations in different countries and different settings that aim to demonstrate that upscaled HCV intervention and treatment can be highly impactful to individuals and public healthcare systems. In conclusion, we see progress, encouraging trends, and remain highly confident in the long-term sustainability of the HCV market in the United States, Europe, Japan, and many other countries around the world. Now turning to HIV, this quarter revenues increased 7% year on year to $2.9 billion, as our TRUVADA-based franchise continues to hold its market leadership position. In the U.S., revenues were more than $1.9 billion for the third quarter, a 16% increase from a year ago. Underlying prescription demand remains strong for both STRIBILD and COMPLERA, with year-on-year growth of 44% and 14% respectively. During the quarter, seven out of 10 patients initiated treatment with a Gilead regimen. HIV revenue growth also benefited from renewed purchasing from the VA and a slight increase in wholesaler inventory. In Europe, HIV revenues were $715 million for the quarter, down 4% from Q2 and 12% year over year, due to foreign exchange impacts and mandatory price cuts. However, prescription volume growth remains strong. EVIPLERA and STRIBILD are the number one and number two treatments respectively for treatment-naive patients in the five largest markets in Europe. These single-tablet regimens are maintaining strong franchise share in the face of competition. Looking to the future of HIV, John already gave a detailed account of where we stand on the regulatory front in bringing our TAF-based treatments to market. And I can say that the Gilead commercial organization is focused on ensuring a successful launch. We're excited about and prepared for the launch of GENVOYA, or E/C/F/TAF, as early as next week. In closing, we are very pleased with the commercial results for the third quarter, and I'll now turn the call over to Robin. Robin L. Washington - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report third quarter results, with non-GAAP diluted EPS of $3.22 per share for the third quarter, up 75% year over year. Total revenues were $8.3 billion, up 37% year over year. Net product sales for the third quarter were $8.2 billion, up 38% year over year, driven by the launch of HARVONI across various geographies, continued growth of SOVALDI outside the U.S., driven primarily by Japan, and increased sales of our newer HIV single-tablet regimen. U.S. net product revenues during the quarter have benefited from strong VA purchases following allocation by Congress of $500 million in additional funds for HCV treatment. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 90% for the third quarter of 2015 compared to 87% for the same quarter of 2014. Gross margin benefited from changes in product mix, including a year-over-year decline in ATRIPLA sales, which have a lower margin, and an increase in HCV product sales. Turning to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $713 million for the third quarter, up 22% compared to the prior year due to the continued progression of our clinical studies, particularly our HIV TAF-based programs. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $850 million for the third quarter, down 4% compared to the prior year, primarily due to a cumulative catch-up of the branded prescription drug fee in the same quarter last year, partially offset by higher expenses associated with the growth of our business, including our commercial expansion to support our HCV products. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $25.1 billion in cash and investments, a sequential increase of $10.4 billion. During the third quarter we issued $10 billion of senior unsecured notes and generated cash flow from operations of $4.1 billion. The approximately $1.6 billion sequential decline in operating cash flow is due to the timing of cash payments related to current liabilities, which include rebates associated with HARVONI sales. Recall that during our Q1 earnings call, I mentioned that unpaid rebates associated with the launch of HARVONI may impact future cash flows as they are paid out. We continue returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. During the quarter we repurchased 28 million shares for $3.1 billion. As of September 30, we had $11.1 billion remaining under our current share repurchase plan and remain active in purchasing shares. Through our repurchase program, we have reduced our diluted shares outstanding to 1.5 billion. Shareholders received a cash dividend of $626 million in September, and this afternoon we announced our Q4 2015 quarterly cash dividend of $0.43 per share. In total, in the first nine months of 2015, we have returned more than $8 billion in cash to shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases. Including our Q2 2015 warrant settlement of $3.9 billion, total cash returns to shareholders have exceeded $12 billion year to date. Finally, in regard to full-year 2015 guidance, which is outlined on slide 45 of the earnings deck, we are increasing our net product revenue guidance, and now expect product sales to be in the range of $30 billion to $31 billion. All other components of our 2015 guidance remain unchanged. In summary, Gilead had another successful quarter. We believe our strong financial position and our future cash flows provide us with financial flexibility and support our pipeline growth and take advantage of external opportunities as they may arise. Thank you, and we look forward to updating you on our progress during our next call. We would now like to open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me have the first question. I really appreciate it. And, John Martin, it was nice to see you a couple weeks ago in California. I wanted to ask about GS-9883. Maybe you talked a little bit about this in the prepared. I had to hop on and off. But it looks like that has been accelerated. This is the unboosted integrase inhibitor. It looks like that's been accelerated. I looked back at your slide deck from last quarter and you were just talking about viewing the Phase 2 data around the end of the year. So I was wondering if you could talk about that product. What gave you the confidence to move into Phase 3 because this is obviously transformative to the HIV business once you combine it with TAF? And what is the IP on GS-9883? When should we model a loss of exclusivity for GS-9883? Thank you. Norbert W. Bischofberger, PhD - Executive Vice President, Research and Development & Chief Scientific Officer : So, Mark, I'll answer the first question. So we have Phase 2 data. We had discussions with FDA. They have accepted our plan, so it will be two studies. One will be, as we call it, a single variable experiment, so we compare GS-9883 to dolutegravir in the background of F/TAF. And the other one will be a double variable experiment. We'll compare the two single-tablet regimens, so TRIUMEQ versus GS-9883 F/TAF single-tablet regimen. And so we hope to enroll the study by the end of this year, so it's all... Patrick O'Brien - Senior Director- Investor Relations : Start enrollment. Norbert W. Bischofberger, PhD - Executive Vice President, Research and Development & Chief Scientific Officer : Start enrollment, so it's all fast forward. Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : And the IP? John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer : Mark, it's a good question. We're scrambling right now because I don't have that one in front of me. So it's a fairly recent invention from Gilead. Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Okay. John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer : So I think it's pretty far out there, but we'll get that number out for you as soon as we can. Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : And the plan is to combine this with TAF and whatever, and you would have a single-tablet regimen unboosted, with the most desirable new TAF through presumably 3030 or so? John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer : Correct. Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : 2030. John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer : Not 3030, yes. Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Okay, I'll let everybody else ask about HCV. John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer : But you're correct. It's going to be an STR. And because of the amount of API, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in that tablet, it's in fact going to be one of the smaller STRs available, and we're quite excited about it. Norbert W. Bischofberger, PhD - Executive Vice President, Research and Development & Chief Scientific Officer : It's smaller than a single-tablet regimen, yes. John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yes. Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : And does this compound have any known advantages over the current unboosted integrase out there that you're willing to talk about? And then I'll stop. Norbert W. Bischofberger, PhD - Executive Vice President, Research and Development & Chief Scientific Officer : Mark, I'm not sure clinically if it will have any advantages. It has some slight advantages over in vitro if systems proved out. Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Thank you, Norbert. Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you, and the next question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good afternoon, guys, good quarter and thanks for taking the question. I've asked this before on hep C, but is there anything you guys can do to further incentivize payers to cure more F0-F1? I look at the fibrosis data on slide 25, and it looks to be going the wrong way when you compare that to Q1 or Q2. And a related question, just from last week, given label changes from your competitor, do you guys anticipate going back to payers if formulary status for HARVONI or SOVALDI wasn't as favorable? Thanks. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President- Commercial Operations : Hi, Geoff. So on the first question, we still see, as you recognize in the chart, very high levels of restrictions still through F0 and F1 patients, and we see this in a formal way in the contracts that we're working with. But we also see it qualitatively when we talk to doctors where, dependent on insurance company, doctors I think in some cases don't even bother to write prescriptions because they know they're going to be rejected. And we do see the rejection rates, and some of them are quite high. But I think we just need to keep encouraging our partners to try and treat earlier and consider treating less sick patients. And I think as we see these patient flows \u2013 and this is pretty much the same answer I gave last time as well, I'm afraid \u2013 but as we see patient flows begin to stabilize and become more predictable, that does work better with the payers and the PBMs' models. So again, I hope that will encourage them to consider treating people earlier. And of course finally, they do get much better value, especially for the less sick GT-1 patients if they treat for eight weeks. So we hope all of that will continue to encourage them, but it is a bit frustrating, I agree with you. John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer : Geoff, the second part of your question is will the label update from our competitor allow us to go back in the contracts, and I would say that's really not the philosophy here. I think people who are choosing between us and the competitor have to make decisions on behalf of the plans, their ability to pay, and the patients that they want to treat. And it would really be up to them to look at the level of access that they want to give, because frankly, the 2016 contracts are all in place. Those have been negotiated, and the payer \u2013 it's really \u2013 we've left it up to them to determine the level of access that they would want to give to us versus them, and as Paul pointed out, also the level of access they're willing to give to patients with lower fibrosis scores. So I'm sure every new data set that comes out allows them to rethink a position. But from where we are right now, I don't see any major changes occurring. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President- Commercial Operations : Maybe I can just add to on that. We are very happy, as I mentioned in the script, that plenty of real-world data sets are coming out and really do I think hopefully give payers the confidence that investing in relatively expensive medicines is worthwhile because of the cure rates and the tolerability and safety profile. So the more real-world data sets that come out, we hope that will be encouraging. And finally, yet again I'd take the opportunity to say that Gilead believes in making sure that prescriptions are in the hands of physicians and their patients and not forced upon them by exclusive contracts. So all of that we hope will encourage perhaps a rethink. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got you. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is now open. Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC : Great, thanks very much for taking the question; congrats on a nice quarter here. Paul, you mentioned bringing the undiagnosed into care. We've seen some data that's showing pilot screening projects by various public and private parties that has increased the identification of undiagnosed patients and the linkage to care. So I guess the question is how is the screening effort going to be handled going forward? How is it going to be scaled up? And do you see any tangible evidence that the screening has brought more patients into care over the past year? And then lastly, I think the Department of Health and Human Services wants to get to 66% of the U.S. hep C population diagnosed by 2020. Do you think that's achievable? Thanks. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President- Commercial Operations : We are very, very busy behind the scenes. In fact, we just had a conference here locally last week with a number of partners that we're working with. We have a program called FOCUS. We have partners with about 100 different external organizations across I think 18 cities so far across the U.S. And the objective here is increasing diagnosis with various programs around screening and then importantly linkage to care. And there's a whole list of programs that we've been hearing about their initial work. One of the things that is quite surprising I think to everyone is that the levels of prevalence, albeit in fairly high targeted areas, have been way higher than people anticipated, so roughly double in fact the numbers that people have expected. As for the DHHS question, I can't really comment on that. But there is a lot of work going on out there and because I think of the simplicity of the treatments and the very high levels of SVRs we're seeing, people are getting more and more encouraged to address the problem. Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, thanks. Following up on some hep C, on slide 25 where you nicely break out the scripts which I think are written, can you take that a little bit further and maybe quantify what you think are the breakdown of fibrosis for scripts filled? Is that primarily all F3/F4? And I guess to further move beyond that, what are the one or two or three things you're trying to work with the payers and trying to understand? I guess John said that he didn't really expect it to change anytime soon. So should we expect to continue the current trends that we're seeing with U.S. scripts as they are, and where do you think that bottoms out to? Thanks. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President- Commercial Operations : So the slides you're looking at, the top right-hand corner is the fibrosis scores. And I just want to emphasize the title on the top here. This is intent to treat. So essentially, this is prescriptions that are written but not necessarily filled. And what we do know is that although it suggests that half the scripts are F0 through F2, we know that a lot, probably the majority of those F0 through F1 at least are not being filled, certainly by some of the payers who are easy to identify. In the F2 area, it's a borderline situation. We know this quantitatively. But again, we also know it qualitatively through our sales force and their interactions with physicians, where it's still quite hard work to get F2 patients through the prior authorization process and time consuming and bureaucratic. So it's a situation that's frustrating for everyone. As I said in my comments just a couple of minutes ago, I think that as we see treatment flows becoming more predictable, as we see more real-world data with the products building a higher level of confidence, that SVR rates and safety profiles are good, that we hope that payers will start to relax criteria around fibrosis scores and other patient characteristics that we've seen acting as barriers to treatment. And we will continue, as we have done and will do, to talk closely with our payer partners and try and encourage them to treat more people and reduce these barriers to treatment. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Abrahams of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC : Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a nice quarter. You recently reported some promising data for the SOF/VEL regimen, including in genotype 2 and genotype 3. I'm wondering. How should we be viewing this as a potential revenue expander in those genotypes? Should we think about that regimen as potentially increasing market share because of its better convenience, you guys potentially having better pricing power because you're eliminating the ribavirin component, or is it more likely to be positioned as really a defense against competitive entrants going forward? Thanks. John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer : Thanks, Brian, it's John Milligan. So just to be clear, so when we thought about this product, we thought about it being a better alternative medically for patients with genotype 2 through genotype 6, and that includes some patients in the United States, but the vast majority of patients who fall in that category are of course outside the United States. With HARVONI maintaining its place in genotype 1 particularly because, as Paul was alluding to, we have such a very strong safety data set now on HARVONI, including over 600,000 patients who have been treated with SOVALDI now in various forms; the fact that we have the eight-week option for patients, which provides quite a savings for the appropriate patient, and as you've seen, very high cure rates in real-world settings at that eight-week regimen. So I do think there are going to be some patients who would benefit from the shortening of duration, not having to go to 24 weeks in some cases, not having to have ribavirin in other cases, and allowing us to then have a very good option for those patients genotype 2 through genotype 6. I don't think there's a big warehouse effect of patients waiting for that, but I do think this provides a very important option for patients who would want a pan-genotypic option and for doctors who may not be able to genotype as effectively. And so I think it's a very important breakthrough for us and will allow us to continue the longevity of the franchise more so than provide any sort of bolus effect up front. Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC : That very helpful, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Obviously, M&A has been and continues to be a big topic of conversation. However, given the volatility in the markets since your last quarterly call, I'm wondering if you've detected a shift in the receptivity from other companies with the valuation resets many have seen, basically curious whether or not you think this kind of market makes it harder to get a deal done. Thanks. John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer : I guess there's an implication that we've been out making offers. So I'd say I don't think the market really changes all that much dynamically in terms of M&A activity. And so I can't tell you people's expectations have changed based on valuation changes, but I've seen these cycles go up and down over the years. And when there's a deal to be put together and it's timely, it can be done. And so I don't think it changes the overall outlook for M&A at all. I just think from my perspective, it's about the same as it was at the beginning of the year. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Phil M. Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Paul, in your prepared remarks, you suggested that the volumes that we see at the end of this year will be more indicative of what to expect in the U.S. in 2016. That suggests that we probably will see a stabilization of script trends. I'm curious why you think that. What data points do you have that suggest that's likely to happen? And also, what makes you think that what we see the end of this year is going to be extrapolatable through the end of next year? Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President- Commercial Operations : Hi, Phil. Thanks. First of all, I'd say you see the same data that I see with the weekly scripts. What you don't see is the non-retail sector perhaps, and you may not see what we call NBRx, which is the new-to-brand, which is essentially the new starts data. I think that we're fairly confident. We've now seen a flattening out of the trends of patient new starts in the U.S. As I said earlier, I've said a couple times now that we saw a very strong first quarter, which really was reflecting the warehousing of patients waiting for HARVONI in the U.S., and HARVONI was such a step-change for GT-1 patients. But we've had a fairly flat two quarters in terms of patients starting on sofosbuvir products. In quarter four last year, just to put it in perspective \u2013 and HARVONI was already launched then, by the way, we saw about 45,000 patients being treated. Then we had this big bolus in quarter one, about 70,000 patients. In quarter two we saw about 62,000, and in quarter three we've estimated about just around 60,000. So it's flattening when you add the retail and the non-retail together. And as I said, as we go into quarter four, I think we can expect that to be fairly stable as we go into next year. Having said that, and again, from my prepared remarks, I emphasized that we are doing a lot of work across the country and around the world to work with governments and other stakeholders to really try and encourage earlier treatment, more screening, and so on, so that we can extend this hepatitis C business for many, many years. And we think that's going to be the case because even now we've treated just a tiny, tiny fraction of the diagnosed patients and hardly touched the undiagnosed area in terms of volume and potential. So we're very confident of the future, but 2016 I think will be a more stable year in the U.S. Phil M. Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC: And just so I'm clear, does your comments about 2016 rely in any way on an opening of restrictions in who gets reimbursed in the U.S., or is this simply restrictions stay the same and patients start working through the system? Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President- Commercial Operations : I think it's going to be patients working through the system, but I think we're fairly optimistic that over time, and it may take a little bit longer time than shorter time based on what we've seen so far, there are fibrosis scores and other patient characteristics which would represent barriers to start treatment will be relaxed somewhat. And it's self-fulfilling in a sense that predictable and stable patient flow works with the business models of the payers. And I think they will start to feel more comfortable about relaxing constraints. So gradually, we should start to see more patients coming through. Phil M. Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC: And just one last follow-up. In Europe, you said that the volumes are more dependent upon the reimbursement levels of governments. Can you give us some sense of where we are bumping up, where we are in comparison to the reimbursement limits that have been set by governments? Are we now bumping up against those constraints, or is there still more room to come? Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President- Commercial Operations : We have to be fairly specific by country, and looking at Europe in aggregate doesn't necessarily paint the full picture. So let me just talk you through quarter three and what's being happening I think in Europe. So we've seen early launch markets like Germany begin to stabilize at lower levels but more consistent levels. And that's a parallel somewhat to what we saw in the U.S. So that would be Germany and France being the early launch markets. We've then seen markets that have high prevalence and ambition to treat a lot of patients like Spain and Italy really starting to address their warehouse patients in quarter two and starting to go into quarter three. And we've seen, I would say, I would suggest somewhat of a spike in those countries, and we would expect those going forward to come down to lower levels but more consistent levels. And then we started to see new markets like the UK coming onstream during quarter three. A confusing aspect in quarter three in Europe is because there's a very high level of vacations in July and August, not just for patients but for treaters and wholesalers and so on, so there are a few moving parts there. Going forward, I would expect Europe to start to flatten out and stabilize somewhat. But of course, as I said, there are different dynamics country by country. And I mentioned in the script a couple of the smaller countries who haven't even launched yet but we will be launching in the next quarter. Phil M. Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC: That's very helpful, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Wendy Lam of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Wendy Lam - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I may have missed this earlier in the call, but I was wondering what percentage of patients on HARVONI were on the eight- week regimen versus the 12-week regimen. I believe last quarter you said it was around 40%, and I was wondering if that has changed that much this quarter. And just one quick question on simtuzumab, for the 48-week interim futility analysis this quarter, will there be any announcement of the results, whether they're negative or positive, or do we have to wait for the 96-week results? Thanks. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President- Commercial Operations : Okay, I'll answer the first question, which is the eight weeks regimen. So our estimate is about 40% of GT-1 patients in the U.S., which is similar to last quarter, have been on the eight weeks regimen. That hasn't changed too much. If you look at just the epidemiology and look at the GT-1 patients who would qualify for eight weeks, that's more like 70% of those. So I hope that answers that part. And I'll hand you over to Norbert. Norbert W. Bischofberger, PhD - Executive Vice President, Research and Development & Chief Scientific Officer : Wendy, I would say the answer to the 48-week is that there won't be an announcement. We have an agreement with FDA. The endpoint in that study is HVPG, Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient, and the FDA felt that the 48-week data would really not suffice for an approval, that we needed 96-week data. Of course, there could be the possibility of some spectacular results like prevention of SMEs or something like that, or the opposite also. There could be a surprise about harm, in which case the DSMB could make a recommendation to either stop the study or unblind it, but I think that's unlikely. Wendy Lam - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ying Huang of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, thanks for taking my questions as well. First of all, I think John was saying that the 2016 contracts with the payers are pretty much in place and there's no major change in access. I was wondering what would prompt the payers to actually provide wider access. Would lower pricing give you guys more access? And in relation to that, there's a third player coming into the market for HCV in January. What's your view of the pricing trend in marketing 2016? John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer : So as I said earlier \u2013 this is John Milligan. As I said earlier, the contracts have been finalized for 2016. That always happens earlier in the year. In fact, we're already starting to talk a little bit about 2017 with the payers. And they have a range of options, much like they had in the past. They can choose what level of rebate they would want to have based on their ability to open up access. And I think 2015 was a bit of a shock to the system with the warehouse patients. And as Paul implied, next year we think will be a much smoother base from which we can then try to impact the growth of the overall market. And so they will have options based on how they negotiate with their clients to open up access or not for next year. So that will be an ongoing discussion with them and within their internal groups as well as the data emerge on this. So we feel very positive about this in the long term. And it sometimes just takes data and time for these things to work themselves out. And with regards to \u2013 yes, go ahead. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just quickly, I know you guys made a 46% gross-to-net announcement. Probably you cannot give us a quantitative answer, but qualitatively speaking, can you talk about the gross-to-net adjustment trend in Q3 versus Q2 and Q1? John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer : No, we're not putting that number out there for the gross-to-net. I think one thing to focus on is what Paul had said earlier. What we are seeing is a trend towards shorter therapy, so a lot fewer use of the 24-week option for patients and then a lot of the eight-week option for those patients. So that is a real benefit of driving the cost down by bringing in shorter care to the patients as well. And so that's what you would expect as the more sick patients in those categories work themselves through. You also had a question about competitors coming to market. I think we feel very strongly about our position in the market. We feel very strongly about the value that we've been able to bring, and importantly, the safety database that we have that will give us a very strong position in the market regardless of who comes in, in the future. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to ask \u2013 I saw on your milestone chart you're going to start a Phase 3 study for the triple HCV regimen you said in the fourth quarter of this year. So I'm wondering what you hope to achieve there. I know you've looked at six weeks, eight weeks, and 12 weeks and what duration you think you're going to be going forward with and what impact you think that could have on the market. And then separately, if you're willing, could you quantify for us how big the VA tailwind was to you? Thanks. Norbert W. Bischofberger, PhD - Executive Vice President, Research and Development & Chief Scientific Officer : Matthew, so our thoughts for the triple combination HCV regimen is twofold. First of all, we're going to do one study, and we still have to talk about all the details that will show \u2013 that will explore the utility of the triple combination regimen to be a universal salvage regimen. So whatever you have failed before, whether it's non-nukes, PIs, or NS5As, this triple combination regimen will provide a universal salvage possibility. And the second thing we're exploring is eight weeks duration of therapy in various patient populations. And again, we're working with the FDA through all the details of that. We haven't decided. The final decision has not been made, but those are our two-pronged approach. And then the other question? John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer : Matt, you asked about the VA tailwind. And unfortunately, we're not able to share any details about prescribing habits or business in the VA, so I can't help you. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Skorney of Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess just on the hep C triple combo data, I know you said you have top line data out. The AASLD abstract only has data for six-week duration for the genotype 3 patients. Can you just remind us if you're still exploring a six-week duration of treatment with this triple combo in other genotypes? And if so, in what context we should think about a shorter duration when we might see some data? And then just on the safety data that we heard about with Viekira this week, if Express Scripts' national formulary committee makes a determination to add SOVALDI and HARVONI due to these issues, will you insist that they pay gross price? Norbert W. Bischofberger, PhD - Executive Vice President, Research and Development & Chief Scientific Officer : Brian, I'll answer the first question. We are not exploring a six-week duration regimen anymore. And the reason is simply that our experience has been that it works for a subset of patients but not for a broader patient population. If you look at cirrhotics or treatment-experienced patients, then the response rates, the SVR rates are not as high as they should be. And I want to remind you, you'll notice that the response rate \u2013 if you just get 90%, people won't accept that anymore. It really has to be 95% or more, and we're not seeing that across a broad patient population with six weeks of therapy. Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Does that mean that you're no longer pursuing the pan-genotypic protease inhibitor anymore too? Norbert W. Bischofberger, PhD - Executive Vice President, Research and Development & Chief Scientific Officer : That was the previous question, Brian. The pan-genotypic PI together with velpatasvir together with sofosbuvir, the triple is going to be a universal salvage regimen and potential universal eight-week duration therapy. That's what we're thinking, but not six weeks. John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer : Brian, I think your second question was about what Express Scripts might do. Obviously, it's up to Express Scripts to figure out what they want to do given where they are. The national formulary, where there is exclusivity for the Viekira Pak, of course is about 15% of the covered lives of Express Scripts. Obviously, we're open to discussions anytime they want to call us, but I have no idea what their thoughts would be. I have no idea how the label update would impact their business at all. That's up for them to decide medically what's the right thing to do for their patients, of course. Norbert W. Bischofberger, PhD - Executive Vice President, Research and Development & Chief Scientific Officer : Brian, I would like to add something. If you looked at the six-week duration treatment would still be two prescriptions. It's not possible to package 42 tablets into a bottle and have that be one prescription. So that's another reason why six weeks is not as appealing. Eight weeks is the result of two prescriptions. Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And, Mr. O'Brien, we have time for one more question. And our final question comes from Alan Carr of Needham & Company. Your line is now open. Alan Carr - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, thanks very much. I wanted to come back to HIV and talk a bit about your thoughts on how well the HIV franchise is doing relative to V-regimens, better or worse than you expected? And then also to come back to GS-9883, what are your timelines there for wrapping up the Phase 3 and submitting the NDA? Thanks. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President- Commercial Operations : Okay, so let me just talk a little bit about the HIV franchise. So actually one of the encouraging pieces of news in the U.S. is that eight out of ten patients now are receiving a single-tablet regimen, which I think demonstrates that the concept of single tablet regimens is really very well established now. TRIUMEQ has been doing well on its launch, and it has been taking some market share from Gilead, although seven out of ten patients new to treatment are receiving a Gilead product and six out of ten roughly are receiving a Gilead single-tablet regimen. So the conversation in HIV having been focused somewhat on third agents over the last few years, we feel now is going to come strongly back to the backbone of these HIV single-tablet regimens. And really up until next week, TRUVADA has been well established as the standard of care backbone in these single tablet regimens. But as of November 5, our PDUFA for TAF or F/TAF-based regimens, that changes, and F/TAF will be the standard of care backbone for single-tablet regimens going forward. So with the launch of GENVOYA next week, we are very confident that we will see a major milestone in the upgrading of HIV treatment. And as John said earlier, because patients are living longer with HIV, have a lifetime of therapy, this is a major improvement for patients and a compelling data set that we're launching with, both for patients naive to treatment and for switch patients. And with switch patients, it takes time to get patients to switch. It won't happen by itself but the commercial organization and the medical affairs organization in Gilead are very well prepared and very motivated and very excited about the launch. So we're very confident. Alan Carr - Needham & Co. LLC: All right, thanks. And then around GS-9883 timing? Norbert W. Bischofberger, PhD - Executive Vice President, Research and Development & Chief Scientific Officer : The timeline, so if we start enrollment at the end of this year, assume six-month enrollment, 48-week endpoint, that's middle of 2017, two months to write it up and submit and then another 10 months for review, so that gets us roughly into mid-2018 timeframe. Alan Carr - Needham & Co. LLC: Great, thanks very much. Patrick O'Brien - Senior Director- Investor Relations : Great. Thank you, Candice, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead, and the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on future progress in future earnings calls. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

(Broker) Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Gilead Sciences fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. My name is Candace, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Patrick O'Brien - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thank you, Candace. And good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, a press release was issued with earnings results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead Sciences website. Joining today's call will be John Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Milligan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer; Paul Carter, Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations; and Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before beginning formal remarks, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections, and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings release press release, as well as on the Gilead Sciences website. I will now turn the call over to John Martin. John C. Martin - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Patrick, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. 2015 was an exceptional year for Gilead, with progress in a number of therapeutic areas, most notably in the development of TAF-based therapies for HIV and hepatitis B and new agents for the treatment of liver disease. Gilead is entering 2016 from a position of financial strength; a portfolio of 20 marketed products that address significant unmet medical needs, including Genvoya, the most recent product to be introduced; and growing pipeline with multiple programs for which milestones are expected during the coming year, including regulatory decisions on two products for HIV and one each for HCV and HBV. As you all know, we announced on Friday that John Milligan will be appointed CEO, a role he will assume in a few weeks. I will be taking on the role of Executive Chairman and will continue to be actively engaged in the company. John Milligan has been with Gilead for more than 25 years and over that time has built expertise in every functional area of the company's operations. The board and I are confident that this is the right time for this transition and that John is the right person to lead Gilead in the next few years of evolution. John, congratulations. I'll now turn the call over to you to make a few remarks. John F. Milligan - President and Chief Operating Officer : Thanks, John. I'm honored and excited by the opportunity to lead this company and the great team we have. In my new role, I will continue to work hard to help Gilead's business grow beyond antivirals and into new therapeutic areas for the betterment of patients. I'm also greatly appreciative that John will remain closely involved as the Executive Chairman. Turning to the business and results of the quarter. Genvoya, the company's first TAF-based single-tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, is now approved in the U.S. and Europe. Genvoya achieved preferred status in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services treatment guidelines within the first two weeks after approval, which speaks to the profile of the product and the important need it addresses. Two other TAF-based regimens are pending regulatory approval in the U.S. and EU. F/TAF has been assigned a PDUFA date of April 7, and in the EU a CHMP opinion could be adopted in the first quarter of this year. R/F/TAF has been assigned a PDUFA date of March 1, and a CHMP opinion is expected in the second half of this year. This means that Gilead could launch two new TAF-containing products in the coming months, giving patients a wider range of options for the treatment of their HIV. During the last quarter, four Phase 3 studies of GS-9883, Gilead's proprietary integrase inhibitor combined into a single-tablet regimen with F/TAF, were initiated. Two studies will evaluate the safety and efficacy of GS-9883/F/TAF in HIV-1-infected, treatment-naive adults. One will compare GS-9883/F/TAF to Triumeq, and the other will compare GS-9883/F/TAF to dolutegravir plus F/TAF. Two other studies will evaluate patients who switch from Triumeq or a boosted PI to GS-9883/F/TAF. Phase 2 data on GS-9883/F/TAF will be presented later this year at a medical conference describing the safety and antiviral activity over 48 weeks of treatment. Analysis of the data through 24 weeks indicated that an STR of GS-9883/F/TAF may represent a valuable option for many patients. And based on current timelines, the U.S. NDA and EU MAA could be filed in the second half of next year. Last month, Gilead submitted a new drug application in the U.S. and a marketing authorization application in the EU for TAF as a treatment for chronic hepatitis B. Regulatory submissions are also expected in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and India this year and China in the first half of 2017. Phase 3 study results reflect high efficacy and improved renal and bone safety parameters, similar to those seen in clinical studies evaluating TAF-based regimens for HIV. Beyond TAF for HBV, several ongoing research programs are focused on therapies with finite duration of dosing that achieve long-term viral suppression. The first is an immunomodulatory approach where multiple programs are evaluating different ways to activate the immune system to eliminate infected hepatocytes. The most advanced is our TLR7 agonist, GS-9620, which is currently in two Phase 2 studies. Other approaches include the combination of novel direct-acting antivirals and agents that modulate cccDNA transcription. Two of these new programs may enter into clinical trials in the first half of 2016. In hepatitis C, Gilead's focus remains on advancing care of people with the disease, regardless of genotype or disease severity. Since the launch of Sovaldi in December 2013 and Harvoni in October 2014, more than 770,000 individuals around the world have been treated with sofosbuvir-based regimen. In November, FDA approved Harvoni for expanded use in patients with genotype 4, 5, and 6 chronic HCV infection and in patients co-infected with HIV. In addition, Harvoni plus ribavirin for 12 weeks was approved as an alternate therapy to 24 weeks of Harvoni for treatment-experienced genotype 1 patients with cirrhosis. Sofosbuvir and velpatasvir is an investigational once-daily pan-genotypic combination studied for the treatment of genotype 1 through 6 chronic HCV infection, including patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. FDA granted priority review and has set a PDUFA date of June 28, 2016. Additionally, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir has been granted accelerated assessment in the EU. If approved, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir will represent a significant step forward, particularly for genotype 3 patients. It would also become the first and only regimen offering high SVR rates with 12 weeks of treatment for patients with all HCV genotypes. The advances in treatment of HCV with Sovaldi and Harvoni over the past two years have allowed Gilead to work with governments and public health experts on eradication strategies among specific populations and geographies. Programs such as those ongoing in the Republic of Georgia and Iceland could serve as examples for other governments around the world seeking to eradicate HCV. Public health programs to prevent HIV transmission are also underway, including efforts to raise awareness about the use of Truvada for PrEP. Today, more than 40,000 patients in the U.S. are receiving Truvada for its preventative indication. Yesterday, the MAA was validated for Gilead's Type II variation of Truvada for PrEP, and it is now under evaluation by the EMA. Gilead continues its R&D efforts in NASH, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Phase 2 studies of simtuzumab, a LOXL2-targeting antibody, are ongoing in patients with NASH and also primary sclerosing cholangitis. The data monitoring committee for these studies recently met and recommended the continuation of the studies, which have a 96-week endpoint. Additionally, clinical studies of the FXR agonist GS-9674 have been initiated, with the first patients receiving treatment in Q4 of last year. Moving to oncology, Gilead continues to study Zydelig in several hematological disorders. Phase 3 study results show adding Zydelig to bendamustine and rituximab provides statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in progression-free and overall survival compared to bendamustine and rituximab alone. Supplemental regulatory filings are planned in the U.S. and Europe early this year to include these important new data. Beyond Zydelig, Gilead also is exploring novel combinations of investigational therapies for a range of cancers, including four classes of kinase inhibitors, PI3K, SYK, JAK, and BTK, that each target different signaling pathways. Progress has been made in inflammation as well. Gilead entered into a global partnership with Galapagos late last year for the development and commercialization of filgotinib, a JAK1 inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases. Phase 2 trial data show that filgotinib has the potential to be an effective and well-tolerated oral therapy for patients with RA and Crohn's disease. Phase 3 studies of filgotinib in RA and Crohn's are planned to start later this year. In summary, Gilead's substantial pipeline offers numerous opportunities for continued growth, both in the short and longer term, and the financial strength of the company allows us to be thoughtful and opportunistic in pursuing partnerships or acquisitions that will further expand the future portfolio of products. 2016 will be a busy year for Gilead, and I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees for their support in this transition, and for their continued hard work and dedication. Paul Carter will now provide a commercial update. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : Thanks, John, and good afternoon everyone. Gilead achieved $8.4 billion in net product revenue in the fourth quarter, representing 16% year-over-year growth. U.S. product revenue reached $4.8 billion in the fourth quarter, which is down 14% from the third quarter and down 12% on a year-over-year basis, largely due to a decrease of HCV revenue. European product revenue reached $1.7 billion in the quarter, which was in line with the prior quarter and up 22% on a year-over-year basis, despite a negative 11% foreign exchange impact. For the rest of the world, product revenues were $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter and $3.8 billion for the full year, driven largely by HCV launches in Japan. Beginning with hepatitis C, total HCV product revenue reached $4.9 billion in the fourth quarter. In the next few minutes, I'll describe the results for quarter four by region and also describe how we're thinking about the year ahead. In the United States, HCV product revenue totaled $2.4 billion, which is down 27% from the third quarter. This decline was impacted by substantially lower VA sales in the fourth quarter. In quarter three, Congress allocated an additional $500 million to the VA for HCV treatment, and this was fully utilized in quarter three. New patient starts in the VA were very limited during quarter four due to the uncertainty of future funding at that time. Congress has since allocated substantial funding of $1.5 billion for the fiscal year, which will allow treatment in the VA to resume this quarter. In terms of patient numbers in 2015, nearly 250,000 U.S. HCV patients started treatment, with more than 90% of these patients receiving Gilead HCV therapies. As I commented last quarter, there were an unusually large number of patient starts in the U.S. in the first quarter of last year, indicative of the rapid initiation of treatment for many warehoused patients, followed by a flattening of patients in the remaining quarters of the year. Looking to the future, even with nearly 400,000 patients treated since the launch of Sovaldi, there remain more than 3 million HCV-infected individuals in the U.S. who have yet to be treated, approximately half of whom are diagnosed according to recent CDC data. Long-term education and awareness efforts to increase rates of diagnosis and the flow of HCV-infected patients into treated care are important and will play out over many years, as we know from our experience in HIV. Turning to Europe, hepatitis C revenue was $846 million in the fourth quarter. And we estimate that more than 110,000 patients were treated with sofosbuvir-based regimens in 2015. Following the normal summer seasonality in quarter three, there was an increase of patient starts throughout Europe in quarter four, including in the UK following the final appraisal determination for Harvoni from NICE. A number of countries in Europe have volume-based incentives for Sovaldi and Harvoni, which serve to encourage a higher number of patients being treated. In quarter four, the growth in revenues did not match the growth in patient starts because of the impact of certain volume-based agreements, combined with adverse foreign exchange movements. In Japan, hepatitis C revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion. Since the launch of Sovaldi in May and the launch of Harvoni in September, sales of $1.9 billion have been generated in Japan, with Harvoni representing more than $1 billion of that number. In late December, pricing and reimbursement negotiations for Sovaldi and Harvoni in Australia were finalized. There are a number of variables to consider when thinking about HCV patient numbers and revenues for 2016. Patient starts in the U.S. will likely be similar to 2015 levels, both observed in the second half and extrapolated for the full year, while the Europe numbers will continue to grow as early launch markets stabilize and new markets ramp up treatment. In Japan, patient numbers are difficult to predict because launches are still in the early stages, and to some extent, we are likely seeing the impact of warehoused patients. In the rest of the world, we're excited to reach new patients in several new markets, notably in Asia-Pacific and in Latin America. As we think about revenue, we anticipate that variables to consider include potential shorter durations of treatment, the full-year effect of payer contracts in the U.S., and by price volume deals in some European markets, which may allow more patients to be treated at a lower per-patient cost. We also anticipate that payer mix in the U.S. may shift slightly towards public payers, while in Japan, new legislation will likely result in lower pricing for Sovaldi and Harvoni. We're confident in the long-term sustainability of HCV markets worldwide. Despite the number of patients treated to date, there are still millions of HCV-infected individuals who have yet to be treated and many that have yet to be diagnosed. There are significant efforts under way by industry, governments, and patient organizations to increase rates of diagnosis and linkage to care. We're also confident in our competitive position as we enter 2016. Sovaldi and Harvoni are breakthrough therapies that set the bar with cure rates of up to 99%. Data presented at AASLD in November show real-world cure rates with Harvoni that met or exceeded what was predicted by clinical trials, including the eight-week duration of therapy. We also look forward to launching our next HCV product, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, in due course around the world, starting later this year. Turning to HIV, HIV product revenue reached $3 billion in the fourth quarter. In the U.S., revenues were $2 billion, a 3% increase from the third quarter and up 5% on a year-over-year basis, driven by the continued demand for Stribild, Complera, Truvada, and the recent launch of Genvoya. Stribild and Complera have a strong underlying prescription demand with year-on-year growth of 40% and 12% respectively. Seven out of 10 HIV patients in the U.S. initiate therapy with a Gilead product, and nearly six in 10 receive a Gilead single-tablet regimen. Genvoya sales have been very encouraging in the first few weeks of launch. Revenues for the quarter were $44 million, with early product uptake well ahead of the launch of Stribild at the same time point. Access and reimbursement have been consistent with historical norms in HIV, and the rapid addition of Genvoya to the DHHS treatment guidelines as a preferred first-line treatment reinforces the safety and efficacy profile observed in clinical trials and reflected in our product label. In Europe, HIV revenues were $747 million for the quarter, up 4% from the third quarter, driven by the sales of Stribild and Eviplera, with a slight decline year over year caused by foreign exchange. Seven out of 10 patients in Europe also started on a Truvada-based backbone in 2015. Genvoya was launched in Europe in November. Similar to the U.S., we are seeing encouraging early product uptake in the six countries launched during the fourth quarter. A final comment on HIV is that the commercial organization is getting ready to execute the launches of R/F/TAF and F/TAF in the next months. Turning to other therapy areas, total revenue for products outside of HIV and HCV, which includes Zydelig, AmBisome, Cayston, Letairis, and Ranexa, totaled $1.9 billion in 2015 and grew 16% year over year. Over the last quarter, progress has been made in the area of cardiovascular disease. Since the inclusion of the AMBITION data in the Letairis label, we've seen a great deal of interest and engagement from the medical community. Revenue for the full year for Letairis reached $700 million, and market share for the products among patients initiating therapy is nearly 50%. In closing, Gilead had a remarkable 2015. The commercial organization's excited about the opportunities across all of Gilead's therapeutic areas, both in the near term and over the longer term, to help many more patients around the world. And I'll now turn the call over to Robin. Robin L. Washington - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to share full-year and fourth quarter 2015 financial results and provide 2016 guidance. For the fourth quarter, total revenues were $8.5 billion, up 16% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Net income for the quarter was $4.7 billion or $3.18 per diluted share, compared to $3.5 billion or $2.18 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $3.32 per share, up 37% compared to the fourth quarter 2014. Turning to fiscal year 2015, full-year total revenues were $32.6 billion, up 31% year over year. Net income for the year was $18.1 billion or $11.91 per diluted share, compared to $12.1 billion or $7.35 per diluted share for 2014. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $12.61 per share for the year, up 56% year over year. Product sales during the year were $32.2 billion, up 31% year over year. HCV product sales increased year over year to $19.1 billion, up 54%, and non-HCV product sales increased year over year to $13 billion, up 8%. The increase in HCV product sales for the year was primarily driven by sales of Harvoni, which launched in October 2014. Further, the annualized HCV growth-to-net estimate that was shared with you during the Q4 earnings call a year ago is on target and reflected in our 2015 results. Non-HCV product sales growth for the year was primarily driven by Stribild and Complera/Eviplera, partially offset by Atripla. Turning to expenses for the full year 2015, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $2.8 billion, up 10% compared to the prior year, reflecting the continued progression of our product pipeline. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $3.2 billion, up 17% compared to the prior year, driven by expenses to support our growth and geographic expansion. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the full year was 16.2%, which was lower compared to guidance, due to the permanent extension of the federal R&D credit that was passed in December. If you recall, the permanent extension of the credit was not included in 2015 guidance. Cash flows from operations were $20.3 billion for the full year 2015 and $4.9 billion for the fourth quarter. With respect to shareholder returns, $3.1 billion in cash was utilized to repurchase 29 million shares during the quarter, bringing total 2015 share repurchases to $10 billion and 95 million shares. Including the Q2 2015 warrant settlement of $3.9 billion, dividends, and share repurchases, Gilead has returned more than $15 billion in cash to shareholders in 2015. Earlier today, we announced an increase of the quarterly dividend from $0.43 per share to $0.47 per share, which will become effective in the second quarter of 2016, subject to a declaration by the board of directors. Additionally, the board authorized a new $12 billion share repurchase program to be initiated after the completion of the current $15 billion program, which, as of December 31, 2015, had $8 billion remaining. Also announced was the utilization of $5 billion of the current program to enter into an accelerated share repurchase agreement, which is expected to be completed in the next three months. This is in addition to the ongoing open market share repurchases that have continued under the current share repurchase program since January of this year. The increase in the dividend and increased level of share repurchases underscore the confidence of the board and management and the strength of the business and future cash flows. Since 2010, in addition to financing ongoing R&D programs and business development activities, more than 75% of free cash flows were returned to shareholders, and share count was reduced in excess of 20% while maintaining and improving investment-grade credit ratings, which Gilead values. Looking forward, the plan is to continue to return a significant component of free cash flows to shareholders via share repurchases and increases to our dividend over time. As in the past, there could be future periods of time when share repurchases are reduced due to acquisitions and other pipeline investments that are prioritized to drive future long-term growth. This strategy provides agility and financial flexibility to support R&D investments, as well as any future acquisitions or partnership opportunities we may consider. Finally, I would like to cover full-year 2016 non-GAAP financial guidance, summarized on slide 51 in the earnings presentation available on the Gilead website. Product sales are expected to be in the range of $30 billion to $31 billion. Guidance for product sales is subject to a number of uncertainties, including an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce HCV spending; volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; inaccuracy in HCV patient start estimates; additional competitive launches in HCV; an increase in discounts, chargebacks, and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; and a larger-than-anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments such as PHS, FFS, Medicaid, and the VA. Non-GAAP product gross margins are expected to be in the range of 88% to 90%. Non-GAAP R&D expenses are expected to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion as a result of the continued investment in our product pipeline. This includes the financial impact of the Galapagos collaboration, which closed in January. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion. This reflects an estimated $200 million increase for the U.S.-branded prescription drug fee. Please note that 2015 included a favorable adjustment of approximately $100 million based on the receipt of the 2015 invoice from the IRS. For the full year, the non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 18% to 20%. This includes the impact of the federal R&D tax credit, which was permanently extended at the end of 2015, and the increase for the U.S.-branded prescription drug fee, which is not tax deductible. Full-year diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related restructuring and stock-based compensation expenses is expected to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.16 per share. In closing, we are pleased with 2015 accomplishments across the organization. Thank you, and we look forward to updating you on our progress. Let's now open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open. Carter Gould - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, guys. This is Carter Gould on for Geoff. Congrats on the quarter. With regard to 2016 guidance, how should we think about the top line guidance and what that implies for any loosening of restrictions in the lower fibrosis score groups or any changes in net pricing? And if maybe that's a little more detail than you're ready to go into, maybe you can just frame how we should think about these levers in 2016 relative to 2015. Thank you. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : Okay. So I think I said in the script that we should anticipate in the United States that 2016 revenues should be more or less based on the second half of 2015, extrapolated for the year. I also mentioned that we had some lumpiness in the second half of the year due to the purchasing profile of the VA. And we anticipate that that will smooth out during the course of this year. I've also said numerous times before that in quarter one last year, we had a very large bulbous of warehoused patients being treated, which of course we're unlikely to see again. But to some extent, that gets substituted as the payers, commercial payers that are well known are beginning to loosen restrictions. So there's a few dynamics in the U.S., but I think the way that I would look at it is a fairly flat, stable, perhaps marginally growing number of patients flowing into treatment. If we see public payers stepping up, like Medicaids and perhaps the correctional facilities start treating more patients, then patient numbers could go higher than that in 2016. There's a few other factors which I also mentioned as we think about the revenue aspect as opposed to just patient numbers. The less sick patients, GT1 patients that qualify, are more likely to be using the eight-week Harvoni treatment duration. And of course, therefore revenue per patient would come down proportionately. Having said that, the offset is that budgets for treating patients go up, and we would like to think that more patients could be treated. So I think that's sort of the main things. I think from the competitive point of view, we feel very confident that our label is very strong and that we're very much supported by the real-world data we've seen since the launch of Harvoni with very high SVR rates and a very strong safety profile, at least as good if not better than the one that was used in our registrational trials. So I think we feel good about the year. The U.S. is fairly steady and possibly could even grow, as I said, if some restrictions are loosened and public payers step up. Around the world, as I mentioned, we expect patient numbers to grow in Europe. They've started to stabilize in the major markets now, again following more or less the shape of the curve in the U.S., where there was a large lump because of warehoused patients being treated initially. That is smoothing out now, and many of the smaller markets are now beginning to come onstream. And so we should see higher number of patients in Europe, but the same thing, we're likely to see more patients being treated with shorter durations. And as I also mentioned, we do have a number of price-volume agreements in place, which are deliberately incentivized to encourage higher volumes of patients being treated, but at a lower revenue per patient, if you like. So we should think about that. And then around the rest of the world, Japan, I mentioned very early days. We're still in that warehousing phase I think in Japan, although we're very pleased with the launch there so far. And then there are various other smaller markets around the world, and medium-sized markets, Australia being one of the medium-sized markets that are yet to launch yet. So we have plenty of patients around the world, but there are some other dynamics, as I said, around shorter treatment and of course the competitive situation. Carter Gould - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Volodymyr Nikolenko - Evercore ISI : Hi, guys. Thank you. It's actually Vlad Nikolenko on behalf of Mark Schoenebaum. I have a question about filgotinib specific JAK1 inhibitor, the one that you got from Galapagos. Just to hear your thoughts about testicular tox concerns on filgotinib, as well as whether your base case will be a 200 milligrams daily dose going forward in the years. And sort of somewhat related questions, what exactly impact on your 2016 guidance on R&D expenses from Galapagos collaboration? Thank you. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer : Yeah, so maybe I could answer the first few questions. So we were very excited about filgotinib because of the clinical profile. As you know, they have now data. Galapagos has generated data in RA and also Crohn's. Both of those have very remarkable efficacy. And also importantly, we think that filgotinib can be distinguished from competitors because of its safety profile, in particular the lack of hemoglobin decreases and very low infection rates. The other thing you asked about, the dose, that still needs to be negotiated with the FDA. We actually have a meeting coming up in the next couple of months where we will talk about, in detail, the Phase 3 program design, including the doses. So it's really, at this point, too early to say what the dose will be. Robin L. Washington - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : This is Robin to answer the second part of your question. We really have included, relative to the collaboration, some of the upfront milestone payments, as well as the cost associated with some of the Phase 3 trials that Norbert just spoke about. So we don't break it out in detail, but I would assume a couple of hundred million incremental to 2015 included in our guidance to support those projects. Volodymyr Nikolenko - Evercore ISI : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is now open. Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much for taking the question, and congrats to John Martin for an amazing 20 years at the helm here. So I have a big-picture question \u2013 seems like a good time to ask it, I guess, with the transition \u2013 is over the last two years, you've tripled your revenues, you've increased your earnings by about six fold over that period. The market seems to be discounting your ability to grow the business from here. Just wanted to see if you could maybe lay out a vision of the development of the various franchises that you have. You have lots going on in cancer. You've added to the inflammation franchise, you have TAF and 9883 in HIV. Just wondering if you could just maybe shine the light on how you visualize the growth out to say 2020, something like that? It would be really helpful to hear your thoughts. Thanks. John F. Milligan - President and Chief Operating Officer : Matt, this is John Milligan. I assume the question's for me, not the congratulatory one to John Martin. Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC : Whoever will take it. John F. Milligan - President and Chief Operating Officer : So whoever will take it. Well, I'll take it; I'd be happy to. So It's a really good question. So you're right, we've faced an extraordinary time when we've been able to triple revenue over the last couple of years, which is a very unusual thing for an organization to be able to do. And we're moving our pipeline along as fast as we can. And as we mentioned, there are some very interesting opportunities for us. So we do see very good opportunities in organic growth. I have great confidence in the HIV portfolio that with the three STRs we talked about on the call today and the other STR being developed by our partner, Janssen, that we'll have a very meaningful, continued growth of both patients and revenues in the future in HIV; I think that's a very important thing for us. We're continuing to accelerate HCV to bring sof/velpatasvir to market and try to work in more countries than we ever have before. So those are important initiatives on things that are current to market. We're very excited about filgotinib. I think there's great opportunities for us in inflammatory diseases. We haven't spoken about it very much about it in the past, and sort of quietly we've been investigating our MMP9 antibody, 5745, which we didn't talk about on this call, which now has positive data in three of the four indications we've looked at in inflammatory diseases, with a fourth under investigation. And so not only do we have filgotinib potentially for RA and inflammatory diseases, but we have an antibody which has a mechanism, which is very refractory to current care. It could be a good beginning to an inflammatory disease franchise. Of course, you mentioned the kinase inhibitors that we have for oncology. There's always the potential that those could be useful in various diseases in combination with filgotinib as well and we will explore that, although I still think the vast value of it is the fact that it's a very good-looking drug and some very positive data in Crohn's disease. So we are going down the pathway of inflammatory diseases by virtue of the successes we've had in our pipeline and successes in licensing. In oncology, Zydelig has been a good start for us. We really need to continue to try to ramp up our efforts in this area and to continue to broaden the areas we want to work in. It's pretty clear we have to do additional partnerships or find other avenues to broaden the revenue stream there for the future. And as Robin mentioned, with our balance sheet, we have the great flexibility of doing partnerships or acquisitions that could get us there. And so that would be an important consideration for us. That may not be the only avenue. We'd also look at other areas where we could bring in different programs, potentially accelerating to revenue as soon as possible in some of those areas when those things are available. And I'd say the environment has shifted dramatically in our favor for doing those sorts of partnerships and whatnot. So that's a good \u2013 2016, I believe, will be a good year for us, because of the strengths of the underlying business and the economic uncertainty that's driving the market today. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer : John, can I add something, maybe? John F. Milligan - President and Chief Operating Officer : Please. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer : I would like to reiterate what Robin said in her script. If you look back at the last six years, it has been remarkable. We have done many, many deals \u2013 CGI, Arresto, Calistoga, Pharmasset, Galapagos \u2013 and yet, we were able to return 70% out of free cash flow to shareholders. So I think that is a good way to think about the future, to in-license through collaborative efforts while at the same time returning money to shareholders. Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks, and my congrats to John Milligan as well. Looking forward to a new era. I wanted to ask a bit of a two-part question. One was you gave some guidance here, and remarkably like the last question, it actually looks like you're a little bit flattish or whatnot this year. Do you expect qualitatively to be growing over the next year? And, two, do you expect that this is a bit of trough revenue here? I just wanted to get your view on that. And, importantly, when you look at managed care \u2013 second part of the question \u2013 look at managed care, given that there's a new competitor on board, do you expect minimal to no changes or minimal changes in terms of access and things like that? Just given the new competition, can you talk a little about that? And there's a little bit of nervousness on how that may change things on the payer front. Thanks. John F. Milligan - President and Chief Operating Officer : Michael, it's John Milligan. First of all, thank you for the congratulations. Second of all, unfortunately, we can't tell you about revenue growth beyond \u2013 we have a lot of opportunities, but obviously we don't give 2017 or beyond guidance. In this business, you almost have to take things one year at a time, especially in hepatitis C as we understand the rate of diagnosis and patients coming into care, which is \u2013 there's great opportunity out there with a 1.5 million patients, as Paul mentioned, still being diagnosed but not yet under care. So really good opportunities for us. With regard to the competition coming to market, we have a very, very strong position. But I'm going to turn this over to Paul because he'd like to give you some of his thoughts on what the competitive landscape looks like versus Harvoni. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : Yeah, thanks, John. I mean, I think if we cast our minds back 12 months, we had the first competitor coming into the hepatitis C space. And I think the managed care view at that time was that these products were interchangeable and could be treated like commodities to some extent, which really triggered off the pricing and negotiations we saw in the early part of last year. That has been proven to be a totally incorrect view of the hepatitis C products. And what we've seen, fortunately with Harvoni in particular, is the real-world data has really strengthened its position and people's understanding of what that product does. It cures people with an incredibly high SVR rate, and the safety profile has been extremely good and in line, if not better, than its label. That hasn't been the case of competitor products so far. In fact, we've seen safety warnings added to labels, and we've seen a differentiation. And that's played out in the market. So I think, as we see a new competitor coming into the market now, payers are really thinking this through. There isn't any kind of instinctive reactions. People are being very thoughtful, and we notice because we have very close discussions with the managed care main players, and we're working with them as they think through this. And I think we feel pretty confident that we'll maintain a strong position as we enter 2016. Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my question, and I want to extend my congratulations to both Johns. I thought if I could just ask two related specific questions. So first, Paul, maybe \u2013 I just want to make sure I understand what you're trying to say with respect to U.S. HCV volumes. If we look at the two volumes and the numbers you've given us in the third and the fourth quarter, it's about 105,000 patients together, which is about 210,000 on a full-year basis, which is below the 236,000 you guys reported. And if I take the low end of the 47,000, which it sounds like you're saying is too low because of the VA from the fourth quarter, that's 188,000 annualized. So I just \u2013 if you can just give us some direction on \u2013 I'm sure you're not going to tell us a number \u2013 around those numbers, just so we're clear on exactly what you're trying to say. And then maybe related to that, can you specifically address where you think access is going to go from Medicaid in prisons this year? Thanks. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : Sure. So if you've got your pencil ready, these are the numbers that I think happened last year. In fact, I'll take you back even into quarter four 2014, where we think 46,000 HCV starts were in the market. This is total starts, by the way. In quarter one 2015, there were 72,000. That really was the peak of this warehoused patient part of the curve. Then drop down into quarter two of 65,000. There were still some of those warehoused patients coming through. And then quarter three was 62,000, and quarter four was 50,000. We know that in quarter three, a lot of patients were treated by the VA, who by the way seem to be incredibly efficient at getting patients into treatment. And we know that in quarter four, very few patients were initiated by the VA. So I think if you do the basic math on that, we'd get up to about 230,000-something, forecasting that forward into 2016 if you assume the VA picks up. Then I think this sort of merges into the second part of your question, which is what happens with Medicaid and other public payers who to date have really treated very, very few people. So our assumption is they're still not going to treat that many more patients this year, is the way we're thinking forward, but we are hopeful that that will be a trend that improves over time as people start to see how effective these drugs are and particularly the eight-week usage of Harvoni, which, as I've mentioned, in the real world seems to be incredibly effective and offers very good value. So that's how we're thinking about it. I hope that's clear. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Thank you, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions, and also my congrats to both John and John on a great run and a great opportunity. So wanted to ask about longer-term trends, the evolution of the HCV market. I know it's hard for everyone to get their hands around it, but you indicated again there are about 3 million HCV patients in the U.S. that have yet to be treated. About half of those are diagnosed. In terms of new patients that are entering the system, how similar or different are they from the existing patients or those that have already been cured in terms of I guess the overall motivation to be treated, fibrosis score, insurance coverage? We get a lot of questions on, are these future patients actually legitimate candidates in terms of being under the care of a doc, not IV drug users, et cetera. So can you just comment, try to give us a little bit more comfort on how we can be thinking about this longer term evolution in the U.S.? Thanks. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : So, Cory, I've mentioned before that we have some proprietary research that we do to try and monitor the flow of patients into treated care, and that means people who are diagnosed with hepatitis C and are registered with a hepatitis C prescriber. And that number has been remarkably consistent at around \u2013 we have actually three different sources of data, and it's around high 20,000s to 30,000 patients a month have been falling into that category. So they're diagnosed with HCV and they're registered with a treater. So if you do the math on that, clearly that's 360,000 patients coming into treatment a year, and we're seeing treatment levels a lot lower than that. What that speaks to is the types of patients are different amongst that 360,000 group, and their sort of pathway to actual treatment varies considerably. But there does appear, again doing the math and assuming the research is correct, that there is a line at the door of patients that still need to be treated and are accessible. I don't think those are the people that are, let's say out of society or these are people that are accessible, and for one reason or another reason, they haven't started treatment yet. But there's a strong flow of patients still out there, and I don't think we're anywhere near getting to the point where we're dealing with patients that are extremely difficult, let's say, to manage. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, and our next comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question, and let me add my congratulations to John Martin and John Milligan. John Milligan, a question for you. I found it interesting that in your prepared remarks, right after you were introduced, you mentioned that you wanted to take Gilead into therapeutic areas outside of antivirals. And I know in an answer to a prior question, you went through the assets you have in other areas. But I'm curious whether you're signaling a need for even more assets in those areas, and in particular, if you had a shopping list, which areas would be on the top of your list? John F. Milligan - President and Chief Operating Officer : So I mean, it's pretty clear we've done some great things in HIV and HCV, but for the company to grow, we have to work in other areas. That doesn't mean that we're not going to continue to work in hepatitis B, which is important to us, and there is the potential to cure that disease. We all recognize that is a hard thing to do, as well as curing HIV, which is an equally or harder thing to do, perhaps. So that does imply that we have to go outside of antivirals for continued growth, and we're interested in doing that as we've been hiring and growing with new things in our portfolio over a number of years. And I think I have some good core teams that can help us grow into those areas. And so the answer is yeah, we're very interested in acquiring assets through partnerships or potentially acquisition that could help us grow in those areas. And with the tripling of our revenue over the last few years, the need to do so sooner rather than later is heightened. That being said, we want to get the right assets at the right price. And so we have the flexibility certainly with our balance sheet, in the current business, to be patient to get things \u2013 to not be forced into doing something before we want to. And so we are looking in the area of oncology. We are looking at additional things in inflammatory diseases and things that are adjacent to there, to see what opportunities might fit within our portfolio, so that we can create a really strong franchise like we have in HIV and HCV with multiple options for success in those areas. Some of it will depend on what happens in our portfolio this year as we make progress with our MMP9 antibody or not. Obviously we're looking heavily in NASH with the FXR agonist. We're very interested in liver diseases, so that's a very important area for us, and we'll continue to try to bolster those to make sure that the company has the assets necessary to have the progress for the future. Is there a shopping list? There's always a list that you have in your mind or sometimes on paper. That's probably dangerous, so mine's in my mind, in which I think about things that would be important for us or things that could have the right opportunity at the right price. Whether or not those things ever come to fruition depends on a lot of factors. But clearly we're going to be very interested in taking a look this year. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC: And with the assets having sold off pretty aggressively in the public markets over the last several months, does that make things more attractive to you, or is it really about getting the right asset that's derisked and price is secondary? John F. Milligan - President and Chief Operating Officer : Well, it makes it more attractive, there's no question. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thanks for taking my question. Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes from Ying Huang of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. First one on maybe pricing trend. If my math is right, if you take about $5.6 billion you booked in second half, divided by about 112,000 patients, starting treatment, you're looking at roughly $50,000 per patient revenue in the U.S. in the second half of 2015. So now, with Merck's new drug they are launching in HCV, how should we think about pricing trend in the market in 2016? And then also I have a question about the diagnosis rate. Based on experience you have in the field, can you provide a little bit more color on the rate of newly diagnosed patients in HCV? Thanks. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : Well, maybe I'll talk about pricing first of all. I mean, I think everyone knows this, but it's really net prices that are the important number here for payers in the U.S. and indeed in Europe. So there seem to be over the last few days somewhat of misinformation or confusion around the WAC price and discounts. So we feel that our pricing is extremely competitive and offers very, very good value given the competitive set. And as I said earlier, payers in the U.S. this time around are taking a very much more thoughtful look at the labels and trying to make sure they do the right thing for their clients. And so we feel pretty strong and pretty confident in the solid basis, let's say, of our price in the U.S. market. And the second question was about HCV. Patrick O'Brien - Vice President, Investor Relations : Percentage of newly diagnosed patients. John F. Milligan - President and Chief Operating Officer : I think that's a hard thing to get at. We still see about 30,000 patients coming into care every month. So that's been an interesting metric for us, because more patients are coming into care than are being treated. We don't know how many are newly diagnosed and how many are coming out of the bucket of diagnosed patients. But it is interesting to note that our most recent data still suggests there's about 1.5 million patients diagnosed in America, which means that \u2013 and that was about 1.6 million when we launched Sovaldi. So that implies that there has been a refilling of that bucket, a replenishment, if you will. I don't know if buckets are the right way to think of it, but in this category of patient, as more patients are being diagnosed and working their way through the system. So we don't have a firm handle on the exact numbers, so that's the closest approximation I can give you. But it does suggest that there's a pretty good flow of patients who are now becoming aware and coming in to at least be diagnosed. We don't know the characterization of those patients. There was an earlier question about whether those are patients eligible for treatment, since many of the Medicaids are not treating many patients, and that's something we're trying to figure out right now. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer : And Ying, I may want to add that there's the CDC recommendation about general diagnosis. We have a number of projects in a number of American cities to look at subpopulations that we test, and we demonstrate that you can actually have fairly high diagnosis rates up, to 20% in some of these populations. And I think as people become aware of these things, I think the diagnosis will increase. That's our belief. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, Norbert. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Alethia Young of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And to both Johns, congrats on a great history and a great future. Two questions; they're sort of \u2013 one's quick. In Japan, can you just help us understand, like kind of think about this, whether it's a 12% or maybe perhaps the larger kind of 50% range of discount when it comes to what kind of a pricing discount will happen? And then also, just on Genvoya, I was just \u2013 and I saw Stribild was down a little bit in new start and total share. So I just wanted to understand if you think the total lion's share is coming from Stribild or do you think there's like some maybe Atripla kind of new starts or maybe switches coming in with the Genvoya launch? Thanks. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : Okay. Maybe I'll comment on Japan. We are fully aware of the new pricing regulation that's just been introduced in Japan. We are, let's say, highly confident that that will affect Harvoni and Sovaldi in Japan. We're not totally certain yet on the number or the timing of that, of that likely price cut, but we have factored that into our guidance. And the second question was on Stribild - John F. Milligan - President and Chief Operating Officer : And switches from Genvoya. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : And switches from Genvoya. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And Genvoya. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : Yeah, yeah. Well, Genvoya's got off to a really good start. We think that about 80% of the Genvoya business to date is from switches, and we think that the majority of those switches are actually from Stribild so far. So that probably accounts for the Stribild share number. We think, of the switches to Genvoya, about 10% of those switches so far have come from non-Gilead products. So we're pleased with the pace of switching, and we're pleased that we're also getting some incremental growth. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Abrahams of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC : Hi. My congratulations to John Martin on all your accomplishments as CEO and to John Milligan on your well-deserved new role. So a question related to the inflammatory franchise. Historically, you guys have had a lot of success developing and commercializing products with best-in-class features along efficacy, safety, and dosing that enable you to really dominate a space, such as an HIV and hep C. RA and inflammatory bowel diseases are a little bit different. They're a lot more crowded. Wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the ways you're thinking about conducting the development paths for drugs like filgotinib and 5745 to maximize differentiation. Perhaps maybe you could talk about combination opportunities there and how this ties into your long-term commercial strategy as you enter these new therapeutic areas. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer : Yeah, so, Brian, as I said before, we believe filgotinib by itself, if you compare it with other JAK inhibitors, is a very valuable franchise. It has a good efficacy, and it could have safety advantages. And I'm saying it could have because I'm making cross-study comparisons, so until we do a large Phase 3 program, we don't really know that for certain. But then as you pointed out, where we have to work fairly quickly want to go with filgotinib is in combination therapy. We believe that in inflammatory bowel disease and also RA, there's a huge unmet need still. If you look at some of the ACR20 responses, they're up to 80% but ACR70s are only in the teens or 20% at most. So that means there's a huge improvement left to be done, and that, we believe, could be done with combination therapies. We're going to go ahead and combine our JAK inhibitor with our MMP9. That's going to be the first thing. And afterwards also possibly with the SYK compounds and the BTK inhibitors. That's where we think we could have a big impact on the future of the treatment of inflammatory conditions. Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, Norbert. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Skorney of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question, and my congratulations too to John and John. Just two, I guess. I guess the first question is in terms of Japanese sales, I understand there's a government-mandated price cut given the revenue that Sovaldi and Harvoni are generating. Could you just walk us through how that flows as of Jan. 1? And can you give us a scale of what we should expect for the price cut? And then just to dig down a little more on Merck's pricing and how it impacts you guys, I think we were all surprised by the quickness in the gross-to-net discounts that AbbVie and you had applied for the initial launches. I guess the question is, Merck clearly is going to take a pretty substantial discount versus what you guys have out. Are you at a point where you're comfortable enough in the profile that you're drawing a line in the sand to say you're essentially not going to be discounting anymore? Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : Let me start by talking about Japan, Brian. We're not going to say what our assumption is around the tax outcome. I mean, I think I already said before, we understand the rules. It's pretty clear what the range is. And we're going to be somewhere in that range, and we're also not sure exactly the timing of that. But we've built an assumption into our guidance that we've given, and I can't really comment further on that at this point. Then on the gross-to-net, I mean, I think your question is, are we confident enough to walk away? And I think the answer is yes, we are. But we're hopeful that our close discussions with payers and the strength of our label and the strength of the \u2013 sorry, the relative strength of our label as compared to the competitors, and of course this enormous wealth of real-world data that we've got gives us a position where we sincerely hope the right thing is done for patients and patients get access to our medicines. So I think that's the way we think about it. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer : And, Brian, other than the costs of drug, you should also consider of course the cost of treatment. There is a genotype required for genotype 1a, the resistance test will cost about $700, and incurs some time delay. There's tests for ALTs at eight weeks and at 12 weeks if you have to dose for 16 weeks. And also, it's possible that \u2013 well, a fairly significant number of the genotype 1a patients, and you know those are 50% in U.S., they will require 16 weeks with ribavirin. So that's not \u2013 it's more than \u2013 it increases the treatment cost proportionally compared to 12 weeks or eight weeks in our case with Harvoni. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : But I think the good news, just to reemphasize, is that the payers across the United States are being very cognizant of this and thinking carefully. The full implications and not being dazzled by the headlines of a low WAC price. Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got you. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Our final question comes from the line of Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I have two, because I'm guessing you might not want to answer the first one. But just for Robin on capital allocation, you mentioned 77% of free cash flow returned from 2010 through 2015. As you look forward, do you guys have a target payout ratio in mind? And then the second one was just on EU hep C patient volumes in 2016. Paul, you gave us a lot of context for U.S., but maybe just if you could be a little bit more specific in terms of actually thinking about volumes in Europe? Thanks. Robin L. Washington - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Terence. I'll take the first one. You're right, I'm not going give a specific number. And as I mentioned on the call, I think it varies based on the other investments we're making, and the numbers we gave you were on average. There have been periods where we've been higher and periods we've been lower. But by using the word \"substantial,\" I think you can assume it to remain significant, but it could vary year to year is how I'd look at it. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : And on the EU volumes, we estimated that in \u2013 the EU, I should say, so the 28 countries of the EU where the product's been launched so far in 2015, around about 140,000 patients in total were treated. We have a slightly lower market share in Europe than we do in the U.S., and that's because of payer-type arrangements that our competitor have got in place. The range of market shares ranges from 70% to 90%, but I would say the average would be about 80%, of that 140,000. All of the main countries, the big countries in Europe, have now gone through their sort of warehoused point of the launch trajectory or the patient flow and are getting into more stable patient flows, but are growing. So I think that's my main point. We anticipate higher numbers of patients in 2016 over 2015. Countries like the UK really didn't treat very many patients at all so far, but they are now beginning to ramp up. And then some of the smaller countries \u2013 Netherlands, Austria \u2013 are beginning to grow patient numbers. Having said that, I also mentioned earlier price-volume agreements. These are set up to try and encourage more patients being treated. But obviously, the flip side to those arrangements is that the price per patient comes down and there's better value to treat more patients. The other thing, I think, is the real-world data with eight weeks of Harvoni treatment. It looks stronger and stronger and is more convincing to European payers. And therefore, they will also use that opportunity to try and treat more patients, but of course, at a lower revenue per patient. Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks. Patrick O'Brien - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thank you, Candace, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead, and the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on our future progress. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patrick O'Brien - Senior Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, Candace, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, a press release was issued with earnings results for the first quarter of 2016. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website. Joining today's call will be : John Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Paul Carter, Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations; and Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer Before we begin formal remarks, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections, and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website. I will now turn the call over to John. John F. Milligan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Patrick, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. While we want to keep our remarks relatively brief to allow plenty of time for your questions, I do want to make a few comments about the first few months of 2016 and what I see as the outlook for the rest of the year. Gilead's HIV franchise is off to a great start with the recent U.S. FDA approvals of Odefsey and Descovy, which followed the approval of Genvoya late last year. Over the last six months, I've had the opportunity to talk with physicians and patients about the importance of having highly effective and safer options, especially for patients facing a lifetime of therapy. With the approval of our three new regimens, we are now able to offer a range of options to address the diverse medical requirements of people with HIV, including those new to treatment, those who have been on therapy for a long time and have run short of options, and those who desire to switch medications for a variety of reasons. Since 2001, Gilead therapies have played a transformative role in changing HIV infection from a fatal and debilitating disease into a chronic and manageable condition. That's true around the world, as broader access to HIV treatment has helped avert millions of AIDS deaths. Innovation remains important in the continuing fight against HIV, and we're proud that Descovy is the first new backbone approved by the FDA in more than a decade. Gilead continues its commitment to helping HIV patients around the globe with our research and development activities, including novel agents for daily treatment, long-acting regimens, and HIV cure. In liver disease, we just wrapped up an exciting week in Barcelona at the International Liver Conference, or EASL [European Association for the Study of the Liver], as it's known. It was a remarkable meeting, especially considering the significant change in the HCV treatment landscape since the conference was held last in Spain four years ago. The outlook for patients has completely changed, with dramatic improvements in cure rates for a wider range of patients. Presentations at EASL included results from several Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies evaluating sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir plus GS-9857. These are two investigational pan-genotypic fixed-dose combination therapies for the treatment of HCV. The data presented continues to underscore the high cure rates and safety of our sofosbuvir-based therapies and support their utility across all HCV patient genotypes and a wide range of disease stages. Data were also presented on the use of TAF for patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. Forty-eight week results from two Phase 3 studies demonstrate its potential to advance the treatment of HCV, offering a similar efficacy profile to Viread with improved bone and renal safety parameters. Based on these results, we submitted a New Drug Application for TAF, and FDA has set a PDUFA date of November 11. We also submitted regulatory applications for TAF in the European Union and Japan last quarter. I'm particularly encouraged by the work that's going on in NASH, which we've augmented with our agreement to acquire the Nimbus Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase, or ACC program, as was announced last month. NASH affects up to 15 million people in the U.S., and is expected to become the leading indication for liver transplantation by 2020. Including the ACC program, Gilead has four investigational compounds that target unique disease pathways, including production of lipids, inflammation, and fibrosis, each of which are thought to contribute to or cause NASH. Data at EASL were presented supporting the development of Gilead's investigational agents for the treatment of NASH, including: simtuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that is selective for LOXL2, which is also being evaluated in primary sclerosing cholangitis : GS-4997, an ASK-1 inhibitor; and GS-9674, an FXR agonist. Nimbus also presented positive Phase 1 data for the program's lead candidate, NDI-010976, which targets ACC, a key step in lipid biosynthesis pathway. Overall, I'm enthusiastic about the future of Gilead and excited to have opportunity to help build on the company's long history of success. Over the past few months, I've had conversations with external stakeholders and employees across all parts of our organization. It's gratifying to see the extent to which Gilead's products and commitment to access have uniquely changed the course of diseases for so many people throughout the world. We now have the opportunity to do so again in many new areas. A few things stood out from those conversations; first, physicians and patients share the excitement that our medical and commercial teams have regarding Gilead's new treatment options for HCV and HIV, particularly the new TAF-based therapies. Access continues to improve for people with HCV around the world. And in fact, we have treated close to 1 million patients with Sovaldi-based regimens since Sovaldi was first approved in late 2013. That's a remarkable achievement in just over two years. With regards to HIV, as many of you are aware, TAF was added to the medicines patent pool and to our various access programs. The clinical data suggests TAF-based regimens may be the best option in both the developed and developing world. We will build on the success we've had with the TDF-based regimens, now used by nearly 10 million people every single day, to make TAF regimens successful around the world, providing much-needed new options. Secondly, I believe we have a rich pipeline, creating opportunities that may allow the transformation of the treatment of many diseases like NASH, HBV, inflammatory diseases, certain cancers, and cardiovascular conditions for which few, if any, options exist. We are committed to building on our company's long history of success, and I'm confident that our innovation and our hard work will deliver on our shared goal of delivering new treatments and providing broad access to Gilead's medicines for patients in need. Finally, we continue to look for business development opportunities that add to our core therapeutic areas and are a fit with Gilead's expertise and capabilities. We are actively assessing options and will make moves when the right opportunities present themselves. I will now turn the call over to Robin, who will provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter. Robin will be followed by Paul, who will provide additional color on the company's performance across products and geographies. Robin L. Washington - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report our first quarter results, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.03 per share compared to $2.94 for the same period last year. Total revenues for the quarter were $7.8 billion, up 3% year over year and down 8% sequentially. Product sales for the quarter were $7.7 billion, up 4% year over year and down 9% sequentially. Starting with HIV and other antivirals, product sales for the first quarter increased to $2.9 billion, up 19% year over year, primarily driven by increased sales in the U.S. We continue to see start strong uptake of our newer single-tablet regimens, including Genvoya, which was launched in November of 2015. Additionally, year over year, Stribild and Complera grew 34% and 19% respectively. Sequentially, these sales decreased 4%, primarily driven by sub-wholesaler inventory decreases in the U.S., reflective of the seasonal inventory pattern from quarter four to quarter one. HCV product sales for the first quarter decreased 6% year over year to $4.3 billion, primarily driven by a decrease in Harvoni sales in the U.S., which was partially offset by the launch of our HCV products in Japan and other international markets. In the U.S., the year-over-year Harvoni sales decline was driven by lower patient starts and the full quarter impact of higher commercial rebates, which were entered into during the first quarter of 2015. Sequentially, HCV product sales decreased 12%, primarily driven by revenue declines in the U.S. in Japan. In the U.S., the decline was due to the increase in discounts required to open up access to patients with lower fibrosis scores and a modest shift in payer mix toward more deeply discounted government payer segments. In addition, revenue was further impacted by higher than expected prior-quarter rebate claims. Rebate claims come in one to two quarters in arrears and were updated in Q1 to reflect the higher claims received. In Japan, Sovaldi volumes declined from high early launch levels, similar to other markets. And channel inventory pricing for Sovaldi and Harvoni was adjusted during March for the mandatory price reduction, effective as of April 1. Turning to our other therapeutic areas, product sales of cardiovascular, respiratory, and other were $498 million, up 19% year over year and down 5% sequentially. Moving to gross margin, non-GAAP product gross margin was 87.2% for the first quarter of 2016 compared to 90.9% for the same period last year. The decrease reflects a $200 million charge or $0.12 earnings per share related to the jury verdict in the Merck trial in March. Although the proceedings in the Merck trial are not complete and the losing party will appeal once the court enters judgment, we booked the charge to comply with accounting rules related to contingencies. Now turning to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $769 million for the first quarter, up 18% compared to the same period last year, due to the continued progression of clinical studies, particularly in liver disease and HIV. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $638 million for the first quarter, up 6% compared to the same period last year. These expenses increased primarily due to higher costs to support the growth of Gilead's business and were offset by favorable adjustments related to the Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $191 million following receipt of the preliminary 2016 IRS invoice. From a balance sheet perspective, during the first quarter we generated cash flows from operations of $3.9 billion, and ended the quarter with $21.3 billion in cash and investments. We continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. Earlier this afternoon, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.47 per share for the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 10% from the prior quarter. $8 billion in cash was utilized to repurchase shares of our common stock during the quarter, consisting of $3 billion of open market repurchases or 33.4 million shares and $5 billion under the accelerated share repurchase program ASR that we announced in February. 46.1 million shares were repurchased under this program during the quarter. The final settlement of the ASR program was completed earlier this month, and we received an additional 8.1 million shares. In total, 54.3 million shares were retired under the ASR program at an average price of $92.09 per share. As of March 31, the amount of capital returned to shareholders, consisting of dividends and share repurchases, exceeded the total amount of capital returned during the first three quarters of 2015 combined. During the quarter, we completed the $15 billion share repurchase program approved by our board in January 2015, and as of April 1 have begun repurchasing shares under our $12 billion 2016 share repurchase program approved in January of this year. Since 2012, we've repurchased over 260 million shares, or 17% of shares outstanding. Finally, we are reiterating our full-year 2016 guidance provided to you on February 2 and summarized on slide 25 in the earnings results presentation available on our corporate website. As a reminder, guidance for product sales is subject to a number of uncertainties, including: an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce HCV spending; volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; inaccuracies in HCV patient start estimates; additional competitive launches in HCV; an increase in discounts, chargebacks, and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; and a larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments such as PHS, FFS, Medicaid, and the VA. I will now turn the call over to Paul to provide more details on our commercial results for the quarter. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : Thanks, Robin, and good afternoon, everyone. Our commercial performance remained strong through the first quarter. I'd like to start with HIV and Genvoya, the first of our TAF-based single-tablet regimens. We're pleased with the launch of Genvoya both in the U.S. and in the European markets where we've achieved reimbursement. Starting with the U.S., through five months post the launch of Genvoya, cumulative prescriptions were twofold more than any HIV product from any company since Atripla, which was the first single-tablet regimen to come to market back in 2006. As expected, most of Genvoya's initial prescriptions came from switches. Qualitative feedback from HIV prescribers is very encouraging and indicating a clear intent to switch patients at the earliest opportunity. Stribild and Complera showed strong year-over-year prescription growth, at 18% and 5% respectively, and in quarter four 2015 Stribild was the leading product in the U.S. for patients naive to treatment. With the launches of Genvoya and now just very recently Odefsey, we expect switches out of TDF-based single-tablet regimens into the TAF regimens to grow significantly. In fact, 82% of Genvoya's prescriptions have been switches. 49% of the switches have come from Stribild. We are seeing an improvement in our ability to retain switch patients, meaning fewer patients who switch from Gilead TDF-containing regimens move to non-Gilead products. Of all the patients who switch to Genvoya, 91% came from a Gilead regimen and 9% came from a non-Gilead product. In addition to switches, preliminary quarter one 2016 data indicate to us that Genvoya may soon be among the most prescribed products of patients new to treatment. Historically in quarter one, we've seen a decrease in sub-wholesaler inventories following a buildup in the prior quarter. We observed this effect again this year, leading to a sequential decrease in HIV product sales. Finally, in the U.S., I'd like to highlight the growing use of Truvada for PrEP, which was more than 20% of Truvada demand last quarter and drove 17% year-on-year growth in prescriptions. Turning to Europe, we're also pleased with the way that our HIV business is performing, with successful reimbursement and launches of Genvoya in several countries, including Germany and the Nordics. In other countries, Stribild and Eviplera continue to replace Atripla. Stribild remains the most prescribed regimen for patients naive to treatment in the EU, with Eviplera in third place. Genvoya was launched in Germany during quarter one. And at the end of the quarter, preliminary data indicate that it had the leading market share for both naive and switch patients. The product was launched and fully reimbursed in Spain just two weeks ago, and we're very excited about the opportunity to offer providers another important option to address the needs of their patients. It's also been recognized as a preferred regimen in numerous country guidelines, including Germany, Spain, and Italy, even before reimbursement has been agreed. This is testament to the favorable clinical profile of Genvoya, a single-tablet regimen that better addresses the needs of patients who require long-term chronic therapy. We're working hard to negotiate timely reimbursement across the rest of the European markets. Finally on HIV, we launched Descovy this month in the U.S. and the EU. We see this launch as a milestone in HIV treatment, as Descovy is the first new NRTI backbone since Truvada 10 years ago. Given the very high use of Truvada as a preferred backbone with multiple third agents, including Tivicay, we're confident that Descovy will quickly replace Truvada and become the leading HIV regimen backbone in all our markets. Now moving to hepatitis C, we continue d to see revenue dynamics around the world which vary by country. As Robin noted, our overall HCV product revenue decreased 6% year over year and 12% sequentially. I'll now describe the different dynamics by geographic region. Starting with the U.S. market, we've seen an increase of new patients in the first quarter, offset by lower revenue per patient due to several factors that include an increase in our gross-to-net adjustments as well as a shortening average duration of therapy. Total market patient starts increased around 10% over Q4 to an estimated 55,000 in Q1. This was primarily driven by the continued opening of access across payer segments to allow for the treatment of patients with lower fibrosis scores as well as an increase in treatment by the VA during the second half of the quarter, as funding made its way to the various VA sites. The revenue associated with this increase in patient starts was partially offset by an increase in discounts associated with our contract agreements entered into during the first quarter of 2015, which provide for additional discounts if access is provided to a broader patient population. We also saw a gradual shift to more deeply discounted payer segments such as VA, PHS, and Medicaid compared to the prior quarter. In addition, revenue was further impacted by higher than expected prior-quarter rebate claims, which come in one to two quarters in arrears and were updated in quarter one to reflect the higher claims received. The average duration of therapy has shortened, as fewer patients require 24 weeks of treatment and a higher proportion of genotype 1 patients are treated for eight weeks, resulting in slightly lower revenues per patient. The ability to treat for eight weeks notably is a strong competitive differentiation. In fact, our market share remained strong, with more than 90% of all patients treated in the quarter being prescribed either Harvoni or Sovaldi. Qualitative feedback suggests that prescribing HCV physicians are encouraged by the fact that real-world outcomes mimic the experience in clinical trials. Several presentations of real-world data at EASL reinforce what has been seen in clinical practice. As we think about the rest of the year in the U.S., patient flow peaked in quarter one 2015, then declined in quarter two, and stabilized in quarter three and quarter four of 2015. In quarter one of 2016, there was an uptick in new patient starts. Our data show that 25,000 to 30,000 patients a month are entering treated care, which exceeds the number of patients starting therapy on a monthly basis. That means there were many more people who could benefit from treatment who are already linked to care. We expect new patient starts to remain consistent through the rest of 2016. Despite the number of patients treated to date, there are still over 3 million patients in the U.S. who have yet to be treated. About half of these patients are undiagnosed. Education and awareness efforts to increase rates of diagnosis are important. And as we well know from public health efforts in the HIV area, these efforts play out over many years. We're encouraged to see data that screening and diagnosis rates have increased at least twofold over the last five years. Now turning to Europe, total HCV revenue in Europe was down 13% year over year and down 1% sequentially. While overall Gilead patient starts increased 5% sequentially to around 31,000 in the quarter, average revenue per patient declined due to a shift in geographic mix and shorter average treatment duration. We also saw a negative foreign exchange movement, which affected HCV revenues by about 8% year on year and 3% sequentially. The mix of sales in the EU is such that more patients are now being treated in countries which have lower net prices per patient. European countries continue to vary significantly in terms of patient access, with many still limiting treatment to patients with high fibrosis scores. We anticipate that as sicker patients are treated, these restrictions will start to loosen, as healthier patients can be cared for within existing budgets. Again, as in the U.S., we treat just a small fraction of patients diagnosed. We are encouraged by ongoing efforts and commitments by governments to increase diagnosis and treatment across Europe. Now moving to Japan, revenue was over $1 billion during the quarter. We're pleased with the successful launches of Sovaldi and Harvoni, where a strong patient flow and high market shares continued through quarter one. More than 30,000 patients were treated with Gilead products during the quarter, representing a market share greater than 90%. Other markets where we recently launched our HCV products include Australia, where nearly 5,000 patients started treatment in Q1. This reflects a strong commitment by the Australian government to address their HCV burden and the usual warehousing of patients prior to the launch of sofosbuvir-based regimens. In closing, our underlying HCV business is strong and sustainable. We've treated around 700,000 patients in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. And despite strong competition, Gilead has maintained high market shares in all regions. The Gilead commercial organization is focused on executing our numerous HIV and HCV product launches across multiple geographies during the remainder of the year. In addition to our three TAF-based HIV products, we're preparing to launch our pan-genotypic HCV product as early as next quarter in the U.S. Thank you, and now let's open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. It seems like lower revenue per patient was one of the bigger contributors to the sequential trends, so a couple questions. What's the initial outlook for higher volumes coming from commercial patients just with respect to broader access for F0 and F1? And then was the volume contribution this quarter pretty meaningful from the VA system? I just want to get a sense for the sequential trends there too. Thanks. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : Hi, Geoff. So several things happened in the quarter in relation to volume and revenue per patient, so maybe I'll try and deal with all of them. So the first thing, as you said, we had, and we expected this and hoped for it, that several of the large commercial payers opened up access to patients regardless of their fibrosis scores during quarter one. The consequence of that was that they triggered discounts that had been previously negotiated in order to incentivize that opening up of restrictions. So that was the first thing. And then the VA, as you know, treated very few patients in quarter four last year because of lack of funding. That funding was agreed for a two-year period and focused on HCV medicines, and was clarified late December. Then the VA went through a process of evaluating the clinical evaluation of product available from not just us, but obviously new entrants to the market. And that process took through till mid to late January. And we had to negotiate with the VA, and we did give the VA some extra discounts, which resulted in them putting our products on their formulary and also opening up, again, access to all patients within the VA. So there were no restrictions on patients. And again, we see this as a large positive. And as that funding got distributed around the VA centers, we started to see a very large uptick in VA treatment from about the middle of the quarter, and we anticipate that that will continue through the year. The second area that happened, of course, is we had the entrance of Merck into the market, and so we judiciously exercised our contractual right to preserve access. And in a few cases, we did increase a little bit of discount to some payers to ensure that Harvoni in particular remained on formularies and with full access. The third thing I think we've seen, as I indicated in the comments, was a slight and gradual shift of payer mix away from the commercial and Medicare Part D payers towards the more government payers, and that was probably about a 10% shift from quarter four to quarter one. And then the final piece, as we indicated, is we did have a catch-up, a true-up of some rebate claims that came in respect to quarter three and quarter four that were a little bit higher than we estimated last quarter and which we put right during quarter one. So that really is the dynamic between volumes and revenue per patient. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot, Paul. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys. By the way, John, I really enjoyed your opening comments. Everyone is very focused on what you're going to do with your cash, BD, M&A. So I have actually one simple question probably for John. Would you be willing to go hostile? And if not, why not? How do you feel about that? Because clearly what we're hearing is that the small companies won't engage right now because they don't like the valuations, but the large companies are very interested. Thank you. John F. Milligan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Mark. It's John. Mergers and acquisitions are always a process, and so the ability to go hostile is limited by how much data or how much cooperation you need. And so in each situation, you'd have to think about what do I need to know about the pipeline or about things that are not public about a company in order to be comfortable making a public offer for the company. But that being said, we've never declared ourselves unwilling to go hostile. I do prefer a friendly process, but it would just depend on the situation itself. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Leerink Partners. Your line is now open. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks very much and, John, welcome to leading your first call completely. I guess to follow up on that question, you've invested it looks like about $19 billion or $20 billion over the last year reducing your share count. The share count has come down by about 10%, but your EPS is pretty much flat, maybe up low single digits versus last year. Are you convinced that that's the best use of your capital? You've got $21 billion in cash and about the same amount of debt. So are you going to revisit that, or is that more or less the path that you believe generates the best returns here? John F. Milligan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Geoff, I think that was directed at me, but I'm going to let Robin answer the first part of the question. Robin L. Washington - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Geoff. It's Robin. I think as we said all along, we look at how we leverage our cash as not only being share repurchases and dividends, but also we consistently look at investing in our core pipeline as well as M&A where appropriate. And similar to the amounts that you called out relative to cash, it's actually about a 17% reduction in share count, as I mentioned on the call. We have done a lot of M&A as well. And I think we'll continue to do that, as John said, when the right opportunities present themselves. So I think we've always been fairly clear that we're balancing doing all of those things, and we have purposely focused on share repurchases because in the absence of M&A it allows us to be flexible and more opportunistic. But when the right M&A opportunities present themselves, it allows us to reduce our share repurchases in order to make those necessary acquisitions and leverage our cash and debt and borrowing if we need to. John F. Milligan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: For us it's fairly simple. We have the flexibility to do both things; that is, return shareholder value through stock repurchases and dividends and of course continue to be opportunistic in M&A. How we're deploying it is a reflection of the things we're interested in. I think, for example, the Nimbus acquisition, while relatively small, could bring a very, very unique product to us and something that we had focused on during the quarter. We're continuing to look for opportunities like that, and we will continue to aggressively look for opportunities to deploy our cash in investing in things other than Gilead. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay, thanks. I'll get back in the queue. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to revisit some questions that you were talking about related to price and volume. You did mention on the positive that net new patient starts were up about 10%, which is great. But then the total revenues in the U.S. declined by 11%. So someone could do the math and imply that price was down 10% to 20%. Can you comment on that or maybe just describe where you think the price/volume equation was in the quarter and how we should think about net price changing quarter over quarter and how that should change over the year? Thanks. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : Mike, I think we are in a much more stable place than we were one year ago at this time. I think I described it just now. We've made some contractual moves which have opened up access. We're very happy about that. We're happy that some of the government payers are beginning to treat a few people. We're very happy about the VA in particular ramping up its treatment levels. I said that we've had to compete in the VA, and we did that, but we're enjoying very high market shares wherever physicians have the choice of prescribing. And that's always been our aim, to make sure that physicians and patients can choose what drug they think is appropriate. And wherever that's the case, Gilead seems to do pretty well. So I would say looking forward, we're in a fairly stable place now. Clearly, over time as competition increases, prices are likely to incrementally move in one direction, I would think. But I think we're stable. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So on one side we're getting lots of access, but on the other side my math is not totally off, just to be fair. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : Correct. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Going back to the strategic theme, you've talked in the past about wanting to be a leader in oncology. But given the issues you've had with Zydelig and the leadership changes you've also had, are you as committed to that space as you once were? And if so, what's your thought on the potential opportunities you see out there between solid tumors and Heme/Onc [Hematology/Oncology]? Thanks. John F. Milligan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Cory, it's John. That's of course a big question. So if you think about where we are in our oncology portfolio, we have been focused heavily on a number of activities around these kinase inhibitors and how that actually behind Zydelig a number of opportunities are moving in the clinic, including our SYK inhibitor, our BTK inhibitor. I should probably let Norbert go on about this, but I would say we have numerous opportunities that we're continuing to pursue. You had mentioned we want to be a leader in oncology. We think of oncology as one leg of a future company that could be important to us along with our investments in NASH and inflammatory diseases. We do see some good opportunities out there and we see some good opportunities internally. So the Zydelig setback hasn't changed our appetite for trying to do more transformative things in oncology. It was never going to be a franchise product like Viread or sofosbuvir but was a good beginning for us, and I really haven't changed my thought process around it as a result of the setback because of the toxicities we've seen. Norbert, do you want to add anything to that? Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer : No. As John said, Zydelig has not only not decreased our appetite, it has increased our appetite to do more in oncology. And we're now at a point where a number of programs are coming to fruition. For instance, momelotinib we're intending to file early next year. The Phase 3 studies are fully enrolled. We should get results at the end of this year. The anti-MMP9 antibody is in Phase 3 for colorectal cancer. We're at the end of dose-ranging with combinations of PI3K, SYK, and SYK/BTK, and that will move into front-line treatment. So we have a number of interesting things ongoing internally. And of course, like John said, we're continuously looking externally at finding suitable opportunities. And if the right opportunity comes along, then we will take advantage of it. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Abrahams of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about hep C diagnostic initiatives and maybe some of the pull-throughs that you're seeing or might expect to see on patient identification. And I'm particularly curious if you have a sense among the growing number of new patient starts, who may have been identified last year and are now getting access with fewer restrictions versus patients who are getting identified this year and coming onto treater care concurrently? Thanks. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : Should I comment on that, John, maybe? So it's actually very hard to tell when people have been diagnosed and who's been treated when. Anecdotally, I can tell you, and I was out visiting some doctors in California just last week. Patients are \u2013 there are plenty of patients there. There are many people who are linked to care now. And with the fibrosis restrictions being dropped now, most physicians can treat \u2013 certainly in the commercial area and Medicare area, can treat whoever they want. One thing is clear though that there are still prior authorizations in place and there's still a fair amount of office paperwork and bureaucracy that have to be put in place for each patient. Then there are the patients themselves, many of whom just simply aren't quite mentally ready or psychologically ready to commit to that disciplined eight-week or 12-week treatment. And with these products, of course, insurance companies aren't keen to do it twice. They want to try and get it right the first time, the doctors want to get it right the first time, and the patients want to get it right the first time. So we're seeing that some of the delays in patients starting has to do with the patient just being ready to commit to a disciplined eight or 12 weeks of patients. On the diagnosis side, again anecdotally, we just know that there are a lot of activities going on. A lot of people are telling us what's going on around the countryside, and we do see diagnosis rates increasing significantly. So I think there are plenty of patients being diagnosed and there are plenty of patients coming into treatment and there's a waiting list of patients at most offices. By the way, our estimate on diagnosis is about 200,000 new diagnoses happened in the U.S. last year. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer : Brian, I might want to add that we have a number of demonstration projects ongoing in the United States to look for places, institutions, populations and figure out what the diagnosis positivity would be. And it's surprising, we've identified some places like ER rooms that have seropositivity rates of greater than 10%. We hope that those demonstration projects will then lead to a broader recognition of the value of diagnosis and identification of hepatitis C in infected individuals. Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney of Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess two quick ones. I know we talked a little bit about this at EASL, John, but just first on the timeline in terms of when you think you can get sofosbuvir [sof]-based regimens approved in China, how you think about pricing that there to capture share of patients who are looking at a branded drug versus potentially penetrating further in. And then just on the U.S., have you guys heard anything in terms of a warehouse build in genotype 3 ahead of a sof/vel [velpatasvir] launch? Should we be expecting a small bolus of patients upon that approval? John F. Milligan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, Brian, I'll start with the China question. So in terms of timing for China, there is a fairly fixed process. And according to the recent processes, we could possibly have sofosbuvir on the market in 2017. As you may have seen, there are new \u2013 the Chinese government is working hard to try to accelerate review and approval of HCV drugs because currently none are on the market of the direct-acting antivirals, and that could help us accelerate the timelines into China, and we are working on that. Particularly of interest to us would be accelerating the timeline for sof/velpatasvir because there are so many different genotypes in China. Genotyping is not common in China, and this could provide a very good option for the people of China. So there's hope, but we can't guarantee of course that we can accelerate that approval beyond its current timeline, which is 2019. The Chinese market is fairly large. Between 10 million and 20 million people are thought to have HCV. I don't want to get into public discussions of pricing, but I do think there's a price/volume relationship that would work for us and for the Chinese health system that could be very, very good for us both. And so that's what we're working towards is access in China. Your second question was on warehousing for genotype 3 patients. Currently a lot of genotype 3 patients are being treated with sof in combination with daclatasvir. And so there seems to be fairly decent access for that. So I'm looking at Paul. I don't think there's any real warehousing going on, but maybe you're more aware of it than I am. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : About 7% or 8% of the U.S. HCV epidemiology is genotype 3. We don't have any data on it, but certainly we get \u2013 I'm getting the impression from my team anecdotally there is a little bit of warehousing, but not least because sofosbuvir/daclatasvir is a very expensive regimen. And the hope is that the cost of the genotype 3 treatment will come down somewhat after sof/vel comes onto the market, which is the PDUFA date is June 28, so people are thinking about that. So we're optimistic. Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, a few questions on Japan. I know you said that there was some change in pricing because of the April 1 price declines during the quarter. What other dynamics were going on in Japan during this quarter? Where do you think you are in treating the bolus in Japan? How much longer could that go? And then separately, I believe that there are price discounts that come in with a certain volume being reached. Are we right to assume that those could be hit in July? And what kind of dynamics do you expect to see in the Japanese market going forward? Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : So we're very, very pleased with the execution of our launches in Japan. In terms of patient flow, the genotype 2 patients, which represent about 20% of the Japanese epidemiology in HCV, are beginning to stabilize now. So those are the patients being treated with Sovaldi. Those numbers \u2013 we launched on May 25 last year. We initially had a bolus and then those numbers came down through quarter four. And quarter one is at a lower level than quarter four, but we're seeing a stable flow of patients now in genotype 2, and we would anticipate that to be stable through the rest of the year. Genotype 1 is treated by Harvoni. We treated an enormous number of patients initially. We're not quite sure if the curve in Japan is identical to the curves we've seen in the U.S. or other major markets, and that's because there was a DAA [Direct Antiviral Agent] in the market before Harvoni, which did treat quite a few people. So there might not have been quite such a large amount of warehousing. In any case, we're seeing the Harvoni patient numbers coming down gradually. It's not quite as steep as some of the markets. And that's yet to stabilize, but I'm pretty sure \u2013 I know it will stabilize sometime in the next quarter or two. So that's how we're seeing it. We treated about 30,000 patients during the quarter. So that number, it will be there or thereabouts I think for the rest of the year. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC: And what about the volume discounts, are those going to come later in the year, and what kind of dynamics? Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : I'm sorry. We're not anticipating any further price movements in this year in Japan. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thanks for taking my question. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Sorry, can you hear me? Patrick O'Brien - Senior Director- Investor Relations : Yes, now we can. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thanks, I guess one follow-up on Phil's question on Japan. Can you just be clear with us? The pricing that you talked about in March, was that the full extent of the 30% price cut or would there be more in April, just so we can understand how much was reflected in this quarter? And then on the rebates that you talked about, the true-up that happened, would you expect that to swing again through the rest of this year, or do you think that that is now at a level that expresses what your forward-looking expectations are for the level of rebates? Thanks. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : I'll do the first part and Robin will talk about the second part. So the pricing in Japan, the official price reduction was just under 32% and officially from April 1. We actually reduced our prices into wholesalers early in March, and the reason for that was because the price cut was announced much earlier, and therefore we wanted to just smooth out the inventory situation, so that's why we reduced our price into wholesalers a little bit earlier. And by the end of the quarter, inventory levels were up to I would say reasonable levels relative to demand. And actually a little bit, inventory levels were a little bit down from where we ended quarter four because overall demand was slightly down because of Harvoni. Robin? Robin L. Washington - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. And going back to answer the second part of your question relative to the rebate accruals that both Paul and I mentioned, we regularly have to adjust our accruals to reflect the trends and timing of rebates. And I would say still the trends and the dynamics and the complexity around reimbursement in these markets still make them somewhat difficult to predict. So I wouldn't say they were all one-time in nature. There may be a small component that you could say when we were trying to look at the level of inventory that maybe was one-time in nature, but these dynamics I think we may see continue into the future. The honest answer is we don't necessarily know. Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First of all, I want to probe a little bit about the rebates. Can you clarify whether it's actually access-based or volume-based? Because we can see from the scripts apparently the volume is not really picking up after those big insurers opened up the access regardless of F [fibrosis] scores. So I wonder what happens there. And then secondly, I think, Paul, you mentioned that the payer mix is getting a little bit worse this quarter. But can you talk about your thoughts on payer mix going forward? Is it going to be continuing shift to the public payers or I guess the lower price environment or not? Thank you. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : Hi, Ying. So the first question was about patient volumes coming in and relative to the opening up of the fibrosis scores. So I'm not sure whether you look at this data or not, but we get new-to-brand data, which is really the leading indicator of new starts in the quarter. So we've seen, and this is just retail scripts by the way, so that doesn't include the VA, it doesn't include scripts that go through ESI [Express Scripts] and various other groups, so it's partly representative. And what we've seen amongst those scripts is new starts in the quarter have gone up, and that's gone up exactly in line with our expectations with the fibrosis scores being released. Total scripts have remained relatively flat, and part of that is because in quarter four of course the patient numbers, throughout really 2015 quarter on quarter, the new starts were coming down. And therefore the refills associated with those new starts falling into quarter one were somewhat down. So the aggregate of that makes the numbers of total prescriptions in the quarter look relatively flat and slightly disengaged from the fibrosis piece. So I think that hopefully covers that. And then of course, the VA, as I said, isn't included in that group and that was a large number of patients coming into the system. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And then the payer mix? Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : The payer mix, I think directionally, this is not a dramatic move. I think directionally we anticipate that Medicaid will start. There's a lot of pressure on Medicaid to treat patients. And we anticipate that the public payer sector will start proportionately getting a little bit bigger in our mix. Just as an example, around 77% of our payer mix at the end of quarter four or during quarter four was really commercial and Medicare Part D. That number has dropped down now to about 64% as a proportion. So we're seeing a shift, and I would imagine that that will continue gradually. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And then would you guys ever talk about the relative magnitude compared to the 46% you flagged last year? Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : No, we're not going to give guidance on our guidance. We gave the gross-to-net number once. We've built that into our guidance for the rest of the year, so we're not planning on breaking that out it all. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you, Paul. Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Citi. Your line is now open. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So just thinking about the moving parts over the course of the year and the color you gave on fibrosis scores, so with so many people getting rejected early on based on fibrosis score, how might they flow into the system during the year? Because there are a lot of patients. Do you see them coming on evenly, or could they come in a bolus and we could see some choppiness in the quarter? And then the second question I had was how comfortable are you that some of the pricing negotiations have been done and we won't see further pricing negotiations coming with the new nuke-based regimens coming next year? Do you think there's going to be another round of surprises in 2017 for discounting, or do you think we've reached a little bit lower of a steady state? Thanks. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : I think it's hard to tell on the flow of patients first of all. What we do know is there are plenty of patients out there. As I said, our data, we've got three different sources of data which shows that 25,000 to 30,000 patients are coming into treatment. Obviously, a lot less than that are actually being treated. And anecdotally as I said, I think it's because there's bureaucracy still in the physicians' offices, which give a kind of \u2013 I guess that's a gating in the sense of the number of patients that can be treated. And also there's from the patient side people actually ready to be treated. I think they want to be teed up, if you like, for treatment, but they might not want to actually start tomorrow morning. So I think we should expect patient flow to be fairly stable through this year. And then on the negotiation side, I think with real-world data, payers are tending now to really take a lot more time and put a lot more thought into evaluating the clinical profiles of the products. And until we see the clinical profiles of the new products, it's very hard to predict how competitive they are. If they're competitive, I think we have to anticipate prices will come down and we'll negotiate because we certainly don't want to lose any access to patients for our products, and we'll defend our market share vigorously. So it's hard to predict. I think directionally, competition equals lower prices, but we're going to be focusing on looking at differentiating our products. We've got great products out there now and our pipeline looks really exciting. So I think we're in good shape for a long and sustainable and healthy HCV business in the U.S. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes from Alethia Young of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just one, if we go back to the beginning of this year and think about the $30 billion to $31 billion you put out there, has the mix between hep C and HIV changed? It seems like HIV is doing a little bit better on the nuances and hep C has more pricing pressure. And then just also, can you confirm maybe if we're seeing any competition in the big five from new competitors like Merck coming to the market? Robin L. Washington - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Maybe I'll see if I can take the first part of your question. This is Robin. We gave guidance for the full year. I would say yes, this quarter we had a slightly uptick relative to our HIV expectations and slightly down relative to HCV. But I think we've still got three quarters to play things out. And as Paul said, we continue to be optimistic relative to patient starts and a more stable, predictable environment going forward. But it's still very early to tell. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : And in Europe, I've got to say the payers are treating the products generally with less consideration to the clinical differences than we're seeing in the U.S. And there are some payers who are treating the products a bit more like commodities, and we're working hard to make sure that we educate them as best as possible. And I think the real-world data, much of which originates from Europe, is really supporting us in that. But we have seen some instances, for example, tenders in the Nordics, which have a very binary outcome. And there are certain times that we've decided that those tenders' prices don't warrant the value of our products. So our market shares have been a little bit less in Europe. And specifically to answer your question, I think all three players are out there in Europe trying to get business. But at the end of the day, we hope that people will recognize that the Gilead products are highly effective, very simple, very tolerable. And the real-world data, which is now there are vast amounts of it, really does support us when physicians make their choices. And as I said earlier, where physicians have the freedom of prescription, we tended to have very, very strong market shares, in the 90%-plus. Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes from Ian Somaiya of BMO Capital. Your line is now open. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks. Maybe just changing the topic a little bit, a question for Norbert. I was hoping you could just speak to the three oral candidates you have for NASH now, just how you're planning to develop them, how they might come into play, potential combination strategies? And as you think about the larger BD question that keeps getting asked, do you have enough data on your internal programs to make decisions in terms of what additional products that might benefit your internal efforts in NASH and also in hep B? Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer : So, Ian, actually it's four products that we have currently in early clinical studies if you include the Nimbus compound. That deal, by the way, has not closed yet, but it should close in the next week. So we have the ASK inhibitor, the ACC1/ACC2 inhibitor, simtuzumab, and then the FXR agonist. And we could by the end of this year be in four Phase 2 studies really in NASH to look at the effect of any one of these agents by themselves. And then we would also at the same time look at our star combination studies to see \u2013 we always have SYK. We believe in the three points of PET disease pathogenesis. There's fibrosis, inflammation, and metabolic, and yet we don't have agents that address all of them. And you're absolutely \u2013 our hypothesis is that ultimately it's a complex biological disease and probably more than one agent would be needed. And we're looking forward, maybe sometime next year we will then go to Phase 3. With regards to BD, we're of course looking. At the moment there is nothing out there that I would say we have to get. As I said, we have four components. We're going to look at those individually and then as the results come in make decisions what else we would need. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And then what about hep B, just similar question? With the assets you do have, I know that you provided very little information or shared very little information with us. But just as you think about your internal portfolio, do you feel like you have the assets you need to move forward with them and obviously capture the market? Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer : I would say we have, as you know, GS-4774. GS-4779, that's the GlobeImmune vaccine. We've presented data at the last AASLD so they're showing that at least in virally-suppressed patients it did not lead to a reduction in its antigen. We are currently doing a study in treatment-naive patients. We then have GS-9620, the TLR-7 agonist in Phase 2 as well \u2013 or Phase 2a. And then we have two other internal programs that we haven't disclosed yet. They are pre-IND, but we have identified with two different mechanisms molecules that we want to develop or evaluate in human clinical studies. But having that said, it's early as a general statement in hepatitis B cure that we are really having a very open mind and looking outside what else is there potentially that would fit our portfolio. Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I was just wondering. You mentioned this 25,000 to 30,000 per month number of patients coming into treatment, and then you gave us the new diagnosis last year in the U.S. And so that equates to about 17,000 per month. So is it safe to assume that of the new patients coming onto treatment, half are newly diagnosed and half are coming from the currently diagnosed pool? Am I thinking about that the right way? And then the second question was just, can you tell us the percentage of patients that are getting eight weeks of therapy this quarter? Thank you. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : Hi, Terence. I think broadly speaking, your math is correct on that. It's hard to tell exactly where the patients are coming from, but I think mathematically that sounds about right. Sorry, what was the second question? Patrick O'Brien - Senior Director- Investor Relations : Eight weeks. John F. Milligan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: On the eight weeks. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : Oh, yes, sorry, eight weeks. We've drifted slowly but surely upwards on the eight weeks. I think we're about 43% now. I've got to emphasize the data we have is called intent-to-treat rather than actual prescriptions. So the intent to treat in the U.S. is about 43%. The epidemiology, as we've previously said, would probably suggest that about half our genotype 1 patients would fall into the criteria that would trigger off eight-week treatment. Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes from Jim Birchenough of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. James Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, guys, a bit of a maintenance question and then a more meaningful question. On the maintenance side, you refer to a bit of a shift from 24 weeks to eight weeks. Could you break down the eight-week, 12-week, and 24-week treatment numbers in HCV and where you see that heading? And the more meaningful question is NASH is obviously an important part of your future growth strategy. FXR is in that category. How confident are you that you can separate out the metabolic effects of FXR agonism versus the beneficial effect? What's the basis for that cohort, and when will we see that data? Thanks. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : We're not going to break down the weeks of therapy. I just said what we think the eight-week amount is, but the rest you'll have to just model yourself. And I'll hand over to Norbert for the second question. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer : So, Jim, as you know, steroid FXR agonists do many, many things, not only in the liver, but in other target organs. So our philosophy is that we have an FXR agonist that purely acts at the level of the GI. So it does not get orally absorbed to any meaningful degree. And then what it does at the level of the GI, it releases FGF19, and we believe that FGF19 does everything that it needs to do in order to impact on NASH. That's our hypothesis and we're testing that, and we should have data available in the third or fourth quarter of this year. So that's a fairly easy experiment to do. You simply look at bio-availability which is below, but the FGF19 \u2013 increase the FGF19 levels with some of the consequent metabolic effects. That way we also think we can prevent colitis, we can prevent the cholesterol effects, we can prevent alkaline phosphatase elevations, et cetera. So if that all is true, it should be a much safer and cleaner FXR agonist. James Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And, Norbert, when is the form for that data release? And I guess what are the next steps for that program? How far behind are you from things that are in Phase 3 right now as an FXR agonist? Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer : We could probably have some of the preliminary data at the AASLD, and we would then move into Phase 3 soon after that. So we're not that far behind other companies. James Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, thanks for taking my question. Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes the line of Alan Carr of Needham & Company. Your line is now open. Alan Carr - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wondered if you can talk a little bit more about the new diagnoses in 2015 that you mentioned. You said there were around 200,000. Do you have any other details around that, where they were found or I guess the trend over the course of the year? Is it increasing? Thanks. Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations : I don't have a lot of details at my fingertips actually, Alan. I would say, just to build on what Norbert was saying earlier, the interactions we're having with many people working on diagnosis projects around the country are that there's a lot of \u2013 a surprisingly high level of positive diagnosis in some of the urban centers and in ER rooms in particular in those urban centers, where diagnosis rates have been double at least what even the local investigators had anticipated. Why that is, I'm not sure, but this has been consistent throughout the country. So I would say that diagnosis rate, the 200,000, would grow rather than shrink, certainly for the next few years. And there are great efforts of course now to encourage diagnosis because people know that at the end of it, they're going to be treated and have a high probability of being cured. Alan Carr - Needham & Co. LLC: Great, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you, and we have time for one final question. That question comes from the line of Tony Butler of Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Charles Anthony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Norbert, very quickly if you could, recognizing that Nimbus closes next week, have there not been other ACC inhibitors which have actually failed? And if that's true, what might be unique about the Nimbus program? I understand it may attack a different part of the molecule, which would be interesting for you to elaborate on if that is indeed the case. Thanks. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer : So, Tony, you are exactly right. There have been previous ACC programs at Merck and Pfizer. They have not been successful, and the reason had to do with the specificity. This compound is really unique, it's a low nanomolar inhibitor of both ACC1 and ACC2. And it inhibits not only the pathway that goes to de novo lipogenesis, so based on low Coenzyme A production, but it also inhibits at the level of the mitochondrion. It stimulates, I might say, lipid acid beta oxidation. So it does really two things. It inhibits the formation of lipids, palmitate mostly, and at the same time it stimulates the beta oxidation of lipids. And so there are actually some anecdotal reports from the Pfizer compound that inhibition of ACC1 and ACC2 results in a decrease in liver fat. That's by the way something we will do as one of the next experiments. We would look by MRI on the reduction of \u2013 we've already shown at the EASL presentation that it inhibits lipogenesis. Now we have to show also that it inhibits lipid fat content of the liver. It's a very straightforward and easy experiment to do. And I think once we have shown that, we have pretty high confidence that there would be a meaningful clinical benefit of the combo. Charles Anthony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Great, thank you. Patrick O'Brien - Senior Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, Candace, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead, and the team here look forward to providing you with updates on our future progress. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. That does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Gilead Sciences second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. My name is Candace, and I'll be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And as a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Vice President Investor Relations. Sung Lee - Vice President Investor Relations : Great, thank you, Candace, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, a press release was issued with earnings results for the second quarter 2016. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website. Joining today's call will be John Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Kevin Young, Chief Operating Officer; and Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer. Before we begin formal remarks, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the latest SEC disclosures documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website. I will now turn the call over to Robin. Robin L. Washington - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Sung, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to share results for the second quarter of 2016. I'll first review our financials and Kevin and John will then make a few comments. Total revenues for the second quarter was $7.8 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.08. This compares to revenues of $8.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.15 for the same period last year. Product sales for the second quarter were $7.7 billion, down 6% year over year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower HCV sales, partially offset by increased sales in HIV and other therapeutic areas. Sequentially, we saw an increase in HIV, U.S. HCV and other products that were offset by a decline in HCV sales in Japan and Europe. Turning to the U.S., product sales for the second quarter were $4.9 billion, down 12% year over year. HCV product sales were $2.3 billion, down 33% year over year, driven by lower revenues per patient as a result of increased rebates and discounts due primarily to payer mix and lower patient starts for Harvoni as the initial group of warehouse patients was treated in 2015. Sequentially, our HCV product sales were up 13%, driven by a $270 million adjustment to our HCV sales returns reserves rate and the initial inventory build for Epclusa. Strong uptake of our TAF-based regimens drove 23% year-over-year and a 11% sequential growth of our HIV product sales. The quarterly revenues of $2.2 billion were also positively impacted by the upward trajectory of Truvada use for PrEP. Turning to Europe, product sales for the second quarter were $1.6 billion, down 18% year over year, primarily driven by lower HCV patient starts and a higher proportion of patient starts from countries that have a lower net average price. Sequentially, sales in Europe were flat, excluding the impact of currency movements with HIV sales growth offset by lower HCV sales. In Japan, product sales for the second quarter were $619 million, down 43% sequentially as a result of lower patient starts on Harvoni and the full quarter effect of the mandatory price reductions for both Sovaldi and Harvoni, which were discussed during our last call. Moving to gross margin, our non-GAAP product gross margin for the second quarter of 2016 was 92% and benefited from the reversal of a $200 million litigation charge recorded in the first quarter of 2016 following a favorable decision in the Merck case. Now turning to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $1 billion for the second quarter, up 48% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the purchase of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration priority review voucher and the progression of clinical studies. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the second quarter were up 10%, compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher costs to support new product launches and our geographic expansion. From a balance sheet perspective, during the second quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $4.9 billion and ended the quarter with $24.6 billion in cash and investments. While our cash flows will remain strong in the second half of the year, we anticipate a sequential decrease in Q3 2016 due to required cash payments related to accrued government rebates in the U.S. and abroad as well as milestone payments associated with our R&D pipeline progression. We continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the second quarter, we repurchased 10.5 million shares for $1 billion under the $12 billion 2016 share repurchase program. And we received an additional 8.1 million shares in April 2016 from the final settlement of the accelerated share repurchase program announced in February 2016. The total share repurchases in the first half of the year were 98.2 million at a cost of $9 billion. As previously communicated, we anticipated share repurchases in the second half of 2016 to be lower than the first half of 2016 as we focus our capital allocation on advancing our R&D opportunities. Finally, we are updating full-year 2016 guidance, which is outlined on slide 21. The changes are as follows. We are lowering net product sales guidance to a range of $29.5 billion to $30.5 billion. While we are seeing continued strength in non-HCV product sales, given the current trends in payer and patient flow dynamics for HCV, our updated models suggest net product sales will range from being slightly above to slightly below $30 billion for the year. As such, we believe it is prudent to update our full-year 2016 guidance. The factors contributing to this conclusion include lower HCV revenue per patient as a result of a mix shift towards more heavily discounted payer segment in the U.S. and continues with a lower net average price in Europe, a trend toward slowing patient starts in the U.S. commercial segment and some earlier launch markets of Europe, a continued gradual trend towards shorter duration and loss of some market share to competition. This guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties, including potential changes in the global macroeconomic environment, adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce HCV spending, volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, inaccuracy in our HCV patient start estimates, additional competitive launches in HCV, an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing commercial payer contract negotiations and a larger-than-anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments such as PHS, FFS, Medicaid and the VA. We are increasing our R&D expense guidance to a range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion driven by acquisition-related expenses for Nimbus Apollo, Inc. and the purchase of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration priority review voucher, slightly offset by lower-than-anticipated clinical trial expenses. We are lowering SG&A expense guidance to a range of $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion, primarily driven by the favorable one-time adjustment to the expected invoice from the IRS for the branded prescription drug fee, which lowered Q1 2016 SG&A expense. Diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related upfront collaboration, stock-based compensation, and other expenses increases to a new range of $1.47 to $1.53 as a result of our recent M&A activity. All other components of our 2016 guidance remain unchanged. I would like to now turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin B. Young - Chief Operating Officer : Thank you, Robin, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me say immediately how terrific it is to be back at Gilead in a full-time capacity. Working with exceptional executive colleagues around the table here in Foster City, interacting with my senior operating management team and seeing the dedication of the thousands of Gilead employees around the world leaves me in no doubt as to the long-term prospects for this outstanding company. While it's early days, over the last two months in my new role, I've had the opportunity to reflect on Gilead's recent product introductions, the evolving healthcare landscape and the operating challenges on our near-term horizon. I'd like to share three general observations with you today. First, I am struck by the commitment that is shared by physicians, payers and governments around the world to reduce the prevalence of hepatitis C. Even countries with challenging economic circumstances are finding ways to prioritize the treatment of HCV patients. In the two-and-a-half years since the launch of Sovaldi, more than one million patients have been treated on a sofosbuvir-based regimen. Beneath this aggregated number are several landmark statistics. The United States has already treated nearly half a million patients to-date with Sovaldi and Harvoni. Equally, over 200,000 patients in Europe have been treated with Gilead regimens. Japan has treated approximately 100,000 patients in a little over a year, and just this year, Australia has treated an estimated 17,000 patients in a matter of months. Healthcare systems have demonstrably mobilized to reach those patients most in need. These are remarkable facts that clearly underscore the profile of the products we have introduced. Equally, they have implications to longer-term treatment dynamics and portfolio lifecycles. Secondly, in the area of HIV, I'm impressed by how the clinical data for TAF-based regimens are resonating with many constituents who tirelessly drive for better patient care. The understanding that these regimens can help address the growing need for highly effective and safer treatment options for lifelong HIV therapy is evidenced by the early success of Genvoya. I will highlight some impressive data points later. Thirdly, I'm reminded just how complex the delivery of healthcare continues to be. Gilead's focus on flawless execution on controlling the variables that we can control with the highest levels of conduct and compliance is critical and is my top priority. Now let me take the details of the commercial performance for the second quarter. Starting with HCV, in the U.S., total HCV revenue was $2.3 billion, up 13% sequentially and down 33% year over year. Since the beginning of the year, access has improved, and almost all major commercial payers have been moved by grocery store criteria, joining Medicare and the VA in this regard. Medicaid remains the only payer segment where use is still generally restricted to the sicker patients. There are other significant barriers to access, but we are encouraged that some states have recently moved away from fibrosis restrictions towards more open access. In terms of patient starts, approximately 59,000 people began HCV therapy in the second quarter, and an estimated 90% of these patients started on a sofosbuvir-based regimen. Importantly, third-party databases suggest that new patients are being identified through increased screening efforts. As evidence, approximately, 14 million people were screened for HCV for the period of 2014 through 2015. And approximately 280,000 people were confirmed RNA positive in that two-year period. These figures represent a significant increase from the years prior to the launch of Sovaldi. We estimate that 3 million individuals remain infected with HCV in the U.S., approximately half of whom are diagnosed. Although patient starts increased for the second consecutive quarter and patient inflows into care remained reasonably steady at around 30,000 patients a month, the dynamics vary by patient segment. Within the commercial and Medicare segments, some larger payers have recently opened up access. We now estimate that up to 90% of all commercial covered lives have access without regard to fibrosis score. While the payers that recently opened up access are bringing in more patients, we are seeing a modest downward trend in patient starts among payers that have had full access in place for longer periods of time. The sickest patients have largely been treated, and the movement we are seeing is towards treating genotype 1 patients with lower fibrosis scores and thus greater use of the eight-week treatment regimen for Harvoni. In terms of all new HCV treatment starts in the second quarter, approximately 45% came from within the public payer systems. We anticipate this percentage will remain largely the same through the remainder of the year. The VA is one example of a payer within this segment, and their commitment to treating and curing veterans who have HCV using budget allocated by Congress to do so is truly groundbreaking. We are aware that in some cities, extra clinics have been scheduled to help shoulder the workload. However, we also expect that in the longer term, socially disadvantaged patients within the VA system will be harder to reach and bringing to care and that the rate of treatment will decline. Turning to Europe, total HCV revenue in the second quarter was $775 million, down 32% year over year and down 7% sequentially. Overall, Gilead patient starts decreased to around 28,000 for the quarter. We observed steady treatment rates in Italy and Spain, but lower numbers in early launch markets like Germany and France. Patient starts in the UK continue to be limited by NHS England budget restrictions. Additionally, we saw a slight decline in average treatment duration as countries like Germany are treating more patients with low fibrosis scores who qualify for an eight-week treatment duration. In several European markets, locally documented cure rates are equal to, if not better than, what was demonstrated in Sovaldi and Harvoni clinical studies. This has resonated with governments and payer bodies. And some countries such as France are considering removing all fibrosis score criteria. We will watch this pretty closely and share evolving news with you in the future. Moving to Japan, as Robin mentioned, revenue was $619 million, down 43% sequentially. We believe this is related to two factors : first, the decline in genotype 1 new patient starts following the Q1 2016 peak when a very large number of individuals with advanced disease initiated therapy; and second, the full three-month effect of a mandatory price reduction previously described on last quarter's call. Finally, for HCV, Epclusa was recently approved in the U.S., the EU, and Canada. These approvals are true milestones in patient care since Epclusa is the first pan-genotypic once-daily single-tablet option. Epclusa will be an important treatment option in the U.S. as an estimated 20% to 25% of HCV patients have genotype 2 and genotype 3. And equally across Europe, there are some countries that have up to 30% of patients with genotype 3 alone. In concluding my remarks on hepatitis C, I will return to my earlier comments. Gilead is proud to be part of a fundamental disease paradigm shift, delivering disease cures to virtually all patients treated. That's why we developed Sovaldi, Harvoni, and Epclusa and have a third single-tablet regimen in clinical testing. Whilst the pace of new patient treatments may slow in coming years and quantifying that pace is incredibly hard, there is still an opportunity to identify and cure many HCV-infected people around the globe. Moving to HIV, we are pleased with the launch of our TAF-based products in the U.S. and in the European markets, where we have already achieved reimbursement. In the U.S., total HIV and other antiviral revenue was $2.2 billion, up 11% sequentially, and Genvoya revenue nearly doubled in Q2 versus Q1. The product represents the most successful HIV launch since the introduction of Atipla, the first single-tablet regimen, a decade ago. After its first six months of availability, Genvoya is already the most prescribed regimen for both treatment na\u00efve and switch patients. Seventy-eight percent of all Genvoya prescriptions have come from switches. Half of the switches have come from Stribild. And importantly, 10% of switches have come from non-Gilead therapies. Among all patients who switch, we have seen an increase in our ability to retain patients on a Gilead product. While still in the early stages of the Odefsey and Descovy launches, we are seeing similar patient dynamics to Genvoya. Over 90% of all Odefsey and Descovy prescriptions have come from switches, and 6% and 11% of switches respectively have come from non-Gilead therapies. Finally, in the U.S., I would like to highlight the growing use of Truvada for PrEP. We estimate somewhere in the order of 60,000 patients to 70,000 patients were using Truvada for PrEP in the second quarter. This number accounts for approximately one-third of Truvada demand. This is encouraging, as we know Truvada has an important role to play as part of comprehensive HIV prevention for many at-risk individuals. Turning to Europe, total HIV and other antiviral revenue was $755 million, up 5% sequentially, driven by the launches of Genvoya and Descovy. Genvoya has gained pricing approval in 11 countries and is now the market leader in Germany for both treatment-na\u00efve and switch patients after only six months of availability. We anticipate additional launches in France, Italy and the UK in the second half of the year. Genvoya is a preferred regimen in several HIV treatment guidelines, including Italy where it was added before pricing and reimbursement. Preferred listings are anticipated in other EU guidelines later this year and into 2017. EACS guidelines are expected to be updated following the HIV Glasgow 2016 Conference in October. Finally, I would like to briefly update you on the outstanding performance of the Gilead U.S. cardiovascular team. Letairis and Ranexa together generated $356 million in revenue during the quarter, representing a 12% year-over-year increase. Today, over 0.25 million people in the United States regularly receive Ranexa and Letairis remains the overall ERA market leader in PAH. In closing, Gilead achieved a great deal across our operations during the quarter and I am confident that we will continue to make significant progress in the second half of 2016. I would now like to turn the call over to John. John F. Milligan - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Kevin. Before I get started, I just wanted to say it's great to have you back on the Gilead team full time as our new Chief Operating Officer. Today, in addition to the remarks of Robin and Kevin regarding the quarter, I'd like to make a few comments of my own. Over the last 2.5 years, we made great progress in helping provide access to Sovaldi and Harvoni for HCV patients. Throughout the world more than one million HCV sufferers have now been treated with nearly half of those coming from the U.S. The launch of these drugs were unprecedented in our industry and patients are treated at a much faster initial rate than we, or anyone else, thought possible. Looking back, we can now say that in every country the peak number of patients treated was achieved within two quarters or three quarters of the launch of Harvoni. And that peak number is far higher than what had ever been achieved before about three times that seen with the launch of the HCV protease inhibitors in 2011. As we've reached the midpoint of the year, we now see the market maturing to a slower rate of treatment for HCV-infected individuals. And as we think about this more normal pace of patient starts, there are a few things to keep in mind. As Kevin mentioned, there are three million people who are infected in the U.S. and slightly more than half of those have been diagnosed. Many of these diagnosed patients have less advanced liver disease upon reentering care. For example, in the United States, in the second quarter this year, we estimated that only 13% of patients starting treatment had F4 fibrosis scores compared with more than 21% the year prior to that. With less severely ill patients, there's less urgency to immediately treat patients and this may explain the slower rate of treatment versus last year. However, we do believe these patients will eventually benefit from treatment and this means the flow of patients will continue for many years to come. There's also an opportunity to diagnose patients and bring them into care. As Kevin mentioned, we estimated that about 280,000 HCV patients were diagnosed in the U.S. within the last two years, considering the value and importance of the U.S. CDC and CMS recommendations for HCV testing. So while there has been a slowing of treatment compared with the rush of patients when Sovaldi and Harvoni were first approved, the HCV market is attractive over the longer term, providing good revenues, strong cash flow and earnings per share on top of our base business of chronic therapies. Because of this, our focus on improving care for HCV-infected individuals has not wavered. Beyond the recent approvals of Epclusa, we are actively working on a third single-tablet regimen that combines the two active ingredients in Epclusa with a third investigational compound, voxilaprevir. This combination known as SOF/VEL/VOX is being evaluated in four Phase 3 clinical trials among patients who have previously failed direct-acting antiviral treatments. It's also being studied for its potential to offer an eight-week treatment duration for treatment-na\u00efve patients of all genotypes. We expect to have top line data available for SOF/VEL/VOX by the end of the year. We're making tremendous headway in HIV as well both with our portfolio of newer products and our pipeline. We've had several key approvals with Descovy approved in the U.S. and Europe last quarter and Odefsey approved in Europe earlier this month. It's clear these medications offer a significant advance for patients, and that advance has been recognized now by multiple professional and public health groups, including the International Antiviral Society of the U.S.A and the Department of Health and Human Services, both of which released updated guidelines supporting the use of TAF-based regimens for initial HIV therapy. We continue to generate clinical data that support the favorable scientific and medical profile of our TAF-based products. Last week we announced the results of two Phase 3b switch studies evaluating Odefsey in virologically-suppressed adults, switching from Complera or ATRIPLA. Odefsey achieved similar rates of virological suppression as the TDF-based regimen. These studies reinforce the efficacy of Odefsey as of the renal and bone safety advantages that we plan to present full data sets later this year. Last month we presented the first human data of bictegravir, our investigational un-boosted integration inhibitor at the American Society for Microbiology. Data from four preclinical and Phase 1 studies examined the antiviral potency, resistance profile, pharmacokinetics and safety of bictegravir, providing the rationale to further evaluate the compound. Bictegravir, as part of a single-tablet regimen in combination with TAF and emtricitabine is currently in Phase 3 trials. Enrollment of more than 2,300 patients across four registrational studies was completed earlier this month. The 48-week endpoints for these studies will be reached in the second quarter of next year; and if the data play out as we hope, NDA and MAA filings could occur in the third quarter of 2017. With the approval and rapid adoption of our TAF-based regimens and exciting new STR in Phase 3 development and an active HIV research pipeline, I'm confident that we will be able to extend our leadership position in the HIV market and broaden our ability to help even more patients around the world. Outside of our work in antivirals, Gilead has focused on solving some of the biggest health challenges today. Several important data sets that are anticipated in the second half of this year may help us to find a strategy and pathway forward for tackling these challenges. In our NASH program, where we have four active clinical programs, we'll have data from the Phase 2 studies of GS-4997, our ASK-1 inhibitor, and simtuzumab, our monochromal antibody and sLOXL2. The Phase 2 study of simtuzumab for primary sclerosing cholangitis will also conclude, and we'll also have data from the Phase 2 studies of GS-4997 in diabetic nephropathy and pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. And finally, we expect data from two Phase 3 studies for myelofibrosis before the end of the year. If these data are positive, these studies will form the basis for an NDA filing in the first quarter of 2017. These are important milestones and represent a great deal of work across the organization to enroll and advance these studies and analyze complex data sets as they become available. Gilead continues to innovate at every level in every part of the organization. Next month, we will publish our first corporate social responsibility report that looks at access, sustainability, grant-making and other positive contributions to the communities we serve and I urge you to read it. I'm proud of the work that's being led by our employees and extend my many thanks to them for all the ways they're making a difference around the world. Thank you, and let's now open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And, Kevin, good to have you back on the call and in the seat, of course. So I want to dig into your comments and also John's comments on the hep C new starts. And, I guess, I'm curious here, because you have better F0-F1 access, you have positive impact theoretically from the CDC guidelines and very low penetration in markets such as the prison population. I'm just curious why \u2013 could you put your finger on maybe one or two things that you feel like could ultimately become a growth driver to give us back to better sequential growth? I'm just trying to figure out what the tipping point is on some of these different volume drivers. Thanks. Kevin B. Young - Chief Operating Officer : Hey, Geoff, nice to hear your voice as well. Thank you for the comments. I'm not at all pessimistic about the long-term prospects for hepatitis C. In fact, I'm rather optimistic. I think what we have seen 2014/2015 is an enormous group of the less well patients treated particularly by specialist hepatitis C treaters. It's really quite amazing. I think this quarter, and we've highlighted perhaps going forward, is really a sort of a payer mix situation that we've got. The VA has definitely increased in terms of its contribution to the 59,000 total HCV starts, which, of course, was an increase on quarter one. So a lot of VA patients are coming through, and the VA is very, very motivated to try to essentially eradicate the virus from that population. I think, yes, we did see pickup in two of the large payers that came onstream with open fibrosis scores from the beginning of the year, but we did see some downtick in other commercial payers. So net-net, it was slightly a decrease in overall commercial patients. What I feel about the long term and as we go into years further forward and we hit an equilibrium of patients is all around what I mentioned and John mentioned around diagnoses, there's been a considerable pickup in the number of HCV tests 2014 and 2015, about a 65% increase in the number of HCV tests, 280,000 in that two-year period were HCV RNA positive. So, as John said, they will eventually work their way through to treatment. There's still over a quarter of the population being diagnosed is at a fall, so there's still a lot of sickness out there in patients. So whilst the healthcare system here and in some of the European markets have done heroic things in treating patients in the last two years, I still think with 1.5 million diagnosed patients in the United States, that we are going to see a continued healthy flow of patients that can benefit from our products. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, thanks, Kevin. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Leerink. Your line is now open. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks very much. So, Kevin, welcome back, and very good to hear you. So following up on this somewhat vexing issue of the HCV outlook, historically, in this category after each market has peaked, it's begun a steady slow, sometimes slow anyway, decline. We certainly saw a rapid decline after the protease inhibitors, more slow decline after we went to ribavirin and with the introduction of pegylated interferon. Are you suggesting to us that you think that there is a stable outlook for the HCV revenue on a market-by-market basis from these levels? Or are you suggesting that we should see more like an orderly and steady decline? And could you particularly comment about Europe where I think it was surprising to see patient numbers in the big early markets roll over so quickly, particularly, Germany and Japan. Is that a one-time step-down? Or are we going to continue at or below this level going forward? Kevin B. Young - Chief Operating Officer : Thanks for the question, Geoff. I think it is encouraging that our patient starts in the U.S. and Europe have been reasonably steady over the past three quarters. Japan's a different story and I can certainly at some point comment on that this afternoon. I think from my perspective and Robin, Norbert, John around the table here, I think it's more of the latter comment that there will continue to be a gradual decline in new patient starts, but an equilibrium will be eventually hit. Quite the timing of that, Geoff, it's really, really, really hard to peg. I've just got to believe that with the amount of testing, with the amount of diagnoses, with the CDC guidelines, Gilead itself in Q3 \u2013 Q4 of this year are going to do some more educational programs around the need to test and treat that we will eventually hit an equilibrium. In terms of Europe, Italy and Spain are very steady. I should tell you that in Italy, there are still 200,000 quite sick individuals, people to be treated and they're in treated care. And the Italian government do want to go ahead and try and mobilize providers to do that treating, so still an enormous number in Italy. I think the markets that are more akin to the U.S. like first and foremost, Germany and to a slight lesser extent France, are starting to see that turnover of patients. We've got full access in terms of fibrosis score in Germany. And we're hoping, as I said, that we get broader access in France. The UK is a different situation now. It's largely due to payer restrictions. But again, still an enthusiasm to treat, but one or two of those markets there is some maturing going on. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Very good, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Regina Grebla - Evercore Group LLC : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my call. This is Regina Grebla in for Mark. I actually wanted to change topics and shift to hepatitis B. On your Q1 call, you mentioned your hep B program included a vaccine, a TLR-7 agonist, and two other internal preclinical candidates. When will we see any data on the internal candidates? And also you mentioned taking a look at external opportunities for hepatitis B. Is hep B still a potential area of interest for acquisition? Thank you. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer : And so, Regina, you asked a question about what our pipeline is for hepatitis B. So we have, as you know, two compounds that are currently in clinical development. One is an active vaccine, GS-4779, a collaboration with GlobeImmune. That's currently in the later stages of being evaluated in non-suppressed hep B patients. The suppressed hep B patients, those data had been released maybe a year ago. They did not show any activity. So we don't have high hopes that this compound will work. Then the TLR-7 agonist is just finishing the first cohort, which is in suppressed patients. And we are currently initiating \u2013 the second cohort is ongoing. We hope that we'll have the presentation of the first cohort ready by ASLD. Hopefully, we'll reach the abstract deadline. Then you said that \u2013 you asked a question about we have two other compounds in development. You know what we're pursuing \u2013 maybe I should answer this more generally. So we're pursuing three approaches to hepatitis B cure. The one is adding another different mechanism to the nucleotides because there's the observation that despite being undetectable with hepatitis B therapies like Viread or TAF, there was always a little bit of virus left, HBV, if you look at very sensitive PCR methods. So by adding another mechanism to it, we could completely suppress virus replication down to zero, would that lead to an eventual cure or hepatitis S conversion. The second thing we're pursuing is immune therapy, so that belongs to vaccine and to TLR-7 that I've talked about already. And we have a TLR-8 agonist currently that is working its way towards an IND. And the third possibility that's the most hopeful but also the one that's least scientifically proven is going directly after cccDNA. And that's really too early to talk about at this point. It's still in the research stages. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. You talked a lot about volume and demand in the different buckets. But can you talk about the payer mix shift? Specifically, I wanted to ask on Medicaid. Can you just help us out with what percent of sales Medicaid is, and what is going on in that bucket? I presume it's a state-by-state negotiation. Can you talk about what's going on there? Is there a state-by-state negotiation you have to go through? Is that pretty much done? Walk us through that bucket and what percent of hep C that is in the USA so we can understand them. Thank you so much Kevin B. Young - Chief Operating Officer : Hi, Michael. It's Kevin. Thank you for the question. I'd prefer not to break out specifically the percentage of the public payers in terms of Medicaid. As I said, all our public payers lumped together for the quarter were about 45%. That's an increase from the previous quarter. But as I said, that's all driven by VA. We've seen very little change really in the scale and size of our Medicaid business. I think it would be true to say that Medicaid's \u2013 the states are slowly, progressively opening up. Forty percent of Medicaid patients come from the five largest states. Two of those, New York and Florida, now have no fibrosis score. So as states do progressively consider opening up, they typically come to us for a contract. We think about those contracts very carefully. Depending on the size of Medicaid, we obviously put our submission in. Realistically, I think we may win, we hope, the majority of those, but there may be occasions when occasionally a Medicaid state goes to the competition. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks so much for taking the question. Robin, if you could, address the $279 million one-time swing. We obviously saw a swing in the first quarter and then a swing this quarter again. Can you just give us some insight into what's going on with those changes in chargebacks and if we should continue to expect to see some of those numbers? And then just separately on PrEP, any plans to get a TAF-based regimen approved for PrEP? Thanks Robin L. Washington - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, I'll take the first part and then Norbert will take the second. Matt, first of all, there are two separate things that we're talking about here, Q2 versus Q1. First, let me address Q2. We did have a sales return reserve adjustment, really related to the fact that as we introduced our new hep C product, we're required to go out and get an external proxy related to sales return reserves. And just recently, just this past quarter we closed several of the lots related to our product regimes, and no further returns are expected. So that gives us a triggering event by which we can look at returns versus how we had been accruing. The other key thing about the timing of this related to this accrues a lot. So as we bring on a new product, we want to rebase their level of returns that we're expecting to see. So that's really the adjustment there. For the most part, you can see \u2013 it's one-time in nature. We may have small adjustments going forward. But as long as returns continue where they are then that $279 million is kind of a one-time event. Last quarter, we had a different issue and that related to rebate claims for hepatitis C. And as I said on the call last time, we always have a situation, where we're constantly showing up claims around HCV rebate, because we get those claims one to two quarters in arrear. This quarter was a bit different than last quarters that we saw a modernization of the level of those claims relative to the prior quarter. So it didn't reverse the other way, it was just a slowing of what we saw in Q1. So we're \u2013 for lack of a better word, we're a little bit more caught up relative to returns this quarter than we were at the end of Q1. So two different items, but we called out the $279 million because that was the one-time event. So we wanted to ensure that you understood relative to the future projection of HCV sales. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for clarification. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer : Hi, Matt, your question about F/TAF for PrEP, so we and also the outside medical community believes that obviously Descovy or F/TAF would have advantages in terms of use for PrEP versus Truvada for all the obvious data that were published already. And also, we have data non-human \u2013 in animal models that showed that has the same efficacy. The thing we're debating internally and also we have had early discussions with FDA is what clinical study would need to be done that leads to approval. It would have to be in almost all likelihood a comparative study and then the secret is what would be the sample size and what would be the powering. And that's currently a discussion we're having with FDA. We hope we can come to some conclusion within the next month or so and then let you know. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And, Kevin, good to hear your voice again. With the list pricing and label established for Epclusa, just wondering what's the right way to think about Epclusa's potential impact on the genotype 2/3 franchise, particularly, with respect to the net price per patient, treatment duration relative to Sovaldi and just how we should be thinking about the overall market dynamics there? And just wondering if you could also quantify the inventory build this quarter there. Thanks. Kevin B. Young - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, great question, Brian. Nice to hear your voice as well. Brian, the majority of the revenues in the second quarter, which is right at the end. The majority of that was inventory that Robin called out. So we've really only just begun the introduction, both the promotion and the education around Epclusa. I'm really pleased that the response has been excellent. And our advisory boards and our speaker programs have been good acceptance. Whilst we have obviously a pan-genotypic label, I think the reality is that physicians are very, very comfortable, as are payers, with Harvoni for genotype 1. Obviously, there's a mix of 12-week treatments and eight-week. Just for your information, the eight-week course of Harvoni is now 45% of patients treated in the United States. So I think people are just really comfortable with the clinical effect and the value proposition of Harvoni in GT 1. That all means that the slot that people see Epclusa is in the genotype 2 and genotype 3 patient. As I highlighted, it's something like in the order of 20% to 25% of patients in the United States. I think the obvious advantage both clinically and from a payer point of view is you really do have a 12-week single-tablet regimen. You don't have to extend the treatment duration. You don't have to use ribavirin. There was quite a number of patients treated with Sovaldi/daclatasvir, certainly in United States. So really somewhat it takes away that regimen and is an excellent slot. So we've had very good reception to Epclusa. It's extremely early days. It will take us three months to six months to get payer approval. Physicians can apply based on medical need and we know they're doing that. So just very early days and weeks. It seems to have found a very nice entry point. Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I have a bigger picture question for you. Really, just following the latest management shuffle back in 2Q, I'm wondering if these changes portend any material shift or consideration of a shift in \u2013 I guess your commercial or pricing strategy really the overall strategy for the businesses or any of the key businesses? And is this playing into the bump in anticipated R&D with the associated downtick in SG&A as illustrated by your updated guidance? Thanks. John F. Milligan - President and Chief Executive Officer : I think there were a couple of questions. So it's John Milligan. So in terms of \u2013 let me get to the last bit. You said there was a bump in R&D. That is true relating somewhat to our acquisition of Nimbus. So there were charges associated with that and are also charges associated \u2013 I should say, expenses associated with the purchase of an FDA priority review voucher. So we're very pleased to get that on board. And we'll look forward to explaining when we're going to use that. Above and beyond that, actually, R&D expenses were slightly down what we \u2013 beneath what we had forecasted, because we continue to hold the cost centers accountable and continue to drive good value through our clinical teams in getting studies done at a cost-effective way. So in terms of that, there's no difference. The SG&A line came down a little bit, because of some one-time charges that were lower than we \u2013 I'm sorry \u2013 the IRS charges was lower than we anticipated. So kind of what we would expect. In terms of signaling about pricing or changes in management about structures, I don't really think there's anything to signal there in terms of our pricing strategy. We're highly competitive. We think we have a very good differentiated product. And we'll continue to do the best for the company and for patients by coming to the right level of price and access. Kevin B. Young - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. And I would just add, Cory, that the Gilead way is always to lead with the science around our product. Nothing's changed in my eyes as I've come back into the company. We lead with science. That's what you do in specialist markets. It is a reality that there's more contracting. I think we've got a phenomenal team working on this. I met with them two weeks ago. And I think they're highly professional. And we always lead with value. That's the key thing. We think we've got tremendous products that either control disease or cure disease and they add terrific value. And that's the course we're going to stay. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen. Your line is now open. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. And, Kevin, it's great to have you back. I have a question on capital allocation. In prepared remarks, I think you mentioned in regards to cash flows being lower in the second half of the year that part of that was investment in R&D. And as you just discussed, that R&D expenses aren't really changing that much in the guidance. So kind of curious whether you have on your list of things to do in the second half of the year more deals, whether M&A or in-licensing, and maybe you could give us some thoughts on how aggressive you're likely to be in those areas. Robin L. Washington - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Phil, I'll start. I think relative to the cash flow, what I was messaging was really just related to the dynamics of payment, right. So we have accrued rebates and other things that kind of cause volatility to quarterly cash flow. So overall, our cash flows remain strong, but we definitely expect a sequential decrease in cash flow second half. Relative to our overall capital allocation, it's no different than what we've been messaging; again, more focused on our BD opportunity. But I'll let John speak a little bit more and just again, focus on that. And that additional focus has meant we're somewhat less focused on share repurchases in the second half of the year. John F. Milligan - President and Chief Executive Officer : And just to follow up on what Robin said, Phil, we were very aggressive in the first quarter of this year. That's why we back off a little bit from where we are in the second half of the year. Mostly, you get the full-year effect or a greater effect of repurchasing the almost 100 million shares through Robin's program. With regard to business development, obviously, we're a company that has been very open about being interested in doing more deals; especially, deals of a certain size where we think we can get some leverage and we can use our organization to effectively accelerate or expand indications. We've done some good deals both with Galapagos and Nimbus recently. We are very interested in continuing that to add more things to our pipeline, especially, in the non-antiviral area where we continue to see growth and franchises. It's our hope that as we exit this year, we'll have a better, more complete story of programs internally and externally that we can use to talk about why the long-term prospects for growth are as good as we believe they are. And that's what we'll be focused on. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Citi. Your line is now open. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, the question from me after hearing some of the comments about like thinking about volumes slowing or coming down and then thinking about gross to net changing over time is, how are you comfortable that you can provide guidance with these two variables? Do you have any bookends for how low we can go that gives you the comfort? And then, the question is, you affirmed guidance last quarter and lowered it this quarter. What was the one thing you think that really changed your view over the last three months that led to that? Thanks. Kevin B. Young - Chief Operating Officer : I'll start and then hand the question to Robin. You know, Robyn, it's really hard. We've got markets in different stages of development whether it be U.S., parts of the U.S., different countries in Europe, and, obviously, interesting and profound dynamics in Japan. So that partly made up of patient flows and partly made up of sort of payer flow. I think the big thing this quarter, from the point of view of the U.S., was very much a payer kind of mix with the large addition of patients from the VA. So I think in the last three months that was probably the biggest thing. We have not changed our prices in the U.S. Q2 versus Q1. It was largely we're seeing dramatic, but incredibly successful program from VA. Robin L. Washington - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Robyn, I'll add to that. I agree with Kevin. I think the heavier percentage of more discounted payers along with the fact that on the commercial side, we're seeing slight decreases in the U.S. And Kevin mentioned earlier about what we're also seeing relative to the mix shift in countries in Europe less of Northern Europe, Germany, France, and more of Italy and Spain. The other part of your question is, as we said earlier throughout the call, this is a really difficult area to predict. It's unlike any other \u2013 it's a curative market and it's very large relative to Gilead's total revenue. So it's a question we have in ourselves as we think in the outer years how can we continue or can we really guide around HCV revenues. So we guided this year, but it's definitely something we're getting a lot of proxy as we think about the trends of HCV going forward and all the dynamics that we're trying to deal with it. It's very complex. So more to follow on that. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ying Huang of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a quick one on also the pricing environment. So if you look at VA sector and also the commercial sector, what kind of impact are you seeing from competition, particularly in Merck's Zepatier, from the pricing perspective? And then quickly on R&D side, do you plan to develop a doublet maintenance regimen? For example, recently Tivicay plus Edurant, the combination showed actually good results in heavily pretreated patients in the conference. Thank you. Kevin B. Young - Chief Operating Officer : So I'll take the first part in terms of pricing and competitive impact, very little in terms of our commercial payer areas because the contracts essentially were set up at the end of last year for the full year, so very little change in market share within the commercial payer segments. We still have a very strong position in VA with Harvoni and Sovaldi, particularly Harvoni. I think probably where we're seeing increased competitive activity is in the Medicaid setting where, as I described earlier, some of the smaller states are requesting contracts as they open up access. So I think that's probably where we see the competition. And again, because of our very strong value proposition, we hope we can be successful in the majority of those. But again, on occasions we may find that they go to the competition. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer : Ying, you asked a question about the pan-genotypic NS5A. So we're, of course, aware of the data that were presented at EASL. They looked fairly impressive. They had a number of genotypes with high SVR rates. However, what they're doing right now in Phase 3 is not looking at the eight-week treatment duration or genotypes in old patients. I would like to contrast this with our own triple combination, SOF/VEL/VOX, that John Milligan mentioned. We are looking essentially at two patient populations. One patient population is experienced that had previously failed other DAAs that treatment duration is for 12 weeks. And then we're looking at all genotypes, cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients, for eight-week treatment duration. And we have one study in particular that only looks at eight weeks of treatment duration in the most difficult to treat genotype 3 cirrhotic patients because that's still a population where SVR rates are still in the low 90%. And if we could push that up into the high 90%, that would be a step forward. So I think if our Phase 3 program, the data supports our Phase 2 results, then we will be a step ahead of all the competition. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ian Somaiya of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow up on the triplet opportunity within hep C. Specifically, Norbert, just I don't know if you could describe the proportion of patients that have maybe failed in the first round of antivirals, whether it be doublet therapy or SOF alone. So I don't know if there's a relevant pool that you can speak to. And then maybe it's more a question for Kevin. Just how do we think about the triplet and its impact on margin price share? Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer : So, Ian, as you know, we are doing essentially four studies with the triplet, what we call the triplet SOF/VEL/VOX. Two of them are in treatment-experienced patients, and what we would aspire to is to have this compound be the universal salvage regimen. Now, Kevin, maybe you could comment on what the proportion of patients is that would qualify with this. But something I can tell you, in Japan, there's a fairly large number of patients that have been treated with the Bristol-Myers GI NS5A regimen. I think if I remember this correctly, they have SVR rates in the Phase 3 study of about 80% or thereabouts. And there are about 9,000 patients now that we heard of that are treatment-experienced that had failed. And those 9,000 patients would immediately be candidates for our own studies. And I said, I want to say it again, the other two studies are eight weeks' treatment duration for all patients, all genotypes, cirrhotics and non-cirrhotics. Kevin? Kevin B. Young - Chief Operating Officer : It's a good question, Ian. We're waiting to see some of the obviously emerging clinical data. Right now, I think we've got a situation, certainly in the U.S. Japan with this resistant situation I think is perhaps quite unique in terms of the original use of the Bristol-Myers regimen. But I think we've got patients being cured to an incredibly high level with Harvoni. And now we've got the right treatment, I think, in (1:06:11). So I think in the U.S., perhaps in Europe, it will be far more modest, the opportunity. Having said that, it depends where we are with those products, our products with where the competition is, obviously what we decide to do in terms of the pricing strategy. I think most importantly, from a company point of view, we think this is the right thing to do and probably the last step in the whole story around hepatitis C to help treatment-experienced or failure patients. So I think first and foremost, we think this is the right thing to do for patients in need. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Alethia Young of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Let me be the thousandth person, Kevin, to say welcome back and it's great to have you here, two questions in the same vein. Just one on oncology, has this remained a focus for you guys as far as building assets there and building up that business as much as it was in the past when you talk about it? And secondarily, just, Norbert, with NASH, can you just talk about some of the data points coming up and like what's going on with the FXR program as well? Thanks. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer : So, Alethia, let me start off by firstly and then John Milligan will have to comment on it too. We are in oncology. We have now momelotinib at the end of the Phase 3 program. We should have data this year. If the data (1:07:30) application next year. We have the MMP9 in gastric cancer in Phase 3. We're looking at other solid tumors. And we're now finally, after sorting out the dosing, starting the first study in combination of PI3K and with BTK in CML. So with regards to NASH, we have now very interesting four modalities or four mechanisms that we're evaluating in NASH. And at least with three of them, we know that they're doing what they're supposed to do pharmacologically. We will have data this year on the ASK inhibitor that will include liver fat analyses along with histology. The FXR agonist is currently in a Phase 1/Phase 2a study. And by the way, we know about that compound already; that it has minimal systemic absorption, but there are systemic levels of FGF19. That was always our idea to have a compound that acts in the GI that releases FGF19. The FGF19 has the efficacy. And by that rationale, we both get decidedly other FXR agonist path. And then finally, we have \u2013 wait a moment, ASK inhibitor? Kevin B. Young - Chief Operating Officer : ACC. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer : ACC inhibitor, the Nimbus compound. And we know those data were presented at EASL that it reduces de novo lipogenesis. So what we're going to do based on these data is firstly with ASK, we could go into Phase 3 next year and with the other compounds into Phase 2 with the FXR and the ACC inhibitor, or even this year. John? John F. Milligan - President and Chief Executive Officer : I'd just follow up with Norbert's comment by saying, we are committed to oncology. We continue to be interested in assets, collaborations, and partnerships where we could enhance our ability to continue to sell these products. But where we are seeing good progress, as Norbert mentioned, our BTK inhibitor, which is we're developing with our partner from ONO, is now making its way to the clinic. And we've overcome some formulation challenges to allow us to go ahead. So that will be very, very, I think, an interesting avenue for us to continue to explore. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just wondering, kind of, two-parter. The first is just any opportunity to broaden your prescriber base on hep C. Kevin, would love your thoughts on that. And the second question relates to Genvoya. Can you just give us what percentage of the switches were from Atripla? Thanks. Kevin B. Young - Chief Operating Officer : Hey, Terence. First of all, in terms of any feature rates of market, I did mention Australia earlier, and that's an incredible story of treating and curing patients and amazing commitment by the government there. We are seeing more patients treated in Brazil. It's a lower price market, but we have seeing more. We are just beginning our launch in Mexico. So, yes, these are smaller markets. Typically, they are lower-priced. But those \u2013 if you like, those smaller ways are starting to work through. We are thinking carefully about China and how we launch there probably in a very modest, very focused way, very efficient way, should I say. So our expectations, I think, are very reasonable around China. So the second question in terms of switch, about 18% of the switch patients is from ATRIPLA. So I hope that gives you the number. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Lee for closing remarks. Sung Lee - Vice President Investor Relations : Great, thank you, Candace, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead, and the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on our future progress. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

My name is Candice, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Candice, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, a press release was issued with earnings results for the third quarter of 2016. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website. Joining today's call will be John Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Kevin Young, Chief Operating Officer; and Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer. Before we begin formal remarks, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website. I will now turn the call over to Robin. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thanks, Sung, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to share our results for the third quarter of 2016. I'll first review our financials, and Kevin, Norbert, and John will then make a few comments. Total revenues for the third quarter were $7.5 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.75. This compares to revenues of $8.3 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.22 for the same period last year. Product sales for the third quarter were $7.4 billion, down 10% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. These declines were due to lower HCV sales, partially offset by increased sales in HIV and other therapeutic areas. Sequentially, declines in our HCV sales in the U.S., Japan and Europe were partially offset by increases in U.S. HIV and other product sales. Turning to the U.S. Product sales for the third quarter were $5.1 billion, down 9% year-over-year. HCV product sales were $2 billion, down 37% year-over-year, driven primarily by lower patient starts for Harvoni and lower revenues per patient, primarily due to a higher percentage of sales to more deeply discounted segments. The decline was partially offset by demand for Epclusa, which was launched at the end of Q2 2016 and generated $593 million in its first full quarter of sales. Sequentially, our HCV product sales were down 12%. These sales were essentially flat compared to the second quarter, excluding the favorable adjustment to our HCV sales return of $279 million that we made last quarter. HIV and other antiviral sales increased 32% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. The quarterly revenues of $2.6 billion were positively impacted by strong uptake of our TAF-based regimen and a one-time favorable adjustment of $332 million to our rebate reserve, primarily related to our TDF-based regimen. Without the adjustment, U.S. HIV and other antiviral sales grew 15% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Turning to Europe. Product sales for the third quarter were $1.4 billion, down 16% year-over-year, primarily due to lower HCV patient starts and unfavorable currency movement. Sequentially, sales were down 12%, primarily driven by lower HCV patient starts and summer seasonality, consistent with the usual decreases in demand during the European summer holiday month. In Japan, product sales for the third quarter were $452 million, flat year-over-year, driven by higher sales of Harvoni, which was launched in September 2015, offset by mandatory price reductions for both Sovaldi and Harvoni, which we discussed during our last call. Sequentially, sales were down 27% as a result of lower Harvoni and Sovaldi patient starts. Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $981 million for the third quarter, up 38% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the progression of our clinical studies which included a $200 million milestone expense associated with our purchase of Nimbus. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the third quarter were down 8% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower branded prescription drug fee expense. From a balance sheet perspective, during the third quarter we generated cash flows from operations of $4.3 billion and ended the quarter with $31.6 billion in cash and investments, which is inclusive of the issuance of $5 billion of senior unsecured notes. We have a healthy balance sheet to invest in our pipeline and external opportunities. While our cash flows will remain strong, we do anticipate a sequential decrease in Q4 2016 due to required cash payments related to accrued government rebates as well as milestone payments associated with our R&D pipeline. Shareholder return via dividends and share repurchases year-to-date remain strong. In the third quarter, we repurchased 11.7 million shares for $1 billion under the $12 billion 2016 share repurchase program. For 2016, the total share repurchases through the third quarter were 110 million shares at a cost of $10 billion. Year-over-year, we have seen an 11% decline in our diluted shares, primarily driven by our share repurchases. Finally, we are reiterating our full year 2016 guidance which was revised on July 25, 2016 and summarized on slide 27 in the earnings results presentation available on our corporate website. As a reminder, guidance for product sales is subject to a number of uncertainties, including an uncertain global macroeconomic environment, adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce HCV spending, volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, inaccuracy in HCV patient start estimates, additional competitive launches in HCV, an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers, and a larger-than-anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments, such as DHS, FFS, Medicaid, and the VA. I would like to turn the call over to Kevin now. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Robin, and good afternoon, everyone. I am very pleased to take you through a solid set of operating results for the third quarter. Starting with HIV, Gilead continues to make significant steps in delivering improved single-tablet regiments to patients around the world. We have seen strong adoption of our TAF-based regiments in the U.S. and in the European markets where we have received reimbursement. In the U.S., of the nearly 840,000 people on antiretroviral therapy, approximately 80% receive a Gilead regimen. Genvoya is the most-prescribed regimen for both treatment-na\u00efve and switch patients. This month we expect cumulative prescriptions of Genvoya to surpass Atripla's prescription at the same point in time post-approval. This will make Genvoya the all-time most successful product adoption in its first year in the 30-year history of HIV therapy in this country. The uptick in Genvoya, Odefsey, and Descovy have largely been driven by the switch from Gilead's old STRs due to the improved safety profile of TAF. It is also encouraging to see a notable number of patients from non-Gilead therapies moving to TAF-based regimens. Approximately 10% of Genvoya switches are incremental to the Gilead HIV franchise. Turning to Europe. Total HIV and other antiviral revenue was $728 million, up 1% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Third quarter European pharmaceutical revenues are typically affected by summer seasonality. In Italy, Spain, and Portugal, we saw lower prescribing risk consistent with prior years. Genvoya has been launched in 18 markets in the EU, including Spain and Germany, where we are seeing rapid uptake, similar to the U.S. Descovy has been launched in nine markets and Odefsey has been launched in eight markets, the largest being Germany in both cases. We expect our TAF-based therapies to continue to grow in Europe, with Spain still early in its commercial launch of Genvoya. Pricing and reimbursement discussions are ongoing in France and Italy, with the goal of having these complete by year end. Guidelines historically have had a significant impact on prescribing patents. Genvoya is already listed as a preferred regimen in several HIV treatment guidelines, including the European AIDS Clinical Society, as well as country guidelines in Germany, the U.K., Spain, and Italy. I would like to make a few comments about HIV prevention and the use of Truvada for PrEP. The growth in people stocking Truvada points to the valuable role the therapy can play when used as part of a comprehensive strategy to prevent transmission. We estimate that in the U.S., approximately 80,000 to 90,000 people were using Truvada for this indication in the third quarter. We are also starting to see uses of PrEP in France, where approximately 2,000 people have been prescribed Truvada since it received reimbursement in January this year. We expect PrEP to continue to be a significant part of Gilead's growth in HIV going forward, particularly in the U.S. With the rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens, the potential of PrEP and our exciting pipeline programs, especially bictegravir, I'm very positive about the long-term lifecycle potential we have in HIV. Turning to HCV. Approximately 61,000 people in total began HCV therapy in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2016. This represents the fourth consecutive three-month period where patient starts have been in the 50,000 to 60,000 range. We estimate that more than 85% of treated patients in the most recent quarter received a sofosbuvir-based regimen. The uptick of Epclusa has been most encouraging in its first full quarter post-launch. Although it is important to point out that we have observed a small, yet noticeable, warehousing effect. As expected, the vast majority of Epclusa is being used in Genotype 2 and 3 patients according to our 12-week label. In terms of payer coverage, formulary reviews for Epclusa are on track. 11 state Medicaid programs have already added Epclusa for Genotype 2 and 3 patients, and most commercial and Medicare Part D plans are providing entrant coverage for Epclusa based on medical need. Finally, the VA has added Epclusa to their national formulary and have begun ordering. The 2017 Commercial and Medicare Part D contracting cycle is now essentially complete. And whilst I can't share with you plan-by-plan details, suffice to say that we are pleased with the picture for the coming year. Discussions with all major PBMs and MCOs proved to be productive and recognized the clinical leadership of Gilead's HCV options, especially as demonstrated in real-life settings. But barriers to access still remain, as Medicaid continues to be the outlier in terms of access, restricting coverage to only the more advanced patients. Turning to Europe. Total HCV revenue in the third quarter was $604 million, down 30% year-over-year and down 22% sequentially. This was driven by lower HCV patient starts. While overall patient starts declined, our market share remained largely unchanged across the major markets, with the exception of the U.K., which was slightly down for the quarter. We estimate that 21,000 patients started on a sofosbuvir-based regimen in the third quarter compared to 27,000 in the second quarter. At our last earnings, I described how we were observing lower patient starts in the early EU launch markets of Germany and France. Put simply, many of the high-need patients have been treated and cured. We are now starting to see this trend unfold in Southern European countries, particularly in Italy and in Spain. Performance in the region is also likely somewhat affected by summer seasonality, similar to the dynamics we observed in HIV. Epclusa has now been launched in Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark. I'm pleased to say that there have been the same positive reception as in the U.S. We expect to launch in the other large EU markets once pricing and reimbursement is in place by the second half of 2017. Not only does 12 weeks of Epclusa deliver incredibly high cure rates, but as a new standard of care, it is considerably cheaper than previously used interferon-free regimens, especially treating genotype 3. As I conclude my remarks on hepatitis C, it is very important to reiterate that more work needs to be done to identify and cure HCV-infected people around the globe. A key objective for Gilead is to appropriately raise disease awareness, highlight the importance of age-related testing and encourage linkage to specialty care. To help with this effort, we recently launched new educational campaigns in the U.S. and Japan to urge all individuals at risk for or living with HCV to talk to their health care provider. You may have seen our new advertisement on television here in the U.S. It debuted last week, and I am very pleased with the positive and responsible tone it takes to emphasize to people the need to be screened for a disease that can now be cured in as little as eight weeks. We have received numerous positive comments from advocacy groups, providers and, not least, the many people already cured of hepatitis C who want others like them to benefit. Moving on. One other liver disease that warrants some mention today is hepatitis B, for which we are well-prepared for the launch of TAF. With our PDUFA date coming, we are hopeful that we will have the opportunity to speak to physicians at the AASLD Meeting and in the field about the strong data for this product as soon as next week. Finally, as I highlighted last quarter, we have a very strong U.S. cardiovascular team that continues to deliver impressive results. Letairis and Ranexa revenue totaled $385 million for the quarter and surpassed $1 billion in the year-to-date. In closing, I'd like to reiterate the positive progress Gilead is making in addressing viral diseases. We will soon have treated 1.2 million HCV-infected individuals around the world, most of whom are now cured. By any measure, this is a profound contribution to global health care delivery. And in the field of HIV, not only are we effectively managing the disease with our new TAF-based regimens, but Truvada is helping more and more people avoid infection. I am confident that we will close out the year with continued strong financial performance underpinned by a passion for operational excellence and our focus on putting the patient first. I will now hand the call over to Norbert. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin. During the third quarter, a number of Phase II and Phase III studies concluded, providing insights into efficacy and safety of both approved and experimental Gilead agents in the areas of HIV, liver disease, inflammation, oncology and cardiovascular disease. Some of these results were disappointments, some were exciting successes. To start off with the disappointments. We now have the final analyses from three 96-week studies of the anti-LOXL2 monoclonal antibody, simtuzumab. The data indicate that, while safe and well-tolerated, there is no evidence of efficacy in one study in primary sclerosing cholangitis and in two studies in NASH. One NASH study was in patients with cirrhosis and one was in patients with liver (20:54) fibrosis. Consequently, we will not develop simtuzumab any further in these or any other indications. We will present these data at future conferences. As for GS-5745, an anti-MMP-9 antibody, we stopped a Phase II/III study in patients with ulcerative colitis because of the lack of efficacy. This decision for the planned interim DSMB analysis after the first 150 patients had been enrolled, that the study met pre-defined futility criteria. Also, and not unexpectedly, there was no evidence of benefit of GS-5745 in a Phase II study in patients with Crohn's disease. Consequently, we will not further pursue GS-5745 for ulcerative colitis or Crohn's. In these studies, GS-5745 was safe and well tolerated, and we're continuing to evaluate GS-5745 in rheumatoid arthritis as an add-on to anti-TNFs or other therapies. Eleclazine, or GS-6615, failed to meet its primary endpoint in a study of patients with ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or VT/VF, and implanted cardioverter-defibrillators. Patients were randomized to two doses of eleclazine or placebo. The primary endpoint was the number of electrical interventions, including shocks and pacing, by the implanted device. And there was no evidence of efficacy of eleclazine compared to placebo. Consequently, we will not develop eleclazine any further for VT/VF. Evaluation in long QT-3 syndrome and in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is continuing. But now to the excitement, starting with HCV. The pan-genotypic single-pill triple combination regimen of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, voxilaprevir, or I'll call it SOF/VEL/VOX, has been studied in four Phase III studies called POLARIS-1, 2, 3 and 4. POLARIS-1 and 4 evaluated the regimen in patients who had previously failed a direct-acting antiviral and included patients with cirrhosis. Treatment of these salvage patients with SOF/VEL/VOX resulted in SVR rates of 96% and 97%. The two other studies, POLARIS-2 and 3, compared the triple combination regimen in treatment-na\u00efve patients given for eight weeks to Epclusa given for 12 weeks. POLARIS-2 was open to all genotypes, whereas POLARIS-3 enrolled only genotype 3-infected individuals with compensated cirrhosis, where the unmet need is the greatest. In POLARIS-2, the SVR rates obtained with 12 weeks of Epclusa were numerically higher than those obtained with eight weeks of the triple combination, whereas in POLARIS-3, the SVR rates were comparable. Particularly in POLARIS-3, which involved the most difficult to treat Genotype 3-infected cirrhotic patients, Epclusa for 12 weeks resulted in 96% SVR rates. These results underscore the value of Epclusa as an excellent treatment option for patients across all genotypes and they also suggest that the future role of SOF/VEL/VOX will be for patients who previously failed an antiviral regimen. The full data from these studies will be presented at AASLD in a few weeks, and we will submit Marketing Authorization Applications to regulatory authorities imminently. Another exciting result was the anti-fibrotic effect observed with GS-4997, an investigational small molecule inhibitor of apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1, or ASK1. GS-4997 was shown to inhibit inflammation apoptosis and fibrosis in settings of increased oxidative stress associated with NASH in preclinical models. This Phase II clinical study involved 72 patients, two-thirds had F3-stage fibrosis and one-third had F2-stage fibrosis. There was evidence that treatment with GS-4997 for only 24 weeks resulted in fibrosis reversal and decreased fibrosis progression in a dose-dependent manner. At the highest dose tested, which was18 milligrams, 43% of patients showed at least a 1-point decrease in their fibrosis score compared to only 20% in the simtuzumab control arm. At the same time, 20% of the Simtuzumab-treated patients progressed to cirrhosis compared to only 3%, or one out of 30, at the 18-milligram dose. The full data from these studies will be presented at AASDL in a few weeks. Based on these exciting data, we will initiate discussions with regulatory authorities and plan to move GS-4997 into Phase III clinical development in patients with NASH. Based on the Phase II results, we intend to evaluate GS-4997 in patients with the highest unmet need, that means those with F3 and F4 stages of fibrosis. At the same time, we have two other compounds with different mechanisms currently in two Phase II studies in patients with NASH and fibrosis, and that is GS-9674, an FXR agonist, and GS-0976, an ACC inhibitor in the studies of 24-week and 12-week duration, respectively. Pending demonstration of single-agent efficacy and safety in these two Phase II studies, we plan to initiate combination studies with the three agents towards the middle of next year. In HIV, we're continuing to explore the utility of TAF-containing regimens in various uses and different populations. Last week, data from three Phase III studies were presented at the HIV Conference in Glasgow. 96-week data were disclosed from one study, where 663 virologically suppressed patients were randomized to either continue on their Truvada-based regimen or to switch to a Descovy-based regimen. In two other studies, 630 and 875 virologically suppressed patients on Complera and Atripla, respectively, were randomized to switch to Odefsey or stay on their current regimen. In all studies, switching to a TAF-based regimen was non-inferior with regards to efficacy, but was superior in regards to renal and bone laboratory safety parameters. The Phase III development of the single-tablet regimen of bictegravir F/TAF is continuing. Four Phase III studies are now fully enrolled and we anticipate unblinding these studies towards the middle of next year, with regulatory submissions planned for the third quarter of 2017. We also plan to present 48-week Phase II data on bictegravir F/TAF at the Scientific Meeting in the first quarter of 2017. In oncology, a Phase III study of GS-5745 in patients with gastric cancer is ongoing as well as a Phase II study in patients with gastric cancer in combination with nivolumab. We're also evaluating GS-5745 in other solid tumors. In addition, we have now completed two Phase I safety studies of our combination kinase inhibitors. We were able to establish safe doses of our PI3K inhibitor, idelalisib, in combination with our BTK inhibitor, GS-4059, and our Syk inhibitor, entospletinib, in combination with the BTK inhibitor, GS-4059. Consequently, we will now first evaluate the PI3K BTK combination with and without anti-CD20 therapy in relapsed refractory CLL patients in collaboration with the German CLL Study Group. We will also be announcing initial Phase Ib/II data on our Syk inhibitor, entospletinib, in acute myeloid leukemia at the upcoming ASH Conference in San Diego. We have entered into a collaboration with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society to provide entospletinib for their Beat AML Master Trial. This trial will employ the latest genomic technology to match specific AML mutations in newly-diagnosed patients over age of 60 with an appropriate investigational drug or drug combination. In summary, great progress has been made with some of our programs. The very nature of R&D is that you often face both closures and progress. Going forward, I'm pleased we now have the ability to focus our attention on development programs in NASH, inflammation, oncology, and HIV. We now have seven new molecules in advanced clinical development. The PDUFA date for TAF for HPV is coming up in a few weeks, and we plan to file an NDA before the end of the year on SOF/VEL/VOX for use as salvage therapy for patients who have failed a previous direct-acting antiviral. Four molecules are continuing in Phase III, that is momelotinib for myelofibrosis, bictegravir F/TAF, the single-tablet regiment for HIV infection, filgotinib for three separate indications, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's, and GS-5745 in gastric cancer. Finally, we plan to advance GS-4997 for NASH to Phase III. I would now like to turn the call over to John. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thanks, Norbert. I would like to make a few closing remarks before we get to your questions. We continue to have success with the important work we do in HIV and viral hepatitis. There's still a great need for innovation in these fields. Both of these include patients whose needs remain unaddressed and both represent global epidemics. Our researchers are working to bring to options to a wider range of patients than ever before. This includes people with HIV who've been on therapy for decades and may need to change their medication due to side effects, or patients who may be failing to fully suppress their virus due to the presence of resistance. Approaches our research teams are pursuing include new molecules for treating resistant virus, novel formulations in combinations that may be dosed infrequently and opportunities to cure HIV patients by clearing out the viral reservoirs from their bodies. Our innovative work in conjunction with our many partners has already allowed our HIV medicines to reach millions of patients worldwide. We're particularly excited about the role that TAF will play. With a small daily dose and improved side effect profile, it is ideal for resource-constrained areas of the world and requires only one-tenth of the manufacturing capacity to supply the same number of patients. In the area of viral hepatitis, the data now obtained with Epclusa suggests that we have an excellent option for the many parts of the developing world for genotyping HCV and determining the stage of disease can be difficult, if not impossible. With Epclusa, there's no difference in dosing for the different genotypes or stages of liver disease and so there's no need for these diagnostic procedures. We are working around the globe to rapidly introduce Epclusa as well as Sovaldi and Harvoni. Finally, in hepatitis B, as Kevin and Norbert mentioned, we are approaching the launch of TAF. HBV continues to be an under-treated disease despite the long-term data showing improvement of liver for people who remain on effective therapy. TAF provides an important new option for patients with chronic HBV, and we'll have the opportunity to introduce the product at the Liver Meeting in the coming weeks in Boston. We also recognize that treating such a prevalent disease chronically is a major global challenge, and we continue to seek ways to provide finite duration of treatment such that patients can control or eliminate the virus without having to endure a lifetime of treatment. Gilead's largest research effort is in the area of HBV cure. Beyond our work in antivirals, we are making great progress in new disease areas for Gilead. We are pleased to be able to share with you today our top-line data for GS-4997 in NASH. GS-4997 targets ASK1, a previously unexplored target for NASH. The data are very suggestive of strong anti-fibrotic activity after only a 24-week period of treatment. And we look forward to future in-depth discussions once the data are presented at AASLD. We think about GS-4997 as a potential backbone molecule, one that can be used alone or in combination. NASH is an understudied, but increasingly prevalent, disease. And Gilead's liver disease team now has three exciting molecules to move forward into clinical studies. We understand that there's a lot of work to do in providing both the rationale to the patient and to the payer as to the benefits of treating NASH. An active compound such as GS-4997 could really move this deal forward and we're in the process of designing comprehensive studies to demonstrate the health system benefits of treating such a prevalent and growing disease. In the area of inflammation, we are executing nicely on our development plan. Phase III studies of filgotinib in RA are up and running, and studies in Crohn's and ulcerative colitis have just begun screening patients in the first of these studies. I'm pleased with the progress we are making and the work of our teams and collaborators to get these trials up and running as quickly as possible. We're also looking forward to exploratory studies of filgotinib in a wider variety of inflammatory diseases so we can fully understand the potential of this specific JAK1 inhibitor. As you know, we are also focused on augmenting our portfolio with external opportunities, particularly in the field of oncology. However, our interest in partnerships and potential acquisitions is not limited to oncology, and we are considering opportunities where there is strong science and where we see the possibility of developing a truly differentiated product. We've been going through an extensive internal review of programs and opportunities, and an important aspect of our approach is that we remain open-minded, but disciplined. So while we have the balance sheet to execute on multiple opportunities, we will keep the bar high. With two months of the year remaining, I want to take the opportunity to thank the 9,000 employees of Gilead for their hard work and dedication. Every day, more than 10 million individuals around the world take a Gilead medication and every day our teams come to work to improve upon that number. Thank you for your time. And let's now open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Today's question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. And our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. John or Kevin, I've got one for you. I just wanted to ask about hep C, but in a broader context. So you guys have had flat patient numbers despite better access in the U.S., and revenue is down sequentially, but on payer mix. So the question is, how do you think about the return on investing continually in hep C, either commercially or in new products, versus, say, looking outwards and being more aggressive in a new therapeutic category? Thanks. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey, Geoff. It's Kevin. Let me just take maybe half a step back from your question and just a few more observations. I've got to tell you that I think we're really executing well in the area of hepatitis C. I've spent a lot of time this quarter with many Gileads and with several providers. And I think the variables that we can directly influence, we're really doing a good job on. Our market share is staying incredibly strong. We're ensuring access whilst preserving the value of our hepatitis C drugs, and we're executing on new versions coming to the market. I think you've seen that with Epclusa. And the area that we can less control but we can influence, you're now seeing some new activities from us in terms of unbranded awareness campaigns. And you may have seen our advertisement that came on the television just over a week ago. So I think, from my point of view, in terms of operational excellence, we're doing a very nice job. It is true that the treatments are staying about the same. Actually, I consider that very positive. Let's not forget that we're at treatment levels that are 2.5 times the treatment levels that were there before the Gilead regimens came to the market. So I take at the level of 50,000 to 60,000 patients as very good. The vast proportion of those are Gilead patients. Epclusa had a very big effect in this quarter, so it goes to show that there's still room for new patients, albeit that we're entering a high level of satisfaction. But with Harvoni for Genotype 1, both 12-weeks and now a high proportion at 8-weeks, and now Epclusa for the 2 and 3 patients. Yes, we have got patients being cured at very high levels. In terms of our triple, I do agree that it'll be a relatively small proportion of patients, but it's the right thing to do and it completes our whole picture for hepatitis C. So I think to have the range of products that we have, to have the efficacy that we have, is the right offering for healthcare. So we continue to move forward and I think we have a healthy franchise. And we are getting better access from particularly the commercial payers, although, as I pointed out and I often discuss with the team here, the Medicaid is still a little bit on the slow side in terms of access. But great progress as far as I'm concerned in the third quarter. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Geoff, it's John. The second part of your question was something about investing in this area versus other areas. So I would say from a pipeline perspective, with SOF/VEL/VOX being our fourth generation of HCV product now being approved, there really isn't much left in terms of unmet medical need. And so from a pipeline perspective, this is really the end of what we'll be developing in terms of HCV molecules and that will allow us then to turn our attention to the important aspects in our fibrosis and NASH franchises and our oncology franchises. So we've really largely turned our attention away from HCV to those areas already. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Brian Abrahams of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Norbert, a question on 4997. Wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the go-forward plan there, particularly with respect to a potential Phase III trial duration, and whether or not a fibrosis endpoint might be acceptable, just given the effects that you saw in such a short time period in Phase II and the plan to target more severe progressive patients. And then can you confirm that there were no baseline imbalances in the Phase II that might have influenced the fibrosis data or progression to cirrhosis data? Thanks. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hi, Brian. So the second question, yes, I can confirm that there were no baseline imbalances. And regarding the Phase III study, no, we're going to make the proposal to regulatory authorities to use just fibrosis as the endpoint. We feel very convinced that that's the right thing to do because, as you may know, fibrosis is the only histological correlate to clinical outcomes. There was a large study published a few years ago where they looked at baseline histology and they correlated histological variables with clinical outcomes. And steatosis didn't correlate, inflammation didn't correlate, ballooning didn't correlate. The only thing that correlated was fibrosis. So we are going to propose two Phase III studies, both looking at fibrosis 48-week as the endpoint. The other thing we're going do with the studies, in F3, F4 patients, again, the rationale is that that's where the unmet need is. And also since ultimately for full approval you will need some clinical endpoint, we think we can get there much faster maybe with a 96-week study even if we start off with F4 patients. But having all of that said, this all has to be agreed upon by regulatory authorities. We have a date with the FDA, but we have not discussed this with them yet. So stay tuned. Some time early next year I think we can update you on the exact plan. Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Thanks for taking the call. Sorry, I was on mute. Can I just ask \u2013 you made two comments related to HCV that I just want to get some more clarity on. You talked about that you're pleased with the 2017 payer cycle. Could you just tell us if we should expect any significant changes in pricing or not? And then can you describe what you think is the size of the Epclusa warehouse and if you think you've moved through that or you would expect to see more of that through the end of the year? Thanks. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey, Matt. It's Kevin Young. I'll take your second part first. Yeah, there was a small warehousing effect. We think that \u2013 and this is anecdotal and qualitative, we think that providers probably held people for a quarter, two to three-month period. So this is nothing like the warehousing that we saw with Sovaldi or with Harvoni. So we think it's largely a Q3 effect. It might go into the fourth quarter, into the quarter now, but we really think it's mostly a 2016 effect. In terms of our negotiations and contracts, I really can't make any specific comments. Obviously they're confidential. But we are pleased with the outcome. We feel we're in a strong position for 2017, and most providers will have very, very good access in the private and Medicaid, Medicare Part D setting to both Harvoni and Epclusa. So we think we're in good shape and our providers will have the Gilead options to look forward to giving to their patients as we have done in 2016. So feel good about that. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from John Scotti of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. John Scotti - Evercore Group LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask one on capital allocation, if I may. So last quarter you spoke about potentially having a more complete story of internal and also external programs by year end, and you've continued to be relatively light on the buyback in 3Q. So a couple things. Can you characterize right now your current appetite for M&A and if that's changed the current thinking more along the lines of larger transformative deals? Or should we expect a string of in-licensing deals similar to what we saw with filgotinib and Nimbus? And how should we think about the sense of urgency here given your comments and going into year end? Thanks a lot. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hi, John. It's John. I think you asked a capital allocation questions and switched to strategy. We'll try to answer that for you. So as we said in our opening comments, we're still very actively evaluating opportunities. We're actively evaluating a series of different partnerships. But as I said in my comments, we're going to remain disciplined and we're going to keep the bar high. You don't want the sense of urgency to overwhelm your discipline because then you'll do things that don't make long-term sense. And that's been the history in all businesses, and that's one we apply here. So we're currently very, very active. We'll do things when they make sense for us and not before then. And that's really as much as I can say. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Leerink Partners. Your line is now open. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thank you very much. Appreciate the question. Robin, just a couple for you, if we may. First, operating margin trending down by 200 basis points to 300 basis points a quarter. Is that something that we should anticipate continuing, or are there some variables in there? Secondly, just on Epclusa. Was there any channel inventory build in the reported number? And then lastly, how are you judging the share buyback? You spent $10 billion, as you pointed out, this year, and the average cost is around $90. Compared to other things that you might have invested in, how are you feeling about that buyback going forward? Thanks. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Sure, Geoff. So I'll start on a reverse order and address the buyback first. We really look at buybacks on a long-term perspective, which is pretty much what I mentioned during the last quarter call. So we're still very comfortable where we are. We did front-load a significant component of our share buybacks. As a matter of fact, I think just in the first quarter we did more than the entire three quarters of 2015. And we messaged very early on that we would see those decline towards the second half of this year, very much in alignment with John's comments on being prepared for M&A. It's still clearly part of our capital allocation strategy along with dividends. So I think balancing that with overall looking for growth is something that we're still focused on doing. And as John mentioned, these things take time to play themselves out. I'll let Kevin answer the inventory question. But I think to your question of operating margins, yeah, the quarterization of our margins do get impacted by revenue dynamics as well as expenses. Keep in mind, R&D had a $200 milestone payment this quarter included that. Overall, I think our margins still remain high \u2013 high relative to overall industry, et cetera. And we're comfortable with them, we're very prudent with expense management. You saw SG&A expenses down. I think the other thing you're slightly seeing is some mix changes between HCV and HIV. That has a little bit of an impact on our gross margins. But, overall, with the continued conversion of TAF, long term you'll continue to see that go down, but it will be impacted relative to HCV becoming a smaller component of our total revenue. And I can't really give guidance on our gross margins, but I think the bar still remains high for them and we still remain a very disciplined spending type of organization. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah, Geoff, just to comment on Epclusa. If you recall, we launched Epclusa in the last week in quarter two. So that's when our opening inventory went in. Like any growing product, major wholesalers tick up their inventory basically because they've got a standard calculation for days on hand. So basically that just ticks up as a product grows, or indeed comes down as a product \u2013 comes down, as likely Sovaldi, because it's now becoming Epclusa, will in the future. So there was nothing unnatural about inventory for Epclusa in the third quarter. But as I said, we did get a very nice bump in usage from a small warehousing of patients. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Corey Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Good afternoon, guys. And thanks for taking my question. John, I wanted to go back to your comments on the strategic question you just got. When you talk about having a high bar in the M&A front, does that mean you see a lack of interesting opportunities out there that just don't meet that bar? Or is this more of a price disconnect given the continued volatility in the market? Thanks. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Discipline has both components to it. There are a number of things that I think are probably too early for us to take part in. There are a number of things that I think are just overpriced. And so it's been a combination of those two things looking backward. Going forward, we'll have to see what makes sense for us and where we're willing to go to bring in new products. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask a question on patient volumes in hep C, specifically as it relates to slide 41, I guess. Previously I would have thought that changes in payer access would have opened up the availability of these drugs to get reimbursed for the healthier F0s and F1s. I guess with patient volumes flattish, are you seeing these F0s and F1s coming in, are they getting treated? Or is your bottleneck there? They come in and they don't get treated? Just wanted to understand your dynamic on that and whether you think that that's going to drive some positive development of volumes. And then in Europe the same question. Europe declined from 27,000 down to 21,000. How do you think that plays out I guess going forward? What are the dynamics there for volumes? Thanks so much. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hi, Michael. Two great questions. Let me try to deal with those in the order. So the first the U.S. If you look at our slide, actually the percentage of F0s to F2s has increased over time. It was sort of 50% a little while ago, and now it's up to 60%. So, clearly, a fitter patient, they're less sick, are being treated. And of course, that's as a result of coverage. But I want to say that the patient journey, I think, is becoming longer in the U.S. now. If you think about it, patients really are starting further back because they are healthier. We are continuing to see approximately 30,000 patients coming into specialist care, so in other words, 90,000 patients a quarter. 60,000 of those are coming out of the other side and are being treated and cured. That's probably not a bad ratio in itself. Not every patient is treated and not every patient is immediately treated. Now, we shouldn't forget that sometimes patients drift in and out of specialist care. Some patients have compounding factors that complicate the start of therapy, most notably, drug use or alcohol use. And the patients who are just less sick have less motivation themselves and the physician has less motivation to really push those sort of therapy. And lastly, the paperwork and the administrative process for authorization is still there, like it is with any specialist product. So I think those are mostly the dynamics and it's mostly around the patient being less time in the physician's practice. They're not patients that have been held for a long time. They're not patients that failed one or two prior therapies and a great urgency by the physician. In terms of Europe, as I said, we did see a down tick in the patients treated in the Southern European markets, primarily Italy and Spain. And I think that's because they are working through the sicker patients and becoming more like France and Germany. There still are more patients in the Southern European markets, but I do think they are clearing the most obvious patients to treat and cure. And I want to emphasize that market share has stayed very, very solid in those markets. And whilst there's not an obvious mechanism through advertising, television advertising, in the European markets, we are doing a lot of partnership with KOLs, with societies, with patient groups, to again try to encourage the right screening practices and the right transfer of patients into specialist care. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Citi. Your line is now open. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thank you for the question. So just to ask the HCV question from a fourth quarter and payer perspective. I remember last fourth quarter, you started to see hints of changes in HCV. So given it looks like the U.S. has stabilized, are you seeing anything that hints that payers could change how they're viewing hep C, or any changes in fourth quarter that you're seeing that could influence 2017? And then given you maintained guidance, how are you thinking now about providing \u2013 what kinds of guidance you might provide in 2017 to help investors feel comfortable that you can predict going forward? I know you can't give guidance, but can you give any hints on how you're thinking about giving us some color next year? Thanks. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hi, Robyn. I'll take the first part. I think, again, come back to the quality of the discussions that we had for 2017 contracting. And I think they were very good. Let's not forget the fact that Gilead are in a very strong place by virtue of our Harvoni being in a good proportion of patients in eight-week therapy. So it's a very big advantage for us and I think that's really appreciated from the point of view of managing costs from a commercial payer. We didn't see much change in the ratio of the public to private payer in the third quarter. It was still about 45% of patients who were covered as a public patient as opposed to a commercial or Medicare Part D plan. Part of the commercial part of the market is, of course, the VA. The VA was a little bit lower in the third quarter versus the second quarter. They still seem to be very enthusiastic, very engaged in recalling patients. But I think that's perhaps one of the variables that will unfold in 2017 is the VA and their continuing ability to recall and treat patients. But I think with our efforts around highlighting the CDC and need to treat the Baby Boomers and the activity of all the companies involved in hepatitis C, I'd like to think that we can continue our progress in 2017. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So Robyn, it's Robin. I'll take the second part of that question. I think, as we said, this is a curative market, HCV, and it's difficult to predict. And Kevin just outlined this patient journey taking a longer bit of time and just changing dynamics. And we spent a lot of time this fall working through the planning cycle, figuring out what that means around 2017 and beyond. Obviously, I can't give the answer yet, but how we guide will again depend on our ability to bracket the risk and opportunities around those dynamics and what those mean. It continues to change and it's something that we monitor very closely. But that patient flow, as Kevin said, is something that's just very difficult for us to control. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah, I'd also add, Robin, if I might, how solid and good we feel about HIV going into next year with that chronic model and the uptick of our TAF-based regimens. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ying Huang of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one maybe is for Kevin. Our channel checks indicated that VA is paying about $15,000 to $17,000 per patient. Do you think that's the absolute floor for HCV pricing? And then another question for John and Robin. Sounds like you guys have a really high bar for acquisitions. If you don't deploy capital in acquisitions, would you consider hiking dividends to a much higher level, like 5% to 6%, so that a lot of investors would be willing to take this off a (1:01:21) dividend payment? Thank you. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hi, Ying. It's Kevin. I apologize, but in terms of commenting on our net pricing to the various channels, to the various constituents, it's not something that we directly comment on, so I couldn't go any further than that at this time. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah, Ying. And I'll take the second half. As we said, the bar is high, but we're very engaged and remain engaged in M&A. When we think about our overall capital allocation, we wouldn't want to do anything that would constrain us and reduce our flexibility to purchase if we found something that we thought could really grow our top line. So we talk with our board all the time about dividend increases and dividends in general as well as share repurchases, and that's something that we'll continue to do. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. And unfortunately it's another one on HCV pricing for you, Kevin. You mentioned two factors that impact the average per patient price that have been changing. One is the public versus private payer mix, which you said changed over the last year, but maybe stabilized now, and then also the rebates given to private payers. You didn't really discuss those too much on this call, but in the past your predecessor said that he expected the rebates to actually increase when Merck entered the market next year. Some of your comments today could suggest the opposite. So I guess just curious for 2017, how should we think about those two factors? Do you think public versus private has plateaued? Is 45% the number we should be thinking about for 2017? And then on the rebates to the private payers, should we continue to expect those to tick up in 2017? Or is your feeling different now that you've gone through the negotiation cycles? Thanks. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Difficult for me to comment in any great detail, Phil, on either of those questions. I'll take the commercial first. They have gone well. As I keep emphasizing, the advantage we have in eight weeks \u2013 think about it. 45% right now of Harvoni patients, genotype 1 patients, are receiving eight weeks. So if you think about 45% of genotype 1 with just that eight weeks, that's a very good economic offering for our payers that they really appreciate. So I believe we've done very well in our position going into 2017. In terms of the ratio between public and private, again, very difficult for me to make a prediction. VA did come down a little bit, but there was an increase, just a tick up, to replace that by Medicaid. I made the comment that the Medicaid opening is really slower than we would like, but I think there may be that change in mix going forward. Difficult to predict VA. VA is still a big part of the public, and we'll just have to see. It's very impressive what they've done and I know they're very committed and they feel that they haven't done their job yet. We, and that's Gilead, will estimate that between 35% and 40% of patients in the VA system have been treated to date. So still a lot of work to do and I think they want to do it. So 45%, 55%, seems to have been the level for the last couple quarters and not entirely clear if that's going to be maintained into 2017. But seems reasonable to me. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks helpful. Thanks for taking the question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Alethia Young of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk a little bit about Genvoya launch, maybe how it's faster than even the Atripla launch, which obviously a very good launch. Maybe if you can just frame how doctors are looking at this. Are they looking at it more as just for everyone that comes to the doctor, they just go and get this drug? Or just give us some more flavor on the dynamics. Thanks. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey, Alethia. Thanks for an HIV question. I really appreciate it. Alethia, I was at our International Advisory Board a couple of weeks ago, and we had some of the foremost HIV doctors from around the world. And it was absolutely unanimous the commitment to switching patients. All things being equal, particularly in terms of pricing, physicians see the benefit in terms of bone and kidney from the point of view of TAFs. So I think there's an awful strong commitment. Let's not forget that in most practices now, half the patients are over the age of 50 and they've been on long-term therapy and physicians just see a natural and fairly straightforward switch going on. I really didn't think I'd ever see an uptake quicker than Atripla. As you remember, there were the components of Atripla that could just be put together and the patient switched. These are slightly different with Genvoya because it's a switch of regimen. So I'm delighted with the way it's going. 80% of Genvoya comes from switches, and right now half of those switches are from Striva, (1:07:38) which is the natural TDF-to-TAF switch. So my expectation is that we'll continue to convert patients. I'm super enthusiastic about it. And once we get more countries online in Europe, I think we can have that same expectation. Germany's going great. Spain's going great. And we're on the threshold of getting the most important market up and running, and that's France. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just wondering if you guys can comment on the GSK ViiV doublets for HIV. Maybe just help frame for us how to think about that if those are successful in either treatment or maintenance setting. Would you look to explore your own doublet regiment, or do you think you've already set a high enough bar there? Thank you. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Terence, the debate in with bictegravir is not doublet or triplet. We're developing bictegravir F/TAF because it has three excellent components that have proven safety and enormously high efficacy. If you look at the ViiV Triumeq compound, of course that continues abacavir. So in that scenario, there is an incentive to get rid of abacavir and go to a doublet, as you call it. But in our case, we have no incentive whatsoever to do that. I would like to point out it's an interesting strategy. It's a potential competitor. The only thing I would like to point out, the safety efficacy has to be still proven in a larger patient population, number one, and, number two, in a more diverse patient population, particularly in patients with high viral load. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ian Somaiya of BMO Capital Markets. You line is now open. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks for taking my question. Just a question for you maybe, Robin, on just R&D spend going forward. The filgotinib program, Phase III programs, may in aggregate cost about $1 billion. You're about to embark on a fairly sizable NASH program. Just how should we think about R&D spend going forward? Are there any files that are completing that might provide an offset? Just if you could give us some color related to that. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah. So maybe, Ian, I'm going to answer the first question and Robin can join in. So as we indicated before, our hepatitis C research is winding down or the development is winding down. Really with this SOF/VEL/VOX, this will be our last development candidate. And we have spent over the last three years probably most of our money on hepatitis C, so that's winding down. And also on HIV coming down because bictegravir F/TAF is going to be our last single-tablet regimen for a broad patient population. And that I think will offset the increased spending in the other areas, as you pointed out, filgotinib and also oncology. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah. I think Norbert summed it up, Ian. I'd only add that I think the rigor remains very internally high within Gilead as well. We're always making the various trade-offs. And we look to do the right thing scientifically, so you could see variably in cost. But overall, there's still a high bar internal relative to how we allocate our research spend. But a lot of our projects ongoing, as mentioned, will be paid for with a decline in some of the larger products we've had with HIV and HCV. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Jim, are you there? Jim? Operator : Again, Jim Birchenough, your line is open. Please check your mute button. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: I think that's it, Candice. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Sung Lee for closing remarks. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Candice. Thanks, everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead. And the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on our future progress. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

Jim Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Gilead Sciences fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. My name is Chelsea, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Chelsea, and good afternoon everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with the earnings results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website. The speakers on today's call will be : John Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kevin Young, Chief Operating Officer. Also in the room with us for the Q&A session are Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and Jim Meyers, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Operations. Before we begin formal remarks, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the latest SEC disclosure document and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website. I will now turn the call over to Robin. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Sung, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to share our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. I'll first review financials and Kevin and John will make a few comments. 2016 was a productive year for Gilead with strong performance across the HIV and cardiopulmonary franchises. The year was not without its challenges, notably navigating the changing dynamics of the HCV market in countries around the world. We continue to be an operationally and financially efficient organization with high operating margins and a healthy balance sheet as 2017 begins. Total revenues were $7.3 billion for the fourth quarter 2016, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.70. This compares to revenues of $8.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.32 for the same period last year. For full year 2016, total revenues were $30.4 billion, down 7% year over year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings was $11.57 per share for the year, down from $12.61 per share for the same period last year. Product sales for the year were $30 billion, down 7% year over year driven by lower HCV sales, partially offset by increased sales in HIV and other therapeutic areas. Turning to the U.S. Product sales for the year were $19.3 billion, down 9% year over year. HCV product sales were $8.4 billion, down 32% year over year driven primarily by lower Harvoni demand, higher discounts and payer mix. Within HCV sales, Epclusa, which was launched in June of last year, achieved $1.6 billion of sales in 2016. HIV and other antiviral product sales for 2016 were $9.1 billion, up 27% year over year due to strong uptake of our TAF-based regimens. Turning to Europe, product sales for the year were $6.1 billion, down 15% year over year primarily due to lower HCV patient starts and unfavorable currency movement. In Japan, product sales for the year were $2.5 billion, up 31% year over year primarily driven by higher sales of Sovaldi and Harvoni, which were launched in Japan in May 2015 and September 2015 respectively. The increases were partially offset by the mandatory price reduction on our HCV products of 32% effective last March. Turning to expenses for the full year 2016. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $3.7 billion, up 32% compared to the prior year, reflecting the continued progression of the product pipeline including milestone payments related to advancing clinical studies and the purchase of an FDA priority review voucher. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $3.2 billion, which represents a slight decrease compared to the prior year, driven by lower branded prescription drug fee expenses partially offset by expenses to support new product launches and geographic expansion. Turning to the Idenix Merck litigation matter, which is ongoing. As of December 31, 2016, we have not recorded any charges to our financial statement, as we believe it is not probable under accounting rules that the company will incur a loss on this matter. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K will contain detailed disclosures on the amount of potential damages and royalties Gilead could owe Merck in the event the appellate court upholds the jury's verdict. Turning to cash flow. We generated $16.7 billion in cash from operations for the full year 2016 and $3.5 billion for the quarter. We continued to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the fourth quarter, we utilized $1 billion in cash to repurchase 13 million shares, bringing our total 2016 share repurchases to $11 billion and 123 million shares. Earlier today, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.47 to $0.52 per share, which will become effective in the first quarter of 2017. This increase underscores the confidence of the board and management in the strength of the business and future cash flows. In 2017, leveraging our capital to pursue external opportunities to expand our R&D pipeline is our primary focus. As a result, we will reduce the level of capital dedicated to share repurchases this year and focus a greater percentage of our shareholder return on our dividend. We currently have $9 billion remaining under our 2016 share repurchase authorization, and we'll utilize it over time to maintain our current share count. Over the longer term, we may be opportunistic with additional share repurchases. Finally, I would like to cover our full-year 2017 non-GAAP financial guidance, summarized on slides 21 through 25 in the earnings presentation available on our corporate website. Given the unique dynamics of the HCV market and patient starts, which have the greatest impact on our HCV revenues, we have split our net product sales guidance between non-HCV and HCV net product revenue. Non-HCV net product sales are expected to be in the range of $15 billion to $15.5 billion. HCV net product sales are expected to be in the range of $7.5 billion to $9 billion. Our guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties, including: the accuracy of our estimates of HCV patient starts in 2017; unanticipated pricing pressures from payers and competitors; lower than anticipated market share in HCV; slower than anticipated growth in our HIV franchise; an increase in discounts, chargebacks, and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; a larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments such as PHS, FSS, Medicaid, and the VA; market share and price erosion caused by the introduction of generic versions of TDF and the fixed-dose combination of FTC/TDF outside the U.S. later this year; an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; potential amendments to the Affordable Care Act or other government action that could have the effect of lowering prices or reducing the number of insured patients; as well as volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Slide 24 provides further information on Gilead's estimate of HCV total market patient starts across key commercial geographies, which is the primary factor used in developing our 2017 HCV product sales guidance. We expect our non-GAAP product gross margins to be in the range of 86% to 88%. We expect our non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion. We expect our non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion. For the full year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 25% to 28%. We anticipate the full-year diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related, stock-based compensation, and other expenses to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.91 per share. I would like to now turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Robin, and good afternoon everyone. Before beginning my comments on the quarter, I'd like to formally introduce our new Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations, Jim Meyers, who joins the earnings call team. Jim has been at the company for 20 years and has been instrumental in building out the company's commercial operations in North America, including leading successful product launches across the company's portfolio of products. I've personally worked with Jim for more than 10 years and can vouch for his unique insights into the complexities of the various markets and therapeutic areas for which we serve patients. Now I would like to provide an update on our commercial performance during the fourth quarter and share a few highlights from markets around the world. Let me say from the outset that I see the very highest levels of operational excellence across Gilead, people every day supporting best-in-class products in viral, cardiovascular, and pulmonary diseases. But as I will describe in some detail, there are very different external dynamics when comparing treatments for chronic diseases like HIV with treatments that can cure a disease like hepatitis C. Starting with HIV, without question, 2016 was one of our strongest years, led by the rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens. In the U.S., total HIV and other antiviral revenue was $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 20% year over year and down 6% sequentially. As a reminder, third quarter results benefited from a one-time favorable adjustment of $332 million to rebate reserves, primarily related to TDF-based regimens. Excluding this one-time adjustment, there was a 7% sequential increase in the fourth quarter, driven by robust underlining growth and some inventory build consistent with prior years. Genvoya, our first TAF-based single-tablet regimen, surpassed $1 billion in revenue in its first year. No other HIV product has achieved this level of success, and this performance is a testament to the clinical profile of TAF in combination with elvitegravir in one tablet. As highlighted on slide 33, Genvoya quickly became the most prescribed regimen across all U.S. treated HIV patient groups within nine months of launch. At the end of 2016, TAF-based regimens made up 37% of Gilead's HIV prescription volume in the treatment market. This is remarkable considering that Genvoya was launched a little more than a year ago, and Odefsey and Descovy have been on the market for just nine months. Most patients on these products switch from Gilead's older regimens due to the improved safety profile of TAF. Additionally, an estimated 10% of patient switches are coming from non-Gilead therapies, resulting in incremental growth for the franchise. Turning to Europe, total HIV and other antiviral revenue was $705 million in the fourth quarter, down 6% year over year and down 3% sequentially. This was driven by negative foreign exchange and a full quarter impact of an imposed price reduction in France. Strong uptake of Genvoya continues across launch markets in Europe, including Germany, Spain, and the UK. In Spain, Genvoya is the most prescribed regimen for switch patients and the second most prescribed regimen for treatment-naive patients. And just last week, I am delighted to say that Genvoya began its commercial introduction in France. As many of you know, France is the largest developed HIV market outside the U.S. Finally, to complete the European major market picture, we hope to have Genvoya introduced in Italy by early quarter two. Turning to Descovy and Odefsey outside the U.S., we now have the products available in 13 and 11 countries respectively. Additional launches are anticipated in 2017 as pricing and reimbursement discussions continue. Beyond TAF, there continues to be a strong uptake for the use of Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. At the end of 2016, approximately 110,000 people in the U.S. were using Truvada for this indication. When used in combination with other prevention strategies, Truvada for PrEP can have a meaningful impact on public health by helping to reduce HIV transmission rates. The majority of PrEP prescribing to date is concentrated in four cities where awareness is high, most notably San Francisco. The city recently announced a reduction in HIV infection rates as a result of greater testing, the use of anti-retrovirals for treatment, and the adoption of PrEP. There is an opportunity to replicate this success in other areas across the United States, and Gilead has been encouraged to play a more prominent role in PrEP education and has done so via the hiring of a field-based team. We believe that Truvada for PrEP will continue to be an integral part of our growth in HIV in the U.S., as communities embrace the public health benefits of prevention. Before leaving HIV, one event that should be highlighted in 2017 is the loss of the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate exclusivity in some countries outside the U.S. We have forecasted the financial impact of this event on our non-HCV sales guidance as shown in Slide 22 referred to earlier by Robin. Nevertheless, we believe the rapid adoption of TAF for HIV treatment and the uptake in Truvada for PrEP in the United States underpin a strong Gilead growth trajectory some 15 years after the introduction of Viread in 2001. Turning to HCV, in the U.S., total HCV revenue was $2 billion in the fourth quarter, down 15% year over year and down 1% sequentially. Total HCV treatment starts in the U.S. for the full year 2016 were an estimated 231,000, approximately 25,000 less patient starts than in 2015. There were a few one-time events that impacted this number in 2016. Notably, one, the opening of access of two of the largest U.S. commercial payers which happened in quarter one. Two, the increase in the number of patients treated through the VA system, especially in quarter two. And three, the treatment of genotype 2 and genotype 3 warehouse patients following the approval of Epclusa in the second half of 2016. Since we do not anticipate the same or similar factors repeating themselves this year, our expectation is that patient starts in 2017 will be lower than in 2016. Above and beyond the factors I just cited, the decline we expect is also due to a change in the profile of patients coming into treated care. A greater number of patients have less advanced disease, and thus there is less urgency to begin using curative DAAs like Harvoni and Epclusa. In addition, an increasing percentage of untreated patients face circumstances that favor delay such as ongoing drug or alcohol use, co-morbidities or unstable living conditions. Turning to Europe, total HCV revenue in the fourth quarter was $628 million, down 26% year over year and up 4% from the previous quarter. The sequential performance was primarily a reflection of the small bounce back in patient starts, following normal summer seasonality in markets like Spain and Italy. Despite the year-end pickup, we expect patient starts to continue to decline in 2017. Countries like Germany, France and the UK are fast exhibiting the same characteristics as the U.S. Spain and Italy continued to experience budgetary constraints, and the treatment of F0 to F2 patients in these countries has been limited. In Japan, product sales for the fourth quarter were $314 million, down 77% year over year, and down 31% sequentially due to the decline in patient starts and the entry of another company's product to the market. Our local intelligence punched us some unique dynamics in Japan that are potentially behind the profound decline in patient starts relative to other countries. First, recall that approximately 40,000 patients were treated with another DAA regimen prior to the launch of Sovaldi, decreasing those who were very sick and warehoused. Second, up to 40% of HCV infected patients in Japan are over 80 years old and often under the care of a general practitioner, not a specialist, who better understands the importance of treating patients regardless of age. Third, there is a lower awareness of hepatitis C and the fact that there is a cure among the general Japanese population. Before leaving our HCV results, I'd like to return to my theme of earlier. This disease has unique dimensions, the most important of which is that it can be cured. And thanks to Harvoni, it can be cured in as little as eight weeks in a genotype 1 patient. Whilst earlier HCV therapies had their limitations, you can still observe the dynamics that a cure has on patient starts following the introduction of a new class of medicines as shown in slide 37. As we look as best we can at the near-term horizon, we see 2017 total HCV patient starts declining relative to 2016 in all major markets. By comparison, the U.S. numbers are still vastly higher relative to treatment levels before the advent of DAAs. Gilead's role as market leader is to appropriately work with the various components of HCV care, providers, professional associations and infected individuals where allowed, to bring patients into specialists' care and successfully cure them of a destructive virus. Moving on to hepatitis B, Vemlidy, our TAF-based therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B was approved by the FDA in November, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in December and the European Commission last month. This is the first medication approved to treat chronic hepatitis B in nearly a decade. While still very early, we are pleased with the uptake of Vemlidy in the U.S. Initial feedback from healthcare providers suggests that they strongly believe the long-term safety profile of Vemlidy represents an important new development for people living with chronic hepatitis B. Finally, as I highlighted last quarter, our U.S. cardiovascular team continues to deliver impressive results. Letairis and Ranexa revenue totaled $436 million for the quarter and achieved nearly $1.5 billion for the year. I would now like to turn the call over to John. John? John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thanks, Kevin. I'd like to make a few closing remarks before we get to your questions. Gilead was very productive in 2016, launching four important new therapies, two for people with HIV and two for the treatment of viral hepatitis. As mentioned by Robin and Kevin, we are very pleased with the progress of Gilead's TAF-based regimens based on the benefits they provide. With the successful launches of Odefsey and Descovy, we now offer three different and important new options for patients with HIV. We continue to innovate in HIV, and next week we will present data from a Phase 2 study of bictegravir, Gilead's non-boosted integrase inhibitor. The 48-week study compared bictegravir to dolutegravir, each given in combination with F/TAF and the data will be presented at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Seattle. The detailed results are embargoed at this time and we look forward to sharing the data with you as soon as we're allowed to do so. CROI is one of the most important meetings for HIV research and this year's meeting gives us an opportunity to present promising data from multiple research and clinical programs aimed at addressing the unmet needs of people living with HIV. Included in the conference will be data from our programs on novel, long-acting agents, next generation nucleotides for highly treatment-experienced patients, and new data on our efforts to cure HIV patients. Gilead remains firmly committed to R&D focused on improving the lives of people with HIV. Similar to HIV, we have revolutionized the treatment of viral hepatitis by providing medicines that cure chronic hepatitis B infection or managing chronic hepatitis B more effectively. Gilead's HCV therapies offer cure rates between 95% and 99% regardless of genotype with fewer side effects and a far less treatment time than prior treatments. When we launched Sovaldi in late 2013, most of the patients had quite advanced liver disease and had been under care for many years. In nearly every country, the healthcare system expanded to unprecedented levels in order to care for these sicker patients as time was running out for many of them. Following this great success, patients seeking care today have a quite different profile and these patients tend to have less advanced disease and require more time for workup prior to initiating treatment. Additionally, many have co-morbidities or other issues that may prevent treatment until resolved. As a result, our analysis situation predicts that fewer people will be treated in 2017 than in 2016 in the United States, Europe, and Japan. These healthcare systems each should see lower spending in this category as a result. We continue to work to ensure patients have access to HCV medications. For example, in the U.S., we've offered very generous rebates and discounts into the various entities that reimburse for prescription drugs. Contrary to the sometimes misleading headlines citing our list pricing, in 2016 in the U.S., the volume-weighted average price for Harvoni was reduced to less than $15,000 per bottle inclusive of discounts and rebates. This average was skewed by the significant discounts provided to Medicaid and the VA and the 340B program. For example, our average price per bottle to Medicaid is less than $10,000 for states that are opening up access to all patients. Prices for 2017 are expected to be similar. Despite the fact that prices of direct-acting antiviral HCV medications have never been lower, getting payer access to these therapies is often an onerous process for patients and doctors. With the declining rates of patient starts, it's our hope that progress can be made by next year to simplify the access process for patients with less advanced liver disease. Patients who are early in their disease have the highest cure rates and often require only eight weeks of treatment, resulting in an even lower cost per cure. There is still one unmet medical need in HCV treatment : patients who fail direct-acting antivirals. Gilead filed a new drug application for its single-table regimen of SOF/VEL/VOX in December and the FDA granted priority review status with a set target review date of August 8, 2017. A market authorization application in the EU was filed in January. If approved, SOF/VEL/VOX would be the first STR for HCV patients who have failed prior treatments. Our NASH programs continue to advance. We believe that NASH is a growing unmet need around the world with data suggesting that perhaps 3 million people in the United States have advanced NASH with fibrosis. We're committing significant R&D resources towards this public health problem. At AASLD in November, we presented positive Phase 2 data on selonsertib, showing both an improvement in fibrosis scores, and a decrease in progression of disease after only 24 weeks of treatment. Selonsertib is a first-in-class ASK-1 inhibitor and we were pleased with the efficacy seen at a relatively low once-daily dose. Based on these promising results, we consulted with regulatory agencies and initiated two Phase 3 studies of selonsertib. One is in patients with F3, and one is in patients with F4 fibrosis scores. Patients with F3 and F4 fibrosis have the greatest medical need, and impose the highest cost on the healthcare payers. In addition, patients with NASH and F4 fibrosis have a median life expectancy of only five years. We're also continuing with two other promising agents for the treatment of NASH and other metabolic diseases, GS 0976, an ACC inhibitor, and GS 9674, an FXR agonist. As these programs advance through this year, we may also begin to look at the combinations to determine if two mechanisms, one that hits the metabolic dysfunction of hepatocytes and one that reverses fibrosis, can improve efficacy with an acceptable safety profile. In the area of inflammation, Phase 3 studies of Filgotinib in rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are now underway and enrolling. Filgotinib has a very large safety database of more than 1,400 patient years, and has proven to be well tolerated. With this once-daily dosing and safety profile, we'll continue to look at Filgotinib across a range of different inflammatory diseases where JAK1 activity is implicated, and we have plans to initiate up to six phase 2 studies during the year. 2017 marks Gilead's 30th anniversary. Over the past three decades, Gilead's many innovative products have helped transform the HIV infection from a fatal and debilitating disease into a chronic manageable condition, giving individuals with HIV a chance to live out their lives. More than 10 million people are now receiving a Gilead-based HIV regimen every day. We are proud of our ability to help HIV patients access their medications globally. In the U.S., for example, we've worked closely with public health systems to ensure access. In fact, Gilead has frozen prices to the federal and state funded AIDS Drug Assistance Program since 2008, and state Medicaid programs pay less for Truvada today than at launch in 2004. Gilead's commitment to these important safety net programs has allowed them to expand over the years, now providing coverage to slightly more than half the people living with HIV in the United States. Over the last several months, I've had the opportunity to talk with public and health policy experts, healthcare providers and industry leaders about the various access that remains, and how we can collectively help address them. We at Gilead will continue to seek solutions so that today's medicines can be accessed by all the people who need them, while supporting the innovative needs for fighting tomorrow's public health problem. Finally, we will continue to maintain our strong operating and financial discipline and focus our efforts in 2017 on continuing to build out our pipeline, aggressively progressing internal programs and pursuing partnerships or acquisitions that are the right strategic fit with our company. I'm confident in the future of Gilead, and I'm looking forward to sharing with you the many accomplishments across this organization in 2017. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees. It's because of your commitment and drive that we're able to help millions of people live healthier, more fulfilled lives. Thank you for your time. And let's now open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : And our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is now open. Geoffrey C. Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for the question. So, John, when I look at the year on year trends on hep C over last year, they're obviously weaker as you progress through the year. What I find impressive though is your cash flow generation remains somewhat stable. So I know on this call you'll get a number of deal questions, but I wanted to get a sense as to how much your cash flow informs the urgency for deals versus other metrics such as operational synergy or valuation. And then a real quick one for Kevin. Just wanted to know the payer attitudes towards PrEP in the U.S. and Europe and how they've changed. Thanks, guys. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey Geoff, thanks for the question. If you think about the different models and we think about our budget for 2017, we still have a very impressive net income and operating margin and importantly cash flow out of it. In fact, it would rank at or above nearly every one of our comparable companies. So we still feel very good about the company. We feel very good about our cash flow for the future. I think it's still for us a desire and a need to have a right strategic fit for the company. That is the driver for why and when we do any mergers or acquisitions or partnerships, much more so than the need for cash flow, because we feel very comfortable about where we are. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey, Geoff. It's Kevin. Let me take the PrEP. Thank you for asking it. I just want to repeat that we now have deployed a small but very focused PrEP team around the country. It's very much in urban areas. And we do hope that we can support PrEP education along the lines, as I said, of the likes of San Francisco. Right now, there is fairly good payer coverage in the United States for PrEP. It's largely through the commercial payers, and they see the benefit. So largely the patient groups that are currently using PrEP have good coverage. Obviously, we're going to take it into a wider audience, so we'll have to make sure that we get perhaps some of the public payers onboard with support for PrEP. Generally in Europe, it's government reimbursed. A year ago we had France give us coverage, and we have about 3,000 patients now on the medication in France. And we're starting to see other governments come out. The UK came out with a statement fairly recently on providing support for PrEP. So we're seeing some momentum starting to build outside Europe. The other thing I would just very quickly say about PrEP that we see as an important signal of adoption is that we're seeing more persistency of treatment for the PrEP patient. In other words, they are getting repeated bottles month after month, in some ways rather like an HIV patient. So that's encouraging that it's starting to become established and routinely used for its preventative benefits in patients. Geoffrey C. Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my question and I appreciate all the granularity around guidance, just a question on the hep C guidance. What's the right way to think about the potential decline in new patient starts in the U.S. versus Europe that you might anticipate this year? And to what extent might new competitive entrants impact price or share this year even before the traditional annual renegotiation of formularies? Might we look for that to maybe contribute more beyond this year and into 2018? Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Brian, I'll probably ask Jim to help me a little bit with a very good question. You can see from slide 24, we deliberately broke out the U.S., the EU5, Japan. There are very similar dynamics going on here. In fact, if you look deeper into the EU5, again, irrespective of the type of healthcare system, there is this decline going on. It is more profound in Japan, and I tried to describe that effect. So these are our best estimates, Brian. We've taken into account some of the trends we see through prescriptions. We've tried to listen to some of the public payers like the VA. The VA don't publish their data on treatment starts, so we just really got to sense how they're doing in terms of moving through their patients. We obviously also take judgments on the opening of access from a Medicare/Medicaid point of view. It has been relatively slow. We have blocked together the competition, the share, and the treatment generation, bearing in mind that slide 23, that is total around Europe, so it takes into account all competitive dynamics. But perhaps, Jim, you may have one or two questions on how we think about this. James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: I would just reiterate what Kevin said that the biggest impact of course is patient starts, and that's what we're seeing. It's across all of the different segments in the U.S. and really across all global markets. Whenever there's a competitive entrant, historically there has been some level of magnitude. It varies by competition on both price and share. So that is factored in here. Again, there are multiple launches later this year. It's not just a competitor. We have a launch later this year. We don't expect formularies to change. That really happens with payers in the fourth quarter in the U.S. But all of this is taken into account in that bucket that you see on slide 23. But again, I can't say enough how much the primary driver is the dynamic we're seeing in patient starts. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: I'd also just add, Brian, we're still very, very confident in the profile of the two options that we have for hepatitis C. Harvoni is still a tremendous product. I would just add that it's about 50% now of the patients that are using eight weeks of Harvoni in genotype 1. And as you've seen from the numbers, there's been tremendous uptake of Epclusa in the genotype 2 and 3 patients. Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC : Very helpful, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and thank you for all the color on the guidance. It's really helpful. I guess I think the question that I think a lot of people will ask me is, you've bottle volume is declining aggressively this year. And while you haven't given guidance beyond that, maybe help us think about, could this happen again next year? Is there anything that gives you comfort that we could see some stability in the patient volumes at least in the near term? Thanks. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hi, Robyn. It's Kevin. Let me start, and maybe perhaps one or two of my colleagues might chip in here. This market's been full of surprises. It surprises on the way up, I think, Robyn, and it surprised us in some ways on these dynamics we see coming down the other side. So it's the kind of market that in some ways we take one year at a time. We're almost learning as we're going along. And we have tried, particularly Jim and myself, but we've tried every way to look at this market. We have vast amounts of data, but what we're always doing is forecasting with no backbone of chronic patients. So it's all about how you just judge the starts. So what we've got here in 2017 is really our very, very best estimates. We've put them out there, and it's difficult for us really to go beyond this coming year. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Robyn, I would say that our efforts and the efforts around us to try to open up access to the less severely ill patients will be instrumental in helping stabilize that, and that's one of our focuses for this year. In fact, even today we saw some potential opening at one of the big plans. So all this could be very useful in terms of stabilizing that number, and that will be a big focus of the company this year. James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: And maybe one final comment, Robyn, just would be that's why we continue to invest in direct-to-patient initiatives and disease awareness campaigns, because even if it is a slightly different profile of patient that's coming into care, they're ultimately all going to need treatment, or the vast majority are. So we need to continue to invest in that to ensure that there is a steady flow of patients for many years in the future. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: As you say, Jim, it's a different patient presenting and it's a longer journey. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thank you very much. Thanks for taking the question. My question is concerning the guidance. It looks as though, back of the envelope, you're guiding for operating margins to be down by 700 or 800 basis points and tax rate up by 600 or 700 basis points. And so we go back to the question about looking ahead. First, if you do a deal, Robin, is there space in that R&D guidance for additional R&D investment in a deal, or would that be incremental to your current guidance? And then secondly, to the extent that there's variability principally around HCV, is that the basis for the trend in the tax rate guidance? And should we extrapolate that if we believe that the trend will continue, where might the tax rate guidance end up if you were straight HIV and the rest of the portfolio? Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Sure, Geoff. So thanks for the questions. I mean, to your first question regarding R&D expense, yes, there is opportunity to do some deal and add incremental R&D expense to get us back to levels commensurate with last year that we've thought about. But more importantly than just the year, we've kind of thought about that relative to some of the actions we've looked at or thought about relative to our overall portfolio and our allocation across the various therapeutic areas that we support. So I'm not going sit here and guarantee that we wouldn't increase R&D expense. We will to do the right thing and get new product in the acquisition market, but there is some opportunity there to absorb some of that. And relative to tax rate, yes, when we started with hep C, we kind of gave these ratios which don't necessarily work on the way down. But I think one of the clear drivers with the delta in tax rate here is the fact that, as outlined in our guidance slide, a lot of the growth in HIV is coming from the U.S. So you're seeing more of our revenues be U.S.-driven which have a higher tax rate as well as less hep C, which again takes the tax rate up. So it's a balance, again, highly dependent on patient starts which is the primary driver across things. So if you see more patient starts and higher hep C revenue, you'd see us on the lower end of tax guidance. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay, thank you very much for that color. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys. Thanks for take the question. Thanks to Sung for all the help my team while I was out. John, good to hear your voice. So let me ask you a deal question maybe a little different way, if you don't mind. And, John, this is a question I don't expect a yes or no. I expect you to just riff on it. When you look at Gilead, can you take the revenue base in 2016 as a starting point? And do you believe that you could grow that revenue base by 2018 without an acquisition of external assets? And then the second part of that question is, your leverage ratio right now at least on 2016 according to your slide deck 1.4. I know your EBITDA next year will be a little lower, so maybe that's 1.6 or something now. But any kind of thoughts, Robin or John, on like where that could go if you saw the right opportunity? Thanks a lot. I really appreciate it. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: First of all, Mark, it's really nice to hear your voice and we're glad to have you back. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Thanks, John. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Maybe less there now that you've asked a hard question. As I understand it, what you're asking is if you take the, say, circa $30 billion we had in 2016, can we do an acquisition that would grow off of that basis. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : No, could you grow the company without an acquisition? John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Oh, without an acquisition. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Was an acquisition a necessary requisite for revenue growth off 2016 levels over the next year or two? John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: We don't have a lot of things launching over the next few years. If you think about it, we have bictegravir which will be filed later this year, launching into next year. We're very confident of our HIV franchise. That is going to be a good growth driver for us. We are facing some headwinds in 2018 and beyond on other patent expiries we'll have, including the U.S. patent for TDF. We'll also have patents on Letairis and the following year Ranexa. So that puts some downward pressure on that non-HCV revenue base and so that makes it challenging for us to grow without some sort of acquisition in those area. I'm not going to say exactly when that would pick up again. It will depend a little bit on where HCV stabilizes and it will depend quite a bit on the uptake of bictegravir, which as we keep pointing out, we're very excited to be able to share the data with you and hopefully you'll share our enthusiasm for how this can transform the HIV market going forward. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Mark, I'll chime in on your debt to EBITDA question. I mean, I think we've been fairly thoughtful particularly dealing with the rating agencies and in thinking about debt levels that we feel very comfortable that we can support acquisitions and increase our debt to EBITDA. Most importantly because given our cash flows, which we expect to continue for a very long time, we can easily delever over time with our existing therapeutic area franchises. And this is totally exclusive of any potential tax changes, or particularly if there were repatriation. That would make all that even simpler. So we feel comfortable that from an asset standpoint that we could support any type of acquisition that we'd need to do to support Gilead's growth. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Thanks, Robin. Good to hear your voice, too. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess I wanted to ask relative to some of your projections for this year and relative to guidance, instead of talking about where you can see further compression but where you might be able to see some upside. So I guess as you think about the projections you've made across HCV patient starts, how your HIV business performs or even some pipeline assets, where might you think about are sort of maybe potential upside SKUs in some of those projections? Thanks. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey, Matthew. Let me make a start and again, you'll get some other views from around the table. I do want to go back to HIV. It's going really, really well. I mean if you look at our results, year on year we were up 17% in HIV and other antivirals and adding nearly $2 billion of revenues to the company. Now a large part of that came from the U.S. And as you see from slide 22, we are predicting anywhere between $0.9 billion and $1.2 billion of growth from the U.S. I don't know whether you picked up on my comment, but we already have 37% of treated HIV, Gilead-treated HIV patients on tap, which in a year is really a remarkable achievement. And it's our intention that we continue that growth and that momentum for Genvoya. So I really want to emphasize that. Yes, we have an interesting dynamic, as John pointed out, in Europe coming up with the loss of the TDF patent in July. But I have to say that Europe is a kind of a mosaic of countries at different points in the TAF launch. So we'll just have to see how that event comes through. Now in terms of HCV, we would like to see a lot more access in Medicaid states, but that has been slow. We would certainly like to see access way improving, which we think a lot of patients could be cured. And we talk a lot to our government affairs team about that. Fibrosis scores are now in some ways opened in Europe. We still have some challenges around Southern Europe, Italy and Spain, but generally that's not a barrier. Geographically, I think we're doing well around the world. We are thinking about a small build-out in China for the private market, but that really would be a 2018 and beyond effect. So what we have today, I think, is a really thriving HIV business. And as John has said, we are excited about bictegravir and we've got these interesting dynamics around HCV. And I concur entirely with Jim. We're going to continue to support HCV with a great deal of enthusiasm because there are still a lot of affected patients, and we'd like to bring them into care. And we have such an efficient operating model that we can do that. James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: I would agree, Kevin. And just maybe one, to build on one thing you said around PrEP earlier. As Kevin had said, we already have 110,000 patients on PrEP. Nearly twice that many have ever been exposed, and again that's before what Kevin had mentioned, the deployment of a 40-person prevention specialist team. And some very targeted direct-to-patient and direct-to-provider advertising that we're going to do. I think as Kevin had mentioned, the vast majority of PrEP prescribing right now is in four or five cities where the awareness is very high. The area where HIV is, people are at highest risk of contracting HIV right now is in underserved, inner city areas. If you're an African-American MSM, your lifetime risk of HIV right now contracting it, is one in two. So we're going to have people in areas like, in epicenters, New Orleans, Baltimore, DC, Newark, Oakland, areas that we haven't been before. But also doing that through targeted advertising, and particularly trying to get at populations that don't engage in healthcare. So we'll be using social media and dating sites and Tumblr and Snapchat and things like that, that are much better, are much more I would say likely media to reach this type of population. So we are bullish on, particularly in the U.S., the potential upside of PrEP as well. And again, there was an earlier question about the payers. I think the one thing that I believe payers are starting to see is if we can reduce the \u2013 if we can prevent HIV from occurring, ultimately that's going to bring down costs of treatment. And that's a lifetime cost of treatment. So again, that's one of the messages that we communicate as well when it comes to PrEP. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. In regards to 2017 guidance, I think it was quite a surprise what the numbers were. Is there some conservatism built in there? Is it kitchen sinking? Is it absolutely very realistically what you see? Maybe you could just characterize how you're thinking about it and whether you're trying to be conservative at all? And then when I think about the patient numbers that are implied in there, which I think is on slide 28 or so, is there a cadence to the new patient starts across the U.S. dropping from 230,000 to 160,000? Is that steadily across the area \u2013 what is the one big thing I guess in 2017 that's different from 2016 as you built out that projection perhaps in your starts. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hi, Mike. It's Robin. I'll start and then I'll have the commercial team chime in. I wouldn't say that our philosophy around guidance has changed year to year. And I think what we've tried to do is to be very transparent, but we're cognizant of the fact that given what you've heard in our commentary, that we expect HCV market patient starts to go down. The reality of it is, is exactly how that will happen and when is still very difficult for us to really hone in on, hence the wide variability in our HCV guidance relative to our non-HCV guidance where we do have much more predictability given that it's a chronic market. So I wouldn't say there's over conservatism built in. I mean, there's always some conservatism built into guidance but I wouldn't characterize the way we've guided here to be different than we have in the past. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Michael, just very quickly, I had a comment. Again, I said it earlier, we've used our best efforts. We've shared I think pretty much all our data that we have with you today. So we've really used our best efforts on trending, on the various payer buckets of patients. I would highlight on the slide that we've supplied on patient starts, there is the call-out of the 20,000 patients that was the uplift in 2016. So in total it was 231,000 patients but there was an uplift of 20,000. So whilst 2017 seems a big step down, it's not as great when you take into account the uplift that took place in 2016. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So heading into CROI, can you remind us the design of the B/F/TAF study versus your ongoing Phase 3, and maybe how we should be thinking about this update next week? In light of the decision to use a lower dose in Phase 3, I guess I'm wondering how much that impacts the read-through, if it does in any way. Thanks. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thanks, Cory, for the question. I thought this earnings call might end without ever anybody asking me a question, so thanks for the question. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : It's my pleasure. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So the design of the study was very similar to Phase 3. It's dolutegravir versus bictegravir given with F/TAF. And our Phase 3 study is the same design but using the single TAF/F regimen instead of the individual component. And then the dose that was actually used for bictegravir is it gives you the same exposure as the Phase 2 dose. So the Phase 3 dose is the same exposure as the Phase 2 dose. There was some slight drug interaction when you co-formulated the bictegravir into a single TAF/F regimen. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's helpful. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: And of course, by the way, the other Phase 3 study, there are four Phase 3 studies. The other controlled Phase 3 study, a single TAF/F regimen versus single TAF/F regimen which is bictegravir F/TAF versus Triumeq. And then there are two switch studies. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you, Norbert. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe just going to HIV and talking a little bit about the dynamics that may change over Europe. I saw that you included it in the guidance. That was helpful. But one, will the generic switches come from new starts or switches in HIV when you think about some of the markets in Europe? And then also, like should we expect the slope to be kind of the same, or will it kind of further go down as we move through the years, you think? Thanks. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey, Alethia. It's Kevin. Generally, and this is a general statement, switches are the dynamic part of HIV. It doesn't matter whether it's the U.S. or it's Europe. So generally, that's where the action is, if you like, in the HIV market. I do want to repeat my comment of earlier, Alethia, that we've got different countries at different stages of the TAF rollout. And that will have some impact on what happens if and when we see generics start to enter the various countries, because of course, whilst we aggregate for our results and aggregate for our comments, Europe is this whole, whole series of different countries. We're getting tremendous uptake of TAF in the early launch markets. I think you can see the chart we put in of Germany, which is just absolutely tremendous. Descovy as well, by the way, even better than Genvoya, we have a lot of separate components in Germany. It just happens to be less of a STR market. So Germany's going great. Spain's going great. I think Jim and I have very high hopes for TAF in France, which is just this past week. So I think you've got a little bit of a picture to paint, and we'll just have to see how that emerges around the event that we've highlighted and we've been realistic about that versus how TAF in its various forms is adopted. James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: I agree, Kevin. And I would just add, just having been over there, that we're not seeing any delay really in any of the reviews of TAF right now. And again, I think that's important. The generic impact will largely be limited to the compounds coming off patent. So it will be Viread, which is little used, Truvada, which is in the early launch markets decreasingly used, and then ultimately Atripla. It will have less if any impact on Stribild and Complera and hardly any impact on the TAF products once they're listed. So that's the whole key that Kevin said was we're at various stages of rollout, but once we get those products listed, it's a 2017 with dynamics moving in a couple different directions. But once we get beyond that and we have the full TAF launch, we see this as a very sustainable growth driver for the company. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, thanks for taking my questions, a quick one for Robin. If I look at your midpoint for 2017 guidance for SG&A and R&D, SG&A is roughly flat, but R&D continues to go up. So 2017 is a year where your earnings will come down. I was wondering how much operating leverage you might have in terms of those items on P&L. And then maybe for Kevin, on slide 23, if I take the midpoint of the $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion negative impact from increased competition, shorter duration and do the math, it's roughly 15% down from 2016 level, potentially for pricing. Is that the right way to think about how pricing would trend in 2017? Thanks. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So, Ying, it's Robin. I'll start with your first question. I think relative to the ranges, first just the one thing I want to mention on SG&A is it's going up primarily because of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee. And even with HCV revenues going down, we ended up with an IRS credit in 2016. So the comparator makes it look like it's going up. Across the board, as I said and John mentioned, I think we remain operationally efficient and do have leverage. Obviously, our operating margins have been very high, driven by our revenue. But we never really grew our company to the rate that our revenues grew. So we do feel we have operational leverage. And even if you look at some of the things we're investing in, in 2016 in SG&A and R&D, they were done by other things we've chosen not to invest in. So we'll continue to be able to currently make the necessary trade-offs, absent M&A, we think to remain efficient and focus on operational excellence. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey, Ying. It's Kevin. Just to address your second question, I really do hope we've been helpful with slide 23 to break out both the starts and three of the elements, which is pricing, market share, and duration. We won't go any further on the latter bucket. We believe we've really put our foot forward and tried to be helpful. But please bear in mind that slide 23 is the whole world of Gilead. There's Europe in there. There's Japan in there. There's the U.S. in there. So it's a whole basket of multiple dynamics around competition and duration. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: And maybe just one last thing is, keep in mind that Epclusa has only launched at this point in Germany. So this takes into account a competitive marketplace. Epclusa is going to, we expect reimbursement in the UK in the first half, the rest of the countries in the second half. And it takes into account competitive dynamics, which are share and pricing around that. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Phil Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question, just a question on intermediate term competition. Two things that investors are debating is the impact of the doublets that are based on dolutegravir that we could see data from this year or early next as well as potentially the competition from AbbVie's new doublet regimen in HCV. How is management looking at those two potential threats? Thanks. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Phil, so the first question about the doublet, keep in mind, what we haven't seen here is the efficacy of the doublet in a whole spectrum of HIV patient populations, particularly those with high viral load. Those have been excluded until now. And until and unless we see that it is really useful across all viral load spectrum, it's really difficult to say what competition that will be. But having that said, if it is efficacious and if it is dissimilar to triple, single-tablet regimens, then it will be a competitor to ours. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey, Phil, in terms of hepatitis C, difficult to ever know what a competitor does. From what we can see of the data, it is a step up in terms of competition. But I'd like to just repeat what I said earlier. We have a heck of an offering in Harvoni and Epclusa. We've maintained very, very healthy market shares to date, I think probably exceeding what many, many people thought we would do. So we'll continue to be very active and believe that we have the best options. The contracts for the U.S. are 12-month contracts for 2017, so it's probably largely or more a 2018 type of event. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, thanks for taking the question. I'm very into the growth question, but hopefully you can start to wind that down. Roughly when do you expect to see at least stabilization of the bottom line? And if you can't answer that question, why do you think investors should have a favorable outlook for the company? And then on the PrEP franchise, can you elaborate on your plans or strategy to convert that to Descovy and how much you think you can convert? Thank you. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey, Josh. We're not hearing you too well. We had a little bit of interference, so we hope you've got the questions. So the PrEP, the PrEP, Descovy, Norbert, in terms \u2013 or Andrew in terms of the Phase 3 studies, perhaps you can give a comment on that and we'll come back to the other question. Andrew Cheng - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hi, Josh. It's Andrew Cheng speaking. And I would say that for our Phase 3 trial, right now it's ongoing. We're in the middle of enrollment. So it's very difficult to address how easy we would convert them without knowing the results, quite honestly. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: And, Josh, in terms again, I think I'd come back to my earlier comments. We are taking one year at a time. I do hope, again, whilst you may not be satisfied with perhaps some numbers we've put out there, Josh, we really have put our best foot forward and given you all the data, virtually as much as we know. So we're almost as intrigued by this market as you are, and we're doing our very best to try and model it. And by putting out the 2017 numbers, we hope that is helpful. 2018 will be what it will be when we get there. Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just two part on hep C. So, Kevin, can you tell us what new diagnoses were in 2016 and then what you're assuming for 2017? And then Express recently published their annual drug trend report. They're projecting hep C spend declines over 30% in 2018 and 2019. So maybe just help us think about, again, I know those aren't your numbers, but as we think about the out years, what could be some of the drivers going into those assumptions? Thank you. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey, Terence. I'll take the first part of your question. If you look at slide 41 in our deck, it has the new diagnoses out there for you. We don't right now have 2016. It's always basically a database that's one year in arrears. So we do the best we can. This is the most up-to-date data that we have and we've now given to you. I would point out one thing on slide 43 and just like we're seeing healthier patients to be treated are being treated, you can see that there's basically less fibrosis in the presenting patients. So again around this theme of patients essentially coming forward who just don't quite have the urgency that had been previously. Jim? John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah, and then regarding ESI, I think it's probably a combination. I can't speak directly for them, but what I would hypothesize would be, you're probably aware that they did add Harvoni to the national formulary, so they now have an eight-week option, which is one of the best ways to reduce costs in HCV that they didn't have when they had the Viekira Pak as their sole option. So that's playing a role in what they're looking at over the next couple of years. But again, other than that, it's patient starts and their ability to project beyond 2017 is probably similar to ours. So it's challenging. And we're confident in 2017 and those are the drivers. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital. Your line is now open. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks. Two questions. I'm not going pretend it's two parts. On bictegravir, just given the excitement related to the data and obviously the opportunity that you've spoken to before, just give us a sense for what impact it will have on the rest of your HIV portfolio. And ultimately, should we expect you to regain some of the share that you've lost to the product offerings from ViiV? An unrelated question, but previously you've stated an unwillingness to compete on price in hep C. Would product offerings being more similar? Is that still the company position? Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So, Ian, I'll take the HIV question first. Part of the success of bictegravir is based on the success of Genvoya. And this 37% already of treated patients is terrific. And that bodes very, very well for TAF bictegravir. So what we like about this is that we are building once again the HIV franchise for Gilead. So we'll have a terrific Genvoya part of this and we believe we'll also have a terrific TAF bictegravir. So it's really I think operating on all fronts. As you've seen from the comments I made on Genvoya, we're getting about 10% of our Genvoya business from patients who are not currently on a Gilead regimen and we would hope to maintain that, perhaps even do better, once we have the additional arm of bictegravir F/TAF coming to join Genvoya. So we think about, if you like, both fronts. And Odefsey, Descovy also contributing to that but basically left hand/right hand Genvoya and bic F/TAF. In terms of pricing? John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Competing on price. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Compete on price? Jim? James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: I'm sorry. I didn't get the second part of the question. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: The question was, he said, you typically don't compete on price, but this category has been unique in this industry and that competition has lowered prices. So in fact, we have been competing on price for a few years now. So I don't see, I don't understand the question because that's been the nature of how we've been competing in these markets, especially with regard to both the public and private markets. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I guess the question was more specific to AbbVie's new product offering and potential for pricing to go down further. Is there a willingness to sort of hold ground here? Or are you willing to compete on price if the price is going down? John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: I'm not going to comment on that because I've been advised by counsel that we can't comment on future product launches and how we would react to them. So I can't say anything. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. I appreciate that, John. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Katherine Breedis with Stifel. Your line is now open. Katherine Breedis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. With HCV, would it possible to perhaps provide a little more granularity around the patient volume by payer mix in the U.S.? And along those lines, are we still tracking toward potentially reaching a point where the majority of VA patients with HCV will be treated by the third quarter of 2017? Thanks. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Great questions, Katherine, and I'll let Jim take the VA. Right now, in terms of payer mix, and it's been fairly steady for the last three quarters, about 45% of our HCV patients are coming from the public and about 55% from the commercial Medicare Part D. So that would be I think the rule of thumb. Obviously, that moves around depending on the very thing that you've raised, which is the VA. And I'll let Jim comment on the VA. James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah, no, sure. I just would first say that no single entity has done a better job of identifying patients and getting them linked to care and treated than the VA and I think they're a model for the other sectors out there. They have treated a higher percentage of diagnosed patients than any other sector. So they're actually ahead of the non-VA population. And we're seeing similar dynamics within the VA as we are outside of the VA and we do expect a lower rate of treatment because of that in 2017. And because the VA is actually ahead of the non-VA population, we would expect that VA patient starts would represent a decreasing percentage of Gilead HCV patient starts in 2017 compared to what they've represented over the last several years. So again, the vast majority of diagnosed veterans are going to get treated. I can't tag an exact date on that, but they're doing a great job and funding has not been an issue. Katherine Breedis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And maybe if I could ask a follow up. Is it tracking faster than we have seen? I mean, is it possible that that patient population will be treated earlier than the third quarter of 2017? Just to get a sense of the gating of the tails. That would be great. Thank you. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Katherine, if I could just jump in there. We have no real hard data from the VA. Our type of feel for the VA is through conversations. As Jim said, it's been very, very impressive. And you got to give the VA credit. So again, the slope, the times are very, very difficult for us to get specific on. James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Right. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Let's go to the next question. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney with Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess when I look at slide 22, and we're talking about non-HCV net product sales guidance, I'm just wondering, it looks like where you have bracketed off the ex-U.S. tenofovir patent expiration, it seems like that assumes the entire loss of ex U.S. Viread sales to make that number despite it not expiring until July. So I'm just wondering, is there anything more we should be expecting in terms of the tenofovir patent expiration impacting other products that you're taking into account there? And where in this slide are you taking into account any ex-U.S. HIV growth? Because it seems like there's only U.S. HIV there. Thanks. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey Brian. There is some very nice growth. Again, I direct you back to the slide on Genvoya, Descovy, Odefsey in Germany, which is those lines that I'm absolutely delighted with. And again, I repeat that our teams, whether it be here in the U.S. or around the globe, are really executing at a high level. I would simply say that the block that you're looking at on slide 22 does include a mix of our TDF products. So it's Viread it is also Truvada, because I think as you might know, the FTC patent predates the TDF patent in Europe. So there is the potential for effect not only on pure Viread, but on Truvada. James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: And recall as well, it's a year in which we're going to have launches throughout the year of the TAF portfolio. So this is the combined picture of both growth and generic impact for 2017. Moving forward as we said, with the launch of the full TAF portfolio, including bicteg, we expect this to be a growth driver globally for us. Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, I guess what I'm really unclear on is where the ex-U.S. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey, Brian. Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: We can follow up with you. Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. That would be great. Thank you. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for one last question. Our question comes from Jim Birchenough from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jim Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah, hi guys. Thanks for fitting me in. I guess you're describing two very different businesses with the non-HCV sales growth and the declining HCV portfolio without a clear sense of where the bottom is there. So the question is, is there any thoughts of splitting those businesses? It's a question I've got. I've thought about it. I'm wondering what the logical considerations would be against doing that? And then the second part would be assuming the business remains melded together, what commitment can you make to growing the overall business beyond 2017? I understand taking it a year at a time from a projections perspective, but I think investors would like some commitment to growth and to understand the initiatives you're going to take to do that. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Jim, the answer is no. We're not considering splitting up the company. And while it looks good in the world of Wall Street from a multiples perspective, I think it's an economically and financially a bad idea for the company. So we are committed to growing the company. We're committed to our field of NASH. We're committed to growing that HIV field. And we are going to continue to accelerate our pipeline through acquisitions and whatnot over the course of the year. This is a challenging situation. I understand it. We understand it. And we're here somewhat reporting the news to you of what the world of HCV looks like as it's declining faster this year than we would have predicted last year. And we're dealing with it through our strength of our balance sheet, through the cash flow we'll have at HCV, so that we can get the company back to growth. But at this point, I'm not going to give you a point in time when that's going to happen. Jim Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for take the questions. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Sung Lee for closing remarks. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Chelsea, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead, and the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on our future progress. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Gilead Sciences First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference call. My name is Candice, and I'll be your conference operator today. I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Candice, and good afternoon everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the first quarter 2017. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website. In addition, this year we have combined our annual and corporate social responsibility reports into a single publication titled 2016 Year in Review to share essential information about the company's financial, social, environmental and governance performance. This report can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. The speakers on today's call will be John Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jim Meyers, Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations. Also in the room with us for the Q&A session are Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, and Kevin Young, Chief Operating Officer. Before we begin formal remarks, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections, and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website. I will now turn the call over to Robin. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Sung, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to provide you with an update on our first quarter. I'll review our financial results. Jim will elaborate on our commercial performance, and then John will make a few comments. There were a number of positive trends from our non-HCV business in the first quarter that Jim will describe in a few minutes. Overall, earnings per share and the total revenues were down year-over-year, due primarily to dynamics in the HCV marketplace that we described during our last earnings call. Total revenues for the first quarter were $6.5 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.23. This compares to revenues of $7.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.03 for the same period last year. Product sales for the first quarter were $6.4 billion, down 17% year-over-year and down 12% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was due to lower HCV sales, partially offset by increased sales in HIV and other therapeutic areas. Sequentially, the decline was due to lower HCV sales and sub-wholesaler inventory decreases in the U.S. associated with our non-HCV franchises, reflective of the seasonal inventory pattern from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. Turning to the U.S., product sales for the first quarter were $4.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year and down 10% sequentially. Jim will provide more color for the U.S. as well as the other regions. Turning to Europe, product sales for the first quarter were $1.3 billion, down 23% year-over-year and down 11% sequentially, primarily due to competitive dynamics in HCV and unfavorable currency movements. Now turning to expenses, non-GAAP research and development expenses were $889 million for the first quarter, up 16% compared to the same period last year, due primarily to the purchase of a $125 million U.S. FDA priority review voucher in March. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $807 million for the first quarter compared to $638 million in the same period last year. These expenses increased primarily due to a higher net branded prescription drug fee for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, which included a $191 million favorable adjustment as referenced on slide 11. Without this one-time adjustment, non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the quarter would have been slightly lower compared to the first quarter of 2016. We continue to focus our efforts on operating in a highly efficient manner by proactively managing expenses and investing in areas of strategic importance to retain our industry-leading operating margins, significant cash flows and healthy balance sheets. During the quarter, we generated cash flows from operations of $2.9 billion and ended the quarter with $34 billion in cash and investments. As part of our plan to return capital to our shareholders, in the first quarter we paid cash dividends of $687 million and repurchased 7.9 million shares of stock for $565 million. The timing and amount of share repurchases was aligned to our stock compensation awards, which are largely granted in the first quarter. As noted in our last earnings call, we are prioritizing the use of capital for investing in the long-term growth of our business including partnerships and acquisitions. The year is progressing consistent with our expectations. As such, we are reiterating our full-year 2017 guidance provided to you on February 7 and summarized on slide 7 in the earnings results presentation available on our corporate website. I will now turn the call over to Jim to provide more details on our commercial results for the quarter. James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Well thank you, Robin, and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to provide an update on our commercial performance for the first quarter, and I'll start with a few comments on HCV. Starting with the U.S., approximately 700,000 people have initiated HCV therapy since the launch of Sovaldi in December 2013, with 90% receiving a sofosbuvir-based regimen. Total U.S. revenue from Gilead's HCV therapies for the quarter was $1.7 billion, down 18% year-over-year and 17% sequentially. The decrease in sequential revenue was driven by the declining sales of Epclusa, resulting in lower inventory, as well as some loss of market share as a result of increased competition. For the remainder of 2017, while increased competition will have some level of impact on patient share and pricing, we expect that the continued decline in HCV patient starts will be the primary driver of the year-over-year decrease in revenue. This decline in starts is driven by the evolving profile of patients that are in care. 62% of patients initiating therapy in the first quarter had fibrosis scores of F0 to F2. That's the highest we've seen for this metric, and indicative of the fact that patients are coming into care with earlier-stage disease, a trend that is illustrated on slide 26. Over the last six months, we've introduced two new direct-to-consumer campaigns. The first launched in late 2016 with the goal of increasing screening among baby boomers. We were pleased to see that this campaign, along with the efforts of organizations like the CDC, had an immediate effect, with a 24% increase in HCV antibody testing among undiagnosed baby boomers over the first two months of implementation. The second campaign launched in March, and is directed towards diagnosed patients with a goal of encouraging them to seek treatment with Harvoni. We hope these campaigns will continue to have an impact, and will help more individuals seek testing, linkage to care and treatment. It's important to remember that while the timeline for a patient to go from entering care to initiating therapy has lengthened and is more variable, there are still nearly 3 million people with HCV infection in the U.S., only half of whom are diagnosed. Turning to Europe, HCV revenues were down 42% year-over-year and 22% sequentially. Quarterly revenues of $487 million were negatively impacted by lower market share as a result of increased competition. During the quarter, we negotiated new agreements with France and Italy to expand access to HCV patients regardless of fibrosis score. This means that there are now 14 European countries, including four of the five major markets, that allow patient access regardless of disease severity. In addition, Epclusa has now been launched in all five of the major markets in Europe, and will be an important treatment option as some countries have a high percentage of genotype 2 and 3 patients. These patients and their health care providers have been waiting for an effective therapy that does not require co-administration of ribavirin, or extended treatment durations. In Japan, HCV product sales for the first quarter were $205 million, down 81% year-over-year and down 35% sequentially, due to a decrease in patient starts and increased competition. In the Japanese market, nearly 130,000 patients have been treated with a sofosbuvir-based regimen since the launch of Sovaldi in May 2015. Because there remain many untreated patients, we continued to implement our direct-to-consumer education campaign to broaden the awareness of HCV in Japan. Worldwide, 1.4 million patients have now initiated HCV therapy with a Gilead regimen in less than four years. With SOF/VEL/VOX, our investigational pan-genotypic single-tablet regimen for salvage therapy under regulatory review, we expect to complete our portfolio of HCV therapies later this year. Now turning to HIV, we are pleased with the rapid adoption and acceptance of our TAF-based regimens by patients and physicians in the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., HIV and HBV revenues were $2.3 billion in the first quarter, up 20% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. As Robin stated earlier, the quarter-on-quarter decline is consistent with the typical seasonality that we see in sub-wholesaler inventory. Importantly, first quarter revenue from our TAF portfolio exceeded $1 billion for the first time, which translates to a quarter-on-quarter growth of 47%. The launch of our TAF portfolio continued to drive the year-on-year growth of the Gilead HIV franchise. Genvoya represents nothing less than the most successful launch in U.S. HIV history as measured by cumulative total prescriptions over the first five quarters following launch. By the end of 2016, Genvoya remained the most prescribed regimen for treatment-na\u00efve patients, counting for nearly one in three patients. More broadly, our TAF-based regimens now represent 42% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume just 17 months after the launch of Genvoya, and less than a year after the launches of Odefsey and Descovy. Truvada for PrEP also continues to be an important growth driver for Gilead. We've seen a significant uptick in PrEP usage in 2017 with an estimated 125,000 patients using Truvada as we exited the quarter. This is encouraging given the important role that PrEP plays in preventing HIV transmission. Turning to Europe, HIV and HBV revenues were $697 million in the first quarter, down 3% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Year-over-year volume growth driven by TAF portfolio launches was offset primarily by FX. Notably, the TAF portfolio revenue grew by 24% quarter-on-quarter. I'm pleased to report that Genvoya launched in France and Italy during the quarter. Genvoya is now available in 23 European countries, including all major markets. In France, the second largest HIV market in the world, Genvoya is off to a particularly strong start. And in early launch markets like Germany, TAF-based regimens already account for up to 60% of Gilead's total HIV prescription volume. This demonstrates the rapid acceptance of TAF by national health systems and the importance of an optimized safety profile for people living longer with HIV. The TAF portfolio has achieved preferred status and treatment guidelines in four of the five major EU markets, as well as the EACS guidelines, with preferred status anticipated in France in the third quarter of this year. Shifting away from HIV and HCV, our U.S. cardiovascular team continues to deliver impressive results. Letairis remains the market leader in PAH with a na\u00efve patient share greater than the top two ERA competitors combined, while Ranexa is ranked in the top five cardiovascular branded products in terms of revenue for each of the past two years. In closing, we were pleased with our first quarter results. For the remainder of the year we will continue to ensure that as many people as possible can benefit from Gilead products around the world. I would now like to turn the call over to John. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Jim. As you've heard, product revenues for the first quarter of 2017 were down 12% from the fourth quarter of 2016. While any decrease in revenue is disappointing of course, this decline is a result of the natural challenge of the HCV cure market, where in each country there was a rapid increase in the number of patients who were treated and cured, followed by a decline in the number of patients seeking care and being able to access HCV treatment. The ongoing reduction in patient starts continues to be the major factor impacting our revenues, however 2017 is progressing as we expected and communicated to you on our last earnings call. On a positive note, we continue to see strong uptake of our TAF-based regimens in HIV, pointing to the valuable role these therapies play in the long-term treatment of patients with this disease. Genvoya is now our number one selling HIV product, surpassing both Truvada and Atripla since the last quarter of 2016. During the first quarter, I had an opportunity to attend CROI, the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. This is a good scientific forum with much progress described across the spectrum of HIV research for prevention, to novel targets and treatment to cure. Gilead's work featured prominently in the conference, including Phase 2 data for bictegravir used in combinations with F/TAF, long-term data supporting use of Genvoya, and preclinical data describing the potential of our novel capsid inhibitor as a long-acting treatment. During CROI, there was great enthusiasm for the emerging profile of B-F/TAF, as this is the first time we are able to present the full 48-week dataset from our Phase 2 study. As many of you know, we initiated Phase 3 studies last year based on our interim look at the 24-week data from the study. These four Phase 3 studies include more than 2,400 patients and enrollment was completed in third quarter of last year. We look forward to sharing data from these studies in the coming months and anticipate that we will begin submitting regulatory filings for approval in the third quarter of this year. The progress we made in providing new options to patients with HIV is remarkable and I'm proud of Gilead's contributions over our 30-year history. Last month, Gilead research was featured in 85 abstracts at the International Liver Conference, or EASL as it is often called. One of the most exciting stories emerging from the conference involved NASH for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. This is a disease that garnered relatively little attention at medical meetings a few years ago but is increasingly understood as a serious health issue for patients, particularly those presenting with the later stages of fibrosis. These are the patients facing the greatest risks of complications, and those with the most urgent need for new treatment options. We shared proof of concept data for GS-0976, our inhibitor of Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, or ACC, in an oral late-breaker presentation. ACC catalyzes the rate-limiting step in de novo lipogenesis, which means the formation of new fat. Inhibition of ACC with GS-0976 leads to significant reductions in both liver fat content and stiffness with decreases in markers of liver fibrosis seen after 12 weeks of treatment. We have now progressed GS-0976 to a larger Phase II study. In addition to 0976, another compound in development is our ASK-1 inhibitor selonsertib. We described for your previously the exciting data presented at AASLD last fall, showing that inhibition of ASK-1 with selonsertib led to decreases in fibrosis and secondary markers of NASH in a dose-dependent manner. We now have two Phase III trials underway evaluating selonsertib in NASH patients with bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis. Also in NASH, GS-9674, a gut-restricted FXR agonist, has progressed into Phase II studies, having shown biological activity through up regulation of FGF19 in a Phase I study. Complete resolution of NASH may require the inhibition of more than one pathway, and animal studies indicate that combinations of selonsertib, GS-0976 or GS-9674 may be more effective than the individual components alone. We have initiated a Phase II study in 20 patients evaluating the combination of selonsertib and GS-9674 and will initiate additional combination studies this year. If these combinations prove safe and efficacious, we will move one or more into extended Phase II evaluation next year. In HCV, we had six presentations at EASL further characterizing the efficacy and safety of SOF/VEL/VOX, our pangenotypic single-tablet regimen in more than 1,000 DAA-na\u00efve and DAA-experienced patients across all HCV genotypes. Most notable was data showing no impact of resistance-associated substitutions on the high efficacy of SOF/VEL/VOX for 12 weeks in DAA-experienced patients. As Jim mentioned, this regime is currently under regulatory review with a U.S. FDA PDUFA date of August 8. Also on HCV, data from two Phase II studies of Harvoni demonstrated HCV cure rates of 99% in children age six to 11 and 100% in adults co-infected with HCV and HBV. The pediatric data have recently been included in our U.S. label. And finally, we presented 96-week results from two ongoing Phase III studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of daily Vemlidy in e-antigen positive and negative patients in 24-week data in patients switching from Viread to Vemlidy. The results reinforce Vemlidy as an important treatment option for patients living with chronic hepatitis B infection. In the area of inflammation, Phase II studies of filgotnib, a JAK1-selective inhibitor are underway and enrolling in rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. With this once-daily dosing in our approximately 1,700 patient-years of experience, we and our partner Galapagos have now started, or announced the intention to start six additional Phase II studies across a range of different inflammatory diseases where JAK1 activity is implicated. Before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I want to mention another recent and important event at Gilead, at which Gilead's work was highlighted, and that's the Neglected Tropical Diseases Summit that took place last month in Geneva. At this meeting, which brought together industry, the World Health Organization, public health and government officials, and many NGOs working to deliver medicines to the developing world, we reaffirmed our commitment to the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases. This declaration, signed five years ago, outlines the WHO's ongoing efforts to control, eliminate or eradicate 10 key neglected tropical diseases. In Gilead's case and related to this declaration, we have partnered with WHO for many years to provide AmBisome for use in several developing countries as a treatment for visceral leishmaniasis, a deadly parasitic infection. This is a very important application for AmBisome, which is better known for its use in cases of systemic fungal infections. We are pleased that the use of AmBisome, along with other mitigation strategies, has resulted in a marked decrease in the number of visceral leishmaniasis cases in India, Nepal and Bangladesh. In addition to visceral leishmaniasis, we have research ongoing to address other neglected or emerging tropical diseases that pose significant public health threats in resource-limited parts of the world. For example, our work on GS-5734 for the treatment of Ebola and potentially other deadly viruses such as those that cause SARS and MERS. In 30 years, we've learned that the value of partnerships in developing innovative new therapies, and have demonstrated a willingness to make bold moves. That hasn't changed, and we are committed to building on our success in HIV and HCV by leveraging our own scientific expertise as well as the knowledge of others through collaborations and partnerships to work toward the next generation of life-saving therapies. I would like to conclude by thanking you for your interest in Gilead and thanking our nearly 9,000 employees for the hard work that is well represented in our results his quarter. So let's now open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Geoff Porges of Leerink Partners. Your line is now open. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks very much for taking the question, and appreciate all the color on the dynamics in HCV and HIV. Perhaps we could talk a little bit about the HIV category. And Jim or John, give us a sense of what percentage of your HIV revenue in the U.S. today is Medicaid funded and then what percentage is covered or at least patients are covered by insurance provided by ADAPs. And then lastly, what do you expect to happen to pricing as you get into generic Viread being available both outside the U.S. and then in the U.S. at the end of the year? Should we anticipate Atripla's price coming down to some of their components or staying at the branded price? Sorry, but they're sort of related. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thanks for your one question, Geoff. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey, Geoff. It's Kevin here. Let me have a go at the first couple of parts, and then Jim can also help out. So I'll just split the business really between the public side and the private side for HIV. We've got about 55% of our business HIV sales go through the public, and about 45% go through the private. It's actually almost a direct reverse of HCV. And of that 55%, 20% or so is ADAP in the U.S. So that's basically the situation that we have. We're very pleased with the progress with Genvoya. As we said on the last earnings call, we will see the effects of generics in Europe in the second half of this year. That will be a country-by-country event. I think the most direct effect, of course, will be on Viread and Truvada. The most important parts, as far as we're concerned, is to make sure as many of our countries convert from TDF-based regimens to TAF-based regimens. And as you heard from Jim, some of our European markets are doing very, very well on that front. We've got Germany already at a ratio of 60% TAF to TDF. So we're trying to control I think the most important variable, which is good for patients, which is to see them converted to TAF away from TDF in advance of the change in the TDF landscape. James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes, and, Kevin, just to add on that, and I agree with everything you said. I think HIV is a bit of a different market over the years. Of all the markets, of all the chronic therapy markets Gilead's ever been in, it's been driven more by increases in patient volume than by changes in price. And there's always some element of both in every therapeutic area that you're in, but disproportionately in HIV. There's always been a healthy steady flow of number of treated patients each year. As I think you're probably aware, and as Kevin just said, we're already in heavily, deeply-discounted payer segments in the U.S. market. What that means is that's already part of the run rate. So the normal impact of a generic is a big change from where you are. We're already, especially for the older products that are going to be coming off patent, the difference between generic pricing and where those prices are right now is much more incremental than you'd see in most markets, and anyways, that's something that's just very unique with that. We continue to see obviously a strong support for single-tablet regimens and fixed-dose combinations, and of course, there will be some level of impact whenever there is generic entry, particularly outside of the U.S. But we still very firmly believe that when we want to ultimately have the full launch of our entire TAF portfolio, particularly BIC/TAF, B-F/TAF, that this remains very much a sustainable franchise going forward. Again, I would say we hear sometimes how sustainable is price levels in HIV. That really hasn't been the story of HIV. It's really, I mean particularly in the U.S. market, because of the deeply-discounted segments and the CPI-U penalties you have over time, this has been a market that has overwhelmingly been driven by patient volume. So we're not as reliant on that. We have not been historically as reliant on, if you look at list pricing for sure, it's there. But net pricing has deteriorated over time, and that's already in the run rate. But I'll stop there, and we feel very confident in this being a sustainable franchise. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Geoff, just two last points, Geoff. We obviously thought about these events as part of our guidance. They're included in our guidance, and the other point I'd like to make is I think for the first time, we've really seen a downturn in the number of Atripla patients. Atripla stayed very strong for 10 years since its launch, but with Genvoya now and the TAF-based regimens, we've really seen that turn, and I think that's good for patients and obviously it's very encouraging for Gilead. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Great. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is now open. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Afternoon, guys. Thanks for the question. Jim, on HIV, PrEP has been a big volume driver. What's the typical duration of use? And how would you size the opportunity? And then, John, you mentioned revenue trends in the quarter. I'm just curious if there's a metric, be it cash flow or margin that maybe that best informs your biz-dev or deal strategy. Thank you. James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Sure. So starting with PrEP, what we're seeing very encouragingly, and I think consistent with CDC guidance and data, is that we're starting to see persistency that is very similar to patients taking antiretroviral therapy for treatment, and that's what you want. Frankly, three, four years ago, PrEP prescribing was very episodic, and we're not seeing that now. So that's not just a good thing for Gilead, I think that's a good thing for patients. That's what the data would say is the way that PrEP should be prescribed. So we're not seeing very much shade of light between those two, and because of that, we do see this as a significant continued driver of growth. I think as we said in the last earnings call, 90% of PrEP prescribing was coming out of five cities coming into this year, and they weren't the cities where a lot of the epidemic is really starting to unfortunately increase, areas like New Orleans, DC, Newark, Oakland, the Bronx. And part of our efforts, both with the field-based team that we deployed of prevention specialists, and also with some of our education that we're doing is geared towards those markets, because honestly I think that's where the needle can be moved the most. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So, Geoff, I would give you a shorter answer to your question. But you asked about metrics. Certainly as we think about opportunities, we do look for things which have potential to have a high operating margin. That's important to us. That of course informs the potential cash flow from the business in the future. We also of course look for things that have a scientific and medical need such that we can build a sustainable business that would have the top line growth that we desire, along with those margins and cash flows. So those things are all informative in terms of how we think about it. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks very much and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about bictegravir specifically. And maybe you could just talk about, how do you view the potential to being able to achieve superiority with bictegravir over dolutegravir? And maybe as part of your answer if you're willing, can you talk about what's the statistical plan and the powering in the head-to-head na\u00efve study? Thanks. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes hi, Matt. I'm happy to answer that. So the head-to-head studies in na\u00efve patients, remember one of them is comparing bictegravir to dolutegravir. The other one is comparing our single-tablet regimen to Triomune. Both assume that the comparator arm has a 91% success rate, and the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval is 12%. So the delta is 12%. Now what the chances of achieving superiority, there's always a possibility. I don't think I would like to speculate on that. It really depends. This will clearly show that these are both large studies and will clearly show if there is a difference between these two drugs, we should see it. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes. Matt, the only other thing I would add from a commercial point of view is that the success of Genvoya, the success of Descovy is the platform for BIC/TAF. So we see it as a family. TAF is doing extraordinarily well. You saw the results of Descovy in the quarter. So that's just the building block upon which that we'll launch BIC-F/TAF. So the momentum we really have going now will be taken forward with B-F/TAF. But we see it all as sort of a collective platform. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Matt, I forgot to add something. Of course we will look for superiority. So the primary test will be non-inferiority, and if we meet that, we will of course look for superiority, which is of course a possibility. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Josh Schimmer, Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Let's discuss why TAF is so strong in Germany versus U.S. And then as you think about launching bictegravir into these markets, is that something going to sustain the current trajectory of TAF adoption or do you expect it to accelerate the penetration? And if it's accelerating, what is the patient population that that one will specifically unlock? Thanks very much. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: You said TAF uptake in Germany versus U.S. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes. Sorry, Josh. You broke up a little bit. So we're going to try to recreate your question as best we can. We'll turn it over to Jim for that James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah, so my apologies that I didn't hear all that. I think I have it now. But I think what we have seen in Germany is consistent with what we've seen in other early launch markets in Europe, which is number one, rapid adoption or rapid acceptance of the TAF profile and treatment guidelines. Again, we have it in four of the five markets right now in addition to EACS. But also a strong desire to appropriately, depending on the label, move patients to the TAF-based regimens. And because Genvoya launched earlier there, that's a good example of what we're seeing in some of our earlier markets. The example we gave was Germany. It was up to 60%. We also have some earlier launch markets in the Nordics and in some of the northern European countries that tend to launch earlier that are there or thereabouts, closer to 60%. So the encouraging thing for us, too, is that as we mentioned, we just launched Genvoya in France this quarter and in Italy literally at the end of the quarter. So we've got a lot of room to grow there and try to get up to the levels that we've seen in the other countries. But I think it's primarily a function of just it was an earlier launch. People are seeing good results. They realize that this is a patient population that is aging, and the attributes of TAF in a 50 to 60 year old patient are even more important than they are in a 40 year-old patient, and I think we're seeing that reflected. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes, Josh. It's Kevin. I was just out in Australia about ten days ago. They've already got a 40% conversion to TAF, so it's happening around the world where we have launched in most markets, a lot of markets just over a year. I would also say that, with HIV, as Jim referred to earlier, this is not a contracting type of market. This is once you have reimbursement, then generally physicians have the freedom to operate and will follow guidelines and put patients on advances in therapy, and clearly, clearly, clearly, clearly TAF is an advancement on TDF. James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: I think the one final thing I'd say is that in some quarters there's some worry that as you get into some of the generic options, that choice will be taken out of physicians' hands, so you do see a lot of physicians wanting to switch to TAF while they have the ability to do that. And that makes a lot of sense. Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. And bictegravir insights? Operator : Thank you. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: I'm sorry, Josh. We couldn't hear that. Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.: So I said the impact of the bictegravir on the adoption curve accelerator just remaining. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Do you think bictegravir's going to accelerate the adoption curve of TAF? James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: I do, yes. I mean, I've said it, and Norbert's probably \u2013 we've all said it in this room. I truly believe that it is the first single-tablet regimen we've had without tradeoffs. And I believe that most of our physicians see it that way too. And I'm looking at my clinical colleagues in the room here, and that's what we hear from our advisors. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes. Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Alethia Young of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I'll continue the trend of no hep C questions, but thinking about NASH, in one of your slides you said less than 1% of patients were diagnosed. So I'm just curious kind of what you're doing alongside your Phase II, Phase III work to kind of drive diagnosis? Like particular biomarker work or anything to that respect. Thanks. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes, so Alethia. I want to answer first then Kevin will, if you have any comments. So we are including in our Phase 3 studies, of course, the primary endpoint as you know is histology. We think that's a potential hurdle to diagnose patients and get patients into care. So we're looking at the use of FibroScan with all patients in that study, and hopefully we can then show the correlation between FibroScan and histology, that that may be a way to include those data and the need. Again, we have not discussed this with regulatory authorities. It's too early for that. We just have to see what the data looks like. But clearly, one thing from a clinical point of view is to get away from doing biopsy. And we're also looking at the usual markers of fibrosis. We presented at EASL, the ELF data, and others like CK-18. So these are all serum markers that have to do with fibrosis and we showed a fairly good correlation between these serum markers and MREs, so and medical resonance elastography. And if we can do the same thing showing the correlation with histology, then hopefully this will become the accepted diagnostic avenue. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes, Alethia, not much to add. Yes, we've got to find non-invasive measures. But I would emphasize that we like the focus of going into the F3 and F4 patients. I mean, they're very defined. Somebody's got cirrhosis, it's a very defined patient population and I think with perhaps different from perhaps some other companies in the area, we like that focus and that's where we want to begin our entry into NASH and then build upon that. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Alethia, I want to add, we had another presentation at EASL about, you know the study of simtuzumab in bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis, that overall field. So it didn't show any efficacy, but it taught us a lot about disease progression endpoints, and it is clear that fibrosis is the only predictive biomarker, the only predictive diagnostic that predicts clinical outcomes. And we also got a good sense for what we can experience over a year or two years in terms of clinical events. And based on this data, we are comfortable that with two-year follow-up, we should have enough clinical events, hepatic decompensation ascites, et cetera, that would get us potentially full approval rather than accelerated approval based on histology. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about business development and curious how much of a barrier all the uncertainty in Washington right now regarding tax reform is when it comes to pulling the trigger on potential BD opportunities? And then, following some of the recent hires you've made over the last six or so months, do you think you have the bandwidth now to more fully explore the myriad of assets in companies that are out there? Thanks. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah, thanks for the question, Cory. So first of all, with regard to Washington, I think that uncertainty in Washington seems to be the norm in my 27 years here. So I think we've kind of learned to filter that out and focus on the things that are right for the company. There may be tax reform. There may be repatriation, but you can't count on it and you can't wait for it either. So we've focused our efforts \u2013 I'll turn to what you asked last, which is we really focused our efforts on broadening our team, adding some depth both scientifically and with business development experience so that we in fact have much, much greater capacity to assess things and are in fact fully engaged with our teams assessing a number of different opportunities, which we think could play out over the coming year as we start to make progress in getting partnerships and potential acquisitions together. So we're going to just focus on what's right for Gilead, try to ignore the noise globally on terms of tax reform, and do the best thing for the company and for the shareholders in the long term. And we really have a great team right now. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mohit Bansal of Citi. Your line is now open. Mohit Bansal - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So one question on NASH. If you could help us understand the futility analysis you have baked in in your ASK-1 program, and also like what is your strategy for data release there? And when do you think we could see those data? Thank you. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes, there seems to be this rumor in the public that we have a futility analysis. We do not have an interim analysis planned in our Phase III studies. This will be 48-week endpoint with histology. There will be the usual DS&B meetings that mostly look at safety. But there is not a futility or an interim analysis planned. So we are going to carry this study out to 48 weeks, last patient 48 weeks biopsy. That will constitute the NDA filing. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: But the study will continue blinded after that. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: The study will continue blinded because we believe that the histology will get us accelerated approval, and in order to get full approval, you need to reach clinical endpoints. And we think they should be reached as I explained just before in the two-year timeframe or so. Mohit Bansal - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thanks for clarification. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ying Huang of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a couple of quick ones related to HCV. First one is you had 44,000 patients starting in U.S. So if you flatline, that trend is actually to the high end of the reg you provided at the beginning of the year of 150,000 to 175,000 patients starting this year. And if you look at your HCV sales, again if you flatline just times 4, it's actually above your range. So I was wondering what do you see in the rest of the year, the next three quarters, what could cause that patient start and also the sales to trend down from 1Q level? And then another related question comes from the comments of Merck and AbbVie on HCV. I think they had a little bit different opinion. Merck was saying that they continue to see patient trending down, patient start, but then, so AbbVie was saying that, but they have different opinion on where the long-term trend is going. So I was wondering if you can provide any color on that. Thank you. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey, Ying. It's Kevin. Let me try and take a stab at that. I mean, let me say right from the start, HCV continues to be a large opportunity, albeit that it's declining, and that decline is happening in every market that we look around the world. In terms of looking at revenues and our performance, we took a very realistic view when we set about our guidance three months ago, and really nothing has changed. We still think the number of 150,000 to 175,000 patient starts in the U.S. is still a very solid number. Yes, you are correct that it was 44,000 treated, but please bear in mind that when you look at revenues, it's a composite that's made up of starts. It's made up of share. It's made up of payer mix, and it's made up of product mix. So there's a number of components that goes into this. It's early in the year. It's just three months. Starts can vary from quarter to quarter, but we don't see anything right now that would change from where we set our guidance back in February. Yes, and so I think from what I can see, and it's not for me to comment on other companies in the area, I think pretty much everybody is now seeing this market in a similar fashion. It's large, and it'll go on for a long time. I don't think anybody really knows when there will be a turning point. We'll probably only know that turning point when we're nine to 12 months after that turning point. But clearly, with 1.5 million people diagnosed in the U.S., 3 million infected but 1.5 million diagnosed, that's still a lot of patients to cure. And I think ourselves and probably the general noise in the market will encourage people to step forward and be treated, and as Jim described earlier, our DTC campaigns are really focused on that. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen. Your line is now open. Phil Nadeau, Ph.D. - Cowen and Company : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. One for John, kind of a broad big picture question. John, last year there was some talk of Gilead providing a strategic overview early in 2017 and discussing your strategic imperatives in a bit more detail. It seems like that has obviously not happened, but I'm curious, is that still something that we can expect? Is there going to be a time when you will more definitively define your strategy? Or is it just going to be piecemeal, we'll kind of see things develop as they do? John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Well, first of all, Phil, I don't recall ever saying that we were going to have a specific unveiling of a strategy, and strategies for companies are an ongoing process, not an event. And so what you have seen in our different areas, I mean, really think about our strategies over the last few years. We wanted to stabilize and then grow HCV products by the introduction of TAF and additional STRs. We wanted to round out our HCV portfolio with SOF/VEL/VOX so we'd have an answer for every patient within our portfolio. We did that very successfully last year, and then we brought Vemlidy to market to help stabilize the HBV market and provide a really good foundation for the company. We're making forays into NASH, as we've described, more compounds that we've acquired, and are building upon. We may do more there. We're building really nicely in filgotinib. I think we have a really great opportunity with filgotinib to accelerate the clinical development timelines, now that baricitinib seems to have a setback, which could provide greater upside for us as well if that is significantly delayed. So those are two different areas where we're continuing to invest, and you'll see with filgotinib, we're going to embark upon other studies. For example, we have a Syk inhibitor that could be also useful in RA, and that maybe combinable with filgotinib. With regard to future legs of stool, I think it's pretty clear we're looking for another avenue to increase our opportunity for revenue, and also for helping patients with the considerable heft that we have, and it's clear we've been focusing on oncology, where the question is there in the area, where we can use our resources to accelerate products to market and build a meaningful franchise in oncology. And that was the hiring of Alessandro Riva; that was the foray we made with our business development people to broaden and then to look at other things that can build this. And so I feel very good that we've got a number of different ways to accelerate growth for the company into the future so that a decade from now we're a very different company, having reinvented ourselves beyond antivirals into a really multi-therapeutic area company. And I feel very good about where we are and we'll continue to try to enhance that as well. So that's our strategy. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Umer Raffat of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC : Hi. Thank you so much for taking my question. I just wanted to zoom in a little bit on the TAF patent estate. And some of your prior commentary seems to imply that you're guiding to a 2025 patent expiry for TAF-based regimens. And we're seeing some patents listed all the way out to 2032, and just wanted to understand, A, how you think about those patents and B, in your base case do you consider using those patents in any possible patent litigation that comes up down the road? Thank you. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Well, first of all, I'm not going to comment on future patent litigation and what we won't or won't do. I don't have my attorney with me, so I'd be loath to say anything. With regard to TAF itself, the TAF patent is out through 2025. What you're seeing in additional patents is, of course, as we have bictegravir and other products that we're developing, those will have longer product patents of course. And so those products and combination products may go out to a much longer date than that. And as we continue to invent other molecules for HIV, we're not done. We're still looking at, for example, drugs for salvage. Those will have additionally long patent lives, as well. So it will be somewhat of a laddered portfolio of patent expirations going out well into 2030. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: 2033 for bictegravir. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, 2033. Sung has corrected me for bictegravir. Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Katherine Breedis of Stifel. Your line is now open. Katherine Breedis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much for taking my question. As a follow up to the early exciting data for your NASH portfolio that were featured at EASL, I was wondering if you could provide some thoughts about what you think the timeline for potential patient recruitment might be, particularly for selonsertib in Phase III, which again looks very compelling, but we've seen from other recent competitors some enrollment delays. Thank you. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah, Katherine, honestly, it's a little bit too early to talk about where we are in patient recruitment, because I always want to get a quarter or one-third into the recruitment phase to be able to make intelligent projections. But clearly what I can tell you is the STELLAR 4 study, which is the one in cirrhotic patients, is enrolling very, very fast and there are two obvious reasons. No competition, number one and unmet need with a population that is very ready to enroll in a study that has the potential to help them and to make their fibrosis better. So the answer was a little bit qualitative. Again, to quantitatively answer it, it's too early. But it is also clear that we might have STELLAR 4 enrolled much sooner than STELLAR 3, in which case we would file with STELLAR 4 only. Of course, this has to be discussed with regulatory. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes. I'd say we have the potential to file it early depending on the data and the safety and risk benefit. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Sure. I think it's also important to say that we know many of these sites very, very well from our HCV programs Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: These are the same, almost, many times the same investigators, yes Katherine Breedis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Just a couple more on hep C. I was wondering if you have data yet on the number of new diagnoses in the U.S. in 2016. I know you've provided that in the past for 2015. And then, can you tell us the contribution from the VA this quarter? And then ex-U.S. market share looks like has been declining on a dollar basis since early 2016. Anything you guys can do to stabilize that? Thank you. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey, Terence, it's Kevin. No. It's just too early. We haven't got the 2016 data yet. So, sorry. It's not that we're holding this back at all. It's just not available. We're hoping maybe going into the second quarter or middle of the year that we'd have that data, but no. We don't have 2016. I'll let Jim take the VA. James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Sure. So, yeah, the VA as you know in the past has been at times one in four patient starts for us in any given quarter. The VA is experiencing the same dynamics outside the VA where we are seeing a steady gradual decline in the number of treated patients, due largely to the changing profile of the patient under care. We're seeing it actually in a little bit more of an accelerated manner in the VA, simply because they were so efficient and so effective in getting their folks into care and getting them treated. So they actually have been able to treat about 50% of their population. So we would anticipate that the VA would continue to represent a smaller and smaller percentage of our overall treated patient population. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: It's important to say, Jim, that we don't see or we don't hear of any budget restrictions from a VA point of view. James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes. It isn't and - Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: The market share year on year. James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes. I'm sorry the question was \u2013 so if you think about market share across Europe, you know we had about the same number of patients this quarter as we did last quarter, but what you are seeing, you are correct on a dollar basis it goes down, and that's somewhat a shift from the patients in the north to the patients in the south, which is sort of a natural again evolution because there are more patients in southern Europe where the prices are lower than they are in northern Europe where we have had a good run at curing a high percentage of the patients already. So I think that trend will likely continue. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah and, Terence, as Jim pointed out, we do have the opening of access now in France and Italy. So we're going to be obviously trying to use that opportunity to treat more patients. So that's a very positive situation that we've got right now. James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Particularly in France, yes Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Particularly in France, yes. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Sung Lee for any further remarks. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Candice, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on our future progress. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Gilead Sciences Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Liz and I will be your conference operator today. I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the second quarter 2017. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website. The speakers on today's call will be Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Kevin Young, Chief Operating Officer; Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and John Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer. Before we begin formal remarks, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well is on the Gilead website. I will now turn the call over to Robin. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Sung, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to provide you with an update for our second quarter. I'll review the financial results, Kevin will address the commercial performance, Norbert will highlight the progress made in R&D, and then John will make a few closing comments. Our strong performance in the second quarter was driven by a continuation of the positive trends in our non-HCV business and better than expected results from our HCV business, particularly in the U.S. Total revenues for the second quarter were $7.1 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.56. This compares to revenues of $7.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.08 for the same period last year. Product sales for the second quarter were $7 billion, down 8% year-over-year and up 10% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was due to lower HCV sales partially offset by increased sales in HIV and other therapeutic areas. Sequentially, HCV sales grew 11% and HIV and other therapeutic area sales grew 10%. Turning to the U.S., product sales for the second quarter were $5 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by favorable demand for our non-HCV products offset by lower HCV sales, and up 12% sequentially, primarily due to the continued strong uptake of our TAF franchise and favorable inventory movements for HIV and HCV. Turning to Europe, product sales for the second quarter were $1.4 billion, down 13% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to competitive dynamics in HCV and unfavorable currency movements. The sequential increase was primarily due to the one-time recognition of deferred revenue related to an HCV contract, demand for Epclusa and the continued uptake of our TAF-based regimens. Kevin will provide more color for the U.S. as well as the other regions. Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $812 million for the second quarter, down 22% compared to the same period last year, due primarily to the purchase of an FDA priority review voucher in 2016. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $827 million for the second quarter compared to $838 million in the same period last year. We remain focused on operating in a highly efficient manner and are proactively managing expenses and investing in areas of strategic importance to generate industry-leading operating margins, significant cash flows and a strong balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $36.6 billion in cash and investments and generated cash flows from operations of $3.5 billion. While we anticipate strong cash flows in the second half of 2017, we expect a sequential decrease in the second half of the year as we anticipate large cash payments for government rebates, both in the U.S. and abroad, as well as other seasonal payments. As part of our plan to return capital to our shareholders, we paid cash dividends of $680 million and repurchased 2 million shares of stock for $130 million to offset dilution in the second quarter. We continue to prioritize the use of capital for investing in the long-term growth of our business including partnerships and acquisitions. Finally, I would like to update our full-year 2017 guidance provided to you on May 2 and summarized on slide 6 in the earnings results presentation available on our corporate website. We are increasing net product sales to a range of $24 billion to $25.5 billion. Non-HCV net product sales are expected to be in the range of $15.5 billion to $16 billion. HCV net product sales are expected to be in the range of $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion. This guidance reflects the strong performance we have seen in the first half of 2017 across our businesses, specifically in the U.S., while continuing to anticipate increased competitive dynamics in the U.S. and EU during the second half of the year. This guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties which are highlighted on slide 16 in the earnings results presentation, including the accuracy of our estimates for HCV patient starts for the remainder of 2017, unanticipated pricing pressures from payers and competitors resulting in lower than anticipated market share in HCV, and lower than expected market share and greater price erosion as the result of the introduction of generic versions of TDF and the fixed-dose combination of FTC/TDF outside the U.S. We are narrowing the R&D expense guidance to a range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion. We are also narrowing the SG&A expense guidance to a range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion. Finally, the diluted earnings per share impact of GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.93. All other components of our guidance remain unchanged. I would now turn the call over to Kevin to provide more details on our commercial results for the quarter. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Robin, and good afternoon everyone. We continue to see strong uptake of our TAF-based regimens in the United States and Europe. In the U.S., total HIV and HBV revenues were $2.6 billion for the quarter, up 19% year-over-year and up 10% sequentially. These results demonstrate the strength and sustainability of our HIV franchise. At the end of June, our TAF-based regimens accounted for 51% of Gilead's total HIV prescription volume. Leading the way was Genvoya with a treatment-na\u00efve patient share of 41%, more than twice that of the second-most prescribed therapy. This represents the highest treatment-na\u00efve patient share for a single product or regimen since the early days of Atripla. In addition, more than one third of patients who switch HIV therapy now switch to Genvoya. More broadly, Gilead single tablet regimens represented four of the top five most prescribed products across all categories, treatment-na\u00efve, switch and total treated patients. Beyond TAF, Truvada for PrEP continues to be an important option when used as part of a comprehensive strategy to prevent HIV transmission. We estimate that approximately 136,000 people in the U.S. were using Truvada for PrEP as we exited the second quarter. We are also encouraged to see third-party providers announcing new initiatives on broadening access to PrEP. Turning to Europe, total HIV and HBV revenues were $732 million in the second quarter, down 3% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease was driven by negative foreign exchange. The sequential increase was due to robust demand for our HIV therapies. Strong uptake of our TAF franchise continues throughout Europe. Based on preliminary data for the second quarter, Genvoya is expected to be the most prescribed therapy for both treatment-na\u00efve and switch patients across the top five European markets collectively. I'm delighted to say that in France, the largest HIV market in Europe, Genvoya became the most prescribed HIV regimen for treatment-na\u00efve and switch patients just four months after launch. Turning to Descovy and Odefsey. We now have these products available in 19 and 16 European countries respectively. Additional launches are anticipated in 2017 as pricing and reimbursement discussions continue. Guidelines have a significant impact on prescribing patterns. Following the recent inclusion in France, Genvoya is now a preferred regimen in country guidelines in all five of the major European markets. Turning to HCV, total revenues in the U.S. were $1.9 billion in the second quarter, down 17% year-over-year and up 13% sequentially. The quarter-on-quarter increase was primarily due to a change in inventory and the timing of patient starts. Our market share for the quarter remained high at approximately 80%. HCV patient starts in the first six months were better than we originally anticipated. As a result, while we still expect a gradual decline over the second half of the year, we estimate total U.S. market starts to be 185,000 to 200,000 for 2017. Approximately 9 million individuals were tested for HCV in 2016, a 15% increase from 2015. As you may recall, we launched an educational campaign in October of last year to encourage baby boomers to get tested. Our research shows that there has been an 80% increase in HCV antibody screening by baby boomers since the start of this initiative. As testing has increased, so has diagnosis. Approximately 190,000 people were newly diagnosed with HCV in 2016, a 32% increase from 2015. This reinforces our belief that there is a significant opportunity to treat and cure many HCV infected individuals for years to come. Gilead is committed to raising disease awareness and urging all individuals at risk for or living with HCV to talk to their health care provider. Turning to Europe, total HCV revenue in the second quarter was $591 million, down 24% year-over-year and up 21% from the previous quarter. As Robin mentioned, the quarter-on-quarter increase was due to the one-time recognition of a deferred revenue related to an HCV contract. Gilead patient starts were approximately 23,000 for the quarter, as declining trends in early launch countries were offset by the opening of access in other markets. With the addition of France, Italy and Spain earlier this year, all five major European markets have now agreed to expand access to patients regardless of fibrosis score. This means that there are now 16 European countries that allow patient access regardless of disease severity. We are seeing rapid uptake of Epclusa, mirroring the same success we had some nine months ago in the U.S. Epclusa is quickly becoming the standard of care for HCV patients with genotypes 2 and 3, and reimbursement has been achieved in 21 countries. While many people have been diagnosed with HCV and cured, there remain millions of people infected with HCV throughout Europe. In Germany, there are over 100,000 people estimated to be infected with HCV who are unaware that they have the disease. In partnership with the German Liver Foundation, Gilead has launched its first large multichannel disease awareness campaign to communicate that HCV can affect anyone and encourage all individuals at risk to talk to their health care provider. Looking to the second half of 2017, and with the launch of Vosevi, we believe that Gilead has the most comprehensive portfolio of products to meet the needs of almost all hepatitis C patients, regardless of disease severity, regardless of genotype and regardless of prior treatment. Finally, as I highlighted last quarter, our U.S. cardiopulmonary team is delivering consistently impressive results. They embody the same tenets of operational excellence as our HIV and liver teams. Letairis and Ranexa revenue total $430 million for the quarter. I would now like to turn the call over to Norbert. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin. Earlier this week we announced the exciting results presented at the IAS meeting in Paris from two Phase 3 studies, studies 1489 and 1490 evaluating a fixed dose combination of B/F/TAF compared to the triple-therapy regimens containing dolutegravir among treatment-na\u00efve patients. In Study 1489, adults with HIV were randomized to receive B/F/TAF or the fixed-dose combination of abacavir, dolutegravir, lamivudine, and in Study 1490, adults with HIV were randomized to receive B/F/TAF or dolutegravir plus F/TAF. In both studies, B/F/TAF met its primary objective of non-inferiority as defined by the proportion of patients who achieved biological suppression. There was no treatment-emerging resistance through 48 weeks. B/F/TAF was well tolerated and no patients discontinued study medication due to renal events in either study. Additionally, no new safety signals were observed, and the nature and incidence of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities was similar among treatment groups with the exception of nausea in Study 1489 which occurred with higher frequency in the abacavir-dolutegravir-lamivudine arm. It was also reported at the conference that in Study 1489 there were more patient self-reported neurological and constitutional adverse events in the abacavir-dolutegravir-lamivudine arm. These results reinforce the value of pairing bictegravir, an unboosted integrase inhibitor with a high barrier to resistance, with the demonstrated long-term safety profile of the F/TAF backbone, addressing the limitations of current HIV therapy. B/F/TAF could represent an important advance in the triple-therapy treatment for a broad range of HIV patients including the aging population and those with mild to moderate renal impairment. Last month, Gilead filed a new drug application for B/F/TAF with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration based on data from studies 1489 and 1490 and two other ongoing studies evaluating the single-tablet regimen in virologically suppressed patients. In both these studies, patients were randomized to either switch to B/F/TAF or remain on their existing regimen, which in one study is a triple-therapy regimen containing abacavir-dolutegravir-lamivudine, and the other study, a regimen of two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors and a boosted protease inhibitor. We plan to present data from these studies at scientific meetings later this year. In addition to these four studies, we have one other study ongoing where patients on dolutegravir and Descovy are randomized to stay on that regimen or switch to B/F/TAF. In the European Union, Gilead's marketing authorization application for B/F/TAF was fully validated earlier this month and is now under evaluation by the European Medicines Agency. With regards to HIV prevention research, we're pleased to report that the DISCOVER trial is now fully enrolled ahead of schedule with more than 5,000 participants across North America and Europe. The DISCOVER study randomized patients to receive Truvada or Descovy to evaluate whether Descovy is safe and effective at reducing the risk of HIV infection when used as a pre-exposure prophylaxis. Turning to NASH, two Phase 3 trials, STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4 are underway, evaluating selonsertib, which is our ASK-1 inhibitor in patients with F3 bridging fibrosis and F4 cirrhosis. Enrollment in these studies is going well, and since initiating the studies in March of this year, we have already screened more than 1,000 patients. We're confident that these studies will be fully enrolled in the first half of 2018. Recall that in a phase 2 study, selonsertib was shown to reverse fibrosis and decrease fibrosis progression in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, two other compounds with different mechanisms of action, an ACC inhibitor, GS-0976, and an FXR agonist GS-9674, are currently in Phase 2 with data readouts anticipated in the second half of this year. We're also exploring combinations of the three agents in Phase 2a studies. In oncology, a Phase 3 study of andecaliximab, which is our anti-MMP-9 antibody in patients with gastric cancer is ongoing and interim futility analysis from this study will be conducted later this year. In addition, the Phase 2a study has been initiated to evaluate combinations of our BTK inhibitor, tirabrutinib, with our PI3K inhibitor, idelalisib, and our Syk inhibitor, entospletinib, in combination with obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed refractory CLL. We're also evaluating entospletinib in a Phase 2 study in acute myeloid leukemia. In inflammation, five Phase 3 studies of filgotinib are ongoing in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 study with filgotinib in combination with GS-9876, a Syk inhibitor. In summary, significant progress has been made with many of our programs. Four molecules are continuing in Phase 3, including the Descovy for PrEP, Selonsertib for NASH, filgotinib for rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and we expect to see a number of regulatory and clinical milestones in the second half of this year. I would now like to turn over the call to John. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thanks, Norbert. I'm going to keep my remarks brief so we can get your questions. I do want to emphasize the importance of Norbert's comment a few moments ago. We've made tremendous strides with antiretroviral therapy over the past two decades. But still today every treatment option available has some compromise, be that a food requirement, the risk of side effects, tolerability, the emergence of viral resistance or a potential interaction with another medication. Those trade-offs and compromises that people living with HIV and their healthcare providers have to make may be minimized to perhaps the greatest extent possible with B/F/TAF. This is why we're so encouraged by the data presented at the IAS Conference in Paris this week and by the data in patients switching from other HIV medications that will be presented at scientific meetings later this year. I'd also like to take this time to congratulate our partner, Janssen, for the positive CHMP opinion on Symtuza, a single-tablet regimen containing darunavir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide, or TAF. When approved by the European commission, Symtuza will be the first commercially available STR containing a protease inhibitor, an important option for patients who previously had to consume two or more tablets every day. Turning to HCV, last month the CHMP issued a positive opinion on Gilead's application for marketing authorization for Vosevi. Then just last week, the U.S. FDA approved Vosevi for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1 through 6 in patients who virus rebounded during or after treatment with an NS5A inhibitor and in patients with genotypes 1a and 3 who have been previously treated with a sofosbuvir-containing regimen. The approval is three weeks ahead of the PDUFA date and marks Gilead's fourth HCV therapy approval in three-and-a-half years. We commenced our launch plan immediately upon notification by FDA. Bottles of Vosevi were shipped to wholesalers last week and it is now available in pharmacies. We are aware that prescriptions were written within hours of the approval and are pleased that many patients who have run out of options and are worried about the progression of their liver disease will now have another chance to be cured of their HCV infection. We had a strong second quarter, and as you heard from Norbert, our pipeline is growing and maturing in HIV, NASH, inflammatory diseases and oncology. We are looking ahead to a number of exciting clinical milestones in the second half of this year and the continued progression of the B/F/TAF regulatory review in the U.S., Europe and other countries. I want to take this opportunity to thank Gilead's 9.000 employees for the incredible focus, hard work and execution over the first half of this year. In the interest of time. let's now open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question and congrats on the quarter. Got one for Kevin or Norbert. So the Genvoya launch continues to look really, really good. But I wanted to know, now that you have the bictegravir data in hand, one, how are you thinking about positioning relative to Genvoya; and two, is there enough differentiation versus dolutegravir to take share that you didn't get with Genvoya? Thanks. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey, Geoff. Thank you for the question. I should say straightaway that not in the room today is Jim Meyers, our Executive Vice President for Commercial Operations, because actually Jim has been in Paris these last few days. He's heading back today and he certainly relayed to us the excitement around Bic/F/TAF. We've had several key opinion leader advisory boards and I think the data that we've presented them from the first two studies have been exceedingly well received. Having said that, Geoff, we've made a flying start with Genvoya. I don't think we could be happier. As I said in my script, over half of our patients are now TAF-based in the U.S., and we have a range of different conversions in Europe, but somewhere like Germany, it was our first country, is now upwards of 65%. So we're thrilled with the adoption of Genvoya. Not only that, Descovy and Odefsey, and as I think I've said in the past, the success of Bic/F/TAF is on the platform of the adoption of Descovy-based regimens. So we consider this a total family. We're still really excited about Bic/F/TAF. Nothing has changed. The data is reinforced so we got tremendous product. It's a beautiful small pill and we think it can be very strongly additive to our F/TAF portfolio of drugs. So as far as we're concerned, we're now going to be moving to very high gear for the launch of that new regimen come 2018. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah, Geoff, you asked about differentiation from dolutegravir. If you look at the results from Study 1490, the two, so comparing dolutegravir F/TAF to B/F/TAF, the two drugs are virologically identical. Adverse events, laboratory abnormalities are the same, the real differentiation is we have one single pill co-formulated, one co-pay, one pill. That's the big differentiation from dolutegravir. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So thanks, thanks very much. I was on mute for a second there. I guess if I could ask, you called out, I guess, the broad question here is around what you're seeing in the HCV market and sort of sustainability of the revenues that you've talked about. And related to that, could you just comment, I think you called out a couple one-time items, but you didn't disclose the size of the inventory or the size of the 1X tenants (31:31). If you'd be willing to just \u2013 if you're not willing to disclose that number, could you just give us an idea of the relative size of those? That would be helpful. Thanks. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey, Matthew. It's Kevin. I'll kick off and then Robin can add to my comments. We're very pleased that there is this increased number of patients that have started in the first half of the year. I think naturally we were careful and sensitive in going into 2017. A cure market has surprises on the way up and it certainly surprises on the way down. So I think we took a very careful approach to what might happen in 2017. It is clear that more patients are starting than we had predicted in our guidance, and as I said in my opening remarks, we now think it's going to be in the range of 185,000 to 200,000 patients. So clearly that's very positive. The other thing I would say is my comments on identifying HCV-infected individuals. If you think about it, as we're treating and curing patients, we want to make sure that the patients infected are coming into the system, albeit that they generally seem to be less ill than they were a few years ago. But it's important to still keep the movement of patients coming through. And as I said, we still consider this a large market, a very important market for Gilead, albeit that we still think there is a gradual trend down and where that sort of turns the corner or bottoms out, right now, still remains to be seen. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hi, Matt. And to answer the other part of your question, the specific items that we called out. So on HCV, in the U.S., we did talk about inventory. And I would say that trend is not any different than what we've typically seen in HIV. I think we'd not called them out in the past because we typically had other changes that somewhat masked them. But with a sequential change or with a sequential kind of stabilization of pricing as well as patient starts and market share, that shift in inventory is just more noticeable. But the same IMA agreements are in place for HIV exists, that the ranges for our overall inventory were maintained quarter-on-quarter. And keep in mind, with the Epclusa launch last fall, just that ongoing volatility until you get to steady state is what we see the dynamics impacting us where we had kind of an inventory build here, given inventory adjustments the last couple of quarters. I just want to emphasize that despite the inventory change, that the real underlying driver is just what Kevin talked about in the U.S. It's really increased patient starts, and so the inventory change was just one component of the over-performance. In EU, the other area we called out was the one-time deferred revenue recognition from a volume-based contract agreement that we had in Italy that expired. So we had been recognizing revenue a little conservative to-date, and so we had a catch-up one-time adjustment. If you take that out, the HCV revenue for Europe sequentially would been about flat. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Geoff Porges with Leerink Partners. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks very much. Two very quick questions. I apologize, but could you, Robin, could you let us know when we should anticipate the first generic Truvada in the U.S. given your agreement with Teva? At least, can we anticipate that it won't be in the next 18 months? And secondly, Norbert, I'm sure you've looked very hard at the filgotinib clinical experience to-date, and could you comment on whether you've seen any thromboembolic events? Any imbalance in such events? Or whether you believe in any way it's related to JAK kinase inhibition? John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So specifically to the first question, Geoff, it's John Milligan. With regard to generic Truvada, we don't expect generic Truvada in the United States until 2021. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Thanks. That's very helpful. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes, Geoff, we have looked, of course, at our database since the news was announced by Lilly and Incyte, and we have found a total of three thromboembolic events. This is, by the way, in a database of 1,900 patient years of experience. One of the events was, by the investigator said, not related to the study drug because it was recurrent. This was pulmonary embolism. One of them was unlikely, and one of them was possible. So it's really a small number. And as you also know, thrombolic events, inflammatory conditions in general are not unusual. But I would like to point out, we are, in our filgotinib study, I think we have de-risked the program by pursuing two doses. This is something that FDA asked us to do. We agreed. And so if there should be a difference between the two doses, we will see it. Geoff, I would like to add another quick \u2013 this is more speculation and hypothesis. If you believe that these events that Lilly saw are drug-related, so that's of course a big question, because they saw a total of five. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Yes. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: The second is if you then believe that they have to do with high platelet numbers, this then all kind of makes sense because baricitinib makes platelets go up. Filgotinib in contrast shows a platelet decrease. So if this is real and if this is the mechanism, then we should not be seeing this. Again, this is somewhat speculative and hypothesis. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks very much for the two questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a very solid quarter. I guess, Kevin, I just want to dig a little bit more into the trends we're seeing in Europe. I saw that Genvoya rose up to the top position in na\u00efves, and I guess I just want to know a little bit more under the hood of what's driving the dynamics there in Europe for HIV. Thanks. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hi, Alethia. Thank you for the comments. Yeah, we're delighted with the quarter. I think it was just all round solid across regions, all our products are. I also salute Norbert for some incredible milestones on the R&D front. So we're really pleased with where we are as a company in the middle of the year. Yes, Genvoya is now starting to exhibit across the countries the same performance that we are having in the U.S. The extreme of that is Germany. We're having very good uptake in Spain and Italy. And of course as I highlighted, France has done extraordinarily well just in four months to become the leading na\u00efve and switch product. The other thing I should say, Alethia, is that Descovy in itself is doing very, very well in Europe. There are one or two markets that don't have the level of STRs that we have here in the United States, if you take somewhere like Germany. So Descovy itself is doing very well and we're happy to have that switch from Truvada to Descovy because it's a great platform for B/F/TAF in the future. So I think we're very pleased to be where we are and I only see great momentum across the European countries. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Skorney with Robert Baird. Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. John, I know if I asked you what company you're going to buy, you'd tell me, but I think the market should keep guessing, so I'm going to ask something else. The new diagnosis rates in HCV are pretty impressive, but I wonder if you could characterize the trends you're seeing in access in the U.S. and maybe provide some characterization of what type of patients are being diagnosed. It never seemed like actual patient diagnosed volume is an issue, so are these patients that are being diagnosed or do you think that are accessible from the current payer situation, and is the payer situation improving from your point of view? Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Maybe, Brian, I could start with that. We're not seeing a great deal of change. Pretty much the patients are, if you like, settling down. They are na\u00efve to therapy, lower fibrosis scores. Generally we have about the same access that we had in terms of start of the year. So there has not been any big, fundamental changes. I think there are still a proportion of patients somewhere in the region of 20% to 25% who do get diagnosed with quite advanced disease. But on a general basis they are fitter than the established patients that were there in doctors' offices and have been sat there for a long time waiting for a new treatment. So that's kind of bad news/good news because we do eventually believe that they will come through the system and make this a long-term market for us. Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I think my question was just really meant more around the new patients are \u2013 I mean, are we looking at the spike in patients, are these patients that are diagnosed who are incarcerated, or is it heterogeneous and kind of the standard? So I want to know, is the spike in new diagnosis, is it actually going to pay off or is it in a patient population that's more or less inaccessible to branded products right now? John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Brian, most of the folks who are seeking diagnosis are people who have access to very, very good medical care. This is not about incarceration. The rate of treatment of incarcerated individuals is still exceedingly low in this country, something that we're focusing on but have had very little traction on. So people who we're seeking, essentially the baby boomers who we're seeking, typically have very good healthcare or Medicare. Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, thanks. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: And so this a very good, accessible population. Operator : Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Citibank. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe we could just follow-up and ask a little bit more about what's going on in the HIV market and who is switching. Who is not switching to these new therapies in the United States? And what percentage of switch is coming from Triumeq or Tivicay regimens? Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hi, Robyn. Nice to hear your voice again. Congratulations on I think the addition to your family. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So great to have you back. Really the results are very positive across the board. As I said, about 30% of switches come to Genvoya. When you start to break down the rest of it, it tends to be kind of a mishmash, a whole bunch of other switches. In terms of your question about how much of Genvoya comes from non-Gilead regimens, that's just over, that's 10% to 11% and that's stayed fairly constant since we launched Genvoya. So that's all additive to us. It's very positive and I think that will probably stay about where it is. So I wouldn't say there's any particular new dynamics. The switch continues to be the biggest part of the HIV market and Genvoya is clearly leading the products in the go-to switch regimen. Overall, I think we're just absolutely delighted that physicians see the benefit of having their patients on long-term TAF-based regimens good for the suppression of HIV and obviously good for their kidneys and good for the bones. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And as a follow up, do you think there's anyone \u2013 do you have a sense yet that there's a percentage of people that you will not be able to switch? Or when do you think you'll have a good sense of maybe a part of the market that will not be switching to these new therapies? Will it take the launch of the F/TAF for you to understand that or do you think you kind of have a sense of that right now? Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Well we do hope Genvoya is going to keep going up until we bring in the F/TAF in 2018. Robin, there are certain patients who are just very familiar with their therapies. I dare say there's still going to be some Atripla patients, Stribild patients, Complera patients. They're just comfortable. Even after discussion with their physician, sometimes patients don't want to switch. And also don't forget, you've got a smaller proportion of patients who are on the PI regimens and sometimes physicians who feel that they perhaps might not be quite as adherent prefer them to be on a PI-based regimen. So there may not be the patients who come across. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to go back to HIV again. In some of the doublet data that was presented at IAS, there was a very small subset of patients that experienced resistance mutations, secondary to extreme nonadherence. I'm curious as to your views on this and whether you think it's a meaningful finding or just noise. Thanks. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes, Cory, thanks for the question. It's Norbert. There's no doubt that both dolutegravir and 3TC are proven long-term tolerable and safe drugs. The question that everybody has, are the two by themselves enough to chronically suppress virus replication in a broad patient population irrespective of baseline viral load and irrespective of partial adherence. And I think the data that were presented at IAS, ACTG 5353 has put that into doubt. Even though these patients were non-adherent, the one especially that developed the 263 mutation, the fact is this is real life. These patients do exist. Not all patients are adherent all the time. And we just have to wait for long-term two-year data to really answer this question. By the way, if you look at the detailed slides, there were actually five patients that had virological failure if you use the FDA definition of greater than 50 copies per ml at week 24, and it was at week 24 analysis. So again, we need to see more data and I know that the Phase 3 studies are ongoing, the GEMINI studies and hopefully we'll get the answer from that. But as I said, at this point I have great doubts whether that dolutegravir/3TC is enough to cover a broad patient population. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Cory, it's Kevin here. If you get virological failure and resistance in a controlled clinical setting in a study, then I don't know what might happen in real life. It's important to say that with the large numbers of HIV patients that are treated these days, many have quite chaotic personal lives in terms of housing and the need for social care, and they are very challenged. And I think it's important that those type of patients really do get robust therapies that do our very best to avoid them getting into difficult situations of failure. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe first one for Norbert. We heard from some physicians attending IAS this week that there's a small but potentially meaningful difference in CNS studies such as sleep quality or disturbance or insomnia. How meaningful is that in the real practice? Do you think that you can make a differentiation between bictegravir and the Tivicay or Triumeq regimen? And then secondly, maybe for Kevin, we're expecting AbbVie to obtain FDA approval probably this quarter for their once-daily one pill regimen for HCV. What's the outlook for market share and also the pricing dynamics once AbbVie enters the market with another one pill once-daily regimen for HCV? Thank you. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes. So, Ying, in Study 1489, which was the trial mate to bictegravir B/F/TAF comparison, there were clearly more adverse, self-reported adverse events that had to do with sleep disturbance, nausea, et cetera, on the abacavir-containing arm. But in the second, Study 1490, the incidence was similar. So our interpretation is that what we are seeing in terms of CNS-related effects and constitutional general well being has to do with abacavir. The comparison of bictegravir to dolutegravir did not really show a difference, and I cannot at this point tell you what bictegravir does in terms of CNS side effects. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey, Ying. It's Kevin. In answer to your question, we just don't know. We're just sort of two weeks before their FDA PDUFA date. We'll just have to cross some bridges when we see their label, we see their pricing, we see how they begin to promote the product, perhaps eventually see how they come on the market with their contracting strategies. So I think there are unknowns, and we'll just have to wait and see. I can only really control the areas that we have with our products, and I think we feel reassured by the portfolio of HCV products. Now we have Vosevi added to that. I think we have a tremendous offering in genotype 1, 2 and 3. Epclusa, as Robin mentioned, is doing really, really well, both here and now it's coming on-stream in Europe and we'll be able to also help the small number of patients who failed other therapies with Vosevi. So I think we're in a good position, and we're certainly going to continue with our very solid and very substantial promotion of our products. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Ying, I would like to add, if you look at the data on (52:34), they had excellent clinical results in genotype 1 in treatment-na\u00efve very early disease mostly F0 and F1. Actually, 80% of the population was F0 and F1 and in treatment-na\u00efve patients. But the data in the other genotypes and also in treatment-experienced and cirrhotic patients were less good, particularly if you look at genotype 3 where they compared in eight weeks to 12 weeks to 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir, the regimen that had the most virological failures was the eight weeks of the AbbVie dual followed by the 12 weeks of the AbbVie dual, and the best-performing regimen was actually sofosbuvir/daclatasvir. So as Kevin said, we just have to really look at what the U.S. label will look like, then we will be in a better position to comment on the competitive nature. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks. I have two R&D questions. One is on filgotinib, where you mentioned there was an interim analysis in UC in the first half of 2018. Can you just remind us a bit on that and what the importance is of that in terms of that interim? And then secondly, on FXR, you have a Phase 2 coming up soon in PBC. I wanted to understand your confidence in terms of efficacy and differentiation and what you would want to see to move forward in NASH? Thanks. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah, thank you, Michael. No, the interim analysis was not on filgotinib, it was on the MMP9 antibody andecaliximab. And that interim analysis is an analysis when we will have reached 30% of the endpoints, and the endpoint is death. So it's overall survival, and that will happen later this year. And we have a hazard ratio pre-specified, so it's more a futility analysis. If we don't reach a minimal hazard ratio, then we will probably discontinue the study. But if the DSMB sees that has a ratio reached, they will simply recommended to continue the study. And the second question. Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC : Maybe I'm just reading it wrong on slide 51, and so I'll follow up with you. On the top there it says filgotinib, Phase 3 UC interim. But we'll keep going. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Okay. Yes, we'll follow up with you afterwards. I don't have slide 51. And the other question had is about FXR agonist in PBC. We just have to see what the data looks like. But as you know, or may know, we are differentiated in terms of mechanism because we rely on intestinally generated FGF19 to essentially give you the efficacy. And we think some the side effects that have been seen with the other FXR agonist may have to do with systemic FXR agonism. It's all hypothesis and the initial data that we have would actually support it. But if we were to see this, we could have an agent that is differentiated from a safety point of view. And the other thing you may probably also know, the compound that's approved currently has pretty severe limitations with regards to hepatic impairment. I think it has to be given, is it once a week? I don't remember, but it greatly increases the concentration of OCA. So those are the two areas of differentiation. Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the beat and raise in the quarter. One question on bictegravir's data that was presented earlier this week. When GSK was asked about bictegravir this morning, they highlighted the numeric differences in virologic suppression that we're seeing in Study 1490, although those differences weren't statistically significant. I guess along those lines, one, to what to do you attribute those differences? Two, how successful do you think you'll be in convincing physicians that they are not significant, using things like the missing excluded analysis that you showed in the poster. And three, do you even expect them to be on the label? Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Sure. So, Phil, this is actually very simple. You can have virological failure. There are three categories that fall into it. Number one, you come in at the week 48 visit and you truly have above 50 copies per ml, that's one virological failure. The second is if you discontinue and the physician indicates on the discontinuation form that you've discontinued for the lack of efficacy, that's number two. And the third category is, if you have discontinued at any point in time for administrative reason and your last measurement was greater than 50. And now look at that third category. We had a total of 11 patients on the bictegravir arm versus three on the dolutegravir arm that discontinued due to administrative reason. And out of those 11, by the way, six only showed up at the first visit. So they showed up, first visit, took the drug and then we never saw them again. And the reason was various : they moved out of the area, they couldn't be reached anymore, they were incarcerated, things like that. So we think this is a completely a non-issue and we will have no problems at all convincing physicians that this doesn't matter. These numbers will be in the label, absolutely. This is how FDA, in all HIV drugs, in all Phase 3 data categorizes thing. But it will be categorized exactly this : virological failure due to number one; two, virological failure, discontinued due to lack of efficacy; and number three, and that's the category I want to point your attention to, discontinued for other reasons and last measurement was greater than 50. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey, Phil, it's Kevin. Just to also add, the real \u2013 the number one headline that is most important to opinion leaders, and therefore the HIV community, is zero resistance. When we have met with our KOLs, that is where they go to first, it's zero resistance, and of course, that is unlike the situation that occurred in ACTG 5353. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes, Phil, just another comment. You would of course expect in a large study like this that these random events would equally distribute between the two arms. Well, they didn't. As I said, there were 11 on the bictegravir arm versus three on the other arm. It's purely statistical coincidence and it has no meaning whatsoever clinically. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn, Ph.D. - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just was wondering, John, if you can give us any update on your latest thoughts on business development, specifically if there have been any changes with respect to either areas of focus or stage of development. Thanks a lot. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thanks, Terence. So the quick answer is no. There hasn't been any difference in what we're thinking about. So we have been very, very active, as we always are. We have beefed up our groups, as you're aware, so that we can evaluate more different kinds of opportunities. And so we are working very hard behind the scenes here on a number of things, but I certainly can't direct you to anything specific, other than to say that we're very, very active. And when the things are right for us, we'll announce them. That's all I can say. Operator : Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital Markets. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks for taking my questions, and congratulations on a great quarter. Really, just a question on the PrEP opportunity. If you could just quantify for us what the opportunity is today, whether it's in patient terms or dollar terms. And as we think about the DISCOVER study, what does that trial need to show for you to effectively transition these patients from Truvada to Descovy? Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hi, Ian. It's Kevin. I'll let Norbert answer the question on the DISCOVER study. But in terms just generally, compared to the few years ago, it's quite remarkable now how people are taking on board the benefits of PrEP and obviously avoiding infection. We've seen some remarkable work here in San Francisco. We see a lot of activity in New York, Miami, and we have taken those signals and put a larger field-based team out there to try and support the education around PrEP. So we're able to visit places now like Atlanta, Washington, DC and many other urban areas. About half of our Truvada sales in the U.S. are currently coming from PrEP, and we certainly expect that to grow. If you look at our numbers this year compared to 2016, we're about 15% higher in terms of the use of Truvada for PrEP. And the other part of this is, it's not occasional monthly use of Truvada. We're starting to see persistency at a patient level that is close to matching normal HIV use of Truvada. So we're seeing a chronicity, a regular use among PrEP-using individuals. And the final thing I would say, Ian, is that we are seeing other parties starting to announce that, for example, retail pharmacies are beginning initiatives that their pharmacist can engage in conversations on PrEP and what PrEP is about and educate people who come into a retail pharmacy to ask about PrEP medication. So that's also I think part of the momentum and movement that's going on right now. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah, Ian, from a clinical point of view it's very simple. It's a non-inferiority study. We want to simply show that regarding efficacy-wise that F/TAF is the same as Truvada along with improved renal and bone parameters. And then because it's much easier and safer to use, you don't have to monitor creatinine. You don't have to look for people that are at risk for bone effects. You don't have to measure BMD, that it's a much preferred agent to Truvada. That's essentially what we're showing. That's why it takes 5,000 patients, by the way. It's not a small study to do. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Right. I guess, Norbert, what I was trying to understand is, is the patient sensitivity any different? Are they more sensitive or less sensitive to the adverse event profile of TAF given that they're \u2013 obviously don't carry the infection? Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: No. Actually, Ian, so I don't have those data yet, but we answered that question when we did the PrEP studies with Truvada. There was a question that both we and the FDA had and the question was, can you take safety data from HIV-infected individuals and extrapolate the non-HIV infected, and the conclusion was you can't. So we generated data in about, I can't remember, 25,000 patients total that were not HIV infected, and that database convinced everybody that the safety is the same. There's no difference between HIV infected and non-HIV infected patients. Operator : Our next question comes from Salim Syed with Mizuho. Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. Just on, when we're thinking about the tail for hepatitis C, I don't think (65:47) these numbers in a while but correct me if I'm wrong. There's 1.4 million patients treated and there was 4 million to begin with in the U.S. and people have previously thought there was 500,000 that are uninsured and untreated. Of the 2.6 million of which that 500,000 is part of, is there any other patient population as you guys have had more time pass that's not treatable here, or reasonably treatable? Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey, Salim. It's Kevin. We've always in the U.S. gone with figures that are about 3 million infected and about 1.5 million that are diagnosed. No, I don't think there's any sort of difference in our opinions of the market. There is a proportion of patients that is uninsured. There are a group of patients that are incarcerated. As John said earlier, we see very little treatment. We continue to have conversations with the various states around their systems of incarceration, but there doesn't seem to be much momentum about that. We talked in the past about obviously the VA. The VA has been incredibly proactive. They've dedicated money. We are hearing, we don't have direct data, but we're hearing that it is slowing down a little bit like the general market, but they continue their efforts to outbound information and try and get people into the system. They're incredibly enthusiastic to try and heal their veterans. And there's the continuation, as John said, of the commercial markets and we certainly are doing our part to try and highlight to patients the need to be tested and that there are very comprehensive ways of curing the disease. So I think for us to continue to do that at some point, at some point, there will be some equilibrium and that will still be a lot of patients. And with a incredible treatment that cures, payers, providers will be motivated to use therapies. So I don't think there has been any big ahas for us or particular opening of new patient groups in the past 12 months. Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, Kevin, on the Get Tested campaign, is the expectation that screening volumes will still continue to grow meaningfully? Or should we expect that impact to plateau, and is it safe to say that program will continue unchanged when AbbVie enters the market? Thank you. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Good question. Carter. I don't know what way. We could go higher. We always feel that part of our role in the areas, in our large areas that we operate is to provide education. As a reminder, our baby boomer campaign is not aired as much as our Harvoni campaign, but I think in general terms, yes we feel that it is important to continue to highlight that baby boomers potentially who have been in a situation of risk, that they might go and ask for a test and be screened and find out their status. Let's not forget that that principle is backed by the CDC and there is Gilead and there are many other parties that support baby boomers finding out their HCV status, and if they are positive, then to take the steps forward. So yes, we feel that as the leader in HCV, it is part and parcel of the role we play. Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Lee for any closing remarks. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Liz, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead, and the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on our future progress.",

My name is Karen, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Karen; and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the third quarter 2017. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section on the Gilead website. The speakers on today's call will be John Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Meyers, Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations. Also in the room with us for the Q&A session are Kevin Young, Chief Operating Officer; Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and Alessandro Riva, Executive Vice President, Oncology Therapeutics. Before we begin with our prepared comments, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, as well as on the Gilead website. I will now turn the call over to John. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Sung. It's been an incredibly busy and exciting few months here at Gilead. In late August, we announced the planned acquisition of Kite. About five weeks later, we completed the transaction and Kite and Gilead began operating as one company. Only 15 days after close, we received FDA approval for Yescarta, the first CAR-T therapy approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. Kite and Gilead employees are now working together to prepare for the first patients to enter Yescarta treatment. Consistent with the requirement of the Yescarta REMS program, the Kite team has begun collaborating with academic cancer centers to finalize training and complete certification. The first 13 centers are expected to be approved in about two weeks and each center will be able to accept patients for Yescarta treatment as soon as the approval is received. As those of you who followed Kite know, this will be a controlled launch to ensure patient safety. CAR-T therapy is complicated and can sometimes be associated with severe side effects. Even though the medical community has been learning over the course of the clinical trials how to more effectively manage adverse events, proper training and preparation for health care teams in oncology and transplantation centers is essential to help ensure the best outcome for CAR-T patients. Yescarta is a transformational therapy for patients who have run out of options and who are waiting for new treatments that may help them with their fight against cancer. And we greatly appreciate the partnership and leadership of FDA to approve Yescarta ahead of the PDUFA date, helping ensure it reaches patients as quickly as possible. Historically, only 7% of patients with refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma achieve a complete response, and patients on average shift six months when treated with the current standard of care. Yescarta serves the population who largely run out options and is essential to expedite access for those patients. The approval of the Yescarta is supported by data from the ZUMA-1 pivotal trial. In this study, 72% of patients treated with a single infusion of Yescarta responded to therapy, including 51% of patients who had a complete response and the median duration of response had not yet been reached after median follow-up of 7.9 months. Data from patients enrolled in the ZUMA-1 study who've had a minimum 12 months of follow-up will be presented at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December. Also at ASH, results will be presented from ZUMA-3, a Phase 1/2 study in adult patients with refractory or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Once the drug is approved, the work continues, of course. There are a number of studies of the Yescarta and other lymphomas in earlier lines of therapy that are planned or ongoing. Additionally, clinical studies of CD-19 CAR-Ts, or modified T-cell receptor T-cells are planned or ongoing in B-cell malignancies, leukemias, or solid tumors. Beyond these studies, Gilead and Kite will continue to invest in research and development in order to bring forward future generations of CAR-Ts and TCRs with a goal of increasing short and long-term complete response rates and improving safety. Gilead along with our new employees at Kite is proud to be part of the advancement of an innovative cellular therapy that is bringing hope and benefit to patients. I would like to take a moment to commend and congratulate Arie Belldegrun and the Kite team for what they have accomplished. CAR-T is among the most significant breakthroughs in cancer treatment in decades. And I look forward to sharing more about our progress in the coming months. Moving to other therapeutic areas, we continue to make significant progress with our liver disease pipeline. Last week researchers presented more than 40 abstracts, featuring a Gilead product or investigational compound at the Liver Meeting in Washington, D.C. including data on HCV, HBV, or NASH. During the late breaking abstract session, important Phase 2 data results for GS-0976, our investigational ACC inhibitor, were presented in patients with NASH. The data demonstrated that GS-0976 led to significant reductions in measures of liver fat and certain biomarkers of liver fibrosis compared to placebo. This is the first randomized placebo-controlled Phase 2 study of an ACC inhibitor in NASH. The study suggests that GS-0976 has a potential to play an important role in treating patients with the disease. We're also conducting Phase 2 combination studies of GS-0976 with Gilead's ASK-1 inhibitor, selonsertib, and the selective non-steroidal FXR agonist, GS-9674 in patients with NASH. Depending on the outcomes of these trials, we may initiate larger Phase 2 combination studies next year. Also at the Liver Meeting, researchers presented new data that demonstrate high cure rates in difficult to treat patients with Gilead's hepatitis C treatments and improved long-term bone and renal safety among patients with hepatitis B who are treated with Vemlidy, adding to the body of evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of Gilead's viral hepatitis therapies in diverse patient populations. In September, we announced that Sovaldi received approval in China. The first approval for a product that Gilead will launch directly in that country. Approximately, 10 million people are estimated to be living with HCV in China, highlighting a tremendous need, the regulatory filings for Harvoni and Epclusa are planned in the near future. We have begun hiring a team to support the launch of Sovaldi and future products with a focus on medical education and market access. Gilead's products serve important unmet needs in China, and in addition to the HCV products, we have filed the MAA for Vemlidy for HBV, and filings are planned for a number of our HIV products. As you'll hear from Jim in a few minutes, our TAF-based regimens are performing extremely well. In August, we announced that bictegravir, FTC/TAF, also known as B/F/TAF, our investigational fixed-dose combination of the integrase strand transfer inhibitor bictegravir and the Descovy background was accepted by FDA with prior review with a PDUFA date of February 12, 2018. Reviews also are underway in Europe with regulatory action expected toward the middle of next year. Data from two Phase 3 studies of B/F/TAF, demonstrating non-inferiority to dolutegravir-based triple-therapy regimens were presented at the International AIDS Society Conference in Paris in July. Earlier this month, we presented Phase 3 data on B/F/TAF, demonstrating non-inferiority when switching from a boosted Protease inhibitor-based regimen. These data suggest that B/F/TAF may be appropriate for a broad range of people living within HIV. In conclusion, we're confident in the underlying strength of Gilead's business, driven by the successful execution of key product launches and advancement of various programs in HIV, liver disease, and now, cellar therapy, all of which positions us well for long-term success. I will now turn the call over to Robin, who will review our financial performance for the quarter. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thanks, John; and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to share our financial results for the third quarter of 2017. Total revenues for the third quarter were $6.5 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.27. This compares to revenues of $7.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.75 for the same period last year. Product sales for the third quarter were $6.4 billion, down 14% year-over-year and down 9% sequentially. As expected, we continue to see the impact of lower HCV patient start and the beginning effects of increased competition on our HCV franchise in the third quarter. The declines in HCV revenue were partially offset by the strong uptake of our HIV portfolio, resulting in increased non-HCV revenues. Turning to the U.S. Product sales for the third quarter were $4.5 billion, down 10% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. HCV product sales were $1.4 billion, down 31% year-over-year and 26% sequentially. The declines were primarily driven by lower patient starts and the effects of increased competition. Non-HCV product sales were $3.1 billion, up 4% year-over-year, and 2% sequentially, driven primarily by higher demand for our TAF-based regimens. As a reminder, our prior-year third quarter revenues benefited from a favorable adjustment of $332 million to rebate reserve primarily related to our TDF-based regimens. Excluding this adjustment, our non-HCV revenues grew 16% year-over-year. Turning to Europe. Product sales for the third quarter were $1.2 billion, down 15% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to competitive dynamics in HCV and the loss of exclusivity for Viread and Truvada as was expected. The sequential decline was primarily due to the recognition of deferred revenue in the second quarter related to an HCV contract as well as lower total HCV market patient starts. Now, turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $745 million for the third quarter, down 24% compared to the same period last year due primarily to the 2016 impact of a $200 million milestone expense associated with Nimbus. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $806 million compared to $780 million in the prior year. Moving to the balance sheet. During the third quarter, we generated cash flows from operations of $2.7 billion and ended the quarter with $41.4 billion in cash and investments, inclusive of $3 billion in cash raised for the Kite acquisition via a debt issuance of senior unsecured notes. In October, we raised an additional $6 billion in term loans to fund a portion of the acquisition. We paid cash dividends of $682 million and repurchased 2 million shares of stock for $153 million in the third quarter. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged and we will continue to prioritize the use of capital for investing in the long-term growth of our business. Finally, I would like to update our full-year 2017 guidance provided to you on July 26 and summarize on slide 21 in the earnings results presentation available on our corporate website. We are increasing the lower end of our previous range of net product sales guidance. We now expect net product sales to be between $24.5 billion to $25.5 billion. Non-HCV net product sales are expected to be in the range of $16 billion to $16.5 billion. HCV net product sales are expected to be in the range of $8.5 billion to $9 billion. We are decreasing the range for product gross margin to 86% to 87%. R&D expense is expected to be in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. SG&A expense is expected to be in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. We are decreasing the range for the effective tax rate to 25% to 27%. This guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties which are highlighted on slide 21 in the earnings results presentation, including the accuracy of our estimates for HCV patient starts for the remainder of 2017, and lower-than-expected market share and greater price erosion in HIV as the result of the introduction of generic versions of TDF and the fixed-dose combination of FTC/TDF outside the U.S. I will now turn the call over to Jim to discuss Gilead's commercial performance during the quarter. James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: All right. Well, thank you, Robin; and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to provide an update on our commercial performance for the third quarter, starting with HIV. In the U.S., our HIV and HBV franchise delivered another very strong quarter, with revenues of $2.7 billion. TAF-based regimens now account for 56% of Gilead's total HIV prescription volume, up from 39% as we entered 2017. This rapid migration to TAF-based regimens reflects widespread physician acceptance of the Descovy backbone. Genvoya has been the most prescribed therapy across all categories, treatment-na\u00efve, switch and total treated patients since the third quarter of 2016. In addition, Descovy is on track to surpass both Atripla and Truvada to become the second most successful HIV product launch in U.S. history behind only Genvoya. We continue to see strong uptake of Truvada for PrEP. As we exited the third quarter, there were approximately 145,000 people in the U.S. taking Truvada for this indication, representing a five-fold increase since January 2015. Even with this accelerated growth, however, the CDC estimates that there are still approximately 40,000 people infected each year. We have seen the impact of the use of Truvada for PrEP along with other prevention efforts on reducing new infections in certain communities in the U.S. And in hopes of building on this success in other regions, Gilead launched two new targeted media campaigns during the quarter aimed at educating people in at-risk populations who currently have low awareness of HIV prevention and PrEP. Turning to Europe, total HIV and HBV revenues were $716 million in the third quarter, down 2% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. The quarter-on-quarter decrease was driven by the entries of generic TDF and TDF/FTC. Like in the U.S., strong uptake of our TAF-based regimens continues throughout Europe. Genvoya is the most prescribed therapy for both treatment-na\u00efve and switch patients across the top five European markets. Physician and patient preference for TAF-based regimens remains strong, resulting in a 25% sequential quarterly revenue growth for the TAF portfolio. In early launch markets like Germany, TAF-based regimens already account for more than 75% of Gilead's total HIV prescription volume. In France, Europe's largest HIV market, twice as many patients are switching to Genvoya as to any other regimen. And finally, in Italy, the uptake of both Descovy and Genvoya over the first four months of launch exceeded that of any prior HIV launch in the country. Turning to Hep C. Total HCV revenues in the U.S. were $1.4 billion in the third quarter, down 31% year-over-year and down 26% sequentially. The quarter-on-quarter decrease was driven by declining HCV patient starts and the impact of increased competition. 39,000 patients began treatment on a Gilead regimen during the quarter, down 9% from the prior quarter, continuing the gradual decline in HCV patient starts that we've seen since the beginning of 2017. In July, we launched Odefsey. The first single tablet regimen approved for the retreatment of adults with chronic HCV, fulfilling the unmet need for an effective regimen for patients who could not be cured with other therapies. For this small group of patients, Odefsey provides an important new treatment option. Turning to Europe. We continue to see strong uptake of Epclusa, which is now the leading HCV regimen across the major European markets. We are also pleased to report that the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Odefsey in July with reimbursement already achieved in Germany. And reimbursement is on track in other countries as payers acknowledge the unmet medical need. Overall, Gilead HCV patient starts in Europe were approximately 21,000 for the quarter. Over the course of 2017, we have observed lower patient starts in some of our early launch markets, partially offset by the impact of broader patient access in countries like Italy and France. And earlier this month, Spain and Switzerland granted access \u2013 expanded access by removing fibrosis score restrictions. Before moving away from HCV, I wanted to say a few words about the impact of new competition. As we have noted in the past, revenues in the HCV market are driven by four variables. Patient starts, net pricing, market share, and treatment duration. While patient starts have exceeded our expectations in 2017, the arrival of new competition has further eroded Gilead's market share and net pricing, which is now similar across genotypes. Some of those changes can be seen in our third quarter results. But the impact on pricing and market share will be more fully reflected beginning in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we have worked with payers to ensure the position in patient access to Harvoni and Epclusa in 2018 will remain similar to what we saw in 2017. We believe that Gilead has the most comprehensive offering of treatments for patients with all types of HCV; importantly, backed by real-world cure rates comparable to clinical trial results. I'd like to close on the topic John began with. And that is last week's U.S. approval of Yescarta, which came in full six weeks ahead of the PDUFA day. Upon approval, we immediately began work to certify 16 leading cancer centers in 13 states to administer Yescarta. Given the exciting promise of CAR-T therapy and patient need, our new colleagues are actively working to train more than 20 additional institutions with an eventual target of 70 to 90 centers across the U.S. As we embark on this revolutionary new approach to treating cancer, our colleagues at Kite are working extensively with payers and institutions to educate them on CAR-T and Yescarta as well as collaborating with other key stakeholders to ensure understanding of the therapy's value and how to navigate the implementation and reimbursement processes. In keeping with our long-standing commitment to help make Gilead therapies accessible to patients in need, we are pleased to have Kite Connect in place. This is a program developed by the Kite team that is customized to meet the unique needs of seriously ill cancer patients. We look forward to updating you on the progress with the Yescarta launch in the coming months. In closing, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their commitment and dedication. For the Gilead employees who continue to work hard to ensure patients have access to our life-saving medications and for our new colleagues at Kite who have been able to bring a breakthrough cancer treatment to patients with no other options. I would now like to open the call for your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Afternoon, and thanks for the question. Just to follow on some of the recent comments in your prepared remarks on Hep C. You guys have had some success last quarter and recently growing new starts. What's been this trend of late, especially now with the new product in the market from AbbVie. And I know you don't want to go into too much detail, but maybe speak generally to the length of commercial and public contracts just thinking of the dynamics looking into next year and beyond. Thank you. James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Sure. I think there were a couple of questions in here. Maybe I'll deal with the contracts, which you mentioned. So what happened really is what typically is a 12-month contractual cycle that we're used to, really became a 15-month contractual cycle just largely based upon the timing of the launch of the new competition. So everything that we're working through right now in terms of finalizing the contractual process are contracts that will go through the balance of 2018. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey, Geoff, it's Kevin Young here. Let me add a little bit on the starts. The starts overall were down for the total HCV market down 51,000 for this quarter, the third quarter versus 53,000. And there was also some change as you would expect because there is a new entrant in our market share. There was a tiny bit of pricing effect, but as Jim pointed out, that pricing and share effect will have a bigger impact in the fourth quarter and then rolling into 2018. I have to say I think we're still in a really strong position, as Jim pointed out for 2018. We have really preserved the availability in our commercial payers and Part D for 2018 to use our options for Hepatitis C. So that's what we were really asked to do by our hepatologists and I think it gives them the option to use the best-in-class therapies, whatever the genotype. So whilst we are seeing changes from competition, and that is somewhat inevitable, we still believe we're in a strong position with regards to our portfolio. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC : Thanks for the question. Following along in Hep C, realizing that this is an issue, I think, people want to see stabilize out. How are you thinking about the dynamics you mentioned as you go into 2018? And the step-down you could see in fourth quarter and then going into 2018? In other words, where do you think patient starts and market share start to stabilize out? Do you think you'll see that by the first half of 2018? How are you thinking about that so investors can get confident about the flattening out. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hi, Mike. It's Robin. I'll take that. As you know, we updated guidance for 2017, but \u2013 and we're not going to use this call to really start to talk about 2018. I will go back to the overall factors that Jim mentioned. Clearly, looking at patient starts, net pricing, share and treatment duration. To Jim's earlier comments, clearly pricing and contracting, we'll continue to work through and complete by the end of the year. But the impact of those other variables are things that we'll work into as we provide guidance to you for 2018 next February. Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC : Okay. (28:04) Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Let me just add a little bit to Robin's comments. I think I've said on the last call that in terms of patient volume, it was looking like between 185,000 and about 200,000. We would sense that it's tracking to the kind of higher end of that in terms of patient starts. What happens next year, as Robin says, remains to be seen. The numbers that we have for Europe that we've put in our original guidance seem to be pretty solid and so do Japan. So the rates of treatment is still going on out there. Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Let me just ask it this way then. If there's a new competitor coming on, but the contracts are basically stabilized, do you think the large step-down or drop is basically going to be seen this quarter and then should stabilize after? And in other words, we're going to see the drop here coming up and then, that's really the big change here. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah. Michael, I would say that I think that in the fourth quarter you'll see more fully the impact of new competition on both price and share. We're not through with the contracting process. So again, I think that to Robin's point, we will issue guidance. We'll have a more complete picture of what 2018 looks like as we get closer to there. I can just tell you that again, we hope to \u2013 we believe strongly we'll be able to maintain access for physicians and patients in 2018 similar to what we had in 2017. We have been able to maintain parity and preferred access with the major payers at least in the Medicare and commercial books of business with those that we've worked with so far. Again, we also have maintained parity access in the VA. Where we will continue to remain disadvantaged is in the Medicaid segment, particularly the Medicaid Managed Care segment. But again, in those scenarios, we're mainly seeing Mavyret replace Zepatier. But in the areas where we got the majority of our business and had the greatest access, we will remain either at parity and preferred access, and we are very confident in our ability, when all of this shakes out, to continue to remain market leader from a share perspective. Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Appreciate that. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys, thanks very much for taking my question. Maybe shifting gears away from Hep C. You recently present data for GS-0976 at the AASLD Conference. Was wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit more details in terms of your view of the benefit risk there and manageability of some of the lipid changes. Where this mechanism could potentially fit into the paradigm relative to the other therapies in your portfolio? And the next steps of that asset? Thanks. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah, Brian. It's Norbert. So thanks for that question. Yeah, we presented data \u2013 12 weeks data by the way. We couldn't do a longer study, because we didn't have the supporting talks, (31:28) talks done. That's done now, of course. And the data showed that there was a good reduction in liver fat as measured by MRI. There were also certain markers of fibrosis \u2013 biomarkers of fibrosis were down. Not all of them, but it looked then there was a dose response. So it was a very nicely behaved compound. And as John said in his prepared remarks, we will almost certainly start combination studies sometime next year. Now, you mentioned one side effect that we did see that was clearly drug-related was triglyceride elevations. Now two comments to that. First of all, out of the 16, the large majority, 12, occurred in patients that already started with high triglycerides of 250 or higher. Secondly, some of these triglyceride elevations were reduced to a lesser grade with continued dosing. So it seems to be an immediate effect. We think actually, by the way, mechanistic, it's a redistribution effect. You shut down lipid synthesis and then the triglycerides come by releasing VLDL from the liver. That's one hypothesis that we have. In the future, how we're going to manage this is, first of all, with statins or fish oil, and number two, by excluding those patients that have high triglycerides at baseline. We think this is manageable. As I said, either with con-meds or with choosing the patients carefully, and over time, the triglycerides may go down to normal levels. Again, we don't have data right now beyond 12 weeks. We will see that in the next study. Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks, Norbert. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Leerink. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks very much. Norbert, I'll follow up with another question for you. It's concerning filgotinib, and I'm just wondering if you could give us a sense of the approximate cumulative exposure to the drug. And what number of VT events you've seen? I know the studies are blinded, but presumably you've been notified and you're watching for these events. And then perhaps you could comment on whether you think that there is a class signal here or molecule-specific signals, or no signal. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah, Geoff. Thanks for the question. So the one study that's published where they looked at background venothrombolic events in RA points to a number of six per 1,000 patient years. So it's very rare, but it does occur in inflammatory conditions. Now, if you look across all the studies that have been published with JAK inhibitors, there's a pretty good variation. And while I don't \u2013 and by the way, we also believe that there is insufficient evidence that any of these JAK inhibitors that it's drug related. The numbers are just too small. So we (34:46) 1,300 patient years' experience with filgotinib across all our clinical studies. And I don't want to tell you the number that we have in terms of these events. It's very small. But if you look at the rate per patient year exposures, we're at the very low end of what other companies have seen and what has been reported in the literature. And the last thing I would like to add, Geoff, if you believe that these events are drug-related and if you believe that the mechanism has to do with JAK2 inhibition \u2013 and as I think I mentioned last time, there's a paper published that looked at a JAK2 knockout mouse, and those mice had higher platelet levels. So it's entirely possible that somehow the venous \u2013 the thromboembolic events have to do with high platelet levels, then we should not have that effect, because number one, filgotinib doesn't inhibit JAK2. And number two, we actually see platelets going down in our studies. So this is the extent of my wisdom that I have on this subject. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks, Norbert. I appreciate it. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Okay, Geoff. You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. If I could ask something on Yescarta. I guess I was looking for some of your insight about some of the dynamics that could influence the launch. And I guess two that come to mind for me are, one, can you talk a little bit about how the drug's going be paid for? Obviously, DRGs don't cover the total cost, especially for Medicare patients, and so how you think the financial impact to hospitals will play into the use. And then, second, maybe you could comment on the impact of the other sort of clinical trials that are going on at these centers, which I'm sure are in high demand and how you think that could impact the launch. Thanks. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Sure. Well, I'll take the first part and then maybe some combination \u2013 yeah, Alessandro on the second. But let me step back for a minute and just remind that the payer mix for \u2013 we believe, and I think we feel fairly confident about this \u2013 will be about 50% to 60% commercial; the rest, largely Medicare; a little bit of Medicaid. And remember, within Medicare, there's a portion that is DRG-related and a portion that isn't. All the discussions the Kite folks have had with payers to this point, both government and private payers have indicated that they believe that they will cover Yescarta beginning an approval while they update the medical policies and so forth. Now, there's a difference between covering and reimbursement obviously. And reimbursement levels will vary by payer segment and also by the contractual agreements that exist between hospital and payers, which are independent of anything that we're involved with. We do believe that over time that Medicare DRG segments will probably at most grow to approximate about a third of the payer mix. They won't be close to that in the first year or so because, again, most of these centers are PPS exempt, meaning that they are not reimbursed based on DRGs and it's more about fee-for-service and more like a commercial-type reimbursement. Even with that, these hospitals are well adept at using non-CAR-T DRGs until they actually have a CAR-T-specific DRG. And I think it's important to remember that what we're dealing with right now is not new. Every hospital-based product launched in the last 20 years has done so without a DRG at launch. So it's not like they're having to figure this out for the first time. So there's experienced people in these cancer centers that do this for stem cell transplants, that do this for every product, hospital base that they've had come in. And last thing I'll say and then turn it to Alessandro is just, one of the prerequisites of these cancer centers being certified to administer CAR-T was a determination that reimbursement would be sufficient to make this financially feasible for them based on their payer mix. So we don't \u2013 obviously, we would love to have, and we will have, in a couple of years the CAR-T-specific DRG. We have NATAP and things we can do in the interim. But this is not novel ground and hospitals are very adept at using other DRGs and other codes to get sufficient reimbursement. Alessandro Riva - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes. This is Alessandro. I'll elaborate that the dynamics, I think, will also change dramatically, because we are dealing with the lifesaving treatment. And we expect that Yescarta will become the standard-of-care for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma after oral therapy. So it is a transformative therapy. And we think that the community, the physician, and the payers will work together towards making sure that the Yescarta is available to patients. So we have done the clinical trials in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in around 15 centers mainly focusing in United States of America. Now we are expanding to most centers in the U.S. and also in Europe. In terms of not only diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, but also our pivotal trials in other B-cell malignancies. So we are very confident that we will have the support from the community, from the regulators to implement this trial. And we'll work together to make sure that we serve both the patient needs that are in relapsed-refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, for whom Yescarta is indicated, and, of course, for patients that will be eligible for our clinical trials. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey, Matthew. It's Kevin. There's always a worry with the start of a new kind of market about will there be commercial patients versus clinical trials. I remember in the early days of RA that was always a worry. But my experience is that there's always a demand with high need patients, as Alessandro said, for treatment from an FDA-approved product. And as Alessandro says, Kite have by far the biggest clinical trial base upon which to introduce Yescarta. So with 40 some centers that have actually had clinical experience that's a really strong base for the commercial introduction. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Perfect. Very helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I did want to drill down on the HCV pricing a bit more with a two-part question. The first is, does Gilead itself understand how the average revenue per patient will change quarter-over-quarter in Q4? Or is it somewhat of a fluid situation where you yourselves aren't entirely sure yet how price would change? Second, I was wondering if you could \u2013 if you do have somewhat of an understanding, could you give us some sense of a magnitude of the quarter-over-quarter change in average revenue per patient in Q4 over Q3? Is it like 5%, 10%? Whatever you can tell us would be appreciated. James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes, no, I would say it's \u2013 again, as we mentioned, we're still in the process right now. We've made a lot of good progress, but it's not complete. So we're not in a position to speak about that right now. But, again, what we can signal to you is that pricing in general is similar across genotypes and it has gravitated down towards 8-weak genotypes one pricing. And, again, you'll see that more fully reflected in the fourth quarter although as they said, the process of 2018 contracting is not fully complete during this quarter. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey, Phil, for this quarter, quarter three versus quarter two, it was by far driven by patient starts and share. It was a 4-point difference going from 80% to 76%. It was just a tad, it was just a little of pricing. But, as Jim says, that will become a bigger effect in Q4. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC: That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. It's probably for you, Norbert. Just wanted you to talk a little bit about the interim PSA (43:58) readout in GS-9674. Just will we get efficacy general thoughts, and then, also, Norbert, just after some of the discussion in the community around FXRs with Ocaliva, I guess, I just wanted to get your general thoughts on some of the tolerability around liver and lipids and different things. Thanks. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Alethia, this question was about FXR or the ACC in it, or both? Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: FXR. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: The GS-9674. FXR. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah, GS-9674. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: FXR? Okay. No, so you will see \u2013 so we have a Phase 2 study kind of ending. We should have data fairly soon. That's going to be a 24-week study, by the way. And you will see data then presented probably at EASL. We haven't really decided yet where we're going to go with those. But what we have seen, it's well-thought. There's no effect; it's well tolerated. We think \u2013 I think we have disclosed that it releases FGF19, that has been published. So the only question is, is the GI-generated FGF19 that then goes to deliver, is that enough to have the same efficacy as, for instance, in FXR agonist that actually gets physically to deliver. That's the question we haven't answered yet. That will come with the Phase 2 study. So we hope we'll have some data on that. But FXR, clearly, it's a proven mechanism with OCA. The FLINT study was published a few years ago in NEJM. Again, the OCA has some drawbacks. And we think with a gut-restricted FXR agonist that we have, we could probably potentially solve some of those downsides. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citi. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thank you. I just want to follow up on one of the comments you made about, right, the hospitals that you're training believe that they're reimbursement \u2013 there's a valuable reimbursement environment for CAR-T. I just have a question around that. So, I guess, the first is like are you incorporating any value-based pricing at these four pairs? Is that incorporated at all so we know how to model the price per patient? And the second is, tell me more about what that means for the hospital? Does that mean that they're going to be very comfortable, trying CAR-T and not worrying about reimbursement? Or do you think they'll still want to treat patients more fully just to get more comfortable with the reimbursement environment? Thanks. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Sure, Robyn. Thank you. Just touching on value-based pricing at first, we are in ongoing and active discussions with really all commercial and government payers, including CMS. And I can convey to you there are varying degrees of interest and ability to execute value-based contracts. It truly does vary by payer. You may be aware there's a lot of operational complexities to this in addition to just government price barriers to implementing this across all payer segments. But we have communicated our openness to considering solutions \u2013 any and all solutions to improve patient access regardless of what they may be. It may end up not being value-based pricing, it could be something different. But we're very open to it. There's a reason why to our knowledge, we don't \u2013 at least, historically, we haven't seen value-based pricing in oncology. It's not the easiest to execute under current regulations. But we're open to that. I think that remember what I said that a lot \u2013 part of the certification process and the vetting process at these hospitals is, these are hospitals that are very used to having to do the same thing with stem cell transplants; understanding who's a commercial patient, who's a Medicare patient; where am I going to get reimbursed at this level; where am I going to get reimbursed at that level. So they really are conducting the same type of calculus here. And one of the reasons why they end up coming onboard is they feel they can make this work for them. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah. I think, Robyn, just for modeling purposes, I would just take out $3.73 (48:25) as the price per patient. I think that's probably a good way to think about it for you. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. That's actually really helpful. That's what I needed. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for take the question. I was just wondering following the launch of bictegravir next year, obviously, in addition to the share capture from some other regimens. Just wondering if you'd expect to see a meaningful step-up in the rate of conversion to TAF from your Viread regimens here? Or do you expect that the rate would actually continue as we've seen over the last few years? Thanks. James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes. Maybe just a first comment, anyone jump in. It would be hard to see a more rapid conversion to TAF than we've seen in the two years since the \u2013 really less than two years since the launch of Genvoya. As we said, we're at 56%. We would anticipate that by considering the mid-February PDUFA date for B/F/TAF that we could be around two-third. So that has exceeded our expectations. So there will be a \u2013 again, by 2020, we anticipate that the only folks still remaining on TDF will largely be Truvada for PrEP at that point. So there will already have been a significant conversion to TAF even before B/F/TAF launches. What we \u2013 obviously, we see TAF as really the culmination, the first regimen really without trade-offs. And what we think we're going to see at that point and what I believe we'll see is a lot of conversion of not only business that isn't TAF yet, but business that is already TAF on to B/F/TAF. Particularly, we have seen an uptick recently in the last quarter or so in patients starting on Descovy plus dolutegravir. And what physicians tell us is, is that in a lot of cases, this is in preparation for what they expect to do in the first quarter of next year. It's very logical to them and to us, but more importantly to them, switch opportunity for them, to obviously get them on a single pill. So I'm not that surprised we're seeing an uptick in that and I think that bodes very well for B/F/TAF. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah, Terence, I would just give a shout-out for how well our colleagues in Europe are doing. As Jim says, that's Genvoya. Terrific that already 75% of our HIV business in Germany's already across TAF-based regimens, but it's also Descovy, as Jim makes a great point. If you look at the uptick and we've supplied you with some slides, you look at the uptick in Italy, Descovy is going terrifically. And that's a great platform for B/F/TAF. So we couldn't be happier about how we're doing this year with our HIV portfolio. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So now that you relatively quickly wrapped up the Kite deal, I'm curious where your mindset is at this point regarding potential additional M&A. And if you do have an appetite for it, what types of assets would be of greatest interest to you now that you have a new commercial product and platform in the fold. Thanks. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey, Cory. It's John Milligan. Thanks for the question. So a couple things to say. The Kite acquisition was done very rapidly, and, of course, we are spending a lot of time now figuring out how to best work with our colleagues at Kite. I can say that they had \u2013 and we are quite interested in bringing in technology that will enhance our ability to move CAR-T forward to the next generations of CAR-T. As we had mentioned on the call when we acquired Kite, when we announced the acquisition, that we see this as a platform that will require continuous innovation. And so we are quite active in bringing in technologies, which will help us move this CAR-T forward. Having said that, it's also true that M&A is going to be an ongoing activity at Gilead, where we will be in a constant state of evaluation of opportunities to bring in revenues or technologies that we think will help enhance our portfolio and our top line for the future. So I can tell you we're very, very active. I'm not going give you hints as to what we might be looking at. But I can say the group that we've put together is very, very good. And we are constantly evaluating stuff internally and with our board. So I would expect us to continue to be quite active in the coming years. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Peters with Deutsche Bank. Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for taking my questions. One more on the new patient start side. I guess I just wanted to drill into the third quarter a bit more. If we look at first quarter to second quarter, it was kind of more flattish on the new patient start side and then we saw kind of a bit of a dip now. Just wanted to understand if there's any kind of seasonality within that new patient start component, or is it really just more consistently that fewer patients are actually starting therapy? And on the seasonality side, if you look historically, say, to last year, how has the fourth quarter performed relative to prior quarters? Thank you. James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah. I'll start. This is Jim. I would say I agree, it looks like it was a larger drop in the third quarter relative to earlier quarters. Obviously, what helped us in the beginning of the year was the fact that we had the midyear launch of Epclusa, and that had obviously some carryover into the early part of the year. The other thing I'd say \u2013 and again, I don't mean to get into the weeds here, but I will just say that when you actually normalize this year based upon holidays and trading days, which a lot of the IMS and other companies will do for you, but don't routinely do, we've pretty much seen a fairly steady 2% month-on-month decline in patient starts basically since the start of the year. Again, there's different numbers of days and holidays in each area. So in reality, it's been less of a drop just from the second to the third quarter and more consistent and steady decline. The reason we were saying very correctly that we saw higher levels of starts than we thought was we actually started at a higher point than we thought. So there was more starts in the first half of the year than we thought. But the general trend of patient starts declining relatively consistently throughout the year has really been in place since January. And we don't expect that to change in the fourth quarter. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Andrew, typically, Europe is more seasonally sort of orientated. We did see France and Spain come down a little bit in the third quarter, although nicely, Italy was quite strong, because there's a lot bigger opening now there is general access across all genotypes to HCV therapy, and there's a lot of untreated patients there. Typically, fourth quarter is as good if not a little bit stronger than third quarter in Europe. I don't think there's really much seasonality, as Jim points out, between third and fourth quarter in the U.S. Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you for the additional color. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. I actually wanted to drill down on Hep C a little more. And I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this correctly because these numbers sounded \u2013 I just want to make sure I've locked them in. So the high end of 2017 guidance for your Hep C implies that the fourth quarter will have a run rate of somewhere between $4 billion and $5.4 billion. So am I doing the math right there? And is that the starting number we should think about as we head into 2018? Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Umer, again, we can't jump ahead and start to give you kind of numbers for 2018. As Jim said, we're finalizing all of our contracts. And there are the three variables : patient starts, which still continues to be a big variable, there is the pricing and there is the share. The one thing that's now come off the table really is duration, because the use of Harvoni, use of Epclusa is pretty standardized now. So that's not really a variable. Yes, you can do the maths of taking away our first three quarters from the guidance that Robin took you through. But we really don't wish to go any further than where we are with, I think, a 2017 that we delivered on our original guidance in hepatitis C and have done superbly with over-exceeding our HIV guidance. But we'll get to 2018 when we get to 2018. Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Katherine Xu with William Blair. Yu Katherine Xu - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon. I'm just wondering about the HCV China business that you guys could potentially drum up there, considering 10 million people infected, although I have the number of 43 million. Let's just say 10% of them could potentially pay out of pocket, that could be a third of the U.S. market. So that could be quite substantial. I wonder what's your overall thoughts on that market. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Well, Katherine, you're making me nervous here. I think it'll be \u2013 I think a staged launch in China. What's remarkable is in the last 12 months how the China FDA have changed their regulations and, particularly for products that we've got in the viral area, are very, very motivated to see these products come to market. We will have a relatively small organization in China. That's quite deliberate. We want to really do the right thing and be highly compliant and bring our therapies very responsibly to the Chinese market. We've known the Chinese opinion leaders for a long time, even though we haven't actually had an office in China. So that gave us the confidence and the platform upon which to start to put in our organization. We have a very seasoned General Manager. It will be, as you say, a private market launch to begin with. We have missed the national listings, which are now closed for the coming year, but in 2018, we will be trying to bridge from the private market into provincial reimbursement and when the next round of national authorization opens, then we will try to get Sovaldi, Harvoni, and Epclusa and Vemlidy, for that matter, because HBV is a very prevalent disease in China onto national listings. So we want to walk before we can run. But there's no doubt that our antivirals are much needed for the infection rates in China. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Our final question for today comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have one for Genvoya, on slide 29 last month, we see a dip in TRx. Am I reading the teal leaf too much? Or there's something behind dip or just one blip in the market? And then secondly on HCV, if I take your high end of the guidance for this year, $9 billion, I get to about $1.36 billion in 4Q. So that's still 40% drop from 3Q. Do you think that's mostly because of the U.S. market dynamics or also you're seeing a drop-off in Europe and the other countries as well for HCV? Thank you. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes. Maybe start with Genvoya, no, we are not seeing anything. There's month-to-month fluctuations just based on \u2013 I wouldn't call it seasonality, but just the number of holidays and so forth. But there is \u2013 the uptake of Genvoya has not shown any attenuation at all and couldn't be going stronger. Again, as we said, 56% we expect to get to about two-thirds by the time of the launch of the B/F/TAF in terms of the presented TAF. So no worries there. The second question was just in terms of the drop-off in the fourth quarter. Again, that's the first quarter on Hep C where will see the \u2013 more fully, the impact of both the dynamics we spoke about in pricing, where it is now consistent across genotypes and has come down more towards genotype one eight-week levels. And again, also, more of the impact of share. So both of those things were reflected in that. And again, that's reflective of the updated guidance that was provided earlier in this call. Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: And, Ying, we will see some competitive effects running into Europe that will be a country-by-country. I have to say that Epclusa is doing really, really well in Europe, and is the number 1 Hepatitis C product, that's being used across all genotypes in the European market. So we believe we've got a very able competitor to the new market entrant in Epclusa. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: And just to reiterate, again, maybe it didn't play out exactly from the four different dynamics that drive revenue as we thought. Patient starts were higher. Price and share, at least, later in the year, were lower. But 2017 HCV revenue will fall within the original guidance that was issued last February. So we feel very good about that. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Sung Lee for any closing remarks. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Karen, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead, and the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on our future progress. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Gilead Sciences Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Candice and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode and as a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Candice, and good afternoon everyone. Just aftermarket close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website. The speakers on today's call will be John Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer. Also in the room with us for the Q&A session is Andrew Chang, Executive Vice President, Clinical Research and Development Operations. Before we begin with our prepared comments, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections, and the use of capital, all which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website. I will now turn the call over to Robin. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Sung, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to share our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 and provide 2018 guidance. I'll first review the financial results and commercial highlights for the quarter. Norbert will discuss progress made in R&D, and John will make a few closing comments. 2017 was marked by operational excellence across the business. During the year, we raised net product revenue guidance as we observed strong performances across our HIV and cardiopulmonary franchises. We continued to execute on and maximize the opportunity in HCV in a changing competitive landscape. We made two strategic acquisitions, Kite and Cell Design Labs, positioning us as an industry leader in cell therapy. Furthermore, we launched two new products, Yescarta, the first cell therapy approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma, and Vosevi, an important option for HCV patients who could not be cured with other therapies. Turning to the financials. For the fourth quarter 2017, total revenues were $5.9 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.78. For the full year 2017, total revenues were $26.1 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings of $8.84 per share. Product sales for the fourth quarter were $5.8 billion and $25.7 billion for the full year. HIV and HBV product sales for the full year 2017 were $14.2 billion compared to $12.9 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to the strong uptake of our TAF-based regimens which now account for 62% of Gilead's total HIV prescription volume in the U.S. At the end of 2017, Genvoya remained the most prescribed HIV therapy for treatment naive and switch patients in the U.S. and across the top five European markets. Genvoya represents the most successful HIV launch in the U.S. and is the first HIV product to reach $3 billion in annual sales. In Europe, sales of our TAF-based regimens continue to grow, while generic TDF and TDF/FTC are available in several countries. Truvada for PrEP has remained a growth driver for Gilead. At the end of last year, approximately 153,000 people in the U.S. were taking Truvada for this indication, representing a greater than fivefold increase since January 2015. HCV product sales were $9.1 billion compared to $14.8 billion in 2016. The arrival of new competition, along with fewer patient starts, contributed to the year-over-year decline. As we have noted in the past, HCV revenues are driven by four variables : patient starts, net pricing, market share and treatment duration. Treatment duration has stabilized as a variable, and pricing of all regimens has gravitated towards the eight-week regimen price. We anticipate both pricing and market share to stabilize by mid 2018 with more predictable but slightly declining patient starts moving forward. Finally, other product sales were $2.3 billion compared to $2.2 billion in 2016. This represents the outstanding performance of the cardiovascular franchise. Ranexa and Letairis together generated $1.6 billion in revenue in 2017. As a reminder, the patent for ambrisentan in the U.S. will expire in July of 2018. Turning to expenses for the full year 2017. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $3.3 billion, and SG&A expenses were $3.4 billion, both of which were in line with expectations. With the recent enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or tax reform, we recorded a provisional estimated GAAP charge of $5.5 billion or $4.16 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. This will be payable over the next eight years and has been excluded from our non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter and full year. Tax reform will have a positive impact on Gilead's earnings by lowering our global effective tax rate and increasing our financial flexibility as a result of our ability to repatriate our ex-U.S. cash over time. While the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act does not fundamentally change our capital allocation priorities, it does enable Gilead to invest in sustainable long-term value-creating opportunities, which include investing in R&D, expanding U.S.-based manufacturing, and creating additional jobs in the U.S. Moving to our balance sheet. Our business continues to deliver strong operating cash flows. We generated $11.9 billion in cash from operations for the full year 2017 and ended the year with $36.7 billion in cash and investments. In conjunction with the Kite acquisition, we issued $3 billion senior unsecured notes and $6 billion term loan facilities, of which we repaid $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter 2017. For the full year, we paid cash dividends of $2.7 billion and repurchased 13 million shares of stock for $954 million. Earlier today, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.52 to $0.57 per share, which will become effective in the first quarter of 2018. This increase underscores the confidence of the board and management in the strength of the business and future cash flows. Our capital allocation priorities going forward include; investment in research and development along with M&A and partnerships to augment our pipeline, delevering our capital structure, continued growth of our dividend over time and share repurchases to maintain our current share count. Finally, I would like to cover our full-year 2018 non-GAAP financial guidance, summarized on slides 33 through 37 in the earnings presentation available on our corporate website. Net product sales are expected to be in the range of $20 billion to $21 billion. Further details on our HCV sales and loss of exclusivity of ambrisentan, tenofovir DF and FTC in Europe can be found on slides 34 through 36. Our guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties including the accuracy of our assumptions about HCV market share; the accuracy of our estimates for HCV patient starts in 2018; unanticipated pricing pressures from payers and competitors in the HCV market; lower than expected market share and greater price erosion resulting from the sale of generic versions of TDF; the fixed-dose combination of FTC/TDF; and the fixed-dose combination of FTC/TDF/efavirenz outside the U.S.; slower than anticipated growth in our HIV franchise; a greater than expected adoption of generic versions of ambrisentan for PAH in the U.S.; a larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments such as PHS, FSS, Medicaid and the VA; as well as volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Non-GAAP product gross margins are expected to be in the range of 85% to 87%. We expect our non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. We also expect our non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. For the full year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 21% to 23%, which reflects the effect of the recently enacted U.S. tax reform. We anticipate the full-year diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related stock-based compensation and other expenses to be in the range of $1.41 to $1.51 per share. As we begin 2018, we remain committed to being an operationally and financially efficient organization that generates high operating margins. I will now turn the call over to Norbert. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Robin. As I look across our numerous research and development programs, I'm excited about the potential we have to advance treatments for a variety of diseases where significant unmet medical need exists. I will spend the next few minutes detailing our progress in HIV, liver disease, inflammation and oncology and discuss some of the key milestones we anticipate in 2018. Beginning with HIV, we anticipate U.S. FDA approval of BIC/F/TAF, our latest once-daily single-tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV infection in adults with PDUFA action date this coming Monday, February 12. The new drug application is supported by data from four ongoing Phase 3 studies in a total of 2,400 people, studies 1489 and 1490 in treatment-na\u00efve HIV-infected adults and studies 1844 and 1878 in virally suppressed adults. BIC/F/TAF met its primary objective of non-inferiority at 48 weeks across all four studies and no participants failed BIC/F/TAF for treatment-emergent virological resistance. Additional clinical trials of BIC/F/TAF are ongoing, including a dedicated study in women as well as a study in adolescents living with HIV. We plan to present data from these studies at scientific conferences in 2018. We continue to invest in research for next generation HIV therapies including long-acting injectables for preventional treatment, therapies for treatment-resistant patients and approaches that could potentially cure HIV. We have filed an IND for our long-acting capsid inhibitor and plan to initiate clinical testing this quarter. With regards to HIV prevention research, we expect to have data from the DISCOVER study next year. This Phase 3 trial, randomized patients will receive Truvada or Descovy to evaluate whether Descovy is safe and effective at reducing the risk of HIV infection when used as pre-exposure prophylaxis. Moving to NASH, there are two ongoing Phase 3 trials, STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4, evaluating selonsertib, our ASK1 inhibitor, in patients with F3 bridging fibrosis and F4 cirrhosis. Patients with an F4 fibrosis cohort are at highest risk of clinical adverse events and therefore represent the group with the greatest unmet medical need. STELLAR 4 is now fully enrolled, and STELLAR 3 will be fully enrolled in the next few months. Data will be available in 2019, and if positive, will form the basis for our regulatory filings. Additionally, we're conducting small Phase 2 combination studies of selonsertib with Gilead's ACC inhibitor, GS-0976, and the selective non-steroidal FXR agonist GS-9674 in patients with NASH. Phase 2 data of GS-0976 in monotherapy presented at the Liver Meeting in October showed significant reduction in measures of liver fat and certain biomarkers of liver fibrosis compared to placebo. Data from these combination studies will be presented at the European Association for the Study of the Liver Annual Meeting in April, and we are in the process of initiating a larger Phase 2 combination study this year. We also made great progress in inflammation. Five Phase 3 studies of filgotinib are ongoing in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Three studies, FINCH 1, 2 and 3, are being conducted in rheumatoid arthritis. The FINCH 2 study is fully enrolled, and we anticipate data from this study in the second half of 2018. FINCH 2 compared filgotinib to placebo each added to conventional disease-modifying antiarrhythmic drugs, or DMARDs, in patients who have had inadequate response to biologics. Other studies in rheumatoid arthritis include FINCH 1, a 52-week randomized study comparing filgotinib plus methotrexate to adalimumab plus methotrexate to methotrexate alone in patients who have had inadequate response to methotrexate. And FINCH 3, a 52-week randomized study comparing filgotinib alone to methotrexate alone to the combination of filgotinib plus methotrexate in methotrexate-naive patients. We anticipate the FINCH 1 and FINCH 3 studies to be fully enrolled later this year. Filgotinib is also being investigated in five additional Phase 2 studies in other inflammatory diseases, namely psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, lupus, Sjogren's syndrome, and uveitis and we should have data available from some of these studies later this year. In addition just last month, we filed an IND on an internally developed small molecule with a novel mechanism of action for inflammatory conditions, and we will initiate clinical development in the coming months. Moving to oncology, a randomized controlled Phase 3 study of andecaliximab, our anti-MMP9 antibody in combination with modified FOLFOX6 in gastric cancer is ongoing, and entering futility analysis for this study was conducted by an independent data monitoring committee in the second half of 2017, and the DMC recommended that the study continue. Additionally, we're conducting a Phase 2 study in gastric cancer of andecaliximab in combination with nivolumab versus nivolumab alone. This study will be completed this quarter, and we plan to present the data at a future scientific conference. In cell therapy, long term data from our pivotal ZUMA-1 study of Yescarta in patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma were presented at the American Hematology Society Meeting and published concurrently in the New England Journal of Medicine in December. In this updated analysis, with a minimum follow up of one year and a median follow up of 15.4 months after a single infusion of Yescarta, 42% of the patients continued to respond to therapy with 40% continuing to have a complete response. We anticipate having two-year data from the ZUMA-1 study later this year. Additional studies are underway including ZUMA-7, a Phase 3 randomized study comparing Yescarta to the standard of care in second-line treatment of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Data are expected in 2020. Also underway is ZUMA-6, a Phase 1/2 combination study of Yescarta with atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, and a Phase 1 study of a KITE-585, a CAR T-cell therapy engineered to target B-cell maturation antigen in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Phase 1 results from the ZUMA-3 study of KTE-C19 in 24 adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia were also presented at ASH. KTE-C19 is the same anti-CD19 CAR T construct as Axi-cel, but is manufactured through a slightly different process. With a minimum of eight weeks of follow up, 17 of the 24 participants will receive the single infusion of KTE-C19, achieved complete remission in 21 of the 24 participants at no detectable disease. I hope I've conveyed my excitement about the pipeline programs we have across Gilead's therapeutic areas. In summary, pending the results of ongoing studies that will read out in 2018 and 2019, we could be in a position to file as many as four NDAs or BLAs next year. I would now like to turn over the call to John. John? John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thanks, Norbert. I'd like to make a few comments about the year that has just ended and where we will focus in 2018. As Robin mentioned, Yescarta was approved by the FDA in October of 2017. We are greatly encouraged by an initial response we have seen from the healthcare and patient communities in recognition of the life-saving potential for people with aggressive large B-cell lymphomas who have run out of options. We have authorized 28 cancer centers to date, and each center is now certified to administer Yescarta to patients. Given the promise of Yescarta and the significant patient need, we are actively working on training and certifying additional centers on the risk, evaluation and mitigation strategy and the Kite Connect process. By mid-2018, we anticipate there will be enough centers certified to treat 80% of Yescarta-eligible patients. We're very excited about the present opportunity with Yescarta, and as Norbert mentioned, we are enrolling clinical studies to expand the label to earlier lines of therapy and exploring combination therapy with other in immuno-oncology agents. We are also working to improve CAR T therapies and are acquiring next generation technology in the belief that we will be able to develop cellular therapies that can achieve greater responses, lessen side effects and increase the types of malignancies that can be treated. For example, the acquisition of Cell Design Labs gives us access to proprietary technology platforms that will augment and accelerate these efforts, along with the dedicated research team who, in collaboration with the Kite team, will help us drive next generation CAR T therapies into the clinic more quickly. The future is incredibly bright for cellular therapy and we are very excited to be at the forefront of the field. Over the past three decades, Gilead's relentless scientific pursuit of better HIV treatments has led to a range of options to help address the diverse needs of people living with HIV. Once approved, BIC/F/TAF will offer people an important new single-tablet regimen option, both to those newly diagnosed with HIV and those who may desire or need to switch from their current multi-tablet regimen or single-tablet regimen. BIC/F/TAF represents Gilead's sixth single-tablet regimen, and with the approval of Symtuza in the EU by our partner, Janssen, the fourth containing TAF. With the approval of BIC/F/TAF, there will be TAF-containing single-table regimens available for patients containing each of the major third agents, including unboosted and boosted integrase inhibitors, a boosted protease inhibitor and an NNRTI. We are deeply committed to continuing to innovate in the field of HIV treatment, particularly for the population of people who have been living with HIV for a long time and whose treatment needs have changed as they have aged. The advancement of clinical trials for selonsertib and filgotinib has positioned Gilead as a leader in NASH and inflammatory diseases. In NASH, the rapid enrollment of patients has put Gilead in the lead in the development of treatments for patients with the most severe form of the disease. If selonsertib clinical studies read out positively in early 2019, Gilead will then be in a position to launch the first therapy for NASH in 2020. We continue to be enthusiastic about filgotinib. In the ongoing Phase 3 studies, we are looking to see if the potential safety and efficacy advantages of a selective JAK1 inhibitor seen in pre-clinical and early clinical studies are borne out in these trials. In addition, Gilead's exploring five additional indications beyond rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. As we enter 2018, we see that the market dynamics in HCV are stabilizing. Since the launch of sofosbuvir in 2013, we've seen multiple competitors come to market and we've launched three of our own new HCV therapies. With the launch of each new product \u2013 the launch of each new product was disruptive, leading to lower prices and shortened treatment duration, both highly beneficial to patients and payers. Going forward, we don't see any new HCV product launches disrupting the market. This leaves two remaining variables, the number of patients to start therapy each year and market share versus our competitors. As Robin mentioned, we've set patient starts to continue to decline, although more slowly than in the past, and market share versus our competitors is expected to stabilize by the middle of this year. Given these changes, Gilead's HCV revenue should be a more predictable, albeit smaller, piece of our financial story. By removing most of the overhang of declining HCV revenues going forward, we can focus on the positive financial trends driven by the continued uptake of TAF-containing regimens and short-term and long-term growth through Yescarta, selonsertib and filgotinib. We've been open about our desire to increase our pipeline through acquisitions and partnerships with other companies, as we continue to actively seek new therapeutic advancements and technologies. We have both the financial strength and internal capability to aggressively pursue opportunities when we see them. I am more excited than ever about the future of Gilead as we extend our efforts to help new groups of people with difficult diseases. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their dedication and service. It's because of your belief in our mission that we're able to reach millions of people with our life-saving medicines. Thank you for your time today, and let's now open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Afternoon, guys. Thanks for the question and all the detail. So, John, when I look at hep C trends which could trough this year and they're offset by a positive impact from HIV, Yescarta and the pipeline, it looks like you guys could get back to growth exiting this year and maybe even going into 2019. How important is that to Gilead overall or do you view these franchises and moving parts more independently? Thanks. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thanks, Geoff. Thanks for the questions. So of course we view all our franchises independently, but taken as a whole, that makes Gilead. And so we do think that it's important that we're able to stabilize HCV revenues and it's important that we be able to talk about the company with the future dynamics that I think will drive us. We're clearly very excited about TAF-based regimens. We're very eager to get Bictegravir F/TAF launched. That will be another positive momentum going forward. As Norbert mentioned, we could file up to four NDA and BLAs going forward. So I think after years of having to be defensive about HCV revenues declining, it's very nice to be on the other side of that and talk about the positive trends going forward and we hope that that will dominate the conversation throughout the year much as it did at the beginning of the year, beginning with JPMorgan. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Yee of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Thanks for the question. Good afternoon. Appreciate those comments as well. Following along that, I guess when you think about the slope of your revenues this year and your commentary about stabilization, thinking about the decline of hep C in the first half of the year and revenue growth with your other products, do you think that you would trough out this year and that you'd see yourself as a growing product franchise by the end of this year? Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hi, Michael. This is Robin. I mean, yes, I mean as John mentioned and I mentioned, we do see the HCV market dynamics stabilizing and removing that overhang. We do think that with our new HIV FTR launch of bictegravir \u2013 (29:42) BIC/F/TAF, as well as our other franchise, that we do overall see ourselves as a growth story. Even if you look at page 34 in our guidance, you can see overall our HCV franchise is expected to grow. And that's growth along with the LOE ex-U.S., as well as to taken to account our other franchise with Letairis. We're still showing overall growth in those core franchises over and above hepatitis C. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Abrahams of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. In the CAR T space, obviously we've seen some consolidation lately. I'm just curious coming out of the CDL acquisition now, where should we look for your focus of investments going forward in technology enhancements that are going to be the most important for long-term competitive positioning, enhancement of delivery and expansion into additional populations from here? Thanks. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes. Hi, Brian. It's John. So just a couple of comments on where we're going to go next. Without giving you any specifics, we have been fairly open in our conversations that we do think that there are additional technologies we want to use to enhance the capabilities we have, including gene editing technology. That's something we've talked about previously. Obviously, there are several areas where we want to try to figure out where we could be more effective. One is increasing the number of targets that we can go at, so we're looking at additional targets. We are looking at ways that we can perhaps move from autologous to allogeneic or sort of universal donor CAR T. So that's technology that Kite was working on, and that we will continue to work on. Gene editing plays into that in some areas. And then of course, anything that we could use to try to lessen the side effects of CAR T would be important to us. So we're looking at technologies, thoughts on how we could have perhaps a lower cytokine release syndrome, perhaps decrease the neurotoxicity associated with this. So all of these things are important to us, and we're very, very actively looking at these technologies right now. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Citi. Your line is now open. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, if I remember correctly, back when you used to launch your HIV products, it would take a long time to get on the guidelines and it's a guideline-driven market, and then with Genvoya, that was extremely different. So do you have any sense with BIC/F/TAF whether or not we could see that hitting the guidelines sooner than expected, and what motivated the guidelines to change so quickly with Genvoya? Thanks. Andrew Cheng - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hi, Robyn. It's Andrew Cheng speaking. So I think you're right. When we look back at the time that Genvoya was put on the DHHS guidelines in less than two weeks after approval, I think as it's difficult to surmise what drove them to do that. But one can take a look at the clinical profile and the differentiation versus TDF-based regimens that we saw in our registrational package, and that may have played a role in that. In terms of the role of BIC/F/TAF and one thinks going forward, I think continuing what we've seen already with TAF-based regimens and how they've impacted HIV treatment throughout the United States, it seems reasonable that these will be adopted in the guidelines. Now the timeliness of which are, as you're driving at, are difficult to say. I think that we don't want to overcommit in terms of \u2013 they have a process in place and we look forward to working with them to get the BIC/F/TAF on the guidelines as soon as possible. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Go ahead, Norbert. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: I would like to reiterate what Andrew said. It used to take a long time many years ago, but in the case of Genvoya, it took exactly two weeks. So it's not true anymore that it takes a long time for it to get on the guidelines. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes. It is a more dynamic process, and of course we also benefit that F/TAF are viewed very favorably within the guidelines, and so that is a big help for us as we launch BIC/F/TAF. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Leerink. Your line is now open. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks very much, and I'll just ask a couple related questions below the line if I may, Robin. Your tax outlook is significantly better than we expected and that you've had before. Can you tell us what you view the sustainability of that tax rate? And as you move capital onshore and invest in manufacturing, can that come down any further from the range you're indicating for 2018? And then a similar question just related about operating margins. Looks like you're guiding to about 50% in 2018. Is that a stable number? Or do you think that that could come under further pressure as you ramp up R&D? Thanks. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Sure, Geoff. So to answer your first question, I do believe the range that I provided for you for tax rates are stable. I don't know if it's \u2013 it's not necessarily the overall mix, per se, of our revenue. To some extent, it is that. But I think with that lower U.S. tax rate and the fact that we've already seen a significant mix shift because of our HCV revenues declining, more revenues in the U.S., I do believe that's sustainable longer term. It's very fortuitous for us from a timeframe standpoint because with that shift, our rate would have creeped up pretty significantly in 2018 compared to 2017. Relative to operating margin, I'd say we're a little higher than you project overall but still remain an industry leading. I do feel the 50% plus is sustainable for us. We are in investment mode when you think about R&D, et cetera, so, and we're several large Phase 3 trials, launching BIC/F/TAF, but obviously a lot of incremental opportunities going forward. So I would say yes, sustainable, and I think we'd aspire to see it even rise higher over time. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Norbert, I wanted to ask you a question on NASH. You highlighted both the STELLAR studies and the ACC, but you didn't talk a lot about the FXR. In your slides here, it says you had an interim on PBC and you completed the Phase 2 NASH study. Any comments on the profile there, if that's panning out as you had expected with lower rates of itching and some other differentiation versus some of the competitors in the market? Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah, Matt, thanks for the question. So the reason is simply that the FXR agonist is somewhat behind the ACC inhibitor. We both present, so the Phase 2 result, studies are just wrapping up. We're looking at the data and we intend to submit this to an upcoming conference, a liver conference. You will then see the results. So just to remind you with our FXR agonist, the hypothesis was that we don't want a high systemic exposure with the FXR agonist. So it got restricted or got focused mechanism of action that releases FGF19 that then goes into the circulation and provides the efficacy. So you will see the completed Phase 2 study at an upcoming conference. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on shifting market share in both HIV and HCV. So in HCV, you talk about a $4.3 billion to $4.6 billion year-over-year decrease because of competitive issues. Can you give us some idea of what type of share shift you anticipate in that guidance? And then similarly in HIV, you talk about a $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion increase. What type of share do you think you'll be able to take back with the Bictegravir combination pill? And what's assumed in that guidance? Thank you. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Phil, maybe I'll cover HCV and we'll have John cover HCV. But you know as we said, I think if you compare and take a look at our Q4 revenues of $2.3 billion relative to all the other players, our share is, we've done very well. And in 2018, it's reflective of that continued market share position. I don't want to get into specific percentages, and I think there will be puts and takes across the various markets, but we're very confident that with our product portfolio that we believe we can maintain market leadership position. In the U.S., the market has moved towards more parity access, which we prefer, right, because it really leaves the prescribing decisions with doctors and patients. And we have been able to maintain parity or preferred access across the majority of the counts overall. So we believe that, yes, we think our share position bodes very well for 2018. Operator : Thank you. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: I'm sorry. Phil had a two-part question, so we'll answer the HIV question. Thanks, operator. So you asked about market share for HIV. I will say that I'm going to talk about market share specifically, but I can tell you in the U.S., we expect to maintain our market share. There are obviously some changes due to generic TDF in the United States. I don't think that will affect us very much, as Truvada is still protected. We do think that we can gain that growth that you mentioned through switches from protease inhibitors, so multi-tablet regimens and of course switches from single-tablet regimens. So we think there's enough switching business and then treatment-naive business in there for Bictegravir and additional growth in Genvoya that we'll do quite well in those areas. In the European Union, however, we do think with the entry of generics in 2018, both TDF and TDF/FTC and of course TDF/FTC/efavirenz, as Robin mentioned, that we will see some temporary decrease in market share and then long term growth getting beyond this year due to the approvals of B/F/TAF, Bictegravir/F/TAF, which will occur later in the year allowing us to launch in these various countries. As we mentioned in some of our slides, we have seen incredible uptake of both Descovy and Genvoya across parts of the European Union. I think that bodes very well long term for TAF regimens, and so we're very, very enthusiastic and confident about that franchise there. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Umer Raffat of Evercore. Your line is now open. Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. Norbert, I wanted to drill down your STELLAR 4 trial in NASH. And my question is, what do you expect the placebo arm to track at on the percentage of patients that will have a one-stage improvement? And I'm also curious what level of visibility do you have on the ongoing STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4 trials on the pooled event rate on a blinded basis? Thank you. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes. So, Umer, the only thing I can point to is the Phase 2 study that we have done. I think I'm very confident we will repeat those numbers. Of course, they won't be exactly the same. As you may remember, the total N was somewhat small, but we saw a difference between placebo and the high-dose active arm at 20%. And we would be very happy with that because, as you know, the endpoint is fibrosis. Something that improves fibrosis or prevents fibrosis progression, that will be a tremendous asset and contribution to the healthcare system. So the other study, I can tell you we of course are looking in an ongoing blinded way at safety, and I can tell you this, the compound is very safe. We are not seeing anything that would concern us, either laboratory abnormalities or adverse events or discontinuation rates. But having that said, I want to make sure that everybody understands we're blinded to the study. So it's a placebo-controlled study, but in the blinded data set, there is nothing that would concern us. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one for me on Yescarta. Just wondering if you can talk to us about how important being first to market is in your view given potential entry of a third player next year? And then in your guidance, can you give us any color in terms of what you assume for second half of the year in Yescarta? Is there inflection or a step-up? Or should we just assume a steady Eddie here? Thanks. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: I do think first mover is very important with this area because it allows us to develop this rapport and relationship with the different cancer centers. And so I think a first mover advantage is important in this area. I'm not going to say that it's everything, but of course we have a second entry and then a third entry. You leaped right to the third, but we're expecting a second entry of course in Novartis. And so I do think that is important so that we have the connectivity, we get through the paperwork, the REMS program. This has to be duplicated for each individual agent coming to market, and so it is more difficult to get the attention of the centers once they have something that works very, very well, which we hope they believe they have in Yescarta. So I think that is an important thing to consider. You mentioned an inflection point, and as we mentioned on the call, we are now getting centers up and running. We have 28 centers currently that are up and now certified to prescribe Yescarta. We hope to have about 80% of the population by the midpoint in this year. And so I think what we're seeing with these centers is, as they get better at handling both the patients and the payment aspect of this, because that is a negotiation between the center and the payers themselves. As they get that down, it gets easier to bring in new patients, and so we do see a slowly growing momentum in each center as they get up and going. So obviously, the second half of the year will be a lot better for enrolling patients than the first half of this year. But I don't see it a major inflection point, but just a growing building of patients over time, so that as we exit 2018, we should have a pretty good handle on what the typical flow rate at each center is and what they can handle. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Alethia Young of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and just one on Bictegravir switches. I know Atripla is still the number three regimen in the United States. So I'm trying to figure out like is it more an education with the doctors or is it finding the patients and bringing them back to therapy to encourage them to move to bictegravir versus Atripla thing? Andrew Cheng - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So, Alethia, it's Andrew. So I think it's a combination. When you look at the registrational studies that support the filing package, we had patients who were switching from protease-based inhibitors or multi-tablet regimens, which are \u2013 and keep in mind that protease inhibitors are no longer guideline for first-line regimens in the United States, and we have patients switching from Triumeq or the components of which. And so these two groups are probably the groups of individuals that we'll see a lot of the switches from overall as we launch the product. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ian Somaiya of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you, and thanks for taking my question. Just a question on Yescarta. I was just trying to maybe, just would love to get your help on putting that 80% number into actual patient \u2013 80% into actual patient numbers, how many patients does that represent? And as you think about eligibility, are there differences in eligibility as you think about the three different CAR T offerings? John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So, Ian, I mean we think there's about 7,500 patients in the United States, so 80% of that is well over 5,000 patients. So it's a pretty good number of patients, far more than we would be able to treat this year for example, given our manufacturing capacity. So the 80% is also really something that we're thinking about geographically. You go to a lot of the big centers and there are a lot of people who may be eligible for Yescarta but are just in areas of the country where it's impractical or unlikely a center would be sent up, and so they would have to travel. So in fact, we think geographically it will be a bigger coverage than that. I'm sorry. Overall, it will be a bigger coverage than that but just sort of geographically if you look at it, it will cover about 80% of lives, so that's why we're keeping that at that number. The second part of the question was, I forgot. It was about the \u2013 I'm sorry, Ian, I forgot the second part of your question. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: I think you answered it. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hopefully I answered it. Okay. We'll move on, operator. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Birchenough of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Jim Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yes. Hi, guys, and congrats on the progress. Just a question on the broader solid tumor opportunity for cell therapy and whether you feel like you've got the assets internally from Kite and from Cell Design Labs to have solid tumor success, and what are the timeliness for generating some solid tumor cell therapy data? Thanks. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes so, Jim, I don't think we have everything that we need, and as John said, one thing missing is gene editing, but we are talking to companies and we will do more collaborative deals in that space. I would say it's early with solid tumors, that the problem with solid tumors, or the challenge I would say, is finding a tumor-specific antigen that is not expressed on normal cells. That is by the way a reason why we're excited about CDL, the synNotch technology. Essentially, it needs two antigens in order for the T-cell to get activated, so it gives you much broader specificity if you can go after two cells. Both have to be present at the same time in the same cell surface. But on the other hand, it's really, it's early days I would say, but it's exciting and that's where the real opportunity lies for cell therapy, I mean, the real commercial opportunity. And you could, for instance, go after neoantigens, you could do shared antigens, and we have announced one study that is ongoing with MAGE A3, A6 with the Rosenberg Group at the NCI. And so that's the opportunity. So you will see more in that space coming from Gilead in the coming years. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: And I would say, Jim, we're going to spread out our bets a little bit, investing in various different technologies, because it's hard to predict which of these will have the breadth to be important and also the specificity and depth of response that's going to be important. So we'll be spreading our bets out there. We do think there's hopeful signs in the solid tumor area, but we've not yet \u2013 don't have much. It's not the similar kind of situation as it was with CD19. And, Ian, I remembered the question you asked about the label and how the differences between the different labels. And clearly, we don't know what the groups have asked for in terms of labeling, but currently from what we see in the clinical studies, I don't anticipate the labels will be all that different going forward. But that could be a differentiating feature as it always is in medicine and that could lead to better access if the labels were truly differentiated from one another. Sorry, I forgot that at the time. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, great. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about your BCMA program. Can you talk about how you see potential differentiation here versus others in development? And will you be using the same manufacturing process as Yescarta or are there any new procedures being implemented as you have new CARs entering the clinic? Thanks. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes hi, Cory. It's really too early to say what the differentiating features will be. We are currently doing dose escalation and it's really a Phase 1, Phase 2 study and we just have to see what the results are and how they compare to the competitors' products. And yes, we're using the same construct, so it's CDZ and \u2013 (51:12) CD28 costimulatory domain with an extracellular binding domain that's different, probably, from the competitors. We don't know that. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes. And in terms of the manufacturing process, it's not exactly the same as Yescarta. So we are working out unique manufacturing processes for each of these, so it will be different. We haven't determined exactly how different at the moment. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Ying Huang of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a quick one for Norbert. I didn't see you including on the filgotinib male subject safety study in the timeline for 2018 to 2019, the slide deck. And then secondly, maybe another question on the pricing dynamics in HIV market. After you launch B/F/TAF in the U.S., do you expect your competitor GSK to use pricing as a potential weapon to keep its share? Thank you. Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes, Ying. Thanks for the question. That's very observant of you that you have not seen the study. Yes, so we are performing a safety study. As you know, there was a safety signal in pre-clinical studies and in order to justify the 200 milligram dose, which is the higher dose that we're using in this study, we were asked by FDA to perform this study. So the study is enrolling and the reason why we don't have any timelines in it is simply we don't know yet. It's too early. So we have sites up and running. It's somewhat slow, always at the start. We just simply, it's impossible to predict what the exact timelines are. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: And your second study was do we expect our competitors to lower prices. That has never happened in the field of HIV, but I don't know what even GSK are planning. That's all I can tell you. Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes from Hartaj Singh of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Hartaj Singh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yeah, hi there. Thanks for the question. I just had a quick question on PrEP with Truvada. It's becoming a fairly decent sized portion of your business and you did indicate that DISCOVERY is now fully enrolled. Can you just talk a little bit about the dynamics for how you see Truvada playing out and then how would you see Descovy kind of rolling into that in the future? Thank you. Andrew Cheng - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So maybe \u2013 it's Andrew \u2013 so I'll just start with the first thing which is that the Descovy study is fully enrolled. It was fully enrolled in Q2 of 2017, so we expect to have results sometime in 2019. But keep in mind that it's an event-driven study so the exact timelines are slightly hard to predict this far out. It's not like our, let's say, the Bictegravir trials, which were 48-week studies that once we have our last patient, we can mark those, block those out. Now in terms of the dynamics of how we see Truvada and Descovy interplay, I think it's difficult to say without the results of the trials to understand the differences, although it wouldn't be unreasonable to think about looking at the dynamics in play that we've seen with HIV treatment, where safety has been a very important factor in driving the switch from TDF-based regimens to TAF ones. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: And I just want to add one bit of data to that, which is if we look at that typical patient who's taking Truvada today, for PrEP, they take it nearly on the frequency with people who take long-term HIV therapy, so about the same number of pills taken per year. So the exposure to TDF would be significant and would carry many of the same risks as TDF was for HIV-infected patients. So TAF may be a better option, particularly given that these patients are not HIV infected, and we think that could be an opportunity as well. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Sung Lee for any closing remarks. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Candice, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead, and the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on our future progress. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

My name is Candace, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Candace, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the first quarter of 2018. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website. The speakers on today's call will be : John Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer; John McHutchison, Chief Scientific Officer and head of Research and Development; and Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room with us for the Q&A session is Andrew Chang, Chief Medical Officer and Executive Vice President. Before we begin with our prepared comments, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections, and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website. I will now turn the call over to John Milligan. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Sung, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I would like to start by introducing John McHutchison and Andrew Cheng in their new roles. As you know, Norbert made the decision earlier this year to step down from his position as Chief Scientific Officer. I've worked along Norbert for 27 years. And on behalf of the entire Gilead organization, I would like to express my profound thanks to him for his many, many contributions. In terms of succession, Gilead is fortunate to have strong leaders across our R&D organization who will build on the tremendous success that we have had for over three decades. I look forward to the leadership of John in his new role as Chief Scientific Officer and Head of R&D and Andrew in his new role as Chief Medical Officer, as we continue our work to invent and develop new products for patients in need. Turning to the business and results of the quarter, we continued to see strong growth in our HIV business, driven by broad acceptance and uptake of our Descovy-based regimens. We are confident that this franchise will remain a key growth driver for the company moving forward. One of the products contributing to the growth is our latest Descovy-based single-tablet regimen, Biktarvy, formerly referred to as BIC/F/TAF, which was approved in February by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of HIV. In March, Biktarvy was added to the U.S. DHHS guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents living with HIV as one of the recommended initial regimens. Last week, we announced that the CHMP has adopted a positive opinion on the Marketing Authorization Application for Biktarvy in the EU. We expect approval in the third quarter of this year. Biktarvy represents Gilead's sixth single-tablet regimen and, with the approval of Symtuza in the EU by our partner, Janssen, the fourth containing Descovy backbone. Symtuza is currently under FDA review in the U.S. Biktarvy is a combination of an unboosted integrase inhibitor and the well-established backbone Descovy. Its small size, minimal drug interactions, and established renal and bone safety profile make Biktarvy an important treatment option for most HIV patients. This is particularly true for an aging HIV population, which is at increased risk for AIDS-related morbidities. In February at CROI, the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, one of the most important meetings for HIV research, we had the opportunity to share our progress on the work we are doing to bring innovative therapies to people living with HIV. Gilead's compounds were featured in 21 abstracts and data presentations, including promising preclinical results from our HIV cure research program. These data show that the combination of two investigational agents, GS-9620, a toll-like receptor 7 agonist, and PGT-121, a broadly neutralizing antibody that binds to the HIV envelope, induced viral remission in the absence of antiviral therapy in HIV-infected monkeys and support clinical investigation of such combination strategies. Investigators also presented Phase 3 data in patients switching from a regimen containing abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine to Biktarvy, and data from a multi-national Phase 3 study of Biktarvy in women, a group that is often underrepresented in clinical trials. Data from these studies further demonstrate that Biktarvy may be appropriate for a wide range of people living with HIV. The data presented at CROI represent encouraging progress and demonstrate our continued leadership in driving innovation in HIV therapy. Moving to liver disease, our team recently attended the International Liver Congress in Paris, where there was a lot of emerging data around NASH and hepatitis B. The particular focus on NASH was very much like what we saw with the early breakthroughs in hepatitis C before the disease took center stage at the conference. John will share more specifics about EASL and the data presented there in a few minutes. In oncology, we're encouraged by the response from the healthcare provider and patient communities to the life-saving potential for Yescarta in people with aggressive large B-cell lymphoma who have run out of options. We are seeing an increase in patient enrollment, as clinical experience with Yescarta steadily grows and additional authorized cancer centers with expanded geographic reach come online. We have now completed the authorization of 40 cancer centers and are on track to have enough centers certified to treat 80% of Yescarta-eligible patients in the United States by the middle of the year. The future is incredibly bright for cellular therapy, and we're excited to be at the forefront of the field pursuing a variety of approaches to develop the next generation of cellular therapy in blood cancers and solid tumors. As I look ahead to the remainder of 2018, we will continue to advance scientific innovation, including progressing our robust pipeline, which has the potential to transform the treatment of NASH, inflammatory diseases, and certain cancers. In addition, we will look for business development opportunities that add to our pipeline and capabilities across our therapeutic areas, diversify our portfolio, and increase future opportunities for growth. For example, earlier in the quarter, we announced an agreement with Sangamo on gene editing to create next-generation cellular therapies. And just yesterday, we announced another with Verily to better understand the immune system of patients in our clinical studies with filgotinib. John McHutchison will provide more details on these collaborations. I'm confident that our innovation and hard work will deliver on our goals developing new treatments for people living with some of the world's most serious diseases. And finally, tomorrow we will publish our 2017 Year in Review that highlights our scientific advancements, sustainability initiatives, community support programs, and our continued efforts to improve public health globally. I'm proud of the work that's being led by our employees and extend my many thanks to them for all of the ways they are making a difference around the world. I will now turn the call over to John, who will provide additional updates on our R&D efforts. John? John G. McHutchison - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, John. I am honored to have the opportunity to lead our R&D organization, which has been at the forefront of scientific innovation for more than 30 years. Under Norbert's leadership, Gilead has brought forward 25 innovative treatments that have improved the lives of millions of people with serious diseases around the world. I am confident that our team will build on these remarkable accomplishments. I'd like to spend the next few minutes detailing our recent progress in liver diseases, inflammation, and cell therapy. Beginning with liver disease, we continue to make excellent progress in NASH, where our efforts are focused on treating patients with the most serious forms of the disease, those with advanced fibrosis, who are at the highest risk to progress to end-stage liver disease, liver cancer, and ultimately the need for liver transplantation. As we recently announced, STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4, our two ongoing Phase 3 trials, completed enrollment ahead of schedule. Both studies are evaluating selonsertib, our S1 inhibitor, in patients with F3 and F4 stages of fibrosis. We now expect data from both Phase 3 studies in the first half of 2019. If the data support the safety and is statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect on fibrosis, we could file for regulatory approval towards the end of 2019. In addition, we are exploring combination therapy approaches with compounds with distinctly different mechanisms of action. In animal models of NASH, combination approaches have proven safe and have led to greater anti-fibrotic responses compared to monotherapy. As John mentioned, at the International Liver Congress in Paris last month, there was a growing interest and focus on NASH. We had the opportunity to present promising early results from a proof-of-concept study exploring both single agents and combinations of selonsertib with Gilead's ACC inhibitor, GS-0976, or our FXR agonist, GS-9674, in patients with NASH. Now the primary objective of this study was to determine the safety of the combination therapy. Based on the 12-week study, our combination therapies were well tolerated, and they offered additional benefits for improving NASH by reducing liver fat content, liver cell injury, and other markers of fibrosis. This is also the first study to show that GS-9674 alone had activity in patients with NASH. Based on these encouraging data and supported by the pre-clinical results, Gilead has initiated a larger 350-patient Phase 2b study of combinations of selonsertib, GS-0976, and GS-9674 in patients with advanced fibrosis due to NASH. The treatment duration will be 48 weeks, with liver biopsies before and at the end of the treatment period. Another goal of our NASH program is to identify accurate non-invasive tests that will hopefully allow healthcare providers to identify those in need of treatment. At the recent Liver Congress, we presented data using two different machine-learning methods on our earlier NASH studies. The results indicate that non-invasive tests can predict with a high degree of specificity and sensitivity the risk of clinical disease progression and, separately, improvement in liver histology. We will continue to investigate non-invasive tests, with the goal of replacing liver biopsies for the diagnosis of NASH and for patient management. Moving to inflammation, I'm pleased to share that our three Phase 3 studies of filgotinib, our JAK-1 specific inhibitor in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, FINCH 1, FINCH 2, and FINCH 3, are now fully enrolled. These studies are evaluating the efficacy and safety of filgotinib in biologic-inadequate responder patients, methotrexate inadequate-responder patients, and treatment-naive patients respectively. We expect the FINCH 2 data will be available in the second half of this year, and FINCH 1 and FINCH 3 data will be available in the first half of 2019. Filgotinib is also being investigated in two other Phase 3 studies in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis that will enroll more than 2,500 patients and also in a number of smaller Phase 2 studies in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, cutaneous lupus, Sjogren's syndrome, and uveitis. We expect to have data available from some of those Phase 2 studies during this year. Also yesterday, as John said, we announced an important scientific collaboration with Verily, the life sciences unit owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet, to accelerate our understanding of three common and serious inflammatory diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus-related diseases. Most patients with these immunologically driven diseases don't experience deep or long-lasting remissions with currently available therapies. There's clearly a need. Through this partnership, we will use Verily's ImmunoScape platform to interrogate the molecular characteristics of these immune-related diseases by segmenting each patient's individual leukocytes into more than two dozen component immune cell subsets. And utilizing epigenetic and transcriptomic assays, we believe this technology could allow us to identify particular groups of patients that respond to specific therapies and also to potentially identify new drug discovery targets. Moving to cell therapy, we anticipate that the CHMP will adopt an opinion for Yescarta in the second quarter. And if positive, approval would follow likely in the third quarter of this year. Given the innovative nature of CAR T therapy, the European Medicines Agency is evaluating the application under standard review to allow them sufficient time to review that data that we submitted with the application. Also in cell therapy, we continue to enroll patients in ZUMA-7, a Phase 3 randomized study comparing Yescarta to the standard of care, which is salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation in the second-line treatment of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL]. ZUMA-7 is also the first global randomized Phase 3 Study of a CAR T therapy and will enroll 350 patients across 50 sites in North America and Europe. There remains a significant unmet medical need for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL after first-line therapy. Salvage chemotherapy followed by transplantation cures only approximately 10% to 20% of these patients. If the ZUMA-7 trial provides positive data in this setting, Yescarta has the potential to become an alternative option earlier in the course of the disease, thereby expanding the therapeutic potential of cell therapy for patients living with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We are also excited about our partnership with Sangamo Therapeutics, which was announced in February. This agreement will allow our researchers access to Sangamo's zinc finger nucleases gene-editing technology, which we believe will lead to the development of an allogeneic T-cell therapy that could be manufactured using the cells of healthy donors. The gene-editing approach would reduce or eliminate some of the complications currently seen in allogeneic stem cell transplants such as rejection and graft-versus-host disease. Allogeneic therapies would also enable us to manufacture CAR T therapies that could be used universally, providing people, particularly those who are very, very ill, to access treatment much more quickly. Combining gene editing with the synthetic biology tools we acquired with Cell Design Laboratories last year will also help us to develop treatments that can more precisely target hematological malignancies and solid tumors and may prove safer, more effective, and easier to manufacture. We have achieved a great deal across our R&D organization this quarter, and I am confident we will continue to make significant progress throughout the remainder of the year. In closing, I am excited to lead the talented Gilead R&D team going forward. I'm also looking forward to partnering with Andrew Cheng in his new role, and of course, with all my R&D colleagues. There has never been a more interesting time in science and medicine, with extraordinary new discoveries on an almost weekly basis. It will be our job here to leverage those advances and develop more effective and targeted therapies for patients with serious medical needs. I'll now turn the call over to Robin. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to share our financial results for the first quarter of 2018. Total revenues for the first quarter were $5.1 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.48. This compares to revenues of $6.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.23 for the same period last year. Starting with HIV and HBV, product sales for the first quarter were $3.3 billion, up 2% year over year and down 10% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by the continued uptake of our Descovy-based regimens, partially offset by the entry of generics and greater U.S. inventory drawdown than in the prior-year period. Sequentially, the decline was due to U.S. sub-wholesaler inventory, reflective of the seasonal pattern from the fourth quarter to the first quarter and the availability of generic versions of TDF in the U.S., which impacted our HBV revenue. Our U.S. HIV business remains robust, led by the continued uptake of Descovy-based regimens. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. HIV product sales grew 8% and total prescriptions for Descovy-based and Truvada-containing regimens grew 12%, consistent with growth seen in each of the preceding four quarters. As John mentioned, Biktarvy, our newest single-tablet regimen for HIV, was approved in the U.S. in February, and we are encouraged by the initial uptake among prescribers. It's very early days, but launch to date Biktarvy is tracking very well against our expectations. With this trajectory, we anticipate over time Biktarvy will become the number one single-tablet regimen for treatment-naive and switch patients, a distinction currently held by Genvoya. Approximately 80% of Biktarvy's prescriptions came from switches, of which approximately one-third came from Genvoya and two-thirds from other regimens, including approximately 20% from regimens that contain dolutegravir, confirming Biktarvy's broad utility across patient types. Similar to the launch of Genvoya, access to Biktarvy has been strong, with the vast majority of state ADAPs and Medicaid programs now covering Biktarvy, with coverage in additional state programs expected this quarter. Truvada for PrEP continued to grow, with approximately 167,000 individuals taking Truvada for this indication in Q1. In Europe, sales of Descovy-based regimens comprise more than half of our HIV product revenues and continue to grow, primarily driven by strong uptake in important markets such as France and Italy. Genvoya remained the number one regimen for naive and switch patients across the EU5 collectively for the fourth consecutive quarter, reflective of the strong physician and patient preference for Descovy-based regimens. Turning to HCV, product sales for the first quarter were $1 billion, down 59% year over year and down 30% sequentially. Consistent with our expectations, in Q1 we observed a downward pricing and market share trend across the major geographies as a result of a more competitive environment. Price has now largely stabilized, and we expect market share to stabilize by midyear. In addition, patient starts have become more predictable, and we expect a slow and steady decline moving forward. We continue to see the HCV market as durable. And albeit a smaller component of our revenues going forward, there are still many patients that remain to be treated. Our cardiovascular products, Ranexa and Letairis, generated $399 million in the first quarter. As a reminder, the patent for ambrisentan in the U.S. will expire in July this year. And finally, sales of Yescarta were $40 million in the first full quarter since approval in October. As John mentioned earlier, we are making great progress in training and certifying additional centers. In terms of access in the U.S., we are seeing the payer mix play out as expected, with approximately two-thirds of Yescarta patients covered by commercial and fee-for-service plans and approximately one-quarter of patients covered by Medicare. There is broad coverage of Yescarta-eligible patients with commercial insurance. It's encouraging to see the strong execution by our commercial, medical affairs and manufacturing teams, the positive feedback from centers, and the growing awareness of Yescarta in the hematology and patient communities. Now turning to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $814 million for the first quarter, down 8% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to our purchase of a Priority Review voucher in the prior year. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $884 million for the first full quarter, up 10% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to costs associated with our newest product launches, including Biktarvy and Yescarta, geographic expansion, and increased expenses to support the growth of our business following the acquisition of Kite. Moving to the balance sheet, during the first quarter we generated cash flows from operations of $2.3 billion and ended the quarter with $32.1 billion in cash and investments. We repaid $4.5 billion of term loans borrowed in connection with our acquisition of Kite, paid cash dividends of $753 million, and repurchased 13 million shares of stock for $1 billion. The amount of shares repurchased was aligned to our stock compensation awards, which are largely granted in the first quarter and reflects a one-time impact to repurchases related to unvested equity assumed from the Kite transaction. While our cash flows will remain strong for the remainder of the year, we anticipate a sequential decrease in Q2 2018 due to anticipated tax-related payments. The year is progressing consistent with our expectations, and we are reiterating our full-year guidance, which can be found on slide 47 in the earnings results presentation. Our confidence in the future is supported by a strong and growing HIV business, led by the launch of Biktarvy in the U.S., increasing momentum in our cell therapy business, and potential opportunities in emerging R&D areas of NASH and inflammation. I would like to conclude by thanking our nearly 10,000 employees for their commitment to excellence and hard work that is well represented in the results this quarter. Let's now open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Leerink. Your line is now open. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thank you very much, and I appreciate the question. John McHutchison, congratulations on all the responsibilities. Maybe we could start off with a commercial question. More seriously on the R&D side, could you give us the latest disclosure on the PE and DVT events you've seen so far in the RA program for filgotinib? And then perhaps you could talk a little bit more generally about what areas you're particularly excited about in your new position that you think the company has the opportunity to invest in more aggressively. Thanks. John G. McHutchison - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Geoff, for the kind words and for the question. So regarding the first part of your question, the thromboembolic event rates with baracitinib, the most recent data that we have shown was a presentation at ACR late last year by Mark Genovese, which is an oral presentation. Now this is just from the DARWIN 1, 2, and 3 extension studies, where we have about 1,700 patient years of exposure, but that rate was very low, only one patient in that presentation who had both a DVT and a PE. So the rate actually in that presentation was 0.06 per 100 patient years. But, Geoff, so far we've got thousands of patients in Phase 3. We've got a relatively small data set in terms of exposure, but that's what we have said so far. We continue to collect all of that information. The other point to raise about this was the discussion recently at the Advisory Committee and whether this is slightly or partly related to JAK-2. As you know, filgotinib is very selective for JAK-1. And in terms of JAK-2 specificity, we don't have that at all. So we don't see any changes in hemoglobin. When we see positive changes in hemoglobin, we don't see any increase in platelets. In fact, we see a small decrease in platelets. Whether or not that's related to thromboembolic phenomena, we don't know. In terms of what we're excited about in R&D, you know me, Geoff. I'm always excited about everything. But the opportunity to make huge progress in cell therapy, not just with Yescarta, which has enormous potential, but the future of cell therapy going forward. Investing in research as we have, to come forward with next-generation products is really exciting for the organization to lead that entire field. And we will continue to lead that, and I will ensure that, as will Andrew and others in the organization as well. Additionally, I think we have a lot of opportunities in NASH. The ability to have a drug approved for an antifibrotic endpoint in liver disease has never been done before, and we clearly want to do that, and there's a lot of patients out there with NASH. And then I believe our fledgling programs that are now developing in full force in inflammation, with filgotinib in multiple diseases are becoming differentiated, exciting, and heading in the right direction, particularly with things such as the Verily collaboration. So that's a long answer. I'm sorry, Geoff. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for the question. So the HIV franchise is really key to Gilead getting back to a growth company, so I was hoping you guys could give a bit more detail on the underlying demand trends in the U.S. and Europe, just independent of inventory fluctuations. I guess I'm trying to reconcile the 2% growth with maintaining guidance in the positive commentary. Thanks so much. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So I'm going to let Andrew start with just giving you really the underlying details around the Biktarvy launch, and then I'll jump in with some of the revenue areas. Andrew Cheng - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Geoff, it's Andrew. So I just want to touch on and reiterate some of the things that Robin has mentioned during the call in her prepared remarks, primarily that when we look at Biktarvy, we see 80% of Biktarvy scripts come from switches. Of those switches, a third are from Genvoya and about 20% come from dolutegravir-based regimens, both Tivicay and Triumeq. When we see the switches as well as the naive patients' trajectory overall, they're right on target for what we predicted prior to the launch and really are in line for where we think Biktarvy will ultimately end up as the top switch as well as naive drug in HIV, and a position that's currently occupied by Genvoya. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: And, Geoff, I'd add to that that keep in mind that the launch of Biktarvy, we basically got six weeks of revenue currently in the quarter. So while a partial quarter, we also had about half of it was related to inventory. But underlying, to your point, we're really excited with the overall launch of Biktarvy and the success to date. The launch trajectory is looking very close to Genvoya. And over time, we expect it to overtake Genvoya, as I mentioned, as the number one STR for naive and switch patients over time. I think if you then turn and think about just Europe beyond Biktarvy, we're also seeing, as I mentioned, over 50% of our HIV sales came from Descovy-based products in Europe, and that's exceeding in advance of the fact that generics are widely available. So to the point I made on the call and John made, we're really excited with the opportunity for HIV to be a growth business. That's inclusive of PrEP as well, but we're excited where we are for the year and for the opportunity to have this business be a growth trajectory for us beyond 2018. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Yee of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question as well, a two-part question. On HIV, can you just perhaps quantify how much inventory impacted the results? I think people are quite a bit concerned on the HIV numbers, so maybe just help us out there relative to consensus, $100 million \u2013 $200 million, or more of inventory. And on hep C, there was a miss there, and I guess people are concerned about that relative to your competition. So maybe just talk to that because you're reiterating the guidance. Thanks so much. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Sure. So, Michael, let me start with HIV inventory. The drawdown in inventory was primarily from our HIV products. But as I mentioned, if you look at underlying U.S. prescription growth overall, it was 12% year over year. And as I mentioned, 50% of our HIV revenues in Europe were comprised of Descovy-containing regimens. So while we haven't quantified the dollar magnitude, the drawdown was larger than what we have seen in past quarters. And typically, if you go back, the last eight quarters we've had that Q4 to Q1 dynamic relative to inventory, so it is seasonal. There were two key events this quarter that made that inventory decline greater than expected. One was the availability of generic versions of TDFs, so therefore wholesalers weren't carrying Viread anymore. And then two, the anticipation of the Biktarvy approval, so lower stocking of both TAF and TDF-containing regimens. Keep in mind if you look at year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter growth, the availability of generic versions of TDF in the U.S. impacted our HBV business. Overall, as we think about our big three wholesalers, we were in line relative to our inventory agreements. I'll remind you that we don't have agreements in place for the sub-wholesalers. But again, just emphasizing that overall, our underlying HIV growth remains strong but we have the typical seasonal inventory, driven by the two events that I just mentioned. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: The second part was on HCV. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So to turn to your second question on HCV, which the question... Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: The competitive environment. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes, the competitive environment, I would say if you step back and think about where we are relative to our guidance and our expectations, we reiterated guidance. It is pretty much playing out in line with our expectations. We talked about the fact in my comments that the U.S. pricing has largely stabilized, and we expect market share to stabilize by midyear. I would say, Michael, that the ex-U.S. competition has intensified, but I'd also say that competition was a more intense environment prior to the launch of a competitor and remains to be. So we do believe that overall hep C is a long and durable market. We'll continue to compete very aggressively with our competitor. But in summary, our expectations for 2018 are intact, and we believe our revenue reflects the guidance that we provided at the beginning of the year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Abrahams of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, thanks for taking my question and my congrats to Norbert on all your accomplishments and to Andrew and John on your new roles and responsibilities. A question on Yescarta, as we try to gauge avenues of continued growth there this year and beyond, can you maybe help us understand the proportion of centers that are operating at high throughput and perhaps how far along in infrastructure establishment those additional centers that you expect will be authorized are going to be relative to those already online? And then I guess I'm also just curious on revenue recognition there relative to reimbursement, how we should be thinking about that. Thanks. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So I'll start, Brian. I would say you're right. It's early days, so we're not going to get into throughput discussions or specifically what we're seeing at every center. We're really pleased with our full first quarter revenue. We've talked about this being a very measured launch, with our focus being this year on getting centers authorized and being sure that their experience with Yescarta meets the expectation of the centers and the patients. So I mentioned we have 40 centers authorized, and we expect by midyear that we'll have coverage for 80% of the eligible Yescarta patients as we continue to ramp up centers. Relative to revenue recognition, no overall concerns there, we're seeing good reimbursement overall for both commercial as well as Medicare patients. So we're really comfortable where we are with the launch to date. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I guess one, with HCV price stabilizing, I wonder if you'd just give us some idea of where that stabilized relative to some of the prior comments you've made around what the average price was across the regimens. And then if I can ask a separate question for John McHutchison, related to the UC program for filgotinib, I believe you have a futility analysis to move from Phase 2 to Phase 3. Could you just talk a little bit about what the bar is and what the hurdle is to move into the Phase 3 program and how you're thinking about that? Thanks. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So I'll start, Matthew. I think the main change that you saw in Q1 in that step-down, as we talked about on our February call, was related to Medicare in the U.S. So as we mentioned this call and the prior, we expected that step-down with the price adjustment as we move to the new contractual arrangements at the beginning of the year. John G. McHutchison - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: And, Matthew, it's John McHutchison. The second part of the question was about the futility interim analysis for the selection of filgotinib in ulcerative colitis Phase 3 study. Just to remind you, the reason we did this futility analysis is we hadn't studied filgotinib in ulcerative colitis in Phase 2. We had in Crohn's disease in the FITZROY study and we have obviously had data in rheumatoid arthritis, but we had to have an interim analysis in the ulcerative colitis study to make sure that we were on track. That analysis is planned, without getting into all of the details, coming up shortly this year. It's based on the week 10 induction timepoint and the endoscopic response and improvements in endoscopic response in the two groups of patients that are enrolled in the trial, those that are naive and those that are biologic non-responders. So I'll leave it at that, I think, to answer the question, and we'll see how it goes. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Citi. Your line is now open. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, guys, thank you for taking the question, so just one quick question on HCV. You did not reiterate HCV guidance, so I was just curious whether or not that's reiterated as well. And then on Yescarta, I'm just trying to understand a little bit about what you're seeing in the real world on safety, given that you'll be facing some competition. Are you seeing safety in line with your clinical trial work or side effects that are not as common? Thanks. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So, Robyn, I'll take the first question regarding guidance. We didn't give specific HCV guidance. But again, if you take a look at our revenues and you look at the components that we provided in our guidance overview last quarter, we're pretty much in line and at the high end of that guidance overall with $1 billion-plus in global HCV revenues. And we did reiterate our total guidance, which is how we guided this year on total net product revenue. Relative to safety on Yescarta, John, do you want to? John G. McHutchison - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Robyn, it's John McHutchison. Hello. So I've been talking to some of the team members in Santa Monica over the last couple of days. And in general, there's nothing untoward that's been observed to my knowledge as well outside of the clinical trial. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Umer Raffat of Evercore. Your line is now open. Regina Grebla - Evercore Group LLC : Hi, this is Regina Grebla on for Umer. Thank you for taking our questions. So first, many investors think that you're in an earnings trough this year. Do you think that you're in an earnings trough? And NASH is emerging as an important catalyst in your pipeline. We saw some data from Allergen at EASL where patients and their placebo arms seesawed between fibrosis stages. We do recognize that the Allergen study enrolled earlier fibrosis stage patients than F3. But how much of a risk do you think this could be in your Phase 3 program? Thank you. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hi, Regina, so I'll start off. As I mentioned on the call, I think we're off to a great start. We've reiterated guidance, and the year is progressing in line with our expectations. We do believe that 2018 is a trough year for us on which we can grow. We'll have seasonality fluctuations from quarter to quarter, but we're very confident, hence, reiterated our overall guidance for the year and expect to be able to grow off of our 2018 base going forward. John G. McHutchison - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hi, Regina. It's John McHutchison. In terms of the second part of your question relating to variability in placebo response rates, it is an issue with liver biopsy, where we know there's a 30% variability if you have two pathologists read the same liver biopsy. And I think some of the presentations you referred to at AASLD might be partly reflecting that. So it's an imperfect tool at best but what we have in terms of drug approvals for NASH patients. We have had the fortunate opportunity of being able to address this. Our previous simtuzumab trial enrolled many hundreds of patients. Now the drug didn't work, unfortunately, but we have a lot of patients with two liver biopsies a long time apart, so we are very, very confident of what we expect to see in F3 and F4 patients in terms of the placebo response rate, in terms of the fibrosis improvement score of one point with no worsening of NASH. So we have that number, and that is what we've used to calculate our power and our sample size in our STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4 programs. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen. Your line is now open. Philip Nadeau - Cowen & Company: Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question, two follow-up questions on the commercial side. So first on HCV, just to maybe ask Robyn's question in a different way, on slide 35 of the slide deck you handed out on the last call, you did give a range for 2018 expected HCV sales of $3.5 billion to $4 billion, even if that wasn't formal guidance. And you said that the decrease versus the $9.1 billion from 2017 would be due to about a $1 billion hit from total market patient starts and a $4.3 billion to $4.6 billion hit from the competitive environment. So if you're going to redo that slide today given what you've seen in Q1, would those numbers still hold? Would you still expect the same hit from market starts, competitive environment leading to the same 2018 range? And then just briefly on Biktarvy, I know you said that the access was good. We've heard from physician consultants that insurers are requiring prior auths and other methods early in the launch of HIV products. What are you seeing in terms of prior auths from insurance plans for Biktarvy? Thanks. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hi, Phil. So I'll take the first part and then turn it over to Andrew for Biktarvy. Looking at the slide that you referred to, and again I'll reiterate our HCV revenues for the quarter were $1 billion. So if I think about what we talked about, the reason for the step-down, one being price, because we did the new contracting in Q1, that would fall under competitive environment as well as thinking about share. The combination of those two make up the competitive environment. Starts, we talked about them being a slow and steady decline. So yes, I believe this slide is intact and it's included in our overall reiteration of our guidance for the full year of $20 billion to $21 billion. Andrew Cheng - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So, Phil, it's Andrew. So we'll switch gears, and you were asking about prior authorizations with Biktarvy. I think as you're well aware that when any new product launches that there is some degree of prior authorization as they start to review the product. However, as John mentioned on his initial remarks of the call, on March 27, the DHHS guidelines placed Biktarvy in the top tier of its recommended initial regimens list. Since that time, we've received some feedback that the amount of prior authorizations has really decreased and has become less of an impediment. And taken together, that helps put us to and reiterate what Robin said earlier on the call that we have every expectation that Biktarvy will match and then exceed Genvoya when it comes to number one position for both naive and switch patients. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering maybe, John McHutchison, if you can discuss the importance of first-mover advantage for Yescarta in DLBCL versus any potential modest benefit that a future competitor might have on CRS. I'm just wondering how you think about that. And then maybe one for Robin, just HIV pricing in Europe, have you guys seen any change in the pricing dynamics on the branded side given the entry of generics? Thanks a lot. John G. McHutchison - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hey, Terence. It's John McHutchison. Hello, thank you for the question. I think the first-mover advantage is important. We have the relationships. We have the experience now in the community, particularly in the U.S., which will obviously extend elsewhere. So I think it's an important advantage, as it has been for us in other diseases, including HIV and hepatitis C, where we were fortunate to be first as well. So that's a brief and general answer, but I think it is important. Andrew Cheng - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Terence, it's Andrew. So I'll touch on the impact in Europe and what we've seen. Generics for Viread, TDF, are available in Europe, and we have seen some impact on certain pricings in certain countries. However, I think it's important to recognize that over 50% of our European revenues come from TAF-based products. And you can see, as we mentioned on our last call, that in certain countries, the conversion rate from TDF to TAF products like Germany exceeds 70%. So I think when one thinks about the impact, we've already made that switchover for a number of countries, and that impact is somewhat muted. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: And, Terence, to follow on to that, we priced Genvoya at parity with Stribild. So our ability to get early access in those markets where we've launched has been helped, and it's helped that overall transition that Andrew just referred to, with greater than 50% being Descovy regimens overall. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. It's on Yescarta, and I'm wondering. Is the $40 million in sales in Q1 pretty evenly distributed across your 40 authorized centers, or is it more concentrated in a handful of them? And then just in general terms, should we be thinking about patient capacity per center as something that also gradually evolves over time? Thanks. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hi, Cory. It's Robin. I'd say again, it's early days relative to our centers being certified and getting launched to really get at a throughput per center or any of those type of metrics. And I'd also say that because this is such a specialized treatment, we've selected centers that we think can be successful. We're helping them through that. Yes, some of the earlier centers we're seeing higher volumes, as you would anticipate. But I think the volume is not just determined by saying you're now certified. It's just determined by the hospital and their resources and looking at the other various treatments, et cetera, and other capacity centers that any hospital has to manage. So it's going to be harder, particularly in this therapeutic area, to provide the level of detail and granularity or at this stage, details by center. The $40 million was very robust for us. We're happy with the results today. And as I mentioned, this is going to be a controlled, measured launch for us, and we're going to continue in that process and provide you updates on that as much as we can. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Alethia Young of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats to John and Andrew. This is more one on the commercial standpoint, just big-picture. So Biktarvy has taken roughly 80% switch from Genvoya. I just wanted to think about broadly. Should we think Genvoya continues to grow, or does it inflect and then Biktarvy picks up where Genvoya left off, or is it just a case that the 80% Biktarvy switch most likely may moderate a little bit, so that trend may not be as pronounced? Thanks. Andrew Cheng - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So, Alethia, let me just clarify something in your call, just to recognize that when we think about Biktarvy scripts, 80% come from switches. About a third of those come from Genvoya. So I think when we think about it, a third from Genvoya, then about 20% from dolutegravir-based regimens, either Tivicay or Triumeq, and then the remainder of the switches come from a mix of different regimens. So when we think about it overall, I think we're very happy with the mix. And given our robust development plan where two of the four studies were based on switch, one from Triumeq and one from protease inhibitor-based regimens, we expect that mix actually to be the same going forward, about an 80 :20 switch given the overall dynamics. Now there's certainly going to be some degree of variability from quarter to quarter into the proportion that's Genvoya versus dolutegravir-based regimens. But certainly, we're very comfortable with where we are and expect that the overall growth of Biktarvy to continue, as we mentioned earlier. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Salim Syed of Mizuho. Your line is now open. Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question, just one on Yescarta. Could you just maybe comment on what sort of education you guys are doing with the medical community for the non-CAR T oncology docs, and if these docs are actually referring patients to the CAR T centers after which line of therapy in general? Thank you. John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hi, Salim. It's John Milligan. I just wanted to \u2013 it's actually a very timely question. So as you know, we've been out in the community detailing Zydelig, and we've just recently taken those representatives, our therapeutic specialists, and put them through specific CAR T training so that they can start to have a conversation with doctors and the communities about what CAR T is, what kinds of patients are eligible for CAR T, and can help them with referrals. I don't know specific referrals, but certainly encouraging doctors to refer those patients who would be eligible to specialists who then can handle those cases. So we are starting an educational campaign in the community that really kicked off this week. Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes from Ying Huang of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, thanks for taking my questions, the first one I have related to the data you presented at EASL. So if you look at the MRI-PDFF data, it seems that the asthma inhibitor does not appear to be very potent compared to the ACC inhibitor or even FXR. So I was just wondering based on that, how much confidence do you have on the ultimate success of the Phase 3 trials for asthma in STELLAR 3 and 4 trials? And then maybe, Robin, can you elaborate a little bit on the ex-U.S. dynamics for HCV? Because it appears that AbbVie has enjoyed very much success in launching Mavyret in ex-U.S. based on the numbers reported. I was wondering how you see that evolving in the next few quarters, whether you can gain back share from AbbVie or not? Thank you. John G. McHutchison - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hello, Ying, it's John McHutchison to answer the first part of your question. The observation you made and noted in our EASL presentation that selonsertib has less of an effect on steatosis in the liver than our ACC inhibitor that inhibits de novo lipogenesis is exactly what we wanted to see and expected to see because of the mechanism of action. Selonsertib doesn't have a primary anti-lipo toxicity effect. It's an anti-ASK, and it works on hepatic stellate cells as well. So that's what we expected to see. In terms of the second part of your question, does that give us more or less confidence in terms of our Phase 3 STELLAR programs, I think you need to take the context of what we presented at EASL in a 12-week study and think about it in the overall context. What we did in all of these programs is we did single-agent small studies first to show that each drug was effective, which we've done for all of our three drugs. Then we did a small combination study to see if there was combination safety. That's what we presented at EASL. We did, however, also present some of the parameters that you've been talking about. But our goal was always, once we had combination safety, to then be able to kick off a definitive larger study with a longer duration of therapy to determine which of those drugs is safer, which is what we're doing. To get back to the selonsertib question, we decided to do a Phase 3 STELLAR selonsertib study based on a previous study that we presented last year that was 24 weeks in duration, that had two liver biopsies, that showed a dose-dependent effect on the regression of fibrosis, and an inverse relationship to the development of cirrhosis. We also showed that the target phospho-p38 is up-regulated in MAPK patients, and it's also blocked or inhibited or down-regulated by the drug. So everything is heading in the right direction. And I think what's happening here is people are taking this small 12-week experiment that was due and looking at combination safety out of context. When we started our STELLAR Phase 3 program, it was based on a larger Phase 2 study, two biopsies six months apart, that showed a definitive effect on fibrosis. So we are in good shape. I'm excited about the results. We've enrolled them ahead of schedule, and we look forward to getting the results early next year. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thanks, John. And I think, Ying, your other question was related to ex-U.S. HCV sales. So let me start by saying I think that's always been a much more competitive environment compared to the U.S. But OUS sales if we compare what we did relative to our competitor includes a wide variety of geographies, including Europe, Japan, and Asia. And I would say the market share is very different from country to country. I think it is fair to say that we've seen our competitors do very well in Japan, for example, with some of the prior DAA failures and some warehousing there. But there are other countries where we're doing well and we're going to pick our opportunities to focus on. While we know this is a competitive market, we feel we have the field force and necessary folks in place to be competitive. And as mentioned, I think we're on track. And relative to where we expected us to be, we see things playing out very close to that. As I also said, we expect our share to stabilize by midyear, so I think we'll be able to provide more insight around share going forward during the next call. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Carter Gould of UBS. Your line is now open. Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks, guys, for taking the question. I was looking to get some clarity on the regulatory strategy for filgotinib and if investors should expect you to file I guess following that the FINCH 1 and FINCH 3 data become available. Or will you look to wait for maybe one of the GI-focused indications to have that Phase 3 data in hand as well? Thank you. John G. McHutchison - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So, Carter, it's John McHutchison. Thank you for the question. So as I said today in my prepared notes that we now are in the fortunate position to have all FINCH 3 trials enrolled for both methotrexate-naive and inadequate responders in our biologic non-responders. So we can file if the data supports it, of course. We can file for RA with all of those three studies, and they are in a different timeline from the inflammatory bowel disease study, so we would not wait for the inflammatory bowel disease studies. Operator : Thank you, and that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Sung Lee for any closing remarks. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Candace, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead, and the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on our future progress. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

LLC Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Gilead Sciences Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Candice and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode, and as a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Candice, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued two press releases regarding our CEO John Milligan and earnings results for the second quarter of 2018. The press releases and detailed slides on earnings are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website. You will notice the change to how we present product sales in the press release. Previously, we grouped HIV and HBV together under antiviral product sales. We now show HIV products alone so that you can better understand the performance of this category. The speakers on today's call will be John Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Andrew Cheng, Chief Medical Officer and Executive Vice President; and John McHutchison, Chief Scientific Officer and Head of Research and Development. Before we begin with our prepared comments, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital, all of which involves certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website. I will now turn the call over to John. John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Sung, and good afternoon, everyone. As you saw from our press release, I'll be stepping down as CEO and departing Gilead at the end of this year. It's been an honor to work here for my entire professional career and now that the company is on solid footing for the future, the board and I have agreed it is a good time to turn the reigns over to a new leader. You've seen the strong results from the second quarter. Beyond these numbers, I believe Gilead is in a position of tremendous strength. When I stepped into the role of CEO there were a number of things I wanted to accomplish on behalf of the company and I'm very pleased with the progress we have made. We have a growing HIV franchise and industry-leading cell therapy program and late-stage pipeline in inflammation and NASH. We've been working at a fast and unrelenting pace for many years, for me nearly three decades, and while I'm extremely proud of what this company has accomplished, I'm also looking forward to a well-deserved break and will move on to new and different opportunities. I want to emphasize that this does not change our mission or the strategic direction of our company and with the full faith and support of the Board of Directors we will continue to pursue and execute internal programs as well as external partnerships and transactions that further strengthen our pipeline and our business. As our press release described, I will be staying in my role until the end of the year while the board has a chance to conduct its search for a new CEO to lead Gilead into its next wave of growth. So let's get to the business at hand, the great results from this past quarter and I would like to now turn the call over to Robin. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I provide an update on the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to thank John for his leadership, commitment and many contributions to Gilead over the years. Personally, I've appreciated your friendship, support, and I wish you well in your future endeavors. Turning to the business and the results for the quarter, I'll review the financial results and commercial performance. Andrew will provide updates on HIV portfolio, and then John McHutchison will make a few comments about our pipeline. We delivered a very strong quarter led by the performance of our HIV franchise with further stabilization in HCV and continued progress of the Yescarta launch. Total revenues for the second quarter were $5.6 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.91. This compares to revenue of $7.1 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.56 for the same period last year. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter benefited from a settlement of a tax examination which contributed $0.15 per share and an effective tax rate for the quarter of 13.4%. Starting with HIV, product sales for the second quarter were $3.7 billion, up 13% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the uptake of our Descovy-based regimen with a very strong contribution from Biktarvy in the U.S. Sequentially the increase was primarily due to the following factors. First, the seasonal U.S. inventory draw-down observed in the first quarter, which accounted for more than $200 million and did not recur in the second quarter. Second, U.S. payer mix which is typically about 45% private pay and 55% government, but in the second quarter was approximately equally split between private pay and government segments. We estimate that this benefited the second quarter by approximately $150 million. And, third, the continued rapid uptake of Biktarvy in the second quarter. Our U.S. HIV business continues to be a major growth driver, delivering 18% year-over-year revenue growth and 11% year-over-year prescription growth, which reflects the strong underlying demand for Descovy-based regimens. 70% of Gilead's total HIV treatment prescription volume was comprised of Descovy-based regimens. We anticipate this percentage to continue to increase over the coming years. In the first full quarter since its approval in February, Biktarvy delivered $183 million in sales in the U.S. Biktarvy also became the number one regimen for switch patients during the quarter. Based on its current trajectory, we anticipate that Biktarvy will become the number one single tablet regimen for treatment-na\u00efve patients and will overtake Genvoya as the most successful launch in HIV history. More than 85% of Biktarvy's prescriptions came from switches. Of these switches, approximately a quarter came from Genvoya and another quarter came from regimens containing dolutegravir. The balance came from older Gilead single and multi-tablet regimens. In March, Biktarvy was added to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services guidelines for the use of anti-retroviral agents in adults and adolescents living with HIV as one of the recommended initial regimens, and earlier this week The Journal of American Medical Association published updated treatment guidelines from the International AIDS Society-USA Panel, which now includes Biktarvy as a recommended regimen. Truvada for PrEP continued to grow with an estimated 180,000 individuals in the U.S. taking Truvada for PrEP as we exited the quarter. Also in May the U.S. Food and Drug Administration extended the indication for Truvada for PrEP to include at-risk adolescents. In the U.S., youth aged 13 to 24 comprised 21% of the approximately 40,000 new infections in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These statistics demonstrate the need for increased efforts to educate at-risk individuals, particularly young men who have sex with men, about risk-reduction strategies including Truvada for PrEP. To this end with strong encouragement from the HIV community, we launched two new television campaigns, a non-branded disease awareness program to reach those unaware of their HIV risk, and a branded Truvada commercial. We hope that these two campaigns, together with the ongoing educational initiatives across our organization, will further support the advocacy community's efforts to destigmatize HIV and normalize conversations about HIV prevention among those at the highest risk for infections and the healthcare providers who serve them. Turning to Europe, HIV sales were down slightly year-over-year due to the availability of generics in several markets. Partially offset by uptake of Descovy-based regimens. These regimens now comprise nearly 60% of our Europe HIV product revenues reflecting the strong physician and patient preference for Descovy-containing regimens over generics. Genvoya remained the number one regimen for na\u00efve and switch patients across the EU5 collectively for the fifth consecutive quarter. Biktarvy was approved in the EU toward the end of June and immediately launched in Germany and a few other countries. We believe Biktarvy will make significant contributions to our European revenues once pricing and reimbursement are achieved broadly, which can take up to 12 months. The performance of our worldwide HIV business was very strong in the first half of the year and we expect similar results for the second half of the year. The U.S. HIV market will continue to deliver robust year-over-year prescription and revenue growth in the second half of 2018 driven by the continued strong uptake of Biktarvy. Given the payer mix dynamic we experienced in Q2, our Q3 U.S. HIV revenues could look similar to Q2. Additionally it is important to note that in Europe there is typically a third quarter seasonal impact on revenues due to holiday schedules in various countries that also could impact our Q3 revenues compared to Q2. We also expect to see some additional impact from generics in certain European countries. All of these assumptions have been factored into our guidance. Turning to HCV, product sales for the second quarter were $1 billion, down 65% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. As anticipated, we are seeing further stabilization of the market, which is reflected in our sequential performance for the quarter. Patient starts continues to be more predictable, and we still expect a slow and steady decline moving forward. Our belief is that the HCV market is durable and will contribute to our revenues in a meaningful way going forward, albeit at declining rates. We will continue to compete for market share across the market segments and geographies with increased promotional efforts and focus behind Epclusa, our pan-genotypic, pan-fibrotic, once daily single-tablet regimen. Turning to cardiovascular products, Ranexa and Letairis delivered their best quarterly performance ever with sales of $208 million and $244 million, respectively. As a reminder, the U.S. patent for ambrisentan, the active agent in Letairis will expire near the end of this month and we expect this to impact our Letairis sales in the second half of the year. Moving on to cell therapy, sales of Yescarta were $68 million. We continue to be encouraged by the response from the healthcare provider and patient communities for the life-saving potential of Yescarta. We have completed the authorization of more than 60 cancer centers which cover approximately 80% of the Yescarta-eligible patients in the United States. While we continue to work on authorizing additional centers, our focus now turns to working with centers to enhance patient flows. Furthermore, we are educating community oncologists about cell therapy and how they can connect their patients to cancer centers for appropriate treatment. In terms of access in the United States, the payer mix has been consistent with expectations. The majority of patients treated with Yescarta were covered by commercial insurance or treated at PPS-exempt centers. We continue to work to provide better access for patients on Medicare. We provided comments to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services as part of the fiscal year 2019 rule-making process to create a DRG code that is reflective of the value that cell therapy provides to patients. CMS is expected to announce the final in-patient prospective payment system rule in August of this year that will establish in-patient payment rates for the upcoming fiscal year beginning October 1. Last month we announced that the CHMP adopted a positive opinion on the Marketing Authorization Application for Yescarta in the EU, as a treatment for adults with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B lymphoma and primary large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. We expect the European Commission to grant Marketing Authorization in the third quarter of this year and our preparations for launch are underway. We plan to complete the authorization of more than 20 centers in the EU by the end of 2018 with our initial launch efforts primarily focused on Germany and France. Now, turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $921 million for the second quarter, up 13% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to our purchase of a Priority Review Voucher in the second quarter and investments in our cell therapy program. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $840 million for the second quarter, up 2% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher costs to support the growth of our business following the acquisition of Kite. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the second quarter was 13.4% compared to 22.8% in the first quarter of this year. The lower rate in the second quarter was due to a favorable settlement of a tax examination. As a result of this favorable impact, we are lowering our full year non-GAAP effective tax guidance to be in the range of 19% to 21%. Moving to our balance sheet. As of June 30, we had $31.7 billion of cash and investments. During the second quarter, we generated $1.6 billion in operating cash flow including tax payments of $1.5 billion. And we also paid cash dividends of $740 million and repurchased 6.6 million shares of stock for $450 million. The year is progressing consistent with our expectations, and we are reiterating our full year guidance with the exception of the non-GAAP effective tax rate, which has been lowered. Also, the diluted EPS impact of GAAP to non-GAAP adjustment has been increased from a range of $1.41 to $1.51 per share to $1.50 to $1.60 per share. Details of our guidance can be found on slide 35 in the earnings results presentation. One area I'd like to address before closing, is U.S. pricing. We did not implement midyear prices increases on any of our products and have no plans to do so for at least six months. As you know, in HCV we have responded to the evolving, increasingly competitive market by providing payers with substantial discounts. We are confident that our net pricing is competitive and is delivering value for patients and the broader healthcare system. In closing, we continue to believe that 2018 is a trough year for Gilead on which we can grow in the future. Our confidence in our future is supported by strong and growing HIV business led by the launch of Biktarvy in the U.S., increasing momentum in our cell therapy business, progress in the emerging R&D areas of NASH and inflammation and a healthy balance sheet, which equips us to invest in future opportunities to create long-term shareholder value. I will now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Cheng, MD, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Robin. It's timely that the 22 International AIDS Conference is taking place this week in Amsterdam. The World AIDS Conference represents the largest conference on any global health issue in the world and has become known as a venue where researchers, policymakers, advocates collaborative help drive an evidence-based response to the HIV epidemic. I'd like to provide some highlights of Gilead's vision for HIV treatment, prevention and cure, and how we intend to sustain and build on our leadership position. I will summarize some of the exciting data presented in Amsterdam this week that provide context to what we see as remaining unmet needs in this field. I'd also like to congratulate our partner Janssen on the approval last week of SYMTUZA by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. SYMTUZA is the fourth Descovy-based, single-tablet regimen and the first commercially available single-tablet regimen containing a protease inhibitor, an important option for patients who previously had to consume two or more tablets each day. Among the results we presented at the International AIDS Conference, where data from a pooled analysis that further demonstrate the lack of resistance seen across the Biktarvy clinical trial program. This analysis generated \u2013 evaluated the efficacy of Biktarvy among patients with high baseline HIV RNA greater than 100,000 copies per milliliter and with a baseline CD4 cell count below 200 per microliter. Biktarvy sustained virologic suppression with no treatment emergent resistance to 48 weeks and 99% of patients in both sub groups achieved HIV RNA less than 50 copies per mill. For some people living with HIV, drug resistance is already a fact of life and we are also advancing molecules to meet their needs. GS-9131 a novel nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor is currently being studded in a Phase 2 trial in people living with HIV who are resistant to nucleosides and we look forward to sharing updates on this study in the future. Although once daily single-tablet regimens have set the current standard for convenience, we recognize that even once-daily dosing can be challenging or impractical for some people living with or at risk for HIV infection. I'm also pleased to share an update on a long-acting formulation of GS-6207, our novel HIV capsid inhibitor. This inhibitor is the most potent anti-HIV molecule ever recorded and results in therapeutically active blood levels lasting greater than 90 days after a single subcutaneous injection in pre-clinical species. Since that time, we have moved a clinical formulation into the clinic and similar to our animal data we have established in healthy volunteers that a single subcutaneous dose of the capsid inhibitor results in therapeutically relevant concentrations for greater than 60 days. Our goal is an effective subcutaneous product that can be self-administered every three months, which could provide an important option for the significant number of people who are unable to adhere to daily oral regimens. Prevention efforts also took center stage at the conference this week. We now have compelling evidence correlating the use of Truvada for PrEP with declines in new HIV infections in the United States. In an analysis of state-level data conducted through a collaboration by Gilead, Emory University, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and presented this week at the conference states that \u2013 states with the highest utilization of Truvada for PrEP from 2012 to 2016 showed significant declines in the number of new HIV infections, while states with the lowest use reported increases in new infection. These data underscore the importance for Truvada for PrEP as an effective public health intervention in the ongoing efforts to decrease new HIV infections. Turning to our HIV cure efforts. One investigational agent is GS-9620, our toll-like receptor 7 agonist which activates certain immune cells that are important for eliminating infected cells. A second investigational agent is GS-9722 an anti-HIV envelope broadly neutralizing antibody that can kill infected cells. Combination studies are planned following the completion of dose-ranging studies for each compound. In summary, Gilead remains deeply committed to leading and innovating in HIV across the spectrum of care from prevention, to treatment, to HIV cure. We are continuing to make significant progress with Truvada in combination with safer sex practices as a means of preventing new HIV infections. We have multiple medicines available to address the needs of people living with HIV, including six single-tablet regimens. We are working to address remaining needs in both prevention and treatment. And we remain focused on pursuing discovery of new research that could one day lead to a cure for HIV. We have been the leader in HIV for many years and intend to remain at the forefront of these efforts for as long as HIV is a threat to the health of people worldwide. I would now like to turn the call over to John McHutchison. John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Andrew, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As you heard from Andrew, we are advancing pipeline candidates across the continuum of care for patients with HIV infection. We are also making progress in other therapeutic areas, and I'd like to spend a few minutes highlighting key accomplishments from the first half of this year, as well as additional milestones to look forward to in the second half, starting with cell therapy. As we anticipate regulatory approval of Yescarta in Europe, we're taking steps to establish worldwide manufacturing capabilities for cell therapy by leasing a new facility in the Netherlands. We anticipate this new European manufacturing facility to be fully operational in 2020 with the capacity to manufacture personalized cell therapies in closer geographic proximity to the patients who will receive them, therefore potentially shortening the turn-around time for people who urgently need such care. All of us at Gilead and Kite share excitement about both the work being done to launch Yescarta and to advance potential new cell therapies that could help a wider range of patients in the future. I'm particularly enthusiastic about ZUMA-7, our ongoing Phase 3 study comparing Yescarta to the standard of care in second-line treatment of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The current standard of care for these patients is salvage chemotherapy often followed by an autologous stem cell transplant. If successful, this study would support the use of Yescarta in earlier lines of therapy and could one day spare people from having to receive stem cell transplantation with all of its concomitant or attendant difficulties and complications. As significant of an advance as Yescarta represents, it is also just the beginning. It's critical, but an even greater percentage of patients respond to therapy. And that treatment becomes even safer and better tolerated, so that we can treat people sooner. I believe that with the pipeline programs we have and the technology gained through recent partnerships we can make this a reality. In the 10 months since we acquired Kite, we have initiated seven acquisitions, investments or partnerships that augment our efforts to more rapidly bring forth cellular therapy, treat a broader range of hematological malignancies and also solid tumors. Lastly, we announced a strategic collaboration with Gadeta a privately-held company that focuses on the discovery and development of novel cancer immunotherapies based on gamma delta T cell receptors. During the quarter, we also announced the new Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or CRADA, with the National Cancer Institute to develop adoptive cell therapies targeting patient-specific tumor neoantigens. Neoantigens are mutations found on the surface of cancer cells that are unique to each person and their tumor, offering the potential for more targeted antitumor activity particularly in the realm of solid tumors. Together, these research collaborations add to our capabilities in research and cell manufacturing, and they broaden our approach to developing potentially effective therapies for additional types of cancers including solid tumors. Moving to liver disease now. Our two ongoing Phase 3 trials, STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4, evaluating selonsertib, our ASK1 inhibitor in patients with F3 or bridging fibrosis and F4 or cirrhosis, were fully enrolled earlier this year, and data from these studies should be available in the first half of 2019. If positive, we expect to be in a position to file for approval in mid-2019. Under this timeline, we believe selonsertib could be the first NDA and the first product approved for the treatment of patients with NASH. From a commercial perspective, our teams are also currently building all the necessary capabilities to develop this new market. Separately, we discontinued the development of selonsertib for severe alcoholic hepatitis after a Phase 2 study of selonsertib in combination with prednisolone showed a lack of benefit on mortality, which is the primary efficacy endpoint of the trial. Now, it's important to note that alcoholic hepatitis and NASH are two very distinct diseases. Patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis have advanced decompensated disease with severe hepatic dysfunction and a high 30-day mortality, independent of any therapy. This is completely different from patients in NASH clinical studies and for most patients with NASH in general who have preserved liver functions and they have compensated disease. Additional data from the study will be shared at an upcoming scientific conference later this year. Turning to inflammation. We continue to be enthusiastic about filgotinib. In May, Gilead and Galapagos announced that EQUATOR our Phase 2 study of filgotinib in adults with moderate to severe psoriatic arthritis achieved its primary endpoint of improvement in the signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis at week 16 as assessed by the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement score. The filgotinib arm achieved an ACR20 response of 80% compared to 33% for the placebo arm. These results indicated filgotinib has the potential to have a significant effect on the signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis, a condition for which there is also high unmet medical need. We also announced that an independent Data Monitoring Committee conducted a planned interim futility analysis of the filgotinib Phase 2b/3 ulcerative colitis study named SELECTION. The DMC recommended that the study proceed into the Phase 3 portion as planned in both biologic experience and biologic naive patients. In rheumatoid arthritis three studies, FINCH 1, 2 and 3 are fully enrolled. FINCH 2 compared filgotinib to placebo each added to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or DMARD in 423 patients who have had an inadequate response to biologics. We expect results from the study later this year. As you know also our ability to file the NDA for filgotinib is dependent on establishing an adequate safety database at each dose of the drug being studied, as well as data from the MANTA study which is currently enrolling. We expect results from FINCH 1, a 52-week randomized study comparing filgotinib plus methotrexate to adalimumab plus methotrexate, and to methotrexate alone in patients who have had an inadequate response to methotrexate. And from FINCH 3 a 52-week randomized study comparing filgotinib alone to methotrexate alone and to the combination of filgotinib plus methotrexate in methotrexate-na\u00efve patients in the first half of next year. In summary, we are very excited about our business performance led by robust HIV revenues, a growing cell therapy franchise, stabilizing dynamics in HCV and a pipeline that will generate multiple Phase 3 data readouts across our therapeutic areas within the next 12 months. I want to take this opportunity to thank John and also Gilead's nearly 11,000 employees for their incredible focus, hard work and execution over the first half of the year. Let's now open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks so much. Hi, John, I just want to say it's been a real pleasure to work with you. You're really going to be missed in the industry. John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Well, thank you, Geoff. I appreciate that. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I'm a little worried about payback from our activist letter. John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: I promise not to write any letters to Barclays. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And I bet you'll miss all the M&A questions, I'm sure. John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: You know, I will miss this. It's always been a pleasure to work with you guys, and I really enjoyed it over the years. And this is not my last call, so you'll have one more chance to pester me. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. So when you look at the backdrop, hep C is stable, obviously, HIV is growing, Kite could be a nice platform. Do you think \u2013 is Gilead happy to get back to positive growth trends when you look at late this year and definitely in 2019? Or is it time to get even more aggressive? I'm just thinking either on deals or maybe more rapid deployment of investments, say, in cell therapy or NASH? John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: It's a good question, Geoff. I mean, the message that we're trying to send out here today is that we're very confident in our overall strategy. We are going to continue to be very, very active looking at transactions which can further our business, and I think it's fair to say we're never really satisfied with where we are. We're always seeking to do more, faster, and we'll continue to try to do that. And so we have a very active business development team. You'll see many things coming to fruition in the second half of this year. The announcement today is not going to slow us down, and the board has given us the go-ahead to move with these transactions if they meet our criteria. So I'm confident in the baseline. I'm never satisfied, and I know my team is not satisfied and we will continue to move forward. And so that's our message. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Yee of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC : Oh, hey, thanks. Good afternoon and I think we're all going to echo our appreciation and all the stuff you've done with us, John. And so to that extent, I guess I would ask, given perhaps some period of uncertainty I think into what that next Gilead is, what do you think investors should anticipate in terms of a either new leadership or a strategy or what do you think could be certainly different? Is that more deal making? Is that going into other areas? What do you think would change? Thanks so much. John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: You know, it's a good question, Michael. If you think about my background and my history, I've been here for a long time, from the time the company was a private start-up to the $100 billion market cap company we are today, and so I've seen a lot of growth. But I've been pretty limited in my exposure, and I think the next leader should be somebody who brings expertise, scientific, commercial or other, into new opportunities for us to grow, for example, people who've launched products into new markets such as we're doing NASH or people who really know how to compete in the oncology area, where I have less experience. And so I think we are looking for a new leader who will bring new ideas, previous history and experiences we don't have, and one who will take the baton from me and move it forward for the company and for the patients we serve. And so I would look for somebody like that. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Abrahams of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. And John, my congrats to you as well on almost three decades there and all your accomplishments. On the HIV front, coming out of IAS, just wondering your expectations as to what, if any, impact dual regimens could potentially have on pricing, particularly in Europe and/or overall market share? And then on the housekeeping front, just wondering if you saw any favorable impact from any inventory restocking in HIV revenues this quarter? Thanks. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So maybe I'll start with the last question, and then turn it over to Andrew to talk about IAS, Brian. No, the performance in Q2 was demand-driven and inventory was stable, right? Wholesaler days on hand remained consistent between Q1, Q2, and I'd say, again, inventory was commensurate with demand. Andrew Cheng, MD, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah, Brian, it's Andrew. And I think when we look at the GEMINI data coming out of the Amsterdam meeting from yesterday's presentation, I think we've all seen the results and we still remain interested in better understanding the resistance profile of a two-drug regimen, given some of the methodological differences that we're seeing in patients who may have had virologic failure before week 24 that were excluded from the analysis. I think when we think about the looking at the big picture for two-drug regimens, in particular of dolutegravir and lamivudine, we are interested in understanding what the long-term resistance profile is as highlighted by some of the recent JULUCA data that highlighted resistance development past week 48. So we'll be very interested to understand how GEMINI regimens work in the real world and are continuing to focus on its \u2013 the potency in a two-drug regimen, especially one which has viral load limitations in clinical studies. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Leerink. Your line is now open. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks very much. And I echo the congratulations, John. I'd like to be the first to volunteer over the next six months to help teach you how to prepare a resume since it's a path that you've never prepared one before. John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Don't worry. My daughter told me she's going to teach me how to set up a LinkedIn profile. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : I look forward to that. I guess the business is really stunning. It really started out in HIV and now it's come through full circle. It's really very much focused on HIV now but with just a much broader and remarkable product portfolio. So I'd like to hear you comment about what the sustainable growth rate is for the HIV business, at least through 2022 or so. You're in the transition from the legacy combinations over to the TAF-based combinations. Biktarvy is just doing fabulously well, and it's difficult for us to sort of model it exactly how that shift occurs. But what should we be thinking about the sustainable growth rate for this business and the contribution from volume, price and mix, both currently and then going forward? John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Geoff, why don't I start out with this? I mean you mentioned 2022, but we see this as a growing franchise well beyond 2022. We think that the TAF-based regimens will be the backbone of choice for patients. We think Biktarvy will be a very, very large successful product, and we see great opportunities for a number of areas to treat more patients. There still aren't all patients in the United States who are under treatment, and with the simplification, we continue to think that we can expand the number of patients who will be treated across the United States. As Andrew mentioned, we're making great progress in our long-acting products. I think there's a significant segment of patients who aren't treated today who would choose an every-three-month option. We're very, very encouraged by the pharmaco-kinetic data we're seeing for this molecule. It is a very interesting opportunity for us to grow the field beyond the 750,000 patients treated in the United States to a much higher number. And so I see great opportunities for us to extend and expand the range of that. And I'll turn it over to Robin for her thoughts. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: I think you've covered it, John. And, Geoff, as you've seen, relative to the conversion of Descovy-based products it's been very, very good surge with over 70% in the U.S., 60% in the EU and, as John said, and Andrew and team are continuing to go forth with new innovation and new development, so we're very confident in our ability to continue to grow this franchise even through long-term LOEs. I think innovation of HIV is Gilead, and that'll stay true to what we will always, I think, excel at. Andrew Cheng, MD, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Geoff, its Andrew. And I would just only add that when one thinks about the growth rate, one really has to factor the 250,000 to 300,000 Americans who know that they're living with HIV, yet are not receiving any form of anti-retroviral therapy. And so there are many reasons for that. But one of them is that, as I highlighted, the oral therapies may not work for where they are in their life at this point. But as we know, HIV progresses without the anti-retroviral control, and so the capsid is something we're very, very excited about given its profile. In addition, when we think about Biktarvy, I think we \u2013 just adding some color to what we've seen to date is that we've seen Biktarvy open doors for us that really we haven't seen. Multiple examples of doctors or practices that have been closed to us for more than five years that, with the profile that we've seen with Biktarvy, no resistance as well as once daily small tablets plus well-tolerated unboosted integrase inhibitors with few drug interactions, that has really made a difference in how physicians and patients look at this compound. And we've also seen institutions create therapeutic exceptions for Biktarvy to enter their institutions because of its profile. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, great. Good afternoon. So John, congratulations to you and good luck as you take a well-deserved break. I'd like to ask a sort of product-specific question, if I could, so. And maybe this is for Andrew, but can you just comment on how you did resistance testing in your studies versus the method that they've employed in their studies? And if there are any key differences in that that may have led to sort of lack of seeing some resistant mutants if they were occurring? Andrew Cheng, MD, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So, Matthew, thank you for the very good question. It's a very technical one, but I think on \u2013 when it came to resistant samples, we began looking at resistant samples at week 8. And with an integrase inhibitor they've come down quite rapidly. We did not require patients to discontinue for them to be what we call a resistance analysis population, so anyone with a viral load after they suppressed of greater than 50 we put into our resistance analysis population. So we looked at them, and we used the second sample to quantify whether or not \u2013 because the first patient would come in, they had a greater than 50 viral load, then we'd proceed to get the second confirmatory sample and send that off for analysis. John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Andrew, I think it's fair to say that it's a very, very rigorous analysis to really make sure that there is no resistance. Andrew Cheng, MD, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: No. Right, John. I think that's right, and I think we're very comfortable with the strong resistance profile of Biktarvy. And as you know, we're very close to presenting 96-week data in upcoming scientific conference. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Citi. Your line is now open. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you for taking my question, and John, I just want to echo what everyone else has said. It's been a pleasure working with you and learning from you. I guess the question I have is really around NASH. It's gone from \u2013 this is a massive market to it's not a market to, oh, now it's a market again. Maybe since you're going into the phase of hiring people and thinking about a launch, can you give us some sense on how you're thinking about what you're learning about the market as its developing? And what you're hearing from what doctors want to see in the space? And how you think it'll evolve with your data and the coming data over the next year? And then part of that would be on M&A. Do you think you have enough drugs in development? Or would you think about adding to the pipeline because there's a lot of other NASH drugs out there as well? Thanks. John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: First of all, thank you, Robyn, for those kind words and I'm not sure that I ever thought NASH wasn't a market. I think we've done a lot of digging. We've been doing a lot of early market development work-around NASH, understanding the doctors, the populations, the kinds of diagnostic tests that will be necessary across the different fibrosis scores, trying to really understand what is the best right medical way to get into this area because we're going to have to establish the market, as I think we are likely to be the first drug launched into NASH. So I think we've got a pretty good understanding of the patients. We have a pretty good understanding of the differing opportunities for the F2 through F4 populations, so I think it has a considerable potential to be a big market for the field and for us, and so I think we're pretty confident in that area. You asked about M&A, do we have enough molecules? I would say we never feel like we have enough molecules in any area, which is why we continue to innovate in HIV for more than two decades and why we'll continue to look for things that make sense in combination with or adjacent to our portfolio in NASH. So we're kind of relentless in that area. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Umer Raffat of Evercore. Your line is now open. Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to focus on two things. One, for the ongoing Phase 3 NASH studies, is there an interim of sorts that we should be aware of before the final readouts, first? And then secondly, is there anything we have learned on a blinded basis from the ongoing filgotinib testicular tox studies? Thank you very much. John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Okay. So it's John speaking, and I'll address in terms of the Phase 3 STELLAR trials in NASH, there is no interim analysis. The interim analysis is the endpoint \u2013 one of the interim analyses is the endpoint for approval and the subpart H, which is the week 48 biopsy. The study actually continues for five years. We do have a D&C, of course, that looks at all the safety data regularly. So if there was any obvious safety signal in the risk/benefit change, we would know about that, and so far we've not had any recommendations to change either of those Phase 3 studies in terms of their conduct. In terms of filgotinib and the male safety study, we're enrolling the study it's something that we have to address. We believe our margin is adequate above and beyond the minor histological abnormalities that we're seeing in the pre-clinical models and we'll evaluate the data as it comes in. Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes from Jim Birchenough with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Nick Abbott - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon. It's Nick in for Jim and, John, I'm sure Jim will echo my comments thanking you for your candor and transparency over the years. I have a very specific question as to, relating to the Gadeta deal you did last week. Is your concept here that you're going to be adding in the gamma delta T cell receptors to CAR T or TCRs to give you that sort of bi-specific, or do you see this as a standalone or an additional product? Thank you. John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah, that's a great question. Nick, I think it was if we caught your name. So we believe that it is standalone. We believe that the gamma data TCR constructed or engineered into the alphabeta T cell will have all of the advantages of both, properties of both of those cells which will allow us to explore them individually in terms of both hamartiological and also solid malignancy so that's a very short answer to a very complex question but that will be our initial approach and that is the initial program that we'll collaborate on. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Philip Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. John, let me add my congratulations on a fantastic career that's played a big part in the success of Gilead and strides in the treatment of HIV and HCB. Definitely a job well done. Two questions, first on your pipeline there's an entry in the slides that says the KITE-585 program, we're going to have Phase 1 data in the back half of the year and also a go decision on \u2013 go/no-go decision on a pivotal study. Can you give us some idea of what data we're likely to see and what the hurdle would be to moving it to pivotals? And if I could just sneak in a question on the commercial, briefly, Robin, I think you mentioned that the HIV payer mix was different in Q2 than in the past. What drove that and is that likely to revert to the normal payer mix in the second half of the year? Thanks. John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Okay. So Phil, its John, and I will talk about the KITE-585 program first which is in Phase 1, dose installation, as you know in people with relapse refractory myeloma. So we will see data as we've said on the slides in the second half of this year and then we will make a decision depending on how the data looks compared to the other data that's come out from other similar BCMA products and determine whether we will take it forward into Phase 2 and that's where we are right now. But we see the value in exploring it, in patients with relapsed refractory myeloma, of course. We have cohorts with people with renal impairment as well, which is also important. Many of these people have renal impairment, so we will also be looking at that as well we have a lot of support from the community we have a single-chain variable fragment that's fully humanized as you know and we have activity in low BCMA expressing targets as well so we'll have to wait and see where the Phase 1 data is and we'll make a decision later this year about moving on to the more registrational trial. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from - Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Let me just finish, operator, I think Phil asked one question regarding payer mix in HIV for Q2 that I want to be sure I address. And Phil, to be specific you're right, you recall that \u2013 if you think about our HIV franchise is typically slanted more to the government payer mix driven by the ADAPs, and that's been fairly consistent, there's always a little variability in there, but overall when you think about it, it's typically a mix of 45% commercial and 55% government. In Q2 we saw that mix more equal, i.e., 50-50, so what I was messaging is if you think about the second half of that normalizes, we quantified it to be approximately about $150 million. It's always tough to be exact because it's really based on some reimbursements and remakes that come in, you know, typically after the quarter-ends so we're always estimating, but we just wanted to be cautious and transparent that if that shifts back to what we normally see it could be a slight headwind relative to sequential growth for U.S. HIV. Overall, robust growth year-on-year, it's simply an adjustment between quarters, but very much factored into our guidance and again, it's just a slightly larger tilt relative to that mix than we've typically seen in the past. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from Tyler Van Buren of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Tyler M. Van Buren - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. It sounds like, I want to ask a question on the cellular therapy business and some of the progress that has been made as of late. It sounds like you guys are pretty adequately penetrated in the center, so could you just provide an update on some of the logistics and some of the improvements that have been made as of late? And I know there's some debate over whether freezing the product is beneficial or not and paying on-demand as opposed to having to pay upfront prior to receiving the product and things like that so curious to get your thoughts, thanks. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: That was Jim? John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Tyler. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hi Tyler, maybe I'll start, but I think we can all chime in. Yeah, I mean, we overall are very excited relative to our progress of the Yescarta launch. Our centers, as I mentioned, are on track relative to our coverage. We're focused on bringing additional centers online. And similar to what you said we're really focused on improving the patient flows and just being sure that our centers are focused on our manufacturing process continuing to be excellent and we have good turnaround times. I'd say overall that our commercial performance has been generally consistent with what we've seen in the ZUMA-1 studies, so we're very confident making good progress; remember we've talked about this being a nice, slow and steady launch. I talked in my prepared remarks about us focused on reimbursement. So overall a very good launch and tracking very good relative to expectations. Maybe I'll turn it over to John to talk about some of the other issues you mentioned. John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Tyler, I don't think \u2013 we have an exceptional group of scientists who spend a lot of time thinking about the manufacturing process and how it can be improved so the product has more active greater efficacy, safer and so forth. So as Robin said I'll just reiterate, I mean what we've seen in ZUMA-1 is what we're seeing in clinical practice as well and we are not having a lot of out of specification issues, et cetera. So in terms of freezing products or not freezing products that's not really an issue for this. Products can be frozen if the cells need to be collected and shipped and sent a long distance to somebody that's very remote. Our product could be frozen. That would take an additional day to do. Andrew Cheng, MD, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Perfect. That's a good point, John, for example, for our European patients we will freeze the cells and send them in, so it's not our practice in the United States but it is certainly possible and we have quite a bit of experience doing that. I think you said something about payment on-demand, I just want to reiterate that we take on the cells, we manufacture them and we only charge the patient if that patient gets those cells. So if something happens in the interim, for example, the patient expires then there is no charge to the family. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question, let me also add my congratulations to John on a great run. You'll definitely be missed. Want to follow up on the CAR T front, although it's obviously very early in the launch. Curious about any comments or color you can provide in terms of safety, CRS or neurotox rates that you're seeing in kind of the real-world experience relative to what you saw in the clinical trials. And I'm curious more specifically on whether in the commercial setting these rates have changed at all or been appreciably different for patients based on the receipt of bridging chemotherapy. John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Cory, it's John McHutchison and we actually have scientific advisory board here, all of our Kite development docs were here and we were talking about this and I actually asked them this specific question as to whether they're seeing anything different with the commercial products and so forth and there isn't a difference. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Katherine Xu of William Blair & Company. Your line is now open. Yu Katherine Xu - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, good afternoon. And John, my congratulations to you as well for great achievements at Gilead and also all the best to you on the next phase of career/life. I have a very quick question on the HCV side. So the international sales have been growing. I just want to understand where that growth has come from and how the launch in China is going. And also on the HBV front, B as in boy, what is Gilead's grand strategy there? Thank you. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So maybe, Katherine, I'll take the HCV question. Yeah. You know, we're excited. Epclusa was recently approved in China. I think it's still very early days there, but we're excited about the possibilities outside of Europe and the U.S. We've got also international sales in Japan, Canada, Australia, as well as several countries in Asia and while there are quarterly fluctuations from country to country, I think overall we continue to establish ourselves in those markets, similar to what we have done in the U.S. and Europe. So as you can see, overall we're on track with our guidance, more stability and predictability, and I think with Epclusa, right, which is the only pan-genotypic pan type (01:00:05) product single-tablet regimen out there, I think we're well poised with our portfolio of products to be successful globally with our HCV franchise. John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah. Katherine, it's John again, and just to follow up from Robin, before I answer the hepatitis B strategy question, Epclusa is the simplest regimen to use. It's one duration, as Robin said. You don't need a liver biopsy, you don't need a genotype. So in terms of all the products out there, it's far simpler. And the efficacy is the same as some of the others, as you know. So there's no compromise there. In terms of the grand strategy for hepatitis B, I think it's similar to your notes. We want to be able to attack multiple different mechanisms of viral replication, and we want to be able to augment HBV specific immunity. We have two new programs in the clinic. One is the TLR8 molecule. And the other one is our capsid, also that's in early stages in the clinic. We have now SB92 \u2013 Spring Bank 9200 collaboration in two Phase 2 trials, one with tenofovir and one with TAF. We have many free clinical programs looking at other mechanisms of action also in both of those axises. And of course we have Vemlidy, which is approved and doesn't have any issues with bone or kidneys, as you know, in more than 50 countries. So it's one of our largest internal research programs and we're passionate about trying to create a finite cure for many people, the many millions of people with hepatitis B around the world. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Ying Huang of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. One for maybe Robin. You actually saw a very decent increase in Q2 revenue compared to 1Q, but you did not increase the guidance for the total product sales for the whole year. I want to drill down more on why that is. And then secondly, and maybe for John McHutchison, you mentioned that the filing of FDA application for filgotinib had to wait until you finish the safety study in the UC trial which won't complete enrollment until first half 2019. Does that mean we have to wait until at least second half of next year before you can file for NDA for filgotinib? Thank you. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Sure, Ying. So I'll start. Again, as I mentioned on the call, I think our HIV franchise is firing on all cylinders. It's positioned extremely well to deliver on long-term growth. And when I think about guidance, again, we reiterated our guidance and feel very comfortable with it. But as I mentioned on the call, we do anticipate second half dynamics to be slightly different. So there's nothing new about those dynamics, but we did want to ensure that, you know, that you understood for modeling purposes kind of some of those components. And then, as I said for HIV in the U.S., we may have payer mix shift more to what normally occurs. But other than that, things are very good there. We do have the patent for Letairis in the U.S. which expires at the end of July, so we do anticipate some impact from generics for that product in the U.S. Turning to Europe, generics are available, and we do expect them to become available in a few additional countries. And we have the normal third quarter seasonality in Europe related to summer holidays, and that impacts both our HIV as well as our HCV franchise. And we also have the slow, steady decline of HCV patient starts. So I do want to emphasize that we expect our U.S. HIV prescription growth and revenue growth on a year-on-year basis that continue to be very, very healthy and robust, but we're reiterating our guidance because all those factors that we talked about at the beginning of the year still remain. John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Ying, for the second part of the question in terms of the filgotinib filing time, obviously we'll file as expeditiously as we can. But just let me make three points. First of all, we need safety and efficacy data from three randomized Phase 3 trials and that has to be supportive. Secondly, we need, and as I said today on the prepared comments, we need an adequate safety database in terms of exposure at each stage both for a predetermined range of time. And thirdly, we need to submit data from the male safety study, which is enrolling. And, you know, these are tough studies to do. You've got to have men with ulcerative colitis and they have to be on the drug for six months and have multiple sperm collections. So we're doing everything we can to enhance enrollment and we will announce the details when it's appropriate in terms of the filing time. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Sung Lee for any closing remarks. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Candice, and thank you all for joining us today.

Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Gilead Sciences Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Cherie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Cherie, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the third quarter 2018. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website. The speakers on today's call will be Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Hamill, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Operations; John McHutchison, Chief Scientific Officer and Head of Research and Development; and John Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer. Before we begin with our prepared comments, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website. I will now turn the call over to Robin. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Sung, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to share our financial results for the third quarter of 2018. Before I get into the financial results and commercial highlights for the quarter, I'd like to welcome Laura Hamill, who recently joined Gilead as Executive Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Operations. We are glad to have this key position filled, and are excited to have Laura on our team. Laura is quickly becoming familiar with our business and has already provided significant commercial expertise on several strategic fronts. You'll hear from Laura in a few minutes followed by John McHutchison with an update on our R&D efforts and then John Milligan with a few closing comments. We had very strong execution in the third quarter, during which our HIV franchise achieved record quarterly sales. HCV revenues continued to be more predictable and in line with our expectations, and further progress was made in cell therapy, including the approval of Yescarta in Europe. Total revenues for the third quarter were $5.6 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.84. This compares to total revenues of $6.5 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.27 for the same period last year. Starting with HIV, product sales for the third quarter were $3.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the continued strong uptake of Genvoya and Odefsey, and the rapid adoption of Biktarvy. With 19% year-over-year revenue growth and 11% year-over-year prescription growth, our U.S. HIV business continues to reflect strong underlying demand for Descovy-based regimens, which now account for 74% of Gilead's total U.S. HIV prescription volume. Sequentially, U.S. HIV sales were up 5%, reflecting strong demand for Biktarvy. Payer mix in the third quarter was similar to the second quarter, where it was approximately equally split between private pay and government segments. In the second full quarter since its FDA approval in February, Biktarvy generated $375 million in sales in the U.S., becoming the number one prescribed regimen for both treatment-na\u00efve and switch patients. Biktarvy is on track to overtake Genvoya as the most successful launch in HIV history, as measured by the first 12 months of product sales. Approximately 85% of Biktarvy's U.S. prescriptions came from switches. Of these switches, approximately one quarter came from regimens containing dolutegravir. Truvada for PrEP continued to grow. We estimate that more than 193,000 individuals were taking Truvada for PrEP as we exited the quarter. Early performance indicators for the HIV prevention and Truvada for PrEP television campaigns launched in the second quarter are encouraging. Since the launch of these campaigns, we've seen active engagement with campaign-related websites and a nearly 50% increase in the number of weekly new subscribers compared to the pre-campaign averages earlier in the year. Turning to Europe, HIV sales were down 11% year-over-year, primarily due to the availability of generics in several markets. The decline was partially offset by the continued uptake of our Descovy-based regimens which now comprise approximately 70% of our HIV product revenues in Europe. As anticipated, we saw a sequential decline in sales in the third quarter, primarily due to the additional impact of generics in certain countries and the seasonal impact of holiday schedules in various countries. To date, in some countries, the impact from generics has not been as significant as expected. Since receiving marketing authorization from European Commission in June, Biktarvy has launched in Germany and some of the smaller countries in the EU. In Germany, we are seeing great early uptake where Biktarvy is tracking at least as well as Genvoya for the same period after approval. Also, Biktarvy is already among the top five most prescribed regimens for both treatment-na\u00efve and switch patients, with about a third of the switches coming from dolutegravir-containing regimens. Genvoya remained the number one prescribed regimen for treatment-na\u00efve and switch patients in the EU5 collectively for the sixth consecutive quarter. Turning to HIV (sic) [HCV] (07:29), product sales for the third quarter were $902 million, down 59% year-over-year and down 10% sequentially. To date, our performance in the HCV market continued to align with our expectations of gradual sequential declines with fewer patients seeking treatment. In September, we announced plans to launch authorized generic versions of Epclusa and Harvoni in the United States in January 2019 through a newly created subsidiary, Asegua Therapeutics LLC. The list prices of the authorized generics will be comparable to the current net prices of the branded versions. We believe these authorized generics could reduce out-of-pocket expenses for patients, increase pricing transparency, and open up access to our HCV medicines for patients covered by Medicaid. This solution allows us to quickly introduce a lower-priced alternative to our HCV medications without significant disruption to the healthcare system or our business. Turning to our cell therapy franchise, sales of Yescarta were $75 million for the third quarter, up 10% sequentially. We are pleased with the progress we made with Yescarta since its approval by the U.S. FDA one year ago. We now have 64 centers certified to provide treatment for Yescarta. As we continue to see patient inflows at certified centers, we have also observed variability in volume as some centers enthusiastically embraced this novel therapy and others adopt treatment more slowly. We've turned our focus to working with centers to enhance patient flows. We are also educating community oncologists about cell therapy and how they can connect their patients to cancer centers for appropriate treatment. We expect to see continued demand as our certified centers gain broader experience with Yescarta and community oncologists become increasingly aware of this life-saving therapy. Recently, CMS approved an NTAP, new technology add-on payment, to assist the reimbursement of CAR T therapy within the hospital setting while we await the creation of a CAR T-specific DRG through CMS. We're very encouraged with the speed in which CMS has recognized the value of Yescarta for cancer patients who have run out of treatment options in relapsed/refractory DLBCL. We look forward to working with CMS to create a dedicated DRG code reflective of the value Yescarta brings to patients. As I previously mentioned, Yescarta was approved in the EU towards the end of August. We are working diligently across Europe to certify approximately 20 centers by the end of 2018. We are pleased with the progress and commercial performance seen to date with Yescarta, which is consistent with our expectations. Going forward, we anticipate a steady and measured launch as reimbursement, referrals and center logistics improve to accommodate more patients. Turning to our cardiovascular products, Letairis and Ranexa generated sales of $241 million and $178 million, respectively, in the third quarter. While the U.S. patent for ambrisentan, the active agent in Letairis, expired in July of this year, we have not seen any impact to our sales as a result of the loss of exclusivity because the single-shared REMS program necessary to allow generic ambrisentan to launch has not yet been FDA approved. There is no specific PDUFA date associated with this approval and the timeline for FDA action is unknown. As we look ahead, we anticipate Letairis sales to continue for the remainder of this year. However, sales beyond this timeframe are uncertain. Now turning to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $844 million for the third quarter, up 13% compared to the same period last year. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $852 million for the third quarter, up 6% compared to the same period last year. The increases in both non-GAAP R&D expenses and SG&A expenses were primarily due to higher costs to support the growth of our business following the acquisition of Kite. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the third quarter was 19.9% compared to 25.7% in the same period last year, primarily due to reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate as a result of Tax Reform. On a sequential basis, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was higher compared to the second quarter rate of 13.4% due to a favorable settlement of a tax examination in the second quarter. Moving to our balance sheet, as of September 30, 2018, we had $30.8 billion of cash and investments. During the third quarter, we generated $2.2 billion in operating cash flow, repaid $1.8 billion senior notes upon maturity, paid cash dividends of $742 million, and repurchased approximately 6 million shares of stock for $449 million. The year is progressing consistent with our expectations, with the exception of the durability of Letairis revenues and the lower impact of HIV generics. The combined benefit from these two exceptions is approximately $400 million. Therefore, we are raising our full-year net product sales guidance. Net product sales are expected to be in the range of $20.8 billion to $21.3 billion. Our guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties which are outlined in slide 35 of our earnings call presentation. For the full-year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 18% to 20%. All other components of our guidance remain unchanged. I will now turn the call over to Laura. Laura Hamill - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Robin, and good afternoon. I'm thrilled to be part of the Gilead team and appreciate how welcoming everyone has been during my first six weeks as I'm getting to know the critical success factors for our current and future therapies. I've had the opportunity to learn more about Gilead's portfolio by participating in several therapeutic advisory board meetings, scientific conferences, visiting some of our cancer institutions that are providing treatments with Yescarta, and engaging with many passionate Gilead employees. The commercial and field teams have a deep commitment to support healthcare providers as they meet the needs of patients around the world. It's a privilege to be joining Gilead at this time with the introduction of Yescarta as well as Biktarvy, which is on track for an outstanding launch. We are continuing to shift treatment paradigms. I also want to acknowledge the innovative approach the team has taken in the United States to increase access to our hepatitis C treatments. Next year, our subsidiary, Asegua, will launch authorized generic versions of Harvoni and Epclusa, a medication we believe has a unique clinical profile as a pan-genotypic and pan-fibrotic single-tablet regimen. As we prepare for our next set of launches, we will bring our deep expertise in building new markets, as well as capabilities to compete in existing markets with many therapeutic options. The teams around the world are motivated by Gilead's mission to bring innovative medicine to more than 13 million patients with life-threatening illnesses. I look forward to sharing our commercial progress with you during our next quarterly update, and will now turn the call over to John McHutchison. John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Laura. Welcome, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. I'd like to start by talking about the progress we are making across our later-stage pipeline. As we enter the final quarter of the year and look ahead to 2019, we anticipate readouts from five Phase 3 studies over the next nine months. The American College of Rheumatology Meeting finished yesterday in Chicago. So I'll begin with some commentary about our work in the area of inflammation, starting with filgotinib, which, as you know, is the selective JAK1 inhibitor. Last month we announced positive results from FINCH 2, the first of three Phase 3 studies to readout in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. FINCH 2 compares filgotinib to placebo, each added to conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, or DMARDs in 423 patients who have previously not had an adequate response to biologic therapy. Filgotinib was generally well tolerated and met the study's primary endpoint in terms of the proportion of patients achieving an ACR20 at week 12. In addition, key secondary endpoints, including ACR50 and ACR70 responses and the rates of low disease activity and clinical remission were all higher with filgotinib compared to placebo. Importantly for these endpoints, we also noted a dose dependency as efficacy rates were numerically higher with the 200 milligram once daily dose of filgotinib compared to the 100 milligram daily dose. The initial readout of the first Phase 3 data adds to our excitement about the potential of filgotinib, obviously. We expect results from two other Phase 3 studies of filgotinib, FINCH 1 and FINCH 3, to be available in the first quarter of next year, and if supported by the data, to form the basis of our filings for regulatory approvals globally. As a reminder, FINCH 1 is a 52-week randomized study comparing both doses of filgotInib, plus methotrexate to adalimumab plus methotrexate and to methotrexate alone in patients who have previously had an inadequate response to methotrexate. FINCH 3 is a 52-week randomized study comparing filgotinib alone to methotrexate alone and to the combination of filgotinib plus methotrexate in methotrexate-na\u00efve patients. Now our ability to file the NDA for filgotinib is dependent on data from the MANTA study. As you may recall, MANTA is a safety study in men with ulcerative colitis that was requested by the FDA and is designed to address non-clinical findings observed in preclinical animal studies. Because our Phase 3 FINCH trials have enrolled more rapidly than anticipated, enrollment in MANTA will likely be the rate limiting factor to filing an NDA in the United States. While we have been making every effort to expedite enrollment, the full impact of the efforts and their impact on the overall timeline are uncertain at this time. Results from the EQUATOR study, a Phase 2 trial of filgotinib in 131 adults with active psoriatic arthritis were presented this week at ACR in a plenary session and concurrently published in The Lancet. The study also achieved its primary endpoint of improvement in the signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis at week 16. The study demonstrated an impressive ACR20 response of 80% to filgotinib 200 milligrams daily versus 33% for placebo. The ACR50 and ACR70 responses were also significantly higher for filgotinib compared to placebo. Based upon the strength of these data, we are excited to be initiating plans for our Phase 3 program and are enthusiastic about what this may mean for people living with psoriatic arthritis and whose disease is not responded to prior treatments. Last month we announced that filgotinib met its primary efficacy endpoint in the Phase 2 TORTUGA study in adults with moderately to severely active ankylosing spondylitis. Patients treated with filgotinib achieved significantly greater improvement in the ankylosing spondylitis disease activity score at week 12 compared to placebo. These results which were also published in The Lancet this week compare favorably to those seen with other known DMARDs commonly known to treat ankylosing spondylitis patients. We'll determine the next steps for the program in the coming months. Finally in the inflammation therapeutic area, I'm pleased to share that a Phase 2 study evaluating three investigational therapies, filgotinib; GS-9876, a Syk inhibitor; and tirabrutinib, a BTK inhibitor in patients with active Sjogren's syndrome has fully enrolled 140 patients. Now turning to HIV, we presented 96-week data at IDWeek in San Francisco earlier this month from an ongoing Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Biktarvy for the treatment of HIV infection in treatment-na\u00efve adults. The data at two years confirmed the efficacy and safety profile of Biktarvy and showed that Biktarvy continued to be well tolerated with no cases of treatment-emergent resistance. Moving on to liver diseases, The Liver Meeting will be held in San Francisco early next month where we will present data from more than 50 abstracts across our programs in NASH, primary sclerosing cholangitis, hepatitis B and hepatitis C. In NASH, we are advancing multiple investigational compounds for the treatment of advanced fibrosis, that is patients with Stage 3 and Stage 4 fibrosis. Individuals with these advanced stages of fibrosis are at a significantly higher risk of liver-related mortality. The data being presented further characterize the potential role of three compounds we have in development : our FXR agonist, GS-9674; our ASK1 inhibitor, selonsertib; and our ACC inhibitor, GS-0976. We will also present baseline data from the STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4, our two ongoing Phase 3 trials evaluating selonsertib as monotherapy that describe the potential role and sequence of non-invasive tests and their ability to diagnose advanced fibrosis. Currently, liver biopsy, which is the standard method to diagnose advanced fibrosis, poses challenges to timely and efficient diagnosis and treatment of patients with this disease. Before we move on from NASH, I'd like to remind you that we anticipate data readouts from STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4 in the first half of 2019. We are also pleased to share that the Phase 2b ATLAS study of various combination two-drug regimen in patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis has now closed screening. We are presenting data from a Phase 2 trial evaluating our FXR agonist in primary sclerosing cholangitis. This is a rare serious disease that causes progressive inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts which can lead to cirrhosis and its complications, including liver failure. There are currently no effective treatment options available for these patients. And finally at The Liver Meeting, we will also share data from Gilead's ongoing programs directed at achieving functional cure of chronic hepatitis B infected patients. GS-9688, an investigational oral selective toll-like receptor 8 agonist is the subject of several studies to be presented, including the first in human, and Phase 1b results evaluating the drug in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Turning to cell therapy, we continue to make great scientific progress also during the quarter. In August, we announced that European Commission granted Marketing Authorization for Yescarta as a treatment for adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, after two or more lines of systemic therapy. We are making progress in reaching patients with other forms of B-cell malignancies also, with Yescarta and KTE-X19. Registrational Phase 2 trials are ongoing with Yescarta in relapsed and refractory indolent NHL or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and with KTE-X19 in relapsed and refractory mantle cell lymphoma and adult ALL. We expect to announce additional data and trial updates from our cell therapy program at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, ASH, which begins December 1 in San Diego. We will share more information with you next month when those meeting abstracts are published. Separately in oncology, we discontinued the development of andecaliximab, an investigational anti-MMP9 antibody, in gastric cancer, after a Phase 3 study showed a lack of overall survival benefit to primary endpoint. These data are consistent with the results we're seeing with andecaliximab in other therapeutic programs. We continue to pursue additional technologies and approaches that will allow us to remain the leader in cell therapy. Earlier this month, we announced another research collaboration and license agreement with HiFiBiO Therapeutics to develop technologies supporting the discovery of neoantigen-reactive T cell receptors for the potential treatment of various cancers, particularly solid tumors. Through this collaboration, we intend to adapt HiFiBiO's proprietary single-cell technology platform to create a high throughput approach that will potentially allow for in-depth screening of TCR repertoires from patient samples to identify both shared antigen and neoantigen TCRs for use in adoptive T cell therapy. Neoantigens arise from tumor-specific mutations that are unique to each patient's cancer, offering the potential for more targeted anti-tumor activity. This area of research has the potential to transform the way we might be able to treat many solid tumors. I would like to also note that these kinds of scientific collaborations are not limited to cell therapy. In September, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Precision BioSciences to develop therapies targeting the in vivo elimination of HBV or hepatitis B virus with Precision's proprietary genome editing platform, ARCUS. We are committed to developing therapies that achieve a functional cure for patients with chronic hepatitis B virus. We are excited about the potential of genome editing and Precision's ARCUS technology, which has already demonstrated promising in vitro activity. We have achieved a great deal across our R&D organization this quarter, and I am confident we will continue to make significant progress throughout the rest of the year. I'm excited about the strength and diversity of our pipeline, as described today, the breakthrough work we are doing in cell therapy and the cutting-edge research we are doing to advance curative therapies, both for hepatitis B and HIV-infected patients. I want to take the opportunity to thank our R&D organization and all of our employees for their incredible focus, hard work and execution. So, thank you all, and now I'd like to turn the call over to John Milligan. John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, John. Good afternoon, everyone. As we approach the end of the year and head into 2019, we have many reasons to feel confident about the strength of our business and the future of our company. Our long-term leadership in HIV continues. We're having a terrific launch with Biktarvy, which is exceeding our high expectations and is on track to become the most successful ever in HIV through the first year of sales. We also have compelling evidence correlating the use of Truvada for PrEP with declines in new infections in the United States, further demonstrating its importance as an effective, public health intervention in the ongoing efforts to meaningfully decrease new infections. While great progress has been made in both treatment and prevention over the last two decades, we believe there is still plenty of room for innovation in HIV. We are pursuing research that could help patients who have run out of options as a result of viral resistance or who may need less frequent dosing than afforded by a daily pill. And finally, we hope that our research may one day help lead to a cure, completely removing the virus from patients once and for all, as we did for patients in HCV. In HCV, we continue to innovate to expand access and support efforts toward elimination of the virus from the human population. In January, just over five years after the launch of Sovaldi, our newly-formed subsidiary, Asegua, will launch authorized generic versions of Epclusa and Harvoni in the United States. We believe this will help reduce out-of-pocket expenses for many patients, increase price transparency and open up access to our HCV medicines for patients covered by Medicaid, without disruption to the broader healthcare environment. One year after the acquisition of Kite, Gilead is the leader in cell therapy and Yescarta access for people with relapsed/refractory DLBCL is now established in over 60 centers in the United States. Yescarta has shown an unprecedented duration of response in clinical studies, and we have now treated nearly 700 patients across clinical trials and commercial use. The high percentage of patients showing a durable response following the single cellular fusion gives us a glimpse into the potential of cellular therapy to radically change the cancer treatment paradigm in the future, perhaps across many different tumor types. Over the last year, we have established six technology product-based partnerships that will allow us to build on our leadership position in cell therapy and transform the treatment of cancer. We have a maturing pipeline and are now beginning to see the first of many Phase 3 readouts of filgotinib in inflammation. We are pleased that the efficacy and safety of filgotinib looks to be consistent with the datasets from the long-term Phase 2 studies and believe filgotinib shows great promise to help patients in a number of different indications. Finally, Gilead has dedicated enormous resources to understanding the biology and pathology of NASH. These efforts are paying off with three compounds in the clinic, including an extensive array of Phase 2 combination studies. Next year, we'll see the first Phase 3 readouts of selonsertib as the STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4 clinical studies are completed and unblinded. We look forward to seeing the data, and our teams are hard at work preparing for the launch of selonsertib into this brand new disease area. The work of Gilead goes on, even as I prepare to depart at the end of the year. To everyone who has supported us in our mission over the years, thank you. I have every confidence in my team's ability to continue the work of bringing forward therapeutics that dramatically improve lives. To Gilead's more than 11,000 employees, I also want to thank you. It's been a privilege to be your leader for the last three years and to work with you for the last 29. It's been deeply gratifying to be part of a company that has brought life-saving treatments to 10 million people around the globe. I look forward to watching the continued evolution of Gilead and the extraordinary things I know you will accomplish. So, let's open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, today's question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. Our first question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the question. John, really will miss your leadership and I want to add congrats also to Laura on the new role. Laura Hamill - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just had a few on HIV. If you guys could give any more perspective on switches to Biktarvy, beyond dolutegravir, are you seeing switches from generic regimens as well? And then on PrEP, I know you don't have data yet, but what's the initial thought on positioning for Descovy over Truvada and how do you think that plays out following the Truvada LOE? Thank you. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So, in terms of the switches, Geoff, as I mentioned, we are seeing that the majority of the Biktarvy prescriptions are coming from switches, about 85% to be exact. And approximately a quarter of those are coming from dolutegravir-containing regimens. There is also about 25% coming from Genvoya as well. So (35:57) balance. Then the latter half of your question, Geoff, if you can repeat it? Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Descovy for PrEP. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Oh, Descovy for PrEP. (36:05), John. John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yes. John here. Look, the question of Descovy versus Truvada for PrEP, people who are healthy, which the people who are taking PrEP are, deserve and want the easiest and safest and best tolerated medication. So, that is Descovy. So I think that's a pretty straightforward answer to that question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. On filgotinib with the Phase 3 starting to rollout, I was wondering if you could provide your latest views on what you see is the key differentiating features or indications, and maybe walk us through your latest plans in how you're thinking about building out a commercial infrastructure in inflammation, particularly with some of the new leadership now in place. Thanks. John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So I'll start first. So, after attending ACR this week and being at the meeting, it's clear that the efficacy that we are generating in multiple inflammatory diseases with filgotinib is as good or if not better than any other drug in the class, and equivalent to the biologics. And that holds true for FINCH 2 where we just saw the most difficult patients to treat, the biologic non-responders, inadequate responder patients where our ACR20 rates in people who had received three or more biologics previously was over 70%, just over 70%. So, I think efficacy wise, we are as good if not better than anything else out there in the class. Safety wise, we continue to see the differentiation based upon the lab parameters, the lack of anemia, the lack of effect on platelets and when we look at other clinical events such as thromboembolic events and other events, we are not seeing anything difference. We have to see that safety benefit and advantage hold up in the subsequent Phase 3 clinical programs. The same as the other diseases. We are seeing those benefits as well. So, I'll hand it over to the other folks about the commercial build out, et cetera. Laura Hamill - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So, hi. This is Laura. I would say on the commercial structure, we will build a commercial field team that is competitive across all indications and as you know, we are aware of the investment that's necessary to compete in this market and we will be reaching consumers in innovative ways to make sure that they are aware of the profile that we'll be able to bring to the market to help them. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Appreciate the question. And, John, I'm sure we all heard the emotion in the voice, so we appreciate all the work you've done and for all the years. I guess my question is, it feels like the Street has two uncertainties; one is a bit on hep C and one is, I guess, to an extent, an update on the new leadership that would give people confidence going forward. Perhaps you can give a comment as to your confidence around the U.S. hep C market stabilizing and whether there's any changes and how did authorized generic helps that, if at all. And then if you can make a comment on where we stand on the leadership change, I think that would help people as well. Thanks. John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah, hi, Michael. So let's just \u2013 talking about the U.S. hep C market, what we have seen through the course of the year is a fairly stable pricing environment but, of course, declining patient numbers, particularly in the commercial markets and to some extent the Medicare markets. So we think the authorized generic will actually boost us for the future because number one, it provides more transparency, which is good for everybody. It will take away some of the pain of the co-pays that are provided, especially into the Medicare population. But most importantly, it'll open up access for us into the Medicaid population, which is the largest growing segment of patients for the future. So we think that all this will enhance our ability to compete for the future and really help stabilize this market going into 2019 and beyond. So all-in-all, a very positive thing for us. With regard to the CEO search, I really can't say anything specific, other than to say there are many candidates who are very interested. The process is moving along quickly, and we certainly hope to have somebody announced before the end of the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I had one related to some of the Kite programs. I noticed in the slides you indicated that you'd be making a decision on your BCMA CAR, whether to move into a registrational study in the fourth quarter. I'm just wondering what data you're waiting for to make that decision and how you're going to communicate that decision. Thanks. John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Sure. Hi, Michael. John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Matt, this is Matt. John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Matt, sorry. Look, yes, it's unchanged. We are waiting for data from the Phase 1b trial, which is looking at escalating dose cohorts of the safety and efficacy in myeloma patients of KITE-585. And then we'll announce the start of a Phase 2 trial if the data supports that. So no change to what we've said previously and we're in the process of that right now. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges with Leerink. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thank you very much. And, John, I just want to congratulate you on all the accomplishments over those 29 years. I'm sure if you have any free time, John McHutchison might lend you his AO (42:13) for a bit of travel. I just wanted to ask John McHutchison a little bit about a couple of pipeline contingencies. First, you mentioned the MANTA study. And obviously, you'll have the three FINCH studies by the \u2013 in the first half of the year. Is it possible that, that filing could be delayed until 2020? Or is there any way you could start filing with the clinical data and then append the MANTA data to the filing? And then secondly, will you have a chance to look at the interim data from the combination NASH study and then potentially contemplate pivotal trials to some combination earlier than the 48-week data? Thanks. John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah. John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Geoff. Starting with MANTA, great question. We have spent an inordinate amount of effort trying to enhance the enrollment in the MANTA study. It's too early to gauge the effectiveness of those modifications to inclusion criteria, et cetera. I think we'll provide an update in the future when we can have more clarity about the timeline. I will say we are having discussions internally and with regulators about different options, as one of which you outlined as well. And as you know in various parts of the world, you can file and you can file updates at various different times of the review process. So each region and each area is different. So we're having all of these discussions and spending a lot of my effort and a lot of the team's effort on that as well. In terms of the ATLAS, your second question, in terms of the ATLAS Phase 2b 350 patient NASH combination study, yes, we will take a look at week 24. And week 24 look we're allowed to do in the statistical analysis plan. It's not biopsy-driven and it's driven by MRA FibroScan, lab tests, MRI-PDFF. So we will be able to have a look. And if there's clear separation without biopsy, we can decide to move early into Phase 3 if we're convinced that's the right thing to do. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Citi. Greg Harrison - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. This is Greg Harrison on for Robyn. Thank you for taking the question. So in hep B, given the Arrowhead data we've seen recently, do you think that you need an S antigen component in your combos? Or are you satisfied with what you have internally? John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: I don't think we're ever satisfied with what we have internally. And we have a number of internal programs that are looking at interfering in S in various different ways, either by direct mechanisms or through induction of HBV-specific immunity. And we are also always looking for what we think is additionally valuable to what we are doing internally, externally as well. We are watching the siRNA field closely also and aware of what Arrowhead's done. We look forward to seeing the data presented in full at AASLD. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore. Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And John, wanted to extend our congratulations on all of your's and Gilead's success over the years. My question was perhaps two-fold. One, going forward for the new CEO, is there specific expectations that the board has set? May that be on specific M&A targets, dollar size, number of transactions? Just wanted to get a flavor for the direction for the company and board's expectations. And then secondly on CAR T, we heard your commentary on the variability in adoption. And my question is, Street has a 50% growth over the next four quarters for Yescarta franchise. And given how important a launch it is, my question is, do you remain confident in that type of growth trajectory? John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So first let me start with the specific criteria for a new CEO. No, that's not typically how things are done. There are conversations and looking at different strategies that a new CEO could bring to Gilead. But, no, there are no specific targets or directions that were given by the board. So secondly, and question about CAR T is a good one. So if you think about CAR T and you think about the shift in paradigm that has to occur in a treatment center to adopt it, it requires lots of collaboration across multiple departments. It requires novel ways of thinking about billing and treating patients. And it takes time for these centers to come up to speed. The centers that were early adopters of CAR T and are still the biggest users of Yescarta, have a lot of experience and have kind of worked out the treatment, and frankly, business paradigm of cellular therapy. And that's where we're seeing the majority of our success today. The middle adopters and now the late adopters are the groups that are really trying to figure out how to make this work within their institution and how to make this business model work for their hospital in particular and that can take some time. So what we would expect is that as these centers start to treat, as they work out how to build the commercial plans, as they figure out how to get reimbursement for Medicare patients, this will grow over time. And, of course, we'll see some centers that have greater adoption and some that have less. So, I do think that with the data that are emerging on CAR T with the growing body of evidence that a high percentage of patients can have very durable responses, this is something that will grow to become of importance in all 60 centers that we're in. But it is going to take some time to get the growth rate that we need. I won't comment to any specifics. But I am very confident that as we get better at this, as the medical practice gets better, as we get better at managing some of the side effects around this, and then importantly in the future, as we get a DRG code, this will grow into a very important business for Gilead. And it will be very, very important for patients who have run out of options. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald. Alethia Young - Cantor Fitzgerald : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on Biktarvy. And John, you certainly will be missed and we truly enjoyed seeing your leadership over such a long tenure. I guess I have a question on HIV and generics in Europe. You said obviously you've seen some impact and there actually have been some countries where you haven't thought \u2013 you thought you would see impact and didn't. So, can you talk a little bit more about those certain dynamics there? Thanks. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Sure, Alethia. Congrats on your new role as well. Yeah, we continue to see adoption of generics across Europe. I think what we're seeing is differentiation across the different countries relative to timing and the uptake of generics. We talked about the uptake of Descovy. That continues to go really well and we think that's thwarting some of that uptake. Particularly in Italy and UK, we're just not seeing the uptake of generics as quickly as we thought they would take hold. And that's something that we've factored into our guidance to the tune of $100 million. I think even in 2019, we'll continue to see uptakes of generics but with the launch of Biktarvy, et cetera, we think we'll be well competitively positioned and think all the benefits of Descovy will help us to continue to grow share in our ex-U.S. markets. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. John, let me add my congratulations on all that you've accomplished and best of luck on your next act. My question is on the guidance. It looks like that even at the top end of the guidance, you're projecting a sequentially down quarter in Q4. I'm curious to get a little bit more information on what elements do you think are going to have a quarter-over-quarter decline? Is that HCV? Is that EU HIV? Any information you could give us would be appreciated. Thanks. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Sure, Phil. I won't go \u2013 again, we kind of gave a base of our guidance. First, let me just say we're really very satisfied with how the year has gone and the ability to raise guidance at this point. Everything that we've talked about from HIV being a growth franchise to HCV stabilizing, Yescarta continuing to have a nice slow and steady build, I mean I think overall, all of our franchises are performing very well. There's a couple of dynamics. You mentioned a few. One HCV, as we said, while stabilizing, we do continue to see declines in patient starts because that's the primary driver. Recall we talked last quarter about a price freeze for the next six months, which if you think about a typical Q4, we sometimes see inventory build in Q4 in advance of that price increase. And I'm not saying we won't have any inventory build, some of that is just part of supply chain, but we do anticipate that there may be a little less. And as I mentioned, the other driver of our raise in guidance was Letairis and the LOE, which is here. We haven't seen any impacts. That could happen, right. So we are providing a range of guidance but we're very confident with our ability to meet the guidance and hope to overachieve it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess first to John, congrats again on a really great run. So I guess my question is on Biktarvy on the heels of another really impressive quarter for the product. I'm just curious if there was any meaningful contribution from inventory build or any other type of one-time item? Or is this really all just demand-driven? Thanks. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Hi, Cory. Great question. No, our sequential growth was all demand driven. We didn't see really any change in inventory and as you're probably recalling last quarter, I talked about the fact that we were at a 50/50 payer mix between commercial and government and there was the chance that that would have shifted back to what we've traditionally seen, 45% commercial, 55% government. But we didn't see that. And these payer mix percentages do fluctuate quarter-to-quarter really depending on the buying patterns from government payers, such as ADAP. So, overall, a strong demand-driven quarter for Biktarvy and HIV overall, no impact from inventory or payer mix. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a couple of follow-ups on Biktarvy and the TAF portfolio. First, can you just comment on European pricing dynamics for Biktarvy now that you're a little bit further in and maybe help us think about that heading into 2019? And then can you guys disclose total TAF volume in Europe right now? I know you give us that for the U.S., but just wondering where it stands in Europe? Thank you. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Yeah, Terence, it's hard to talk about volume because of generics. We do talk about TAF or Descovy based as a percentage of revenue, and it's about 70% of revenues in U.S. Pricing really hasn't been a barrier, keep in mind we price \u2013 our Descovy regimens are pretty much priced similar to Stribild, et cetera, in the way of (54:39) Biktarvy. So it's really been good overall uptake. I think we'll always see competitiveness in European pricing, but that's something that we're used to. So, it really fundamentally has been just the desire from more and more patients who want to move to Descovy-based regimens that has been driving our performance offset by the adoption of generics. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats to John as well. So, first one on Yescarta, I think, Robin, you mentioned that now you do have this new technology add-on payment. I was wondering how much that helps the adoption for Yescarta under that? And how much is this financial loss is actually stopping the centers from adopting Yescarta? And then secondly, we noticed that you have exclusive status with Express Scripts for 2019 and Mavyret from AbbVie was excluded. Does that mean there is additional pricing concessional rebate provided by Gilead? Thank you. Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So, let me start with the prior question, Ying. I think as always is our case, we are always working and negotiating with payers. I can't talk specifically to the details of the contract, but we are happy that we have reached the formulary ranking with Express Scripts, and it's something that we've talked all about that we continue to be out there competing in this marketplace. There's us and Mavyret, and we continue to do well. I think to your other question relative to Yescarta, yeah, the NTAP as I said, it's a start. As we understand it, it's about 50% of reimbursement. To sit and tell you what every hospital makes or doesn't make, that's very hard for me to comment on. That's very dependent on their relationship with the payers, et cetera. So, I can't give you more details on that. I do think the NTAP is a start, and we are working very, very diligently and hard to continue to show the value of this treatment, and hopefully eventually see DRG specifics for CAR T therapy. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from Steven Seedhouse with Raymond James. Steven Seedhouse - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Just on NASH, understanding the hope is obviously that both STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4 succeed. I'm curious if there is a viable filing strategy or path forward for either monotherapy or combination therapies for selonsertib in basically refined fibrosis subset of NASH patients if one of those two Phase 3 trial hits the primary endpoint or have you designed the clinical program such that both Phase 3 trials need to work to move selonsertib forward? Thank you. John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: So, it's a good question regarding the STELLAR programs, and I think the answer to your question lies in the STELLAR programs where our discussions with regulators were around both trials independently, but I think everybody understands that a third of patients with F3 really have F4, and a third of patients with F4 have F3. So, if for example there was a situation where one trial was positive and one trial was negative, we would be able to look at different subgroups of patients, but that would be a completely unscripted discussion that would just depend on what the data looked like at that time. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Sung Lee for any closing remarks. Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.: Thank you, Cherie and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead, and the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on our future progress. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sung Lee : Thank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the fourth quarter 2018. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website. The speakers on today\u2019s call will be : Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Hamill, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Operations; and John McHutchison, Chief Scientific Officer and Head of Research and Development; also in the room is Gregg Alton, Interim CEO and Chief Patient Officer. Before we begin with our prepared comments, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the Company\u2019s underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website. I will now turn the call over to Robin. Robin Washington : Thank you, Sung, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to share our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 and provide 2019 guidance. I will first review financials followed by comments from Laura and John. 2018 was a year filled with accomplishments where we met our financial and operational goals. Beginning with our HIV franchise, we extended our leadership position and grew the business to an all-time high in product revenue. We continue to execute and maximize our opportunity in HCV and initiated a plan to launch authorized generics this year, which should keep us very competitive in a durable long-term market. In cell therapy, we made tremendous progress in the number of centers authorized, and saw the steady and measured adoption of Yescarta in the U.S. and the approval of Yescarta in Europe. We advanced our pipeline and finished the year with a strong balance sheet that will enable us to continue to execute on M&A and partnerships to drive future growth. Turning to the financials. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $5.8 billion, with non-GAAP earnings of $1.44. This compares to revenue of $5.9 billion with non-GAAP earnings of $1.78 per share for the same period last year. For the full year 2018, total revenues were $22.1 billion, down 15% year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings were $6.67 per share for the year, down from $8.84 per share for the full year 2017. The full year 2018 GAAP diluted earnings of $4.17 per share included an unfavorable impact of $0.98 per share due to an impairment charge for in-processed research and development for the KITE-585 anti-BCMA program for the treatment of multiple myeloma and a non-cash tax charge related to intangible assets acquired from Kite. Now turning to our product sales. Product sales for the fourth quarter were $5.7 billion, up 4% sequentially and down 3% year-over-year. For the full year, product sales were $21.7 billion, down 16% year-over-year driven by lower HCV sales. In the U.S., product sales for the quarter were $4.5 billion, up 8% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. This marks the first quarter in several years where U.S. product sales grew year-over-year as the revenue growth of our HIV franchise more than offset the market dynamics of our HCV franchise. While demand, particularly for Biktarvy and Truvada for prep, was a driver of sequential growth, the quarter also benefited from seasonal inventory purchases and a favorable payer mix. These two factors contributed an estimated incremental $250 million to the sequential performance. In Europe, product sales for the quarter were $813 million, down 7% sequentially and 29% year-over-year. The sequential and year-over-year declines were anticipated and included the full quarter impact and launch of generic HIV products in certain markets, as well as an accounting adjustment related to statutory revenue call back reserves. Now turning to the expenses for the full year 2018. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold were $300.6 billion, up 5% compared to $3.4 billion in 2017. The increase was caused by a $410 million reserve on unfavorable $0.31 EPS impact, primarily for excess Harvoni inventory due to a shift in demand to Epclusa. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $3.5 billion and non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $3.6 billion, both expense categories increased by 7% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to a full year of investments to support the growth of our business following the acquisition of Kite. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the full year 2018 decreased to 19.8% compared to 24.5% in the same period last year, primarily due to reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate as a result of tax reform, and the favorable impact of a tax settlement. Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $8.4 billion in cash from operations for the full year 2018, and $2.3 billion for the quarter. We ended the year with $31.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. During 2018, we repaid $6.3 billion of debt, the majority of which was related to our acquisition of Kite, and paid cash dividends of $3 billion. In 2018, we repurchased 40 million shares for $2.9 billion. In Q4, we made opportunistically purchases of approximately 14 million shares for $962 million, resulting in a reduction of diluted shares outstanding at year-end. Earlier today, we announced an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.57 to $0.63 per share, which will become effective in the first quarter of 2019. This represents the fourth consecutive year of double-digit increases to the dividend and underscores our confidence in the strength of the business and future cash flows. In 2019, our capital allocation priorities will remain the same with a focus on M&A and partnerships to augment our pipeline, followed by dividends and share repurchases. Before I provide details for our full year 2019 guidance, I would like to highlight aspects of 2018 performance as illustrated on Slide 20, which will impact the anticipated level of product revenue growth in 2019 relative to 2018. In October, during our Q3 earnings announcement, we increased our 2018 full year product revenue guidance due to two unanticipated events. Our second half 2018 revenues did not reflect the entry of a generic version of Letairis in the U.S., as expected when we issued our original guidance at the beginning of 2018. Secondly, we saw the entry of generic versions of our HIV products occurred later in certain ex-U.S. countries than we had originally expected. It is important to keep these events in mind as our 2019 revenue performance unfold as they will have an impact on the level of product revenue growth in the year. Turning to guidance. Our 2019 non-GAAP financial guidance is summarized on Slides 19 through 23 in the earnings presentation available on our corporate website. Product sales are expected to be in the range of $21.3 billion to $21.8 billion. This guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties, including slower than anticipated growth in our HIV franchise in larger than anticipated shifting payer mix to more highly discounted payer segment such as PHS, SSS, Medicaid and the VA. Lower than expected market share and greater price erosion resulting from the sale of generic versions of TDF, the fixed dose combination of FTC, TDF and the fixed dose combination of FTC, TDF, efavirenz. The accuracy of our assumptions about HCV market share, the accuracy of our estimates for HCV patients starts in 2019, unanticipated pricing pressures from payers and competitors, as well as volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, which could be plus or minus $300 million for each 10% change relative to our assumptions. Non-GAAP product gross margins are expected to be in the range of 85% to 87%. We expect our non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion, and include investments to prepare for commercial launches in NASH and inflammation. For the full year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. We anticipate the full year diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related stock-based compensation and other expenses to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.50 per share. As we look towards Q1 2019, we anticipate total Gilead product sales will decline sequentially by a percentage similar to what we\u2019ve seen over the past two years, which was in the range of 12% to 14%, primarily driven by the U.S. seasonal inventory patterns and buying patterns of public payers that negatively impact payer mix. Also a factor into the Q1 sequential decline as a step-down in price for our HCV drugs sold into U.S. Medicare. Despite this anticipated sequential decline in total product sales in Q1, I want to underscore our confidence in the health of our worldwide HIV business, from which we expect double-digit year-on-year growth again in 2019. I would now turn the call over to Laura. Laura Hamill : Thank you, Robin. Good afternoon, everyone. I will provide an update on our commercial performance during the fourth quarter, and here are some highlights from markets around the world. Beginning with HIV, we achieved an all-time high in quarterly revenues. This speaks to the appeal of our Descovy-based regimen led by Biktarvy, the growing use of Truvada for PrEP and our ability to execute commercially. In the U.S., total HIV revenue was $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 30% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter. Year-over-year growth was driven by a 13% increase to prescription and also benefited from an inventory purchases and favorable payer mix mentioned earlier by Robin. We continue to see strong adoption of Descovy-based regimens, which accounted for 77% of Gilead\u2019s total U.S. HIV prescription volume as we ended the fourth quarter. This is a remarkable achievement considering the first Descovy-based regimen was introduced just three years ago. Through its first 11 months, Biktarvy remains the best HIV launch of all time in the U.S. as measured by total prescriptions on a launch-aligned basis. During the fourth quarter, Biktarvy generated $551 million in revenue in the U.S. and is the number one prescribed regimen for both treatment-na\u00efve and switch patients. Approximately 80% of Biktarvy\u2019s U.S. prescriptions came from switches, 25% of these switches from dolutegravir and another 25% coming from Genvoya. This is a testament to the profile of Biktarvy, its strong efficacy and no identified cases of treatment emergent resistance at week 96 in our Phase 3 studies. Biktarvy provides the renal and bone safety advantages offered by Descovy backbone with minimal drug to drug interactions. These are important considerations for an aging HIV population and for younger patients on lifelong treatment. Moving to prevention. Truvada for PrEP continues to grow as we invest in the U.S. to raise awareness among at-risk individuals and treating physicians. We estimate that approximately 202,000 people were taking Truvada for PrEP at the end of the fourth quarter in 2008. We initiated two direct consumer campaigns in mid-2008, and have dedicated team of therapeutic specialist focused on Truvada for PrEP. Additionally, we have a number of commercial programs aimed at helping populations, disproportionately impacted by HIV, where utilization of Truvada for PrEP is low. While these investments has helped increase awareness, there is still so much more we can do. The CDC estimates that 1.1 million people in the U.S. could benefit from PrEP. Now turning to Europe. Total HIV revenue was $511 million in the fourth quarter, down 21% year-over-year and down 13% quarter-over-quarter. This decline was driven by the expected availability of generics across all major EU countries. During 2018, we experienced slower erosion of the HIV franchise due to later generic entry in a few countries, while at the same time, we saw rapid uptake of our Descovy-based products, which accounted for more than 80% of our total HIV revenue in Europe for the fourth quarter. We are encouraged by the strong uptake of Biktarvy in Germany and in France. In Germany, Biktarvy was number one prescribed regimen for both treatment-na\u00efve and switch patients during the fourth quarter. And in France, just six weeks after launch, Biktarvy was among the top five regiments for switch patients. We anticipate by mid-year, Biktarvy will also launch in Spain, Italy and the UK. Once Biktarvy is broadly reimbursed and entrenched in the market, we believe our European HIV business will stabilize and return to growth. Now, turning to HCV. Product sales for the fourth quarter were $738 million, down 51% year-over-year and 18% quarter-over-quarter, in line with the guidance we provided in 2018. As previously announced, authorized generic version of Epclusa and Harvoni have become available in the U.S. this quarter through Asegua Therapeutics LLC, a separate subsidiary. We expect to see a positive impact on sharing Medicaid markets during the second half of 2019. Over the long-term, we anticipate the adoption of these authorized generics will allow us to be more competitive in a rapidly growing Medicaid segment. In 2018, we launched a new direct-to-consumer campaign highlighting Epclusa as a pan-genotypic, pan-fibrotic single-tablet regimen. Epclusa has the right profile to address the broadest population in HCV. As a leading liver company, we remain fully committed to serving patients with HCV, contributing to the elimination of the disease and competing with a great deal of confidence based on the profiles of our HCV products. Turning to Yescarta. We are building on the momentum generated by the two year real world data presented at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting. This year, we expect to steadily and measurably progress in the U.S. and in Europe and potentially see a doubling of our revenue for Yescarta Carta, as centers gain experience and community oncologist become increasingly aware of this life saving therapy. We now have 68 centers in the U.S. certified to provide treatment with Yescarta. In Europe, we are encouraged by the early stages of our launch. We have treated commercial patients in the UK and in Germany and we have activated sites in France. In total, we have authorized 12 centers and look forward to additional centers coming online this quarter. We are pleased with the engagement of countries across EU markets, wanting to rapidly offer Yescarta. Finally, our U.S. cardiopulmonary team continues to deliver impressive results. Letairis and Ranexa revenue totaled $431 million for the quarter. We did not see any generic competition for Letairis in the fourth quarter. We currently anticipate the entry of generics in the second quarter of 2019. We began the year from a position of strength. I would like to thank the teams around the world for their incredible efforts. With a continued focus on our outstanding portfolio of products and operational excellence, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our 2019 goals. Now, I will turn the call over to John. John McHutchison : Thank you, Laura, and thank you everyone for joining us today. As you know, this is a very exciting time for Gilead\u2019s R&D organization. We anticipate readouts from five Phase 3 clinical trials in the first half of this year. I will talk briefly about those studies, provide an update on our cell therapy and oncology programs and then close with some thoughts on 2019. We expect upcoming readouts of STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4, our ongoing Phase 3 trials, evaluating selonsertib, an ASK1 inhibitor in patients with advanced fibrosis, future NASH. It\u2019s supported by the data, we expect to file for regulatory approvals in the second half of this year. In addition, we continue to advance multiple other investigational compounds in NASH as both single agents and as combination therapies. We anticipate ATLAS, our Phase 2b study of various two-drug combinations or regimens in patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis to readout in the fourth quarter. As we continue to do to build our pipeline in NASH, I would like to highlight tow other recent preclinical agreement. Last month, we announced the collaboration and license agreement with Wuhan to co-develop novel treatments for patients with advanced fibrosis, future NASH that will complement our other internal programs. In December, we also entered into another collaboration with Scholar Rock to discover and develop highly specific inhibitors of TGF\u03b2 activation. We will work with Scholar Rock to investigate this novel approach directed towards one of the core pathways driving fibrotic diseases including NASH and diabetic kidney disease. Now turning to inflammation. This quarter, we expect results from FINCH 1 and FINCH 3, two Phase 3 studies of our selective JAK1 inhibitor full governed in rheumatoid arthritis. As you may recall, last year we announced from FINCH 2, the first of our Phase 3 study to readout. Those results demonstrated that they\u2019ll get in a bit all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints and it difficult to treat group of patients. Now as supported by data, we expect to be able to then progress the filgotinib rheumatoid arthritis indication filings for regulatory approvals globally. In the U.S., our ability to file the NDA is the dependent on data from the MANTA study, a safety study in men with ulcerative colitis. This was requested by the FDA and is designed to address non-clinical findings observed in preclinical animal studies. The FDA recently allowed us to expand the inclusion criteria, which is enabled us to enhance enrollment. We will continue to evaluate our progress and options to advance timelines. Once we have the Phase 3 data from 3 FINCH studies in hand, we will initiate and request further interactions with the FDA and other regulatory groups worldwide. We will then be able to provide greater clarity as to filing timelines in the U.S. Moving to HIV. In the coming months, we anticipate the results from the DISCOVER trial, a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind study of more than 5,000 people, evaluating whether Descovy is as safe and as effective as Truvada at reducing the risk of HIV infection, when used as PrEP or pre-exposure prophylaxis. The trial speaks to our ongoing commitment to people at risk of HIV infection and those living with HIV, where our goal is to continue to lead and drive innovation across the spectrum of care from prevention to treatment to hopefully one-day a cure. And finally, I\u2019d like to make a few comments on cell therapy. Our investment in cell therapy is and always has been an investment in the future. Similar to what we\u2019ve done in other areas, historically, we are committed to leading with cutting edge science that one-day creates a path to a cure. Last December, the American Society of Hematology annual meeting, we presented a number of significant updates. The two-year safety and efficacy ZUMA-1 data presented at the meeting and simultaneously published in Lancet oncology, showed an unprecedented plateau in duration of response and overall survival in patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma. After a single infusion of Yescarta with a minimum follow-up of two years, more than half of the patients were still alive and nearly 40% of patients had an ongoing response. The two-year point is a major milestone for Yescarta. This is the longest duration of follow-up of any registrational clinical cell therapy study, and the results set the bar, reinforcing our leadership in cell therapy. Also at the ASH meeting, there were numerous presentations highlighting real world Yescarta data from centers outside of the clinical trial setting. It was encouraging to see similar 30-day efficacy and safety data in this setting, despite sicker patients compared with ZUMA-1 as well as the consistent manufacturing performance and product turnaround time. Finally for Yescarta, we are moving forward in earlier lines of therapy in large B-cell lymphoma and several new indications for other B-cell malignancies, as part of our broader registrational plan. This year, we will also continue several studies aimed and investigating strategies to further improve the safety and the efficacy of Yescarta. More broadly now in cell therapy, we\u2019re advancing an allogeneic platform to IND this year. Progressing different cell therapy approaches in multiple solid tumors with next generation technologies and leveraging our best-in-class cell therapy manufacturing. We will also continue to pursue scientific collaborations that will help us achieve these goals when they make sense. With regard to our other oncology programs, during the fourth quarter, we announced a global collaboration with Tango Therapeutics to discover, develop, and commercialize a pipeline of innovative, targeted immuno-oncology treatments for patients with cancer. Our collaboration will combine Tango\u2019s CRISPR based discovery technology alongside Gilead\u2019s drug discovery and development capabilities. We also recently entered into a partnership with Agenus, focused on the development and commercialization of up to five novel immuno-oncology therapies, three of which are expected to be in the clinic in 2019. We believe these novel approaches can augment the impressive benefits that have been seen with checkpoint inhibition in a variety of cancers. Last quarter, we disclose an initial patent outlining some of our exciting preclinical work related to our small molecule PD-L1 program. To that end, we have now initiated a Phase 1 study of GS-4224 in healthy volunteers. I\u2019m confident we will continue to make significant progress in 2019. I want to close by highlighting several key areas for Gilead this year. We are focused on returning to growth in terms of product sales and confident this can be achieved with our operational excellence, a strong in growing HIV franchise, and stabilizing hepatitis C market. As I\u2019ve just shared on the R&D side, we continue to make excellent progress with our pipeline and we\u2019re looking forward to the readouts of the five Phase 3 studies as I described today. With regard to cell therapy, we will maintain our position of leadership as we continue to reach more patients with Yescarta and advance the next generations of cell therapy. And finally, we are in a position of financial strength, which gives us the flexibility to execute on M&A and partnerships to augment our pipeline. On behalf of the entire organization, we look forward to welcoming Dan O\u2019Day to Gilead next month, as our new Chairman and CEO. In closing, I would like to thank our 11,000 employees around the world. It\u2019s your commitment and dedication that have made us successful and will continue to make us successful in 2019 and into the future. So let\u2019s now open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Your question, please. Geoff Meacham : Good afternoon guys, thanks so much for the question. John, I want to continue to the thought on BG and looking at the step-up in 2018 that you guys had. It\u2019s mostly on early to mid-stage assets. So the question is, one, does this change Gilead\u2019s appetite for later stage deals? And two, what\u2019s the appetite for an expansion beyond your core therapeutic areas? And I realize the answers like to change after Dan gives a more detailed review of the business. Thanks. Robin Washington : Hi Geoff. It\u2019s Robin, why don\u2019t I start. I\u2019d say again, the high bar and criteria for us when it comes to M&A or scientific differentiation, I think you\u2019re right to state that we\u2019re primarily focused on our existing therapeutic areas. While these have been small deals, I think we\u2019ve continued to look for deals with commercial assets as well as later stage pipeline deals as well. But they happen when they happen. So as you can see, we\u2019ve been very active. We\u2019ve been even more active at the second half of the year and we\u2019ll continue to focus in this area as Dan joins us. John McHutchison : And Geoff, it\u2019s John and I\u2019ll just add onto what Robin has said. Also, we have looked at many other things as well over the last year and we\u2019ll continue to do so. And it is driven by the science and it is driven by the opportunity and the importance and the impact that we\u2019ll have on certain diseases. So we will look at life and earlier stage opportunities as they come forward, but as Robin said, the late-stage opportunities are few and far between. Geoff Meacham : Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Your question, please. Michael Yee : Thanks for the question. I guess my question is, although Dan hasn\u2019t come onboard yet, I mean, what do you think and investors should anticipate or should expect through the course of the year, is that him just trying to get onboard familiar with everything and that could take a year? Do you think that he void or management and the board anticipate urgency to put the balance sheet to work? When yes, what should investors expect through 2019 as it relates to Dan coming onboard? Thanks. Gregg Alton : Sure, this is Gregg Alton, I\u2019ll take this question. I think it\u2019s neither of the scenarios that you laid out there. I think that Dan will come onboard March 1, as you know. I think he will be patient. He\u2019s going to take his time to get to know the company, spend more time with the management team, fits in our strategy. Certainly, he will \u2013 then I think he\u2019ll put his own mark on what \u2013 where he wants to take the company. I wouldn\u2019t expect it to take up a year, but I think he will be patient and I think he\u2019s going to be thoughtful and make sure that he\u2019s really understanding what we\u2019re doing. Michael Yee : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please. Brian Abrahams : Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. How should we be thinking about your 2019 guidance for HIV with respect to contribution from volume versus price? And then along those lines for the longer term, there\u2019s been some discussion around CMS practices shifting for protected classes. Can you talk a little bit about the impact that you foresee elements like formulary management or prior authorizations potentially having on clinical practice in HIV and on potential future revenues for the franchise? Thanks. Robin Washington : Hi, Brian. It\u2019s Robin. Maybe I\u2019ll take the first part of your question. And then turn it over to Gregg. So thank you for calling out both those parameters. I mean, keep in mind that volume is a major driver of growth for our business and that will be the case in 2019. For our HIV business, we have taken price increases in the U.S. in the past, but keep in mind that the net effect of them has been limited because the majority of our volume goes through public channels. For instance, ADAP has not had a price increase in since 2008. And that\u2019s part of our U.S. business. In Europe, as you know, we actually take price decreases. So the net result on a worldwide basis is really a low single-digit price benefit when we think about any price increases. For this year, as you can \u2013 appreciate due to competitive reasons, we\u2019re not going to mention, if we aren\u2019t taking price increases at this point in time. Recall back mid-year, we announce no price increases for six months, but any thinking that we do have around price increases as currently reflected in our guidance. And I\u2019d say that, we\u2019ve aware and continue to be aware of the climate out there and we\u2019ve always had a very sensible approach to how we think about pricing. Gregg Alton : And so if I can just jump in on the second part of the question relating to the proposal by CMS on the protected classes, as you\u2019re all aware of Gilead has been on the forefront of innovation in HIV for 30 years now. Bringing our products for treatment and prevention that improved potency, safety, tolerability, simplicity and the protected classes has been a very important component to ensure that patients have access to that and then physicians are free to prescribe what\u2019s best for their patients. And the reason for the protected classes, as many of you know is, these are disease or six disease areas where the products really are not interchangeable and they really need to be the right patient \u2013 right for the patients. This is allowed patients, individuals to do very well with HIV, but also allows us to have a very good public health response to HIV on reducing new infections. We believe that any challenges to the protected class, particularly the prior authorization or step therapy would be a significant step backwards in these efforts. We also share this with a lot of the other therapeutic areas that are impacted by the protected classes. So we are in constant discusses with them. This is the number one public policy initiative by Gilead is ensuring that people understand the importance of protected classes. We\u2019re very engaged with the administration at CMS, HHS, as well as the Senate and Congress. So we are ensuring that we\u2019re very vocal. There were also very closely tied with the patient groups and the physician groups, who care very much about this issue. So this is the first time, this has come up, but we take this very seriously, and we are making sure that the message is very strong, that this would be a step backwards. And we also don\u2019t see significant cost savings to our health system from doing this, and potentially a long-term step back in terms of what we\u2019ve accomplished. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink. Your question, please. Geoffrey Porges : Thank you very much for taking the question and for the information provided in the call. Robin, could you talk us through the increase in SG&A specifically? It\u2019s about a 10% increase compared to where you are this year. It\u2019s about $500 million above what the rate was expecting. Could you talk us through where the incremental $500 million is going and what\u2019s the total possible with \u2013 presume you went through everything else you were spending on previously and couldn\u2019t find any way to reduce in other areas. Thanks. Robin Washington : Yes. Thanks for the question, Geoff. Let me first talk about the sequential increase that was driven by a one-time grant. So I wouldn\u2019t take Q4 and assume that\u2019s the run rate, right? I mean, during the second half of the year to your specific question, we have included incremental expenses focused on our new emerging therapeutic area launches, in particular, NASH and inflammation. We\u2019ve also included some incremental expense to our cell therapy ramp. As you know, we\u2019re continuing to build outside of the U.S. in that area as well. So those are some of the primary drivers. The kind of the smaller drivers include just some geographic expansion. If you saw from our guidance, we\u2019re expected to have HIV revenue in Japan next year, so there\u2019s some investment that we\u2019re waiting there. We also continued to get products approved in China, so that\u2019s an area of focus. So yes, there is a second half ramp in our expenses to support those very new launchers. I would say, Geoff, to your point, have we thought about trade-offs? Yes, we have. I would say, particularly, for NASH, we haven\u2019t maybe work and can comment on this as well, we do believe continuing to stay focused on our hep C franchise in a much more competitive environment is the way to go. So there are some incremental expenses that we hadn\u2019t initially thought about associated with NASH, but we\u2019ve appropriately included in our guidance. Laura Hamill : Yes, thanks, Robin just first half covering it. For HCV, we believe not only from a field force perspective that we wanted be fully focused around the world, but also in terms of reaching consumers in the United States as a very strong focus. And external and outside of the United States, there is a number of initiatives to really help with elimination in conjunction with the government, and we\u2019re committed to that. So I think that\u2019s really what we were contemplating with positive where we have an opportunity to join forces, we believe that we should keep those separate and continue to focus on them as individual very important products uniquely. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. John, I have one for you, specifically on the NASH study. Can you talk a little bit about how you tower those studies? I know you\u2019ve talked in the past that 20% delta is clinically meaningful, I wonder if you could comment if you achieved the delta below that? If the studies could still be statistically successful and how you might look at the result like that? Thanks. John McHutchison : Thank you, Matthew. We\u2019re excited about the NASH readouts from STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4. We have 1,600 patients with bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis. So those results due to imminently readout this quarter, so we are looking for the \u2013 to answer your question, we are looking for a significant increase over placebo response rate, which we believe we can calculate accurately from our previous trials, and we believe that we would like to show a 10% to 15% increase or a doubling of response rates over placebo, to have a meaningful effect in a group of people that have a high likelihood of disease progressing to transplant, et cetera. So without getting into all the details about the numbers, this would be our first step forward for patients with advanced fibrosis towards NASH, and a meaningful improvement if we could allow one in five of them to prevent progression of the disease to transplant the compensation, et cetera, we believe that will be meaningful clinically, statistically and otherwise. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citi. Your question please. Robyn Karnauskas : Hi guys, thanks for the question and congratulations on all the progress. My question is on PrEP. Can you talk about 200,000 on PrEP and by our math that could be around $2 billion worth of sales coming from PrEP I don\u2019t know the trade, but my question is more about their data other thing this could be a 1 million to 2 million, 3 million people that ideally could benefit from PrEP. How are you thinking about getting that \u2013 getting Descovy enhance of those people? What is the argument you would make to make sure those patients go on PrEP? And do you think \u2013 my question is more about a lot of people are young, so how are you going to make that argument and where do you think PrEP could go and what\u2019s going to benefit from DTG, very long question, sorry. Laura Hamill : Yes. So how about if I take the conversion question and on the clinical study, I\u2019m going to leave that up to John. So this is Laura. Thank you, Robyn for the question. So as it relates to PrEP, as I mentioned earlier, I mean, the United States has 1.1 million people that the CDC estimates that could benefit from PrEP. And we really believe there\u2019s a lot more to do. There\u2019s a lot of populations that are affected that just don\u2019t have the awareness that they really need to protect themselves. So not only do we have a dedicated field force, but we have a lot of community individuals that have come from non-profits that are very much committed to helping these communities, and we are leading into these communities to try to raise awareness. In addition, we\u2019ve actually put a significant amount of additional funding behind both Biktarvy and Truvada for PrEP in 2019, because we believe that\u2019s very important thing to do. Now to answer your question about the conversion from TDF based regimen to TAF based regimen or Descovy-based regimen. Obviously, the clinical trial results I\u2019ll let John talk to. But what I would say is when we look at the treatment market, as I mentioned in the U.S., we\u2019re at 77% of prescription, total prescription, now in Descovy-based backbone and in Europe, we\u2019re at 80%. And we believe that the benefits that accrue to a patient for HIV are the same benefits that we need to have for a patient at risk that its being treated for PrEP. Some of the duration of therapy is longer than we would \u2013 you may anticipate, so these otherwise, healthy individuals want to have a normal, healthy life and the Descovy-based regimen really lens splints for that to be a great treatment option. Then turn over to John on the study. John McHutchison : So Robyn, the safety advantages of taking a test-phase backbone has this been the case and seen in the conversion rates for the HIV-infected individual will apply equally to the at-risk individual who\u2019s taking medication for PrEP. So we\u2019ll be able to show in the study with over 5,000 patients that they are differences, I presume, in terms of safety, kidney and bone. And because of the young age and the longevity in terms of taking medicines to prevent HIV infection, the same principles apply suggested somebody who is infected already. So another way of saying what Laura has already said, and hopefully, the study will lead this down. The answers to that question, we are creating that in the coming month. Operator : Thank you. Our next comes from the line of Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question please. Alethia Young : Hey guys, thank for taking my question. I was just asking about the MANTA study, I just want to clarify maybe one thing. Is that may for like a label or is it really need actually for at the filing package. And then just can you update with a little bit more precision on how does initiative that played out at the enrollment timeline? Thanks. John McHutchison : Thanks, Alethia, and thank you for your question on MANTA. Before I go into at an answer that, so let me further I really do appreciate everybody\u2019s interest in the program. It\u2019s a somewhat different situation than we found ourselves in before and the day that we generating in the Phase 3 trials will provide me with a lot more, and our team, with a lot more details that will allow us to be able to answer your questions with greater clarity regarding the timelines. So we have had a pickup in enrollment, Alethia, since we\u2019ve made the modifications to the programs. And as I said today really, I think we don\u2019t need it for labeling necessary, but it would give clarity as to whether there\u2019s any risk associated with male infertility and so forth because it\u2019s a male safety study. So it\u2019s not required, but it\u2019s, obviously, advantageous for us to have it in all of those respects. As I said to you, this is an issue that we \u2013 we\u2019re really addressing an FDA issue of a non-clinical filing that we observed in the preclinical animal studies. We\u2019ve seen a pickup in enrollment, I don\u2019t want to get into specifics about the numbers, but there has been a significant pickup in enrollment. And I\u2019ll keep watching, and we will keep watching that process very carefully to advance our timeline. So once we have the data from the three Phase 3 FINCH trials, we will be able to initiate further interactions, discuss the MANTA study and its progress more and then be able to provide you with the greater clarity. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Your question, please. Umer Raffat : Hi, thank you so much for taking my question. I have one for Robin and one quick clarification on something John said. So Robin, there was an expectation among investors based on a lot of the comments you shared and the rest of the management shared at the January conference that 2018 was a trough and 2019 should be a growth year in product sales. But judging by guidance, at least, it doesn\u2019t quite look like that. Can you please go over that? And also particularly curious about Hep C because it looks like versus 4Q run rate, there isn\u2019t a whole lot erosion modeled into it? And John, just to clarify, something you mentioned about NASH earlier, is there a hierarchal analysis for the low-dose versus high-dose in the readout or is the p-value being split? Thank you very much. Robin Washington : So, Umer, let me start with your question on guidance. And so I just want to reiterate, as I\u2019ve said, your conference, we are very focused on returning the growth in 2019, and really believe that\u2019s achievable if you look at the strength of our HIV franchise. As I said we expect double-digit year-on-year growth, stabilizing trends in our HCV business, as well as the momentum of our cell therapy franchise where as you saw, we expected to practically double this year. I think the other thing we\u2019ve tried to do is to be very transparent in our 2019 guidance of outlining those unplanned factors in 2018 that definitely will impact growth or the level of growth that we expect in 2019. The other thing I want to point is just our philosophy around setting guidance at the beginning of the year. It remains pretty consistent with how we\u2019ve done in prior years, and it includes all the uncertainties that you could expect that could impact our franchises. I mentioned several on the call and just take FX, that alone, volatility could have a, plus or minus, $300 million impact. So yes, the guidance, particularly, our first guidance of the year, that includes downside risk, and we\u2019re going to monitor those and manage them throughout the year. But our conviction as well as our confidence around returning to net product revenue growth is very, very strong, and we\u2019re going to look forward to updating you throughout the year as activities progress across our franchises. John McHutchison : In regard to your second question, it\u2019s John. We took two doses into the Phase 3 trials, a, because we had target engagement of both doses in terms of immunohistochemistry. We also allowed ourselves to have another chance in terms of the safety profile that might be potentially differentiated that lower or higher doses, those were the two reasons for taking two doses forward into Phase 3. And without getting into all the details of the statistical analysis plan, we will be able to compare both doses to placebo in terms of the primary endpoint. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Your question, please. Cory Kasimov : Hey, good afternoon guys. Thank you for taking my question. Wanted to ask on the cell therapy side of things. Can you talk about the source of your confidence in the projected growth for Yescarta in 2019? I believe you said it\u2019s up $200 million, given there\u2019s only $6 million of sequential growth in 3Q and 4Q. And along these lines, I think you previously guided to having more centers online for the product. In Europe, by the end of 2018 and where you ended up. So how should we be thinking about kind of the cadence of opening centers into 2019 and how that plays into your guidance. Thanks. Laura Hamill : Hi, this is Laura. Thanks for the question. I will say, that our launches of Yescarta really made excellence progress, both in the U.S. and in EU. As part of our guidance, we do expect the Yescarta revenue to nearly double, as you\u2019d mention. So we feel we have very, very strong on momentum. We are seeing greater depth and breadth of treatment with Yescarta across the 68 certified sites in the U.S. So where we started off, there is a process of the institutional really figuring out how to operationalize treatment, and we had a very high amount in the \u2013 for top 20 academic institutions, we\u2019re starting to see that spread further across the 68 institutions and also like I said, depth of patients going through. In addition, as we mentioned, the data that was presented for the follow-up to the real-world evidence, I think really is providing that extra energy in the community about the importance of treating. Not only, obviously, the 68 sites, but what\u2019s more important is that the community oncologists are referring these patients into the sites for treatments, and we do have full force focused on helping with that referral process. And you did ask us specifically about Europe. So we do have 12 sites in Europe that are actively engaged, and we will tell you that in terms of what we\u2019re seeing in Germany. We\u2019re very, very impressed with the results and we continue to have additional in the UK and we also have provided products and open up sites in France, and we will continue to expand throughout 2019 in the European markets. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau from Cowen and Company. Phil Nadeau : Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Question on the HIV franchise. I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that the use of TDF generic regimens is a risk to HIV pricing this year. And in fact, we have seen some payer programs to incentivize the use of those generic regimen. So just curious if you could maybe talk to a little bit more detail what you are seeing from payers? Any impact on pricing of the generic regimen\u2019s, how it\u2019s being used by physicians and should payers get more aggressive about recommending their use, how it gave encounter that. Thank you. Laura Hamill : So this is Laura. Thank you for taking question. That was a pretty consistent question that we had at JPMorgan conference, too. And when we look at specifically, one particular payer that was emphasized, we really have not seen any major impact at all. As a matter of fact, when we look at the program, which was specifically, supporting Cimduo, we saw no more than 100 prescriptions generated during the 10 month period of time. And in addition to that, in December, United, basically said, there were two physicians saying, they were longer going to run the My Scripts program. So that\u2019s \u2013 I think that was an effort that was tried to be, if patients would choose to switch back but we really did not see any impact. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Salim Syed from Mizuho Securities. Your question, please. Salim Syed : Hi, guys . Thanks for taking the question. I just actually have two quick ones, if you don\u2019t mind. The first is on HIV Japan. So if I recall at the end of last year, toward the end of last year, you guys bought back to HIV rights from Japan tobacco. I was wondering if you could just give us some color, how should we be modeling that opportunity coming out of Japan now that you are marketing that solo? And what should we be taking out of the royalty line, where I believe you previously booked the economics. And then the second question, just on your auto CD19 wondering if you guys view CD19 car and K cells therapy as complementary or competition to your allo T-cell therapy. Thank you. Robin Washington : So maybe I\u2019ll start with the HIV question. Thanks for a asking that. We\u2019re really excited about the opportunity in Japan. It is included in our guidance. And to your point, in the past, we got between about $50 million and $60 million a year in Japan Tobacco royalties and that was in total revenue, not product revenue. So net-net, this is a positive for us and that we\u2019ll now see those revenues flow through net product revenue, but we\u2019ll lose that royalty contract and other going forward. So again, I think very excited about gaining the commercial rights to the HIV products. And Laura, I don\u2019t know if you want to expand a bit on the commercialization of that relationship at all. Laura Hamill : Yes. So the teams have been actively working for a smooth transition for the HIV franchise. I think it\u2019s not only the HIV franchise that exists most currently, but it\u2019s really the opportunity this year 2019 to launch Biktarvy. So we\u2019re really, really excited about that opportunity. And the teams, like I said, are working hard and we appreciate the great partnership with Japan Tobacco on kind of helping us with the conversion and building this franchise for us and helping us with a successful launch. John McHutchison : In terms of the question Salim, related to the allogeneic program. As I said on the call, we are very pleased to announce that we hope to have our IND for our allogeneic CD19 program this year. And we will engineer certain factors into that program. One of which we\u2019ve already announced that we\u2019ll be HLA high related that will have an effect on NK cells that will \u2013 we hope, an advantage in terms of persistence of those cell \u2013 persistence or the manipulated or engineered CAR T cell. So it\u2019s an early field, more to be seen, lots of different approaches. We are pleased with our progress so far. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Terence Flynn : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just on selonsertib. I was just wondering if you can confirm if you\u2019d be able to file on only one positive Phase 3 trial or if you need both of those trials to file. And then we\u2019d love your thoughts on how you see this market playing out over the near and longer-term under a positive outcome for the STELLAR studies. Importantly, what are the key inputs on pricing? Do you need the event-free survival data to really drive the value proposition or do you think just the histology data\u2019s enough? Thanks. John McHutchison : Thanks, Terence. Look, we would like both studies to be positive. They imminently going to be available in the next quarter or few months as well. If one was positive and one was negative as you outlined, we\u2019d have to have a discussion with the regulators. And that would be something that we would discuss analyzing data in that situation. Look, in terms of pricing and moving forward, I\u2019ll hand those aspects onto Laura. Laura Hamill : Yes. Thanks, John. Thank you. So obviously it\u2019s too early to really comment on our pricing strategy, but of course we modeled scenarios. I will say that the medical affairs team has done a lot of work from a health economics perspective. We\u2019re quite familiar with the overall cost of an F3, F4 patients. These patients are extremely expensive to the system, so having that real world data, which shows us how expensive and unfortunately how many patients when they get to that level really are in pretty dire need. We can take that information coupled with what John produces from a clinical perspective and be able to utilize that for our discussion. John McHutchison : Terence, just to add. It is Subpart H approval. So once we have the histological endpoint of week 48, that would then allow approval of the drug that would be linked to the five year follow-up to show the improvement in clinical benefit as well over time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please. Ying Huang : Hi. Thanks for the questions. So maybe first for Robin. In your assumptions for the incremental SG&A for 2019 in PrEP for the launch for filgotinib and NASH, I assume that will probably mostly occur in the second half. And if NASH unfortunately fails, does that mean SG&A would actually be lower than expected. And then secondly on the assumption for the HIV launch in your guidance, does that assume incremental more switches from dolutegravir-containing regimens or not in 2019. Thank you. Robin Washington : Sure, Ying. So first to talk about SG&A, as I mentioned earlier, yes it is the ramp in SG&A is more second half 2019. Don\u2019t use Q4, 2018 as your baseline. Yes, it\u2019s an unfortunate, yes. And for some reason we would not launch our SG&A expenses would go down and that is hopefully not what happens. This is one place where as a CFO, I hope we\u2019ll spend every single dollar that we have allocated. I\u2019ll also add that, again, because of the health of our HIV franchise, I didn\u2019t mention earlier, but there is a component of incremental investment we\u2019re making there as well. But to your question, if NASH did not launch, you would have lower expenses. If you think about $100 million for us in terms of SG&A spend or expenses in general, it\u2019s about $0.06 a share. Gregg Alton : And then there is a question on the HIV launch assumptions and in terms of a competitor. I think Ying, it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019re not going to get into our detailed assumptions of our guidance. But we fully anticipate Biktarvy will go on to be the best selling single tablet regimen. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould from UBS. Your question please. Carter Gould : Thanks guys. Just wanted to dig in a little bit deeper to the EU dynamics in HIV. You obviously highlighted a couple country\u2019s total launch with Biktarvy, but you were a little bit more, I guess a pick on around if that business will sort of stabilize this year and/or return to growth, or is that really something we should be looking to 2024? Any color there would be appreciated. Thank you. Robin Washington : Okay. Hi, Carter. This is Robin, maybe I\u2019ll start and if Laura has any color. Yes, I would say in 2019 we actually don\u2019t expect U.S. HIV revenues to grow. But we\u2019ll have the full year impact of genericization and as Laura talked about, we\u2019ll continue to see that ramp of our Descovy-based products. So keep in mind over the next two years we\u2019ll be launching Biktarvy throughout Europe. So the one component of that quarter sequential decline that we saw was a one-time adjustment we had to make relative to prior periods where certain Southern European countries reach a cap in terms of spending on pharmaceutical products. And then they do what\u2019s called clawback, we get kind of an additional tax. There has been a lot of changes in governments -- and we did make an additional adjustment. And if you take that out, I\u2019d say the sequential declines are more consistent of what we\u2019ve seen in the past. But beyond 2019, again, Laura talked about the great uptake of Descovy and with Biktarvy, we do expect overtime in 2020 or 2021 return to grow for EU HIV. Laura Hamill : Yes. So I\u2019ll just add a little bit. I think Robin covered it very well. In terms of launches, we\u2019ve definitely been able to with Biktarvy launch, like I said, just some \u2013 the very end of the year, some of the big countries, but we have a launch is going on all through 2019 for Biktarvy. There will still be erosion of generics occurring through 2019. So we had in 2018, we\u2019ll see it happen through 2019. But we believe, we\u2019re going to have some erosion. But the conversion of the Descovy-based regimen being at 80%, those three variables, we believe that we will be able to move through 2019 and then continue to grow from that base. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to management for any further remarks. Sung Lee : Thank you, Jonathan, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead. And the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on our future progress. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Gilead Sciences' First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jonathan and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sung Lee : Thank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the first quarter 2019. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website. The speakers on today's call today will be; Daniel O'Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Hamill, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Operations; and John McHutchison, Chief Scientific Officer and Head of Research and Development. Before we begin with our prepared comments, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website. I will now turn the call over to Dan. Daniel O'Day: Thank you, Sung, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm really pleased to join all of you today for my first earnings call at Gilead. Rob and Laura and John will take you through the key highlights of the quarter, but I'd like to share and start by sharing some of the perspectives that I gained since arriving here in March. As many of you know when I made the decision to join Gilead, I was drawn to the potential that I saw to build on the legacy of transforming care for people with serious illnesses in a company that has a deep commitment to patients and science. I now had a chance to see the extent of that potential up close. Let me share some of what I've observed, the areas that I focused on up until now and a few thoughts on what you can expect next. The first thing, I'll say is that it's been really exciting to see the scientific strength from the perspective of being inside the company. I've taken part in a series of deep dives into the R&D programs in each of our therapeutic areas. This includes spending time at KITE to dig into our work in cell therapy. I'm excited about the progress that we're making in inflammation and with the results of FINCH 1 and FINCH 3 are the studies that were announced at the end of March. John will walk you through the detailed study results later in this call, but I just want to express my enthusiasm for this work, as we mobilized the organization for the launch of filgotinib, a medicine that will be a significant step forward for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Inflammation is one of the three emerging areas for us and we anticipate that filgotinib will be an important future growth driver. As I deepen my understanding of Gilead's therapeutic areas, I've had the pleasure of participating in two scientific congresses, beginning with CROI or at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. And here I had the opportunity to watch as we shared the promising results from the DISCOVER study of Descovy for PrEP. More recently I attended the International Liver Congress in Vienna where we presented data from across our liver disease programs and had the chance at both of these conferences to meet with key thought leaders and get their perspectives on our R&D programs. During my first two months, I've also begun to get to know our shareholders and to understand their perspectives. These conversations have helped me understand the external view of Gilead and this feedback will help inform the decisions then I make to shape the organization and position Gilead for the future. As I've settled into my new role, I've been greatly impressed with the people at Gilead and the extent of talent across the organization. I spent a lot of time talking to groups and individuals and it's great to meet so many really smart passionate and thoughtful people. So when I close my portion of the call by sharing with you a little bit about what you can expect from me and when. In terms of immediate priorities, broadly speaking, I'm looking first to three key areas : Number one, strengthening the pipeline, both internal programs and corporate development opportunities. Number two, is ensuring optimal commercial delivery both on our current medicines and those that were getting ready to launch. And number three the organizational piece ensuring that we have the right people in the right roles and that they are well equipped for success. I want to make sure we tap into the talent at all levels of the company. In my early days one area of pressing need has been working to better understand the work we're doing at KITE, identifying what it needs for short- and long-term success in cell therapy. I wanted to take some swift decisions here. And at the end of March we announced internally that KITE would become a separate business unit. We've initiated a search for a CEO of KITE. And once appointed that individual reports to me and will have full accountability for all aspects of cell therapy. I believe that providing KITE with this degree of autonomy will foster agility, innovation and entrepreneurialism. Cell therapy is a critical piece of the puzzle with regards to the long-term future of oncology and a critical element of Gilead's long-term strategy helping us to build on a legacy of transformational medicines. Between now and the end of the year, I will also have a series of meetings with the leadership team and the Board to shape our long-term strategy and vision for the future of Gilead. I anticipate that later this year I'll be in a position to begin sharing more with all of you. Finally, I'd like to thank all the people who have contributed to the excellent progress my colleagues will outline today, Gilead's 11,000 employees, our partners, the scientific community and the patients who take part in our clinical trials. I'm excited to see what we can achieve together in the months and years ahead. Before I turn the call over to Robin, I would like to acknowledge the news we shared earlier this week regarding her retirement from her role as CFO. Over the past two months, I've come to know Robin as an exceptional and talented leader. This is a transition that I know she has contemplated for some time and while I had hoped to have the opportunity to work with her for longer she has my full support. I'm grateful to Robin for agreeing to stay at Gilead through March 1, 2020 to see us through the completion of the reporting of the company's 2019 financial results. Thank you, Robin for your leadership through this period and over the past 11 years. I'll now turn the call over to you. Robin Washington : Thank you, Dan, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to share our financial results for the first quarter of 2019. Total revenues for the first quarter were $5.3 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.76. This compares to revenues of $5.1 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.48 for the same period last year. Turning to product sales. Product sales for the first quarter were $5.2 billion, up 4% year-over-year and down 8% sequentially. This is the first quarter in the past three years where the company has posted year-over-year growth and it reinforces our belief that the company can grow product sales year-over-year on a full year basis. In the U.S., product sales for the first quarter were $3.8 billion, up 8% year-over-year and down 15% sequentially. The sequential decline was primarily due to the anticipated inventory drawdown associated with our HIV products reflective of the seasonal inventory pattern from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. As expected, our HIV payer mix moved more toward public payers, which also contributed to the sequential decline. Combined inventory and payer mix contributed an estimated $400 million to the sequential decline. Turning to Europe. Product sales for the first quarter were $882 million, down 12% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially. Sequentially, the increase was due to an unfavorable accounting adjustment related to statutory revenue callback reserves recorded in Q4. Without these Q4 adjustments product sales would have been flat. On a year-over-year basis, the decline was driven by lower HCV sales due to lower patient starts and competitive dynamics and the broader availability of generic HIV products in 2019. Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $871 million for the first quarter, up 7% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher investments to support our cell therapy programs. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $962 million for the first quarter, up 9% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher promotional expenses in the U.S. and expenses associated with expansion of Gilead's products in Europe and Japan. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the first quarter was 16.7% compared to 22.8% in the same period last year due to a $0.09 per share favorable tax settlement. Note that this settlement was reflected in the full year 2019 non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance of 20% to 21% as previously provided. Moving to the balance sheet. During the first quarter, we generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations and ended the quarter with $30.1 billion in cash and investments. We repaid $750 million of debt borrowed in connection with our acquisition of KITE. We paid cash dividends of $817 million and we repurchased 12 million shares of stock for $834 million. As a reminder, the majority of our stock compensation awards are issued in the first quarter. 2019 is progressing consistent with our expectations as we enter the second quarter of our fiscal year and we are reiterating our full year guidance, which can be found on slide 18 in the earnings results presentation. As we mentioned in the previous earnings call, our SG&A guidance included funding to support commercial launch activities for NASH. Given the results of stellar Phase III studies, SG&A funding for these activities will not be utilized in 2019. We do believe there may be opportunities to enhance launch readiness for filgotinib that we are monitoring. As such we will revisit SG&A and our other guidance assumptions midyear and provide you with an update during our Q2 call. We remain committed to vigilant expense management and ensuring that we retain industry-leading operating margins. I will now turn the call over to Laura. Laura Hamill : Thank you, Robin. Good afternoon everyone. I will provide an update on our commercial performance during the first quarter and share highlights from markets around the world. Beginning with HIV. We continue to see double-digit revenue growth on a year-over-year basis led by uptake of our Descovy-based regimen and growing use of Truvada for PrEP. In the U.S. HIV revenue was $2.8 billion in the first quarter, up 19% year-over-year and down 17% quarter-over-quarter. As Robin noted, the sequential change reflects the anticipated inventory drawdown and payer mix in the first quarter. This trend is a typical pattern that we see between Q1 and the preceding Q4. Underlying prescription demand remains robust growing 12% year-over-year. We continue to see excellent adoption of Biktarvy. It is become the top-selling product in the U.S. and generated $739 million in revenue. It remains the number one prescribed regimen in both treatment-na\u00efve and switch patients. Approximately 80% of Biktarvy's U.S. prescriptions come from switches, with about 25% coming from Genvoya and 25% coming from dolutegravir-based regimens. Overall, Descovy-based regimens continue to gain share and now account for approximately 80% of Gilead's total U.S. treatment prescription volume. In Europe, total HIV revenue was $569 million in the first quarter, down 7% year-over-year and up 11% quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year decline was driven by the broad availability of generic versions of Truvada across the EU. The decline however is moderating, as we continue to see rapid uptake of our Descovy-based products, which now account for almost 80% of our total HIV revenue in Europe in the first quarter. Biktarvy is now available in Germany, France and Spain. We anticipate launching in the U.K. and Italy mid-year. We are encouraged by the strong uptake of Biktarvy across all markets where we have launched. In 2018, we launched Biktarvy in Germany in June and France in November. In both markets, Biktarvy has quickly become the number one regimen for na\u00efve and switch patients. As you will recall, in Japan, we acquired rights to certain products from our HIV franchise from our marketing partner Japan Tobacco at the beginning of the year. We subsequently received approval for Biktarvy in March and launched earlier this quarter. Now moving to prevention. Use of Truvada for PrEP continues to grow in the United States. As we work to educate at-risk individuals and treating physicians, we estimate more than 200,000 people were taking Truvada for PrEP at the end of Q1. These estimates reflect an external industry-wide restatement from IQVIA, a source that we use to quantify Truvada for PrEP use. On a like-for-like basis, we saw 28% year-over-year growth. We were also very pleased to see the outstanding results from the DISCOVER trial presented at CROI. If approved we believe Descovy for PrEP will bring a meaningful benefit to at-risk individuals where we have been seeing increase in persistency of use. Now turning to HCV. U.S. product sales for the first quarter were $393 million, down 33% year-over-year and down 4% quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year U.S. decline was primarily driven to competitive dynamics, including an alignment of the Medicare and commercial pricing at the start of 2019 and lower patient starts. Sequentially revenue in Q1 were positively impacted by the timing of Department of Corrections order, which was originally anticipated later in the year. Over the full year, HCV revenue expectations for 2019 remain unchanged. Revenue for our HCV generics sold by our separate subsidiary at Asegua Therapeutics is in line with our expectations. Sales in the first quarter included some wholesaler inventory stocking. Asegua is continuing negotiations with payers and as we previously communicated we anticipate Asegua launch will continue to gain momentum in the second half of 2019. In Europe, HCV product sales for the first quarter were $203 million, down 25% from the prior year, due to declining patient starts and 8% quarter-over-quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to Q4 accounting adjustment that Robin mentioned earlier. We are continuing to see favorable share trends, particularly with Epclusa in France, Spain and U.K. We launched Epclusa in Japan in late February and we believe this has the potential to bring meaningful benefit to patients with HCV. Now turning to Yescarta. The commercial performance continues to meet our expectations of a steady adoption. Worldwide sales were $93 million during the first quarter, up 90% quarter-over-quarter. Since launch more than 1,500 patients have been treated with Yescarta, including patients for commercial market and clinical trials. This is an important milestone for our cell therapy business. In the U.S., hospitals continue to learn how to operationalize CAR T therapy and physician awareness of Yescarta's data continues to improve. Our efforts remain focused on educating providers about the profile of Yescarta, working with centers on operational setup and engaging with community oncologists to identify patients for whom Yescarta is appropriate. We're beginning to see benefits of all of these efforts. Additionally, we continue to engage with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, and other stakeholders, as we work to improve Medicare reimbursement and access. Last week, CMS released the 2020 proposed rule for Medicare inpatient perspective payment, which contains an increase and the new technology add-on payment. The proposal is currently open for public comment through the end of June. This is a positive step. And while we believe more needs to be done, we are very encouraged by the progress. In Europe, we are focused on getting site certified. It's early days for Yescarta in Europe, but we have already achieved reimbursement in countries such as Germany, France and U.K. Across Europe, we are continuing to build awareness about the therapy. Finally, I'd like to acknowledge the strong closing performance of our cardiopulmonary team, as we lost exclusivity for Ranexa and Letairis. Letairis and Ranexa revenue totaled $352 million for the quarter. As expected, we saw generic versions of Ranexa enter the market during the quarter, leading to a drop in revenue. We anticipated generic competition for Letairis during the second quarter, as FDA approved the single-shared REMS in March. The year is off to a great start. I'd like to thank the teams around the world for their incredible effort. With a continued focus on our expanding portfolio of products we are making wonderful progress. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John. John McHutchison : Thank you Laura, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Let me start by saying that this has been another important quarter for the R&D part of our organization, and I remain excited about our ongoing program. So far this year, we have had five Phase 3 registrational clinical trials readout. I will spend some time discussing these studies and then cover other progress we are making across our pipeline. In March, we announced additional positive results from our FINCH program in rheumatoid arthritis. FINCH 1 and FINCH 3 Phase 3 studies of our selective JAK1 inhibitor filgotinib in adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis each met their respective primary endpoint. Taken together with the FINCH 2 data reported last year, the three FINCH datasets support the potential of filgotinib as an important treatment option across the broad range of patient populations with rheumatoid arthritis. FINCH 3 evaluated filgotinib in combination with methotrexate and as monotherapy in methotrexate-na\u00efve patients. Filgotinib is generally well tolerated and met the study's primary endpoint in terms of the proportion of patients achieving an ACR20 response at week 24 of treatment. In addition, the proportion of patients achieving the primary endpoint was significantly higher for filgotinib 200 milligrams plus methotrexate and filgotinib 100 milligrams plus methotrexate compared with methotrexate alone. Key secondary endpoint, specifically ACR50 and ACR70 or deeper responses and clinical remission rates at week 24 were also significantly higher with filgotinib plus methotrexate compared with patients receiving methotrexate alone. Now the FINCH 1 trial evaluated filgotinib compared to adalimumab or placebo on a stable background dose of methotrexate in patients with the prior inadequate response to methotrexate. The safety profile of filgotinib was also consistent with previously reported results. And the study also achieved its primary endpoint for both doses of filgotinib in terms of the proportion of patients achieving an ACR20 response compared to placebo at week 12. Similar to results seen through at our FINCH program, FINCH 1 ACR50 and ACR70 deeper responses were also significantly greater for filgotinib compared with placebo at week 12 for both doses. Across the three FINCH trials, we have therefore observed, deep, consistent similar to or -- responses similar to or higher than other JAK inhibitors and other approved biologic agents. Given the high proportion of patients achieving remission or control of their disease, these responses are encouraging, and the safety profile associated with JAK1 specificity continues to be differentiated. Based on these data, we will progress the filgotinib rheumatoid arthritis indication filing for regulatory approval in Europe in the second half of this year. As you know the MANTA study was requested by the FDA. Now that we have the Phase 3 data in hand from three FINCH studies, we have initiated a request to have further interactions with the FDA. Following those discussions, we will be able to provide greater clarity on a filing time line in the U.S. Now turning to HIV. We are pleased with the results from our DISCOVER trial a Phase 3 randomized double-blind study of more than 5,000 people, evaluating whether once-daily Descovy is as safe and effective as once-daily Truvada at reducing the risk of HIV infection, when used as PrEP or pre-exposure prophylaxis. In a late breakup, oral abstract presented at CROI in Seattle earlier this year, the trial demonstrated that Descovy is non-inferior to Truvada in terms of preventing new HIV infections, with additional statistically significant advantages with respect to bone and renal safety. So based on these data last month we submitted a supplemental NDA to the FDA for Descovy for the PrEP indication as an potential important new option to prevent HIV infection. If approved, we believe this will help contribute to achieving national and global HIV prevention goals. We submitted a priority review voucher with the filing, and we would anticipate approval in the fourth quarter of 2019. Moving to liver disease and our broader NASH development program. In the last two months, we released top line results from the STELLAR-3 and STELLAR-4 programs the two Phase 3 studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of our investigational F1 inhibitor selonsertib in patients with reaching fibrosis Stage F3 due to NASH and Stage F4 or compensated cirrhosis due to NASH. Both studies did not meet their primary endpoint at week 48 of a greater than or equal to one stage histologic improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH. Although, this is not the outcome we were hoping for, these were important studies to conduct. There's a significant unmet need for patients with advanced fibrosis in this disease. NASH is also a complex biological disease with multiple drivers of the disease and we believe the combination therapy will likely be necessary to effectively treat most of these patients. To that end, the ATLAS trial a Phase 2 study evaluating combinations of our investigational compounds in patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis is expected to read out in the fourth quarter of this year. At the International Liver Congress in Vienna last month, we had more than 35 abstracts across NASH viral hepatitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. In particular, we presented new data supporting our efforts to develop combination therapies targeting different aspects of NASH, to evaluate the utility of non-invasive test for the identification of patients living with the disease, and to advance our overall understanding of the complexities and the burden of NASH. Lastly as it relates to our NASH program I would like to highlight two recent agreements that will also augment our effort. A few weeks ago we announced our intent to enter into clinical collaboration with Novo Nordisk to evaluate the utility of combining their approved GLP-1 drug semaglutide with both our FXR agonists cilofexor and our ACC inhibiter firsocostat for the treatment of patients with NASH. We also announced the strategic collaboration with insitro to discover and develop therapies for patients with NASH. As part of that three-year collaboration, we will leverage insitro's prior proprietary platform which applies machine learning, human genetics, and functional genomics to create disease models for NASH and discover relevant drug targets that have an influence on clinical progression and regression of the disease. We, therefore, have a broad, deep, and strong pipeline in NASH combining both internal program and multiple external collaborations to advance therapies and we remain committed to developing effective combination therapies for patients with the disease. Now, finally, let's shift gears to cell therapy and the momentum we're seeing there in advancing the next generation of medicine. We're gearing up for ASCO, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the annual meeting in Chicago in a few weeks. I'm excited by the abstracts we will present. Our anticipated data updates include a presentation of the preliminary result of earlier steroid use with axi-cel in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma. This study is part of a broader clinical effort to optimize the safety and efficacy profile of Yescarta by evaluating various combination approaches, reaching chemotherapy, and revised safety management practices. I'm also pleased to share that we plan to announce top line results of ZUMA-2 our registrational trial of KTE-X19 cell therapy in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma. Pending positive results, we expect to file the U.S. regulatory approval of KTE-X19 in patients with relapse/refractory mantle cell lymphoma for this indication by the end of 2019. This would represent the first regulatory submission for X19. As a reminder KTE-X19 employs the same engineered T cell construct as Yescarta with a slightly modified manufacturing process to address the specific characteristics of mantle cell lymphoma acute lymphoblastic leukemia and other diseases where there's a large burden of circulating tumor cells. KTE-X19 was granted breakthrough designation by the FDA. So, the application would be considered for expedited review. Overall, our commitment to cell therapy is simple. We continue to try to reach more patients in need with Yescarta and to try and optimize the safety and efficacy of the treatment. More broadly we are focused on creating a path to cure with subsequent generation products that enhance the efficacy and safety of cell therapy for hematological malignancies and ultimately solid tumors. We are also advancing allogeneic cell therapies which would offer significant benefits to patients making time to treat quicker and also more convenient. As I look across our R&D organization in quoting both our earlier and later-stage pipeline, I'm excited about the momentum we have established. In closing, I would like to thank our R&D organization and all of our employees around the world for the hard work and commitment to translate into most important scientific discoveries into the best treatments for patients. So, let's now open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Geoffrey Meacham from Barclays. Your question please. Geoffrey Meacham : Hey guys, thanks for the question and Dan welcome to your first Gilead call. Daniel O'Day: Thanks Geoff. Geoffrey Meacham : So, I know you just finished the listing 2, but at this point how much of a strategic priority would you say the NASH portfolio or the hep B portfolio is? And if the answer is high, how aggressive you think you want to be on the BD front to add assets to these two categories? Thanks very much. Daniel O'Day: Yes great. Thanks Geoff. It gives me a chance to maybe just characterize what I've seen so far. So, I've obviously seen as all of you have the incredible depth of strength in HIV and in HCV and more broadly from HCV into liver diseases where obviously NASH and hep B are paramount. At the same time, I've had a chance to see the broader portfolio in inflammation with filgotinib at the lead of a comprehensive life cycle management program as well as some very interesting partnerships and earlier-stage molecules in inflammation. And likewise in oncology, of course, with the cell therapy being in a leadership position and all the life cycle managements that go around cell therapy, but also the interesting partnerships around both the biologics and small molecule oncology program. So -- still early days of digging into that, but I've been impressed by the breadth, I would say of the portfolio and the partnerships and some of the recent BD activities. Now specifically related to NASH and hep B, I would say that, what I've come to understand about NASH is the significant unmet medical need and growing unmet medical need I would say. And although, the results in the first quarter this year didn't turn out as we had expected, it's very clear that this disease -- needs scientific advancements. It's a heterogeneous disease. There are challenges with diagnosis. And at the same time, Gilead's experts in liver disease make it an area of continued interest for us and I'm particularly interested in the fact that a disease like this with the challenges associated with it may very well require combination therapies. And of course, we'll have some readouts and our combination approaches in the second half of this year, and you heard already from John some of the partnerships that we're entering to in that front. Hep B, similarly I mean, obviously, we have a treatment for hep B today, which we will continue to focus on. But the opportunity to continue to try to advance the science in hep B particularly around moving towards a cure is something that I've been impressed by to see the different scientific approaches that the scientists here at Gilead are looking at. So bottom-line Geoff is that I think that NASH and hep B as areas of liver and with the expertise of Gilead are areas we need to continue to explore both internally and through partnerships as a part of a broader portfolio of approaches across different therapeutic areas. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please. Brian Abrahams : Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. On filgotinib. Coming out of FINCH 1 and 3 where do you see the most differentiation for that product versus currently available in late-stage -- therapies in late-stage JAK1 inhibitors? And obviously you're waiting FDA feedback, but I'm curious your willingness to file prior to completion of the MANTA study. I guess, how do you weigh speed to market for that product in a competitive space versus having to potentially optimize label right of the pad at the launch? Thanks. John McHutchison : Thanks, Brian. It's John here. Multi-part question. But look we are -- let me just step back a bit and think time -- summarize what we think about the entire data set. We have the full data package now from a Phase III clinical trial. We have over 3.5 \u2013 3,200 patients. Look we've shown in terms of characterization and although it's hard to do head-to-head comparisons across drugs, across studies of course. What we have seen in our FINCH program consistent with our Phase II program is deep efficacy responses in broad patient population. And if you're a practicing rheumatologist that's what's most important to you. You're not getting to ACR20 you're getting strong ACR50 and strong ACR70 responses -- remission responses low disease activity. And all the FINCH trial shows those deep responses when you characterize them by those characteristics. Look each of the studies achieved all of their primary endpoints, and they showed improvement in functional status. And where we explored it we showed that we could slow the rate of structural damage on the X-ray files. So these are all important additional advantages of the drug or what we showed in that clinical programs So we'll go to -- as I said today on the earnings call we have the full data package. We're impressed by the risk benefit. We think it's relevant to patients and rheumatologists. We'll be able to file in Europe in the second half of this year, and we'll go and have a discussion now with the FDA. We've requested that meeting where we'll sit down and talk with them about what we have in terms of data from the MANTA studies what we have in terms of our Phase III registrational programs and what we should do. And the time the time lines around that will play out during that meeting. But look I think it's important to us and Dan has brought this with his fresh eyes on the program recently is that there is some degree of urgency for us to get this drug approved as quickly as we can and obviously in collaboration with the regulators across the world. A \u2013 Daniel O'Day: No, I would just -- thank you John. I would just add Brian that I think it's, yes I've been impressed by the profile of the product through all three FINCH studies and the consistency and the outcome and the results on both the efficacy and safety side. And knowing that rheumatoid arthritis patients are waiting for highly efficacious medicines that also have good safety and tolerability profiles. I think, we're looking forward to the totality now the discussion with the FDA. So we put the request for the meeting. We expect to have that meeting by midyear and we'll be looking forward to getting back to you on kind of the next steps. But we remain bullish on this and looking forward to bringing this as soon as possible to patients around the world and in the U.S. John McHutchison : And of course, if I could add -- thank you, Dan but the safety -- I forgot to mention --unfortunately, the safety profile. We actually had a press release about this because we thought it was important as well. And again, it's impossible to make cross-drug cross-trial comparisons, but the safety profile we're seeing with this JAK1-specific inhibitor leads us to believe we have an additional benefit for patients as well. We're seeing low rates of infections, low rates of discontinuation, herpes zoster, thromboembolic events, cardiovascular events and so forth. So we also believe that that's an important advantage for the patients as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink. Your question please. Mr. Porges, you might have your phone on mute? Geoffrey Porges : Thank you very much. Sorry, about that. Robin, it might be premature to say congratulations. I know you're around through the end of the year, but at the very least just wondering if you could help him with some Gmail settings. My storage is getting a little filled up. Robin Washington : I will work on that in 2020, Geoff. Geoffrey Porges : I'm sure you could take care of that. But seriously Dan, I wonder if you could comment and perhaps Robin could weigh in on this as well about capital allocation. You effectively returned 100% of your cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks this quarter. And obviously that's not really sustainable. But Dan, could you talk about how you feel about dividends versus buybacks? And whether you will be willing to make any firm commitment to a certain proportion of cash flow being returned to investors versus other items? Thanks. A \u2013 Daniel O'Day: Sure Geoff. And I know that Robin want to weigh on this as well but let me just say a couple of things. As you noted in my priorities, my top three priorities obviously focusing on the pipeline and understanding it both from a internal Gilead perspective and also what's on the outside horizon is my top priority as you can imagine. And therefore, I'm really pleased to get my deep dives into the R&D organization, but equally I should mention this. I spent a good amount of time with our corporate development organization and I think it's working really hand in glove with our research colleagues to identify and scan the external environments. And you can see the level of activity we've had now over the past year or so 1.5 years lots of partnerships and things that are going to supplement that portfolio, so back to the capital allocation. I consider it really to be in the following order in terms of priority. And the first one is where we can find opportunities to supplement our portfolio through M&A or partnerships that's priority number one because we think that's in the best interest of the long-term journey of shareholders in the company. Secondly then I would say obviously we want to keep an attractive dividend policy. And I think that's been shown by the past behavior that I've seen coming into Gilead. And then thirdly, smartly looking at share repurchases when those make sense. So I'm very clear that those are the orders of priority to create value for shareholders in my experience and also been reinforced on my journey into Gilead. Robin, what do you think about storage capacity? No he's talking about capital allocation? A \u2013 Robin Washington : Yes. I mean I think as we continued to discuss externally for you Dan and I'm going to -- I think we're very aligned in terms of our priorities Dan. I think you articulated that very well. We've been fairly consistent with continuing to focus on our dividend as being the primary shareholder return vehicle and we expect that to continue. And we believe ultimately that's very important to our shareholders. And share repurchases we've leveraged as you said where appropriate. So I think we continue to be aligned Geoff. You're right we have unnecessarily published a specific level of cash flow returns but I think if you look over the multiple year period, we've returned about 50% of free cash flows to shareholders in the forms of dividends as well as share repurchase and that vary year by year as we made the necessary investments to grow the company. We believe we have a financial flexibility to retain the dividend and make the investments at the end and the rest of the leadership team sees as appropriate to grow and strengthen the pipeline as Dan outlined. A \u2013 Daniel O'Day: And Geoff I would just say in my listening to you -- I've been listening to many of you on the phone here and beyond. And I think broadly speaking there was quite a bit of alignment between capital allocation policy. So hopefully we're also meeting your needs as well as the company needs which should go hand in hand. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jeffries. Your question please. Q \u2013 Michael Yee : Hey, thank you. I wanted to ask question to Dan. You listed pipeline enhancement as a top priority. Maybe just speak a little bit more to that in terms of how you're thinking about prioritizing parts of the pipeline. I mean at Roche which obviously you had a long time at. You didn't really do any deals about $8 billion but maybe just talk about how you think about what may be different here at Gilead and maybe the appetite for M&A? How you're looking at the environment out there here at Gilead? Thanks so much. A \u2013 Daniel O'Day: Yes, thanks Michael for the question. I mean maybe just to expand a little bit from the previous question, I would say that as usual I think priority number one is to -- is that our M&A activity is led by science at the end of the day. And therefore, one focuses on so many expertise that we have within the company and that would obviously be in the areas of now oncology with the acquisition of KITE and the growing portfolio, we have here liver diseases inflammation and HIV. Not to suggest that we want to be opportunistic on something that has an interesting scientific profile and a high unmet medical need where we think we could bring out a transformational difference. So I want you to know we're scanning the entirety of the environment and we're science-led. But obviously I think overall, you're generally better positioned to identify the opportunities where you have expertise in-house. And I think that was true in my previous company and its also seems to be true from what I've seen here at Gilead as well. And I think again -- I think as we all know, I think -- and it's been true here when I've looked at the Gilead activity over the past couple of years. Here the vast majority of the opportunities are kind of an early stage or a mid-stage. And I think the opportunity create value exists quite a bit in those areas, particularly when you can find something earlier or more exciting because of the relevance of your science. But having said that we also acknowledge that we need to look our late-stage portfolio and pipeline and strengthen that. And I think there's two different ways to do that. One is to look accelerating internal programs which I know John and the team are constantly looking at and I've been interested in speaking more about that, so there's maybe opportunities to take some risk and to accelerate things and to expedite things to applying resources. And the other thing is of course to bring interesting life stage assets in. So overall, I think the vast majority of the work that Gilead has done and arguably they've been quite successful with their late-stage acquisition approach over the course of their 30-year history. I mean, we'll be looking for opportunities like that, as well of course, to fulfill the pipeline with a keen sense on the science. And I think bolt-on type acquisitions are continued to be in my opinion the highest likelihood and the way that we'll be proceeding. John, I don't know if you want to add anything from your \u2013 thoughts of your? John McHutchison : I completely agree, Dan. I think we've always had the philosophy and the success with being led by the science. We feel much comfortable in making those decisions when we have the expertise internally as you articulated. And we are opportunistic and prepared to take risks when we feel the science and the opportunity and the need exists. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould from UBS. Your question please. Carter Gould : Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe to follow-up Dan on your comments around the KITE organizational structure and separating that as a own business unit. Maybe talk about what drove the decision? What you hope that will achieve? And maybe any sort of consequences for future BD focused on cell therapy? Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Absolutely, Carter. Yes I think the bottom line is that, I've been very encouraged by what I've seen at KITE, since I've come in and how the Gilead colleagues have approached to their entry into oncology in a very significant way. I think the concept of moving towards a new platform a new technology in this space as an entry point into oncology having come from a background of deep oncology experience and understanding the depth of a competitive environment is an intriguing way to go. So, to really go for a future-oriented technology I think makes a lot of sense. And then to supplement that, with interesting partnerships like the one that John and his team have done in bispecific antibodies for instance with Agenus and/or some of the interesting small molecule work that's going on here within the walls of Gilead. So first and foremost, I think one needs to consider the early, but interesting oncology work that's going on here at Gilead. And then, with that context we said \u2013 I said, as I've looked out in discussions with the leadership team that KITE itself in cell therapy oncology is in a ultra-competitive area. I think we have a leadership position, but I think we need to maintain that leadership position. And for the reasons of focus, we decided to create KITE as an independent business unit that will wake up and go to sleep every day thinking about how to be leaders in oncology cell therapy. Now that's not to suggest that, they won't work with the rest of the organization to complement as we know specifically in oncology the combination approach and the multi-science approach is absolutely the way to go. But we need to make sure we secure that leadership in cell therapy, while we complement it with combination approaches in immuno-oncology or targeted therapies or other mechanisms. So that's the context. Let's make sure, we win in cell therapy and leverage the remaining parts of the Gilead focus on oncology to win in the broader oncology market as well. So \u2013 and it's with that lens that, I took the decision to create a separate business unit to focus that, and now in the process of recruiting a CEO that will \u2013 reporting to me that will work very closely with the leadership team for success in oncology. Now on the BD side, they've been very active as you know since the KITE acquisition, a very active M&A and partnership work within cell therapy, which I think is fundamental and essential, because the science is occurring of course within KITE and cell therapy, but all around this as well. So I have been impressed with the landscape analysis that the BD team has done here with the research and development team at KITE and at Gilead. And I think we're really well positioned to continue to scan that environment and to complement it, with the appropriate pieces of the puzzle that we need to continue to write the next chapter in cell therapy history. And as John, articulated, its advances and hematologic malignancies, it's moving to solid tumors and it's also getting ready for the future of science, the allogeneic form as well, which has risks, but I think lots of opportunities as well. So, very comprehensive approach on the BD side and that will continue. John any perspective? John McHutchison : Completely agree, Dan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please. Ying Huang : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe for Daniel. Is there anything you actually want to change in the Gilead organization after two months in the job? And then maybe another one for John McHutchison quickly. You decided to have a collaboration with Novo Nordisk in NASH. How does it compare to the other mechanisms of actions in the market today or on the development today if you look at semaglutide data in NASH? Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Ying. And look let me first say that, I've been incredibly welcomed and very impressed with coming into Gilead. So I think I probably know more of what I don't want to change than what I do want to change after two months in the role. And that is the focus on science. I've been really impressed by the science and the motivation and intelligence of the colleagues at Gilead. I think both the level of expertise that is here in many different areas as well as the intrinsic motivation of our employees is something that I've been deeply, deeply impressed by. So, in terms of what to change, as I said before, I'm still in the process of evaluating the organization looking at pipeline, looking at commercial execution, looking at the organizational structure and people. And I think you would agree with me that, two months is really short period of time to evaluate that which is why I said there are certain things that I'm acting quickly on and won't hesitate to like the KITE decision and there are other things I think I need to learn a little bit more and understand. But it will be an evolution, not a revolution, and it will be based upon good observations, good discussions with the leadership teams in terms of how we progress here, so stay tuned on that. And I think, we as a leadership team and a leadership community here at Gilead with the Board, and we continue to have our outside ears open to investors and to thought leaders and to what our patient needs are. We'll continue the evolution of the company, and I'll be articulating better what my priorities are as I go into the later part of this year, and we'll certainly inform you as I go. So, thank you for the question. And John, will you? John McHutchison : Yes. We know that Novo Nordisk, Ying, that's a compelling mechanism of action. Novo Nordisk is clearly a leader in the pharmaceutical development of products for patients with diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Mechanism of action is not necessarily directly related to NASH, but it has many of the effects you would want to see in patients with NASH. And additionally and importantly, as well as all those other metabolic benefits in terms of glucose control influence secretion and so forth, as a weight loss component to this drug and a significant weight loss component. And that weight loss component, we think is very compelling for us to explore with our other mechanisms of action that are really focusing on different and separate drivers of NASH at the Genesis. So we believe it's a very exciting and a very important collaboration. Novo Nordisk brings a lot of people and a lot of depth of knowledge about metabolic syndrome to the table, whilst we bring a lot of expertise in liver disease. So it's a wonderful collaboration that we're just starting, and looking forward to. So we will combine a semaglutide without FXR agonists and our ACC drugs as well, and that will be the initial clinical collaboration. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore. Your question, please. Umer Raffat : Hi. Thank you so much for taking my question, and welcome again Dan, for your first Gilead call. I wanted to keep it fairly high level today. I'll maybe just ask Dan. Do you see Gilead as growing top line into 2020s? And also, what are the biggest risks and the biggest opportunities that you see at Gilead currently? Daniel O\u2019Day: Thanks a lot Umer for the warm welcome again. I really appreciate, and look forward to working with all of you, and obviously articulating my views and visions for the company as I go. It is definitely premature to talk about sales in 2020 at this stage. In fact, in the first two months, I've really been focusing, as you know, on pipeline and understanding our current commercial delivery. We will over the coming months of course, in the natural process of thing start to digest the progress that we have for this year, the opportunities we have for next year and put those into some ideas of a plan. So I think it's a bit too premature for that. What I can assure you is that we'll give you a sense for that much later in the year. At this stage, I mean, maybe just to add a little additional color to that from the way that I see the business today. I see the strengths in HIV clearly as a real foundation of course of Gilead and a strong and growing business. Laura mentioned the progress in Biktarvy. Both Laura and John talked about the really good data on the Descovy and the opportunity there with the DISCOVER trial. So, I do see good strength in the HIV business. I see the opportunity that HCV is much more predictable at this stage and a much smaller part of the overall revenue turnover at Gilead. And then I see the future opportunities, such as filgotinib and others that we'll be discussing with all of you as upside to that relatively stable base. And the question that I need to digest with the team is to understand how and when those opportunities will be hitting, and I just want to give you a little bit more color as to how I see the business and I think the opportunity. So what are the risks and opportunities, again, I need a bit more time than two months to come back to you with a comprehensive list. I think I've given you a bit of an idea in the call here today. I do think that there are tremendous opportunities in the early mid-stage pipeline, and I think we also have a real opportunity with filgotinib. I mean this is a profile of a product in a space that needs -- the patients and physicians need more treatment options, and they're looking for treatment options that are highly efficacious that are safe and that are convenient. And so, I think I've been working with organization with the leadership team to really think about how can we accelerate some of the plans around filgotinib, how do we get ready for entering this very competitive space. And obviously with all of these launches comes both risks and opportunities, but I do think that we have a very good profile product on which to build one of our next legs successfully the whole leg of inflammation accordingly. Likewise, I think we should mention in that same statement around the overall business picture, the ongoing success of Yescarta, the ability to think about moving into other diseases and hematologic malignancies, lots of readouts on Yescarta, just reviewing with John just before the call. There's a lot of interesting readouts that will come in the coming year, two years, three years that I think will help us understand the utility of cell therapy both with and without combination approaches in oncology. So I'll give you an even more complete view of the business Umer, later this year from my perspective, but those are some of my early insights into what I've seen so far. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau from Cowen and Company. Your question please. Phil Nadeau : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Robin let me add my congratulations on the announcement of your retirement. Dan, a question for you actually on HIV just to focus their. Gilead's clearly been a leader in HIV treatment for almost two decades. But arguably you fall behind in the development of nucleotide-sparing regimens and long-acting regimens, so you brought fresh eyes to looking at your HIV portfolio. How do you see the treatment of HIV evolving over the next five to 10 years? And do you feel like Gilead's HIV pipeline has all the programs that it needs to stay competitive over that period? Daniel O\u2019Day: Thanks, Phil and I welcome John and Laura to feed in on this as well, but I'll give you my top line take first. And that is that there's no doubt that Gilead is the leader in HIV has been for a long time and to your point, so we need to make sure that we continue to have the most significant next advance for patients and that's certainly been the case for TAF. From TAF the regimens and to the Descovy regimens, and now of course with the PrEP data and certainly there's lots more that we can do in improving the patient experience in HIV including long acting as you mentioned and other approaches. So I think there's a very comprehensive life cycle plan around this and I think that thinking this got into this in terms of making sure that the next generation programs like a long acting are something that are going to be well received by the patients that are convenient easy to take and really allow for if you like the next best advance from a daily oral medicine, which is let's face it the highly convenient to begin with. So I think they really scrutinize the target profile well and I think the science that's growing on here is well-positioned to continue to take the next meaningful advances for patients into the future. But I would ask John if you want to feed in on this, great? John McHutchison : Sure. Thanks, Phil. Phil we have led the field of HIV therapeutic development for over a decade. And one of the critical components of that approach and our success has been no resistance. And that has been achieved with effective three drug regimens. So, for example, with all the Biktarvy studies as you know we have no resistance through week 96, which is a critical advantage for anybody. You can't afford to increase the fragility of a regimen by decreasing or diminishing or cutting out one of the components, and theoretically or not theoretically increasing the risk of resistance. So that's very important. Now two drug regimens with adherence is potentially not so important such as an effective long-acting regimen is actually one of our critical programs internally. And we believe that our ultimate goal with the long-acting regimen should be a subcutaneous at-home small volume, non-painful injection that's probably got two components to it, but it won't have that adherence issue to it and we'd like to be giving it every three months. That would be a great advance for patients as well. And in terms of our other activities in HIV, we have many cure programs as you know. We also have programs for those most in need in terms of the highly resistant groups of patients and then of course we have all of our PrEP programs as we discussed on the call today. So we are very much laser-focused on maintaining our leadership position scientifically and for patients with HIV and preventing HIV by all of these initiatives. So I think the issue of two versus three drug regimens has to be put in context of the decades of history of this disease and where the long-acting ultimate goal should be. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Your question please. Cory Kasimov : Hey, good afternoon guys, and thank you for taking my question. I also have one on HIV, but more from a near-term commercial standpoint. So basically curious how you're thinking about potential pricing pressures within the category over the near to medium-term from both potential U.S. health care reform as well as competitors entering the space at substantial discounts to Gilead's regimens? Thanks. Laura Hamill : Thanks for the question. This is Laura. So let me start off with the pricing pressures in the U.S. health care and I assume you're talking about is maybe the protected class with the Medicare population. So let me just address that. We've been actively engaged in a discussion around the protected class and this is the Part D benefit for the senior population. And all along I think what's most important for the senior population is to ensure that they have access to safe and effective medicines that are appropriate for the guidelines. We really want to make sure that there is no prior authorization that impedes rapid treatment and renewal of the long-term treatment for patients. And I think that there's been a significant groundswell across the community of advocacy of people positioned that really believe that it's important for the Medicare population to have access to the HIV regiments that they need and to maintain a protected class. So that's specific to the Medicare population. As it relates to the commercial population, I would say that we're very pleased with the amazing coverage that we've been able to achieve with Biktarvy. Over 90% of the plans have Biktarvy rapidly available. You can see that in the numbers and what we just said in terms of treatment-na\u00efve and switch patient. How quickly patients are moving to Biktarvy and obviously 80% of our overall prescription is coming from a Descovy base backbone. So we don't feel significant pressure on the commercial side as it relates to coverage and access. As it relates to the overall growth that we see as I mentioned, we had a 12% prescription growth year-over-year. And we've continued to maintain double-digit growth for the last couple of years. So, I'm very, very pleased with that. And then finally you asked about the competition and pricing pressure. So I think we've always tried to make sure we bring innovation into the market. And I believe there are -- for Gilead it's been the 11 products in 17 years. We've always been mindful of the pricing in the market to make sure that our innovation gets rapid access and people can access these new brands. And if we look at new entrants, I believe that their pricing is relative to the branded pricing of the component. So for example Truvada is really the branded price of the two drugs. And I believe Biktarvy has been also priced very competitively within the Descovy base backbone. So we feel very comfortable with our pricing. A \u2013 Robin Washington : Yeah. Cory I'd just add also. Remember that for Gilead our franchise has really been driven by volume right. Pricing has been frozen in the public market, since I've been here. So, we don't get real upside relative to pricing particularly in the U.S. and as you know ex-U.S. it's all pricing decreases. So, I'm totally in agreement with everything Laura, provided in terms of our focus legislatively and competitively. But it's just -- underlying price has never been a key factor when you take a look at our HIV revenues. Operator : Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein, your question please? Q \u2013 Ronny Gal : Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. And thanks for filling me in. Two there if I can. One, about HCV, I noticed the agreements you just had in the U.K. and the one you had in Louisiana. Can you just explain to us from a financial perspective, how you're thinking about this? There's some implied discount in those contracts. But obviously you're getting access to other patients you wouldn't otherwise. So can you just tell us how you're thinking about this as a strategy? And then, coming back to this issue of HIV pricing I hear you about not raising prices. But Robin, I think you mentioned that with this shift of patients, to government programs you're actually seeing a bit of a net decline. And if we look at the revenue reported and divided by IMS scripts, we are seeing kind of like modest declines year-over-year in your price point. Should that be the baseline assumption going forward? Essentially more people going on those programs. You guys not raising prices. And that's in effect we should see a net price decrease a little bit per year the way the market is looking right now? A \u2013 Robin Washington : Yeah, Ronny I'll take that -- the second part of your question. What I was referring to was just a shift relative to when public buyers purchase right. And that's about payer mix right? And typically in Q1 as even the ADAP cycle, we do see that downward shift driven by payer mix. The biggest overall driver of our sequential decline this past quarter however was not pricing at all, it was inventory right. So I just want to clarify that and happy to follow up after the call on that component. Laura, do you want to address the Louisiana and \u2026 A \u2013 Laura Hamill : The U.K., Yeah, yeah. A \u2013 Robin Washington : \u2026the Washington markets? A \u2013 Laura Hamill : Yes. So -- and you -- I think you also mentioned U.K. if I heard you correctly. I thought it was U.K. and maybe Louisiana and Washington was it all 3? Q \u2013 Ronny Gal : Yes. A \u2013 Laura Hamill : Yeah okay. So let me talk about the U.K. and then I'll also talk about Louisiana. So, really our goal is to make sure that we work with governments the best we can whether it's federal or state or country to be able to provide the appropriate access for patients. And we believe HCV is a huge value to the health care system. So as it relates to Louisiana. This is particular to the needs of that government. And really if you think about what we're trying to accomplish with Louisiana they wanted to be able to treat a number of patients. But their annual budget is a certain amount every year. So if you think about five years you have certain amount every year. But the need actually is to treat more people earlier on. So really the discussion that we\u2019re in with Louisiana is how do we, basically smooth that out so you don't have a big peak and then a trough. From a payment perspective, we can be flexible to try to work within the needs of the budgets and be able to give people access. From the U.K. perspective, we're partnering with the U.K. as it relates to really an elimination project in the U.K. and they're actually a number of governments around the world that Gilead participates in arrangements such as this and really that's the focus. There's a price, and then we're also working to make sure that we find patients, and get them properly diagnosed and treated. And then finally, the last thing that I wanted to mention, which kind of plays into all of this as you all know is the launch of the AG by our subsidiary Asegua. And, I think that was another opportunity or strategy that was deployed by Gilead to make sure we were servicing the needs of the managed Medicaid market. So, we have the flexibility between the Gilead portfolio, of Sovaldi Harvoni and Epclusa. That is made available in the commercial market. And of course Asegua is also available in the commercial markets. But specifically to address the needs of managed -- the managed Medicaid market we have offered up this opportunity to be able to address their particular needs. So hopefully that addresses your question. A \u2013 Robin Washington : Perfect. So, Ronny I also wanted to go back to the other component that HIV line also includes prevention right so flat. So to your point there is that impact on the average price per patient. Because it's not the STR you're looking at the Descovy component of that right so that would also impact average price per patient as PrEP users -- PrEP usage continues to go up as well. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Sung Lee for any further remarks. Sung Lee : Thank you, Jonathan. And thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead. And the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on our future progress. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

My name is Liz and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sung Lee : Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the second quarter of 2019. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website. The speakers on today's call will be : Daniel O'Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Johanna Mercier, Chief Commercial Officer; and Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room are Diana Brainard, Senior Vice President and Head of our HIV and Emerging Viruses Therapeutic Area; and John Sundy, Senior Vice President and Head of our Inflammation Therapeutic Area. Before we begin with our prepared comments, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital all of which involve certain assumptions risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website. I will now turn the call over to Dan. Daniel O'Day: Well, thank you, Sung, and good afternoon, everyone. It's now month five and I'm really pleased that I've had a chance now to talk with you the second time in the second quarter after the first quarter call with some very good results. I would like to share a few opening comments and then I'm going to turn the call over to Johanna Mercier, who joined us at the beginning of the month, as our new Chief Commercial Officer. Very happy to have Joanna with us as well. Robin will then take over and walk you through some of the highlights of the strong quarter. So let me just start by saying, I'm really pleased with the progress we're making across all the fronts. As one example, as the leader in HIV, we're very focused on continuous innovation as you may have seen from some of the recent data we presented. Biktarvy is the number one regimen in the United States now. Momentum continues to build and we expect that momentum to continue in the future. I mentioned on the last quarter that I would focus on three key priorities as I came into this organization : The first one was the pipeline; the second one was optimal commercial delivery that's both for our current products but also as we prepare for some new and important and exciting launches; and then, thirdly, really people, the organization bringing the right team together at the right time for Gilead. And as you can see we've had a very busy quarter. We've announced key changes this quarter that helped to address really all three of these priorities. And importantly we've made these changes against the backdrop of strong financials and really promising pipeline progress. So let me say a few words about the major steps we've taken to, first of all, strengthen the pipeline with the Galapagos collaboration; secondly, I want to dive a little bit into the highlights from our current pipeline; and three talk a little bit about the organizational changes as well. So first on Galapagos, it\u2019s fresh news. Earlier this month we announced an exciting new collaboration with Galapagos. As you know, Galapagos is a highly productive R&D engine. They have seven medicines now in clinical development including filgotinib, which has a very comprehensive of life cycle program. And they have more than 20 medicines now in preclinical and their model has been very productive at producing new candidates for the clinic every year. And of course with our increased investments we would expect that to even increase in the future. This is a really unique collaboration because it combines complementary strengths between Gilead and Galapagos and very importantly and, as you know, we structured this to allow Galapagos to remain independent. Many of you know my past. I'm a big believer that innovation requires independence, I think to be preserved. And the structure of this deal allows us to preserve the great science and talent at Galapagos. They can invest and innovate to accelerate the progress based upon our investments. And in return we have an exclusive access right to their proven drug discovery platform. All of this I believe will help patients, science, and our business in a very significant way. So I was really pleased this was the first collaboration that I could announce under my tenure and yet, this is still a beginning. We'll continue to explore other ways to strengthen our pipeline and our innovation network in the future. Secondly, on the pipeline side, this has been an important time for our existing pipeline. Let me touch on a couple of things that speak to our growth potential before handing it over to Johanna. And there's two things I want to just highlight here, some recent promising HIV data that we presented recently; and secondly, since the last quarter our plans to file filgotinib for approval. So, first of all, we had a terrific week last week at the International AIDS Society Conference on HIV Science. We were able to present clinical data for our first-in-class HIV capsid inhibitor, the GS-6207. And as you saw the early results support further development as a long-acting therapy that we think will really meet the needs of the community that we serve. And then we also presented further data on Descovy for PrEP, additional data that reinforces the profile of the Descovy in the PrEP setting. And as you know this is currently under regulatory view in the United States. And we also have plans to file Descovy for PrEP in the EU in the first half of 2020. We are looking forward to the FDA advisory committee that will be held next week. And overall, we're encouraged by the government's engagement around HIV prevention in many forms. The advisory committee will be an important opportunity and provide an -- a forum for Gilead to talk about the benefits of Descovy in the prevention setting for a broad population of individuals at risk for HIV. So secondly, on filgotinib, as you know now based upon a meeting with the agency we intend to file for U.S. approval for filgotinib later this year in rheumatoid arthritis based upon our discussions with the FDA. We will also be filing in the EU really eminently at this stage, so overall very good news on the path for filgotinib. I had the chance actually recently to attend the EULAR meeting, the Annual European Congress of Rheumatology in Madrid so I can get a first-hand view of the enthusiasm among physicians and thought leaders about the profile of filgotinib and the potential it has to be a best-in-class among the JAK1 inhibitors. Finally then a few comments about the work we've been doing to build the right team for the future. I'm very pleased to welcome Johanna who you'll hear from next; and Christi Shaw who joins us from Eli Lilly. She will start as CEO of Kite on August 1. And as you know with Christi's arrival at Kite, Kite will become its own business unit and we remain committed to accelerating the pipeline and maintaining our leadership position in cell therapy. I'd also like to very much extend the thanks to three leaders who will be leaving Gilead, John McHutchison, Gregg Alton and Katie Watson. John Greg and Katie have all made tremendous contributions that helped to shape today's results that you're seeing and really Gilead's progress over the past many year\u2019s decades in fact. So I'd like to thank them as we transition the team forward for Gilead. So, in closing, from my side, I just wanted to emphasize how increasingly optimistic I am about the future of Gilead and the potential that it has. This is a unique company. It's a company that cures hepatitis C and transformed HIV. I'm getting an up-close view of the unique strengths that made that possible. I'm looking forward to working with all the talented people at Gilead as we apply those strengths to the next wave of transformational advances in various diseases. We're making great progress and there's much more to come and I look forward to continuing to share more about my vision for the future later this year as I communicated. But as you can tell, I'm not waiting for that we're implementing along the course of that strategy with many of the things that you've seen in this past quarter. So I'd like to thank all of our employees and partners around the world for their dedication and hard work to bench with successful quarter and whose commitment will continue to make us successful in the future. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Johanna. Johanna Mercier : Thanks Dan and good afternoon everyone. So although, I'm only one month in I've become to get to know the company the people and I just want to say how impressed I've been by the talent and the strength of the team as well as what we've accomplished so far. And today I wanted to take the opportunity to maybe highlight two areas that really caught my attention, both of which I believe are real growth opportunities moving forward for Gilead. Those are the strength of our HIV business both in treatment as well as in prevention as well as the potential for filgotinib. So if we start with HIV. You'll hear from Robin describing in more detail our results for the quarter, but our HIV portfolio have never been stronger. Biktarvy continues to be a very impressive launch. It's on an incredible trajectory. It just hit its first $1 billion quarter in the U.S. for Q2. It's now the number one prescribed regimen in the U.S. for both na\u00efve and switch patients as well as number one for na\u00efve in switch in Germany, in France and in Spain. We just got reimbursement in Italy and the U.K. in the last two months or so, so more to come on performance there. As Dan mentioned we had a really strong showing last week at the International AIDS Society Conference presenting research that really demonstrated the breadth of the scientific work across our pipeline from prevention to treatment to cure. This included a couple of new announces of our Descovy for PrEP. We really believe that Descovy for PrEP could offer important safety advantages over Truvada as it shows superior safety for bone and renal as well as rapid onset and longer duration of preventative therapy than Truvada. These are really clinically meaningful to individuals, physicians and payers for two main reasons. Individuals at risk of HIV are not patients but they're generally healthy people. So therefore the bar for safety among this population is just so much higher. The second reason is the persistency on PrEP has increased actually similar to that that what we're seeing in HIV treatment patient. In addition, younger people are initiating this therapy at the time when they're actually building peak bone mass. So overall, people on preventative therapy are on for longer periods of time, which is what makes these results even more compelling. And that's exactly what we heard from physicians at AdBoard last week during the conference. So we're very excited about what's to come with DESCOVY in PrEP. Dan mentioned that we're under review with the FDA for the prevention of HIV. And for the reasons, I've just shared we really believe it had significant potential to make a difference in the life of a broad population of individuals at risk of HIV. So that's the first real growth opportunity both in HIV treatment as well as in PrEP. The second one is around filgotinib. I really see commended potential in filgotinib and the teams you can imagine they're really hard at work in preparing the launch of this medicine. It's a high priority for me and the team and the whole organization. Although, it's a very competitive space and we know that, we truly have an opportunity to make a difference in the lives of people living with RA and potentially even other inflammatory indication as these are just such debilitating diseases. And yes there are numerous treatments on the market for RA. However, many patients aren't actually helped by the therapies that are currently available. The FINCH studies highlight the strong efficacy and tolerability results of filgotinib in different patient types. Filgotinib a JAK1 specific inhibitor could actually answer a clear unmet need in the marketplace for an efficacious and safe oral agent. So, still to come on that, and obviously more to come on the filing in the second half of this year. So with that, I really look forward to working with this great team to deliver on the promise of this medicine and to getting to speak with you in more detail in the near future. I just want to take a moment to thank everyone for such a warm welcome as I've arrived a month ago. And now, I'll turn the call over to Robin. Robin? Robin Washington : Thank you, Johanna, and welcome. Good afternoon, everyone. As Dan said in his opening comments, we had a strong quarter led by our HIV franchise, predictable performance in HCV and continued growth of Yescarta. Total revenues for the second quarter were $5.7 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.82. This compares to revenues of $5.6 billion, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.91 for the same period last year. Total revenues in non-GAAP earnings per share for the second quarter benefited from an approximately $160 million adjustment for statutory revenue clawback reserve, primarily related to HIV and HCV sales in Europe from prior years, which contributed $0.10 per share. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the same quarter last year benefited from a settlement of a tax examination, which contributed $0.15 per share. So starting with HIV. Total HIV sales for the second quarter were $4 billion. In the U.S. HIV product sales for the second quarter were $3.2 billion, up 13% year-over-year, and up 14% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by robust underlying prescription demand growth up 13%. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter in which HIV sales have posted double-digit year-over-year growth. And the first quarter in which Biktarvy surpassed the $1 billion mark, becoming the number one prescribed regimen for all patients. More than 40% of new patients started on Biktarvy. It is by the growing momentum of Biktarvy, Descovy-based regimens accounted for 83% of our prescription volume for HIV treatment. Sequentially, the increase was primarily driven by the continued uptake of Biktarvy and PrEP and the full quarter impact of price increases taken in March of this year. In Europe, HIV product sales for the second quarter were $623 million, and benefited approximately $70 million from the adjustment for statutory revenue clawback reserves related to sales meeting in prior years. Excluding the adjustment our HIV product sales in Europe would have slightly declined sequentially. The year-over-year decline was predictable driven by the broad availability of generic versions of Truvada. We continue to see, however, the impact from generics moderating as the uptake of Descovy-based products progresses. Biktarvy is now available across the EU5 with launches occurring in Italy in June, and in the U.K. in July. Already in France, Germany and Spain Biktarvy is the number one regimen for na\u00efve and switch patients. With access increasing for Biktarvy, we're optimistic that the declines in our European HIV business will continue to moderate and that our Descovy-based franchise will continue to grow. Turning to HCV total HCV sales for the second quarter were $842 million. U.S. product sales for the second quarter were $355 million, down 35% year-over-year, and down 10% sequentially. The year-over-year U.S. decline was in line with our expectation and primarily due to competitive dynamics and lower patient starts. Sequentially, the decrease was primarily due to the Q1 purchasing activity by a state Department of Corrections. As a reminder, we mentioned on our prior call that Q1 U.S. HCV sales were positively impacted by the timing of the state Department of Corrections order. We're very encouraged by the performance of the Asegua authorized generics, which accounted for more than 25% of our U.S. HCV revenues and continue to improve our HCV competitive positioning. In Europe, HCV product sales for the second quarter were $277 million and benefited approximately $80 million from the adjustment for statutory revenue claw back reserves related to sales made in prior years. Without the adjustment HCV, product sales would have declined 15% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Turning to cell therapy. Worldwide Yescarta sales for the second quarter were $120 million, up 76% year-over-year and 25% sequentially. We were pleased with the steady adoption of Yescarta. Our efforts in the U.S. remain focused on educating providers on the profile of Yescarta and identification of appropriate patients. Additionally, as the centers for Medicare and Medicaid services looks to finalize the annual Medicare IPPS rule for fiscal year 2020, we continue to engage with agency officials and other stakeholders with the goal of improving Medicare reimbursement and access for patients over 65 years of age. This remains an area of focus to ensure continued uptake of Yescarta. In Europe, Yescarta has launched in Germany, the U.K., France and Spain among the larger countries. Overall, we have been very impressed with the speed at which countries have provided reimbursement and the pace at which centers are being certified. Finally, I would like to comment on our cardiovascular products. As expected, we saw generic versions of Letairis introduced during the quarter. Letairis and Ranexa sales totaled $223 million for the second quarter, down 51% year-over-year and down 37% sequentially as a result of competition from generics. Letairis sales were sequentially higher in the second quarter primarily due to a favorable inventory dynamics compared to a drawdown in Q1. But underlying prescriptions demand is eroding and we anticipate going forward, sales will decline as we absorb the full quarter impact of generics. Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $916 million for the second quarter, down slightly compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the 2018 impact of our purchase of a priority review voucher largely offset by higher investments to support our cell therapy program. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $1 billion for the second quarter, up 21% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher promotional expenses in the U.S. and expenses associated with the expansion of Gilead's business in Japan and China. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the second quarter was 21.5% compared to 13.4 % in the same period last year, which was impacted by a one-time favorable settlement of a tax examination. Moving to the balance sheet. During the second quarter, we generated $2.2 billion in cash from operations and ended the quarter with $30.2 billion in cash and investments. We repaid $500 million of senior unsecured notes, paid cash dividends of $800 million and repurchased 9 million shares of stock for $588 million. Moving to our guidance, we are raising our full year net product sales guidance based on favorable demand trends in the first half across our portfolio and the one-time adjustment for Europe statutory revenue claw back reserves. Net product sales are expected to be in the range of $21.6 billion to $22.1 billion. We are also updating our full year diluted EPS impact of GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments, which are expected to be in the range of $3.90 to $4 a share as a result of the collaboration agreement with Galapagos. All other components of our guidance remained unchanged. With regard to full year SG&A guidance, we are leaving that unchanged as we prepare for future lunches of filgotinib for rheumatoid arthritis. Our guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties, which are outlined in slides 23 to 24 in our earnings call presentation. So I want to thank everyone very much for joining today's call. Let's now open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Today\u2019s question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask one related to the HIV pipeline. I noticed that you've got a breakthrough designation on the capsid inhibitor, and I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the path to registration and how breakthrough enables you to potentially move that product ahead? And if you could just also comment on what you see as the patient opportunity for that product as well? Daniel O\u2019Day: Great, Matthew. So, we had Diana here and she will be more than happy to address that. Diana Brainard : Yeah. Thanks. Hi, this is Diana Brainard. We're very excited that the FDA recognized the importance of the capsid inhibitor GS-6207 by providing it with breakthrough designation for heavily treatment experienced patients with multidrug resistance. This is a small segment of the HIV population, but represents a really high unmet medical need. These individuals have limited treatment options due to the resistance they have, and this highlights one of the important components of our capsid inhibitor, which is to say because it is first-in-class, there's no pre-existing resistance to this class and it makes it really a unique compound in that regard and that's part of the value it brings. Of course the other piece is that it's long-acting. And so we see it as having value across a broad range of patient populations. In terms of the past two registration, what breakthrough designation does is allows us to communicate more frequently and have more dialogue with FDA. And in fact we have plans to do that in the coming weeks where we'll get more clarity on exactly how we can best move our capsid inhibitor forward in this population as quickly as possible. Sung Lee : Great. Thank You. Could we have the next? Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Brian Abrahams : Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. Maybe another question on the capsid inhibitor. How important will it be to pair that with additional antiretroviral agents? Can you talk about where you are with respect to development of long-acting forms of internal assets that could potentially pair with 6207? And along those lines, what's your sense at this point kind of mapping the Phase 1 PK data with the Phase 2 of viral decline data as to how often, how frequently you think patients will need to be dosed in order to maintain adequate exposures and still have a small injection volume for that drug? Thanks so much. Robin Washington : Sure. Well, so I think when we talk about developing long-acting regimens, we're envisioning the capsid will need to be partnered with the second agent. And to that end we've got a number of different internal candidates to become partners with capsid and we hope to be rolling that data out and those plans out over the next coming months. In terms of the frequency of injection. One of the things about capsid that's so exciting is that it\u2019s got picomolar potency, which really makes it in order of magnitude more potent than any other approved antiretroviral and allows us to give the amount of drug needed for very long-term injections. And so really the frequency of drug injection is going to be dictated in large part by the partner and also by the formulation and we're still gaining clarity on what the initial regimens will look like, but there's a huge potential here for very infrequent dosing. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Michael Yee : Hey thanks for the question. Congrats on a good quarter. I wanted to talk a bit more high level about R&D. Obviously, John McHutchison not sure if you're in the room but it's been good to spend the years together particularly in the HCV days, but maybe just to comment either from John, but obviously Dan going forward, where the shape of R&D goes from here? What you would like to try to do in the next say 12, 24 months? How oncology plays with that? And then the second part of the question is, since you've done this Galapagos deal, it would seem that that's a big part of early stage discovery, how much of your R&D is early stage discovery? And does that help offset some of that again, sort of, it led to the first question. Thanks. Daniel O\u2019Day: Yeah. Thanks Michael. Can I just get some clarity on your second question, sorry, around Galapagos. I want to make sure I understand what your question was there? Michael Yee : Yeah. I guess, if you can quantify or describe how much of your R&D budget I think it's $3.5 billion, $4 billion is early stage discovery, it would seem that Galapagos is going to be either additive to that as resources? Or that that could actually allocate some of your R&D early stage to have them and do some of that and supplement that? Daniel O\u2019Day: Okay, thanks. So Michael first of all, thanks a lot, we will certainly pass your good wishes on to John McHutchison. He's got his team here but he's not in the room today, but John has really made tremendous contributions to Gilead and we wish him nothing but the best as he seeks his next challenge. But let me just comment first on your first question about the shape of R&D next 12 months to 24 months. Well, again I think a lot has happened in the past quarter just to emphasize -- where we stood when we spoke just a few months ago. Certainly, we've had progress on the HIV front, which we just spoke about in the first two questions with Diana. But we've also gotten much greater clarity around the path forward for Filgotinib. And with that path forward with Filgotinib in rheumatoid arthritis, I remind you we have a very broad and extensive program around Filgotinib and other diseases that's including IBB. And so -- we really have had a good quarter for our internal portfolio. Now moving forward, I mean, obviously our emphasis is on growth it's on long-term growth. It's on our ability to shape that R&D portfolio into an area where we have a good number of innovative medicines balanced across our stages of development. As we spoke about last time, one of the areas that we really need to continue to strengthen is our late-stage portfolio as well. And I do think that the collaboration with Galapagos and some of the acceleration of molecules that we have within Gilead will help us to strengthen that late-stage portfolio. I remind you with Galapagos they have two products that are in later stage; one for IPF and one for osteoarthritis in addition to the broad program around Filgotinib. But moving forward and more on this Michael later in the year, obviously information with the lead with Filgotinib, the work we have on HIV, long-acting treatments for highly experienced patients in care programs, oncology is a clear focus. And it certainly is within the cell therapy realm where we've had really some transformational effects on a subset of B-cell lymphomas. And -- our strategy there is to bring it to earlier alliance of therapy with B-cell lymphoma to other hematologic malignancies to potentially solid tumors and to allogeneic. And then we're bridging that across to a broader oncology portfolio that will continue to advise you on within Gilead and partners that include small molecules and biospecific antibodies that will be focused on really providing significant benefits for patients with high unmet medical needs in oncology. And then finally, of course, liver diseases. We continue to work in the liver area and Hepatitis B. We have important data readouts on NASH later this year. So, I think, when we sit here in the next couple of quarters a lot of these things are also going to come to more fruition. We'll get a chance to look at what we have in our hands today in terms of late stage -- in terms of our portfolio. And we'll continue to supplement that with innovation from the outside, innovation network like Galapagos. Secondarily, on Galapagos in particular, I think, it's probably the best way to put it into context and I said this on the call previously with Galapagos, it's with the collaboration with Galapagos we essentially double our research capacity. And what does that mean? I mean, we've got roughly the same number of scientific colleagues across the two organizations. In fact Galapagos will be increasing their number to get a little closer to what we have at Gilead, but it provides with two sources of early-stage discovery input into our late-stage portfolio. And I think that's very exciting because if we can get two highly productive research engines speeding the late-stage portfolio that speaks well for kind of the future of our portfolio as we move forward. We haven't really completely disclosed exactly the spending patterns in each of those areas. I'll suffice it to say that those investments will be driven by the science the decisions on the portfolio will be driven on making sure we keep the bar high for patients and we'll continue to look at other ways to expand that innovation network with early-stage collaborations and deals and when possible late-stage collaborations and deals. Hopefully, Michael that gives you a little color to so far what I can articulate in the past five months. Michael Yee : I appreciate and look forward to the rest of the year on that. Thanks. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Michael. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Leerink. Your line is now open. Geoff Porges : Thank you very much and appreciate the question. Dan, there's been a lot of pretty interesting moves in the industry of sort of a macro level companies changing portfolio shifting assets around. And I realized your focus is primarily been on R&D, but is there anything that you believe you could potentially consider moving out of the company's portfolio? Or do you have any appetite to bring in any macro and products that might be available for any other company's portfolios? And just related to that could you comment on how much of an issue FTC considerations are as you look at outside products given what we've seen so far this year? Daniel O'Day: Geoff, yes, I mean I guess just taking a step back about how we look at our approach to M&A overall and our partnerships. Again, I would say that you're right there's a lot of moves in the field. I think what's characterized Gilead is the ability to really focus on the science in a way that's been pretty transformational with HCV and HIV. And I've commented before on my observation on the quality of the science and the scientists that are here at Gilead and I would only emphasize again after five months. And that's important not only for the science we do within the company, it's also important for how we can evaluate external scientific opportunities. I can say that as we partner with Galapagos, the respect and admiration from a scientific perspective between Gilead and Galapagos was very high and that's what led me with confidence to move forward with the team in striking that deal. So, we will be driven by science for sure. We'll focus on the areas of expertise that we have today. I mean that's HIV, oncology, liver disease, inflammation, and the intersections between those two. To your point, I mean I don't think we'll have a one-size-fits-all strategy for bringing innovation into the company. I think that the Galapagos structure was the right structure for that collaboration. It allowed independence, it allowed us to secure our investment, it allowed us rights to everything that comes out of that investment, and therefore, that collaboration was fit for purpose for that particular transaction. But it doesn't mean that we won't look at different ways of transacting when we look at other opportunities out there. Some will be more straightforward, particularly, if they come right into our value chain and our distribution chain for our late-stage aspect. On the FTC standpoint, I don't really have a lot of comments there. I think we haven't had any issues right now with FTC and the type of transactions we're going after. So, I don't have a whole lot of personal insight into that question as well. So, hopefully, that gives you some indication of how we'll continue. Geoff Porges : Thanks very much. Daniel O'Day: Thanks. Geoff. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open. Alethia Young : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the very solid quarter. I just want to talk about trends in Europe. I'm slightly intrigued by the fact that you guys tend to like -- or able to mitigate kind of the generic pressures seeing from the Biktarvy offset and I just want to get a little bit more color on why you think that's the case? I mean we all know Europe is fairly cost-conscious. And I understand that there's differentiate profile. But what had really been the driver there that allows you to have growth in Europe your TAF franchise there? Thanks. Robin Washington : So, Alethia I'll take that one. I mean I think it really has been the underlying opportunity that we have with Descovy. We have seen with the Descovy now launch of Biktarvy -- sorry. Biktarvy we've just seen really a moderating of that deceleration. So, it really speaks to the innovation of the product and the drive and we've seen really solid adoption. Operator : Our next question comes\u2026 Daniel O'Day: Thanks. Yes, let's go to the next one. Thanks, Alethia. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Your line is now open. Carter Gould : Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for I guess Dan or Johanna, can you maybe just to elaborate a bit further on how should we think about PrEP providing another leg of growth for the HIV franchise, particularly, given some of your moves in the quarter, you've improved access in the U.S.? And I guess when you think about Europe some of the historical challenges there? And then I guess a follow-up there just any insight you could provide on what you expect the focus of the AdCom to be for Descovy there? Thank you. Daniel O'Day: That's great. So, we'll have Johanna pick up on the first aspect to your question Carter and then Diana can talk about the AdCom. Johanna Mercier : Yes. So, thanks for the question Carter. So, basically in PrEP what you'll see today if you think about our Truvada business, the growth is very solid, it's about a 27% growth year-on-year. But having said that, there's only about 200,000 individuals that are actually on Truvada and that represents that 20% to 25% of the total potential of individuals that could benefit from prevention treatment and that's where Descovy comes in. And I do think Descovy, as we talked about earlier on this call, real opportunity in light of the fact that it just has such benefit in the prevention setting for a broad patient population -- a broad population of individuals namely because of its superior safety both on bone and renal as well as the fact that there's rapid onset and longer sustained duration of HIV protection in Truvada. So, those things will definitely play an important role as we think about our launch for Descovy moving forward in the second half of this year. On the flip side, you talked about a little bit about Europe. Obviously, Truvada PrEP in Europe is not available in light of the fact that it was genericized, but we will be looking at filing for PrEP in the first half of next year. And maybe Diana for the? Diana Brainard : Sure. Yes. So, with respect to the AdCom the FDA has the liberty to convene an advisory committee for a number of different reasons. And in this case for Descovy for PrEP, I think it's probably part of a larger effort to increase awareness and signal the commitments of the government to HIV PrEP efforts. And this is a forum where experts can come together and provide a discourse on the benefits of PrEP and also the trial results of DISCOVER. And as you know we are seeking a broad indication for Descovy for PrEP and our study was conducted in men and transgender women who have sex with men. And so this will certainly be a topic for discussion as well as the study results themselves and so that's what we're prepared for. Carter Gould : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Umer Raffat : Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I wanted to focus on two pipeline programs, if I may. First on filgotinib, so based on everything disclosed so far in the pool data, there is no DVT imbalance, and that's very important. But my question was, what about all thrombotic events? So, for example, the retinal vein occlusion in France too was technically not a DVT. So, what about all thrombotic? Is that still no imbalance at all? That's point number one. And the second one was on the Galapagos IPF program, we know the Phase II trial there ran -- had a meaningful baseline imbalance on FVC median. And my question is have you analyzed the FVC data on similar sets of FVCs on the placebo arm versus the active arm? Thank you very much. Daniel O'Day: Thank you, Umer. So, we're going to get John involved here. John, Sundy so, thanks John. John McHutchison : Sure. So, first of all to start off with filgotinib, getting to the issue of -- issues across all thrombotic events, we are still very pleased with the results across all those events, and don't really see anything that would change our perspective on that compared to the specific data that we've presented already. Moving on to the Galapagos compound, as you might imagine, we looked very carefully at all of the available data in the IPF program. We have quite a bit of experience in IPF ourselves with prior programs at Gilead as well. And we saw that the data really provided the confidence to Galapagos to be able to move ahead and we share that confidence with them. Umer Raffat : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Citi. Your line is now open. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thanks for taking my question. So quick question on capsid inhibitor, do you think a longer acting agent such as capsid inhibitor could expand to that market, just to say that it is 20%. And then when can we learn more about your plan for capsid in PrEP? Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Yeah. Before I turn it over to Diana, we'll hear -- I think it's a good question. By the way, we fully intend prior to the capsid to get beyond 20% of the PrEP market with both Truvada and Descovy. I mean and you're seeing the increase of course quarter-on-quarter there, but also our wraparound programs with the community and really taking this more global. So there's lots of opportunity with the current programs. Having said that, Diana, if you want to address maybe the capsid for PrEP concept? Diana Brainard : Sure, thing. And I didn't catch the second part of the question, but I'll answer the first part. So Johanna mentioned this large gap between the number of people in the U.S., who are eligible for PrEP and the number of people who are on PrEP. And of course we're trying to close that gap. But the part of that strategy is going to be having additional options beyond daily PrEP and the capsid inhibitor could be one approach to that. It's got a long-acting potential. We're looking at preclinical models to assess its efficacy in the PrEP setting, and we're very excited about its potential as our physicians and the community about having this as an option. So we're looking forward to generating the data but that will allow us to get into the clinic with that. Mohit Bansal : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Cory Kasimov : Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. So, I guess for Dan, I'm curious how should investors be thinking about building out your management team versus building out the company's capabilities via external BD? In other words, there are clearly some important positions to fill such as a permanent CFO or permanent CSO, et cetera. So how much are there search for assets and technologies and the search for personnel correlated or mutually exclusive? Obviously I recognize what you recently able to do with Galapagos, but there were some established relationship that was already there. Thanks. Daniel O'Day: Thanks. I really appreciate the opportunity to answer that. I think they can both very much happen in parallel. I mean I can just articulate that the Galapagos collaboration, for instance. I mean it involved teams of people within our organization that are absolutely dedicated to both the discovery platform aspect of it as well as the clinical programs. And so, I don't see any slowdown at all in our ability to proceed to have a corporate development during this period when we're still recruiting key individual. First of all Robin is here and very active, so we don't like a CFO by any means, and we'll certainly have a good transition of a CFO before Robin leaves. And Robin's appetite to continue to grow the portfolio is good. Isn't it, Robin? Robin Washington : Very high. Daniel O'Day: Okay. So that -- we don't settle anything there. We have a very, very effective Corporate Development team in the organization that Andy filled up over the past couple of years, but the most important thing about the effect in this Corporate Development team is that they're interconnected with all the different respective experts within the organization. So, Diana's team and John's team, and the other principal TIA heads, and then Billy's team and the entire research organization. So, that machine is still operating at full steam and full effect in this, so I just want you to know that. In the interim, of course, we are then proceeding ahead with Robin's replacement and with John's replacement. And we look forward to bringing some additional new colleagues into the organization that will also be focused on science and growth and driving the future of Gilead's mission, like we did with Johanna and with Christi so far. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Phil Nadeau : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. My question's specifically on the recent proposed changes to Medicare and specifically Part D. I'm wondering, if you'd be willing to disclose what proportion of your U.S. revenue in Q2 came from Part D? And whether given, it's done any preliminary analysis of those changes and their potential impact on your revenue? It seems like based on the pricing of your medicines, you're right around the breakpoint between helping and hurting your revenues. So I'm curious if you've done any fine analysis to figure what the impact would be? Robin Washington : You want to start? Daniel O'Day: Yes. Let me start, Phil. Let me give you a little context and then I'll turn it over to Robin on some details. So, first of all, I mean, I think, it's important to note that there's a lot of things that have been happening in Washington recently and a lot of things that are still need to be provided clarity with. What I would say is a couple of things over this past quarter have been very encouraging. First of all, the work that we've done with the administration on ending the HIV epidemic, our drug donation and ability to get to many, many more patients with HIV, really shows the support we have around increasing those number of individuals that are eligible for PrEP. The other thing is the Part D protected class rule was a really important patient choice legislation that was upheld and that's -- we think that's good for patients. We also think that supports our portfolio as well. And then, the other thing that I think is a really ongoing dialogue is the consensus that we have now in such a margin around the need for new solutions and different approaches for CAR T therapies. So I just point to those three things as things that I think have been really encouraging for our portfolio that happened in the past quarter. Now at the same time we completely accept and understand that there's going to continue to be pressure on drug pricing. I remind you that the vast majority of our business is driven by volume. We're actively involved, of course, in the Part D discussions and where that may go. We believe in initiatives that supports cap to patient out-of-pocket expenses that help patients at the end of the day and Part D reform and that's where we and others in the industry are rolling our sleeves up on, to be active participants in Part D reform. Specifically relative to our exposure to Part D, I don't know, I'm going to turn it over to Robin\u2026 Robin Washington : Yes. Daniel O'Day: \u2026.and see if she has any other thing she wants to add there. Robin Washington : No, Dan. I think, you've covered a lot of areas. I will only add so that we don't typically disclose the various specific payer mix, I will tell you that, overall, it's a low double-digit percentage. If you think about Gilead, particularly our HIV, I mean, overall we have a high proportion of public pay rate and we've always come up with innovative programs, as Dan was describing, some that support full access to those patients. So I think that is something that we'll continue to do as we work with Washington. Daniel O'Day: Thank you, Phil. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Salim Syed with Mizuho. Your line is now open. Salim Syed : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Dan I just wanted to talk about hepatitis B, as in boy, for a second. So the beginning of the year before you joined, I believe, some of your colleagues mentioned that Gilead plans to be a leader in hepatitis B. I was wondering if you still maintain that view. How you prioritize it within the company, versus perhaps oncology or inflammation areas? And if there's any science that you feel like you don't have that\u2019s of interest to you. Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Thanks. I'm still digging into that a bit, Salim, but it's clear that we have tremendous expertise in our organization and colleagues that are focused on liver disease and, in particular, hepatitis B. It's also clear that our current product Vemlidy is a significant benefit for patients with hepatitis B and underutilized. So one of the things we're working with Johanna and others on in the organization is, how do we make the current standard of care more available to patients at need and at risk around the world. And that's something you may hear more from us on in the coming quarters. But relative to your question about the next level of advances in hepatitis B and I also had the experienced to talk to some key thought leaders around us as well. There's no doubt that it's a challenging scientific area to think about coming up with a hep B cure. And yet, I still think there's some very promising scientific avenues. As you can imagine - I won't comment necessarily on specific technologies that we either have in-house or that we think we may need to partner and to collaborate with. But I wouldn't give you confidence that we know the landscape extraordinarily well, we know the science extraordinarily well. And like many viral diseases, we may need to think about combination approaches in this area to get to longer duration and sustained responses. But because of the sensitivity of some of those programs, I'm not going to get into more detail. But suffice it to say that I think, as a company with our type of expertise, that we do need to be on the cutting edge of hep B and we need to be thoughtful about how we approach it and what level of investment we put into it. But there's no doubt that as long as our scientists think there's an avenue forward we should be -- we should have some concentration in that area. Salim Syed : Great. Thanks so much. Daniel O'Day: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Hartaj Singh with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Hartaj Singh : Hi, thank you. Thanks for the question. I just had a question on Yescarta. You reported now a good quarter, I think two in a row. I think you had indicated earlier in the year this year that you had over 1,500 patients on the therapy, which had accelerated from the end of 2018. Could you just give some more color on the dynamics of the patient in the Yescarta and how you're feeling for the rest of the year? Plus also how over the next couple of years, you would start to roll out into your line of therapy as that clinical data retail? Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Thanks a lot Hartaj. So let me start and then maybe other colleagues want to add a little bit here. So let me just restate my belief that I said on previous quarters that as Gilead think strategically about how to approach and entry into oncology, I think the concept of approaching it with a pioneering technology is a very sensible path forward. In other words, instead of jumping into where everybody else is right now, really moving to where the treatment paradigm could go, I think makes sense. Now with the pioneering technology comes all with the rewards and risks associated with being on the cutting edge of science. But I would say that I'm very impressed by the data that's been generated so far from the KITE team and the sustained level of responses we're getting and we'll continue to update you on those responses. I know again later this year as well on the duration of those responses, but we're seeing a very consistent response in that subset of DLBCL patients. So in addition to the scientific strength of this and the broader R&D program that I mentioned before about moving into earlier lines of therapy, other hematologic diseases, solid tumors and allogeneic, I would say that there are clearly some near-term factors that can affect the trajectory of Yescarta. We're carefully monitoring those something I've been personally involved in is some of the discussions around the reimbursement changes. Robin mentioned in her prepared remarks around the Medicare reimbursements and then we're also investigating further patient flow dynamics. So I think there's no doubt that in the near term with the pioneering technology where hospitals are getting used to how to get reimbursed, CMS is trying to come up with new programs as you've seen published about how to encourage adoption for Medicare patients. There could be some variability if you like on the quarter-to-quarter sales for Yescarta. But having said that, when I just take a step back and think about the mid- to long-term trajectory of Yescarta and the duration of response in patients, I continue to be very encouraged. And as the quarters go on, we'll be able to of course provide data for you on the continued profile of Yescarta, just as we did at ASCO of course where we talked about some of the ways to ameliorate some of the initial responses into -- encourage Yescarta and even more patients from an early standpoint. So that's what I would say so far about Yescarta. I don't know Robin would you like to add anything on that? Robin Washington : No. I think you covered all the areas Dan. And as I've said on the call, we also have Europe now. We're very encouraged relative to the receptivity reimbursement and innovative therapies that we're doing very well with our launch there in addition to all the factors that you mentioned in the U.S. Daniel O'Day: And just maybe one last point on that. So we expect the new Medicare reimbursement role to go into effect in October of this year. So that's obviously going to be a key pivot point for how we see uptake in using Medicare patients. And we know that the use of Yescarta in Medicare patients also has an influence in centers on how they treat their non-Medicare patients. So lots to continue to innovate here, not just on the science, but also on the reimbursement and access programs, so we're fully committed to that. Hartaj Singh : Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Thanks. Operator : And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Sung Lee for closing remarks. Sung Lee : Thank you, Liz. And thank you everyone for joining us. The team here looks forward to providing you an update on our next call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

My name is Liz and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sung Lee : Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the third quarter 2019. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website. The speakers on today's call will be Daniel O'Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Johanna Mercier, Chief Commercial Officer. Also in the room are Diana Brainard, Senior Vice President and Head of our HIV and Emerging Viruses Therapeutic area; and John Sundy, Senior Vice President and Head of our Inflammation Therapeutic area. Before we begin with our prepared comments, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website. I'll now turn the call over to Dan. Daniel O'Day: Thank you, Sung, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining today. I'll share a few opening comments and then turn the call over to Robin. And after that Johanna will take you through the commercial highlights of the quarter as well. So let me start by saying, I'm very pleased with the progress that we're making on all fronts here at Gilead and a strong third quarter results. Once again, we saw a significant growth in our HIV business, reaching an all-time high in quarterly HIV revenue. As you know in my time at Gilead, I focused on three key areas since coming in the pipeline, commercial delivery and people. And today in my brief remarks, I'll focus on the significant progress we've made in two of those areas : The pipeline and the people, and then Johanna will take you and talk to you about the excellent commercial performance later in the call. So let me begin by saying a few words about our pipeline, starting with HIV. As you're aware, we received FDA approval for DESCOVY for PrEP earlier this month. This is a really important indication for us as it allows us to extend the benefits of DESCOVY to people who are at risk of HIV. To remind you, the approval was based on the DISCOVER trial, which demonstrates that DESCOVY is just as effective as Truvada and offers advantages in bone and renal safety parameters. We are excited to build on DESCOVY status as the most-prescribed dual NRTI backbone in the world by advancing its use in PrEP. Happy to say, we've also received endorsement to begin the study of DESCOVY for PrEP in cisgender women, which will allow us to eventually bring the medicine to a broader group of people. Rest assured, we continue to remain focused on our HIV pipeline beyond our DESCOVY-based regimens as well on our long-acting antivirals programs compounds that will treat -- highly treatment-experienced patients and, of course, on our CARE research as well. So turning to filgotinib, we've now filed for approval of filgotinib in rheumatoid arthritis in the EU and Japan and are on track to complete our filing in the United States by the end of the year. Our teams around the world are preparing for launch and I'm encouraged about the potential of filgotinib to be best-in-class among the JAK inhibitors. In addition to rheumatoid arthritis, we're continuing to advance filgotinib together with our partner Galapagos. We have a comprehensive program across a number of other inflammatory diseases, including ulcerative colitis, which we expect to have data on next year. And in addition, we were successful in closing our partnership with Galapagos this past quarter. I'm looking forward to the American College of Rheumatology coming up in Atlanta, so that we can share further updates on filgotinib. Researchers there will present further analysis in the FINCH two study, which evaluated filgotinib in patients with RA who previously -- who were previously treated with a biologic and then results of the pooled safety analysis of filgotinib across the FINCH program will also be presented and updated there. Turning to cell therapy. I would like to say a few words about Kite and our working cell therapy. The teams down at Kite are busy preparing for the American Society of Hematology meeting, which will happen in early December, where in addition to exciting data from our ongoing clinical trials, we will share survival data for Yescarta at three years in large B-cell lymphoma as well as results from the registrational study of KTE-X19 in mantle cell lymphoma. Recently we also completed enrollment in the pivotal ZUMA-7 study of the Yescarta in second line large B-cell lymphoma and we're excited about the potential this medicine could help for this group of patients. As we discussed also last quarter, we continue to see quarterly variations in Yescarta, but we're very confident in its future and the long-term trajectory of our cell therapy platform. Finally, a few comments about our leadership team, which is now complete with two new appointments. Merdad Parsey will join us on November 1st as our Chief Medical Officer. Merdad who previously led the early clinical development program at Genentech will have responsibility for all of our global developments and medical affairs functions. Bill Lee will continue to lead our research organization and he will report directly to me working closely with Merdad. Merdad is an outstanding scientist and leader with a remarkable track record of success. And I believe that Merdad will be a tremendous asset to Gilead maintaining a very high bar for innovation, so that we can continue to build on our legacy of transformational medicines. I'm also very excited about the appointment of Andy Dickinson to the role of CFO. Andy has been at Gilead since 2016 and currently serves as our Executive Vice President of Corporate Development and Strategy. He transformed the way that the company approaches corporate development before I came in, and expanding the kinds of transactions executed and implemented a broader more strategic approach to dealmaking here at Gilead. As of November 1st, Andy will succeed Robin Washington whose retirement we announced earlier this year. Happy that Robin will remain at Gilead in an advisory capacity through early next year, while we complete the reporting of our 2019 results. I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank Robin for her outstanding contributions, dedication and tremendous commitment to Gilead. We wish her all the best in retirement. And I'm sure she'll continue to stay busy. I look forward to working with this outstanding group of leaders here at Gilead, who bring a strong blend of skills and diverse perspectives to the path forward for our future. And in closing, I'm increasingly optimistic about the future and believe we are well positioned as we enter the last part of the year and look ahead to 2020 and beyond. We will continue to build on our success, as we replenish the pipeline and bring the next wave of transformational advances to patients. On behalf of the leadership team, I want to thank all of our employees and partners around the world for the dedication and hard work that led to the successful quarter and the results that you see here today, and whose commitment will continue to make it successful in the future. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robin. Robin Washington : Thank you Dan for your kind words. It has been a privilege to serve as Gilead's CFO for the past 11 years and to work alongside such extraordinary colleagues to bring medicines to people around the world. I know the focus on this mission will continue and I look forward to cheering Gilead on in 2020 and beyond. I'm pleased to report the financial results for the third quarter, which were marked by strong execution across our therapeutic areas led by the continued growth of our HIV franchise and continued predictability of HCV. Total revenue for the third quarter were $5.6 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.75. This compares to revenues of $5.6 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.84 for the same period last year. As noted in the earnings press release, on a GAAP basis, we recorded a loss of $0.92 per share primarily due to $3.92 billion or $2.40 per diluted share of upfront collaboration and licensing expense associated with our global research and development collaboration agreement with Galapagos. Turning to product sales. Product sales for the third quarter were $5.5 billion, down 2% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. In the U.S., product sales for the third quarter were $4.2 billion, up 4% sequentially and up 2% year-over-year. In Europe, product sales for the third quarter were $804 million, down 23% sequentially and down 8% year-over-year. The sequential performance was primarily impacted by two items. First, recall that the second quarter benefited from a $160 million adjustment for a statutory revenue clawback reserve. And second, the third quarter was negatively impacted by a statutory clawback reserve adjustment. These two factors, which primarily impacted our HCV and HIV revenues, caused an approximately $200 million decline between quarters. Turning to cell therapy. Worldwide Yescarta sales for the third quarter were $118 million, up 57% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. U.S. sales were $86 million for the third quarter, up 15% year-over-year and down 13% sequentially. In Europe, Yescarta sales were $32 million, up 52% sequentially, as we continue to ramp in the region. It is clear that cell therapy is a validated platform; with hundreds of patients being treated on a quarterly basis in the U.S. Yescarta has established itself as a differentiated leader in an increasingly competitive environment. We will continue to focus our efforts on CAR T education in the community oncology setting to stimulate referrals of appropriate patients to cell therapy treatment centers. We also observed CAR T eligible patients being enrolled in clinical trials at a much higher rate relative to commercial patients. As such and as Dan outlined, we anticipate further quarterly sales variations, but remain very confident in the future trajectory of Yescarta. Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $954 million for the third quarter, up 13% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to increased investment in our oncology programs, HIV programs and research projects. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $967 million for the third quarter, up 14% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher promotional expenses in the U.S. and expenses associated with the expansion of Gilead's business in Japan and China. Moving to the balance sheet. During the third quarter we generated $2.6 billion in cash from operations and ended the quarter with $25.1 billion in cash and investments. We paid $5.5 billion in connection with our global research collaboration and equity investment in Galapagos, which was classified in our cash flow statement as cash from investing activities and includes a $1.1 billion equity investment. We also paid $1.5 billion of debt used to finance our acquisition of Kite. We paid cash dividends of $804 million and repurchased 3.4 million shares of stock for $223 million. Turning to our guidance. As we move closer to the end of 2019, we are narrowing our guidance ranges as follows. Net product sales are expected to be in the range of $21.8 billion to $22.1 billion. Non-GAAP R&D expenses are expected to be in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. We expect non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.1 billion. All other components of our guidance remain unchanged. Our guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties which are outlined in slides 22 and 23 in our earnings call presentation. I will now turn the call over to Johanna. Johanna Mercier : Thanks, Robin, and good afternoon, everyone. So as I've had the chance to settle into my role, I've been really impressed with the talent here at Gilead and the potential we have to reach even more patients with our medicines. I want to talk today about a few areas, the continued strength of our HIV business, including our recent launch of Descovy for PrEP durability of HCV, and finally touch briefly on our cardiopulmonary business and close by discussing our filgotinib launch preparations. So, let's start with HIV. Global HIV sales for Q3 were $4.2 billion, up 4% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. As Dan noted, this is an all-time high for quarterly HIV product sales. U.S. HIV product sales were $3.4 billion in Q3, up 6% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was driven by underlying prescription demand growth of 13% mainly Biktarvy. Biktarvy was a number one prescribed regimen in the U.S. in the quarter. In prevention, they're now approximately 224,000 people taking Truvada for PrEP, an increase of approximately 25% year-over-year of active patients. Our teams are now in the field with Descovy with its recent approval in PrEP. We initiated efforts to educate health care providers and people at risk for HIV about Descovy immediately following the approval and are really quite pleased with anecdotal feedback from providers. Turning to Europe, Q3 HIV product sales were $558 million, down 10% sequentially and 4% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline was expected due to the broad availability of generic versions of Truvada. The impact in generics is starting to wane as the launched of our Descovy-based products namely Biktarvy progress. As Robin just mentioned, the sequential performance was impacted by an adjustment for statutory clawback reserve in Europe, which benefited the second quarter. Biktarvy is now available across the EU5 and continues to grow. It's on track to be the best HIV launch in Europe and is number one in naive and switch across Germany, France and Spain. It recently launched in Italy and the U.K. and is off to a strong start in both those countries. Moving on to HCV. Global Q3 HCV sales were $674 million, down 20% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. U.S. product sales for Q3 were $380 million, up 7% sequentially and down 22% year-over-year. The sequential performance was driven by the continued uptake of authorized generics which has improved our overall competitive position in the U.S. In Europe, HCV product sales for the second quarter were $111 million, down 60% sequentially and 45% year-over-year. As anticipated the sequential performance was negatively impacted by the adjustment for statutory clawback reserve in Europe, which benefited Q2. Overall, the HCV market continues to see a more predictable decline in patient starts and perform in line with our expectations. Before closing, I wanted to just make a few comments on our cardiopulmonary business, where we have seen generic competition enter the market. As anticipated significant volume erosion has occurred and as of September, we have seen an 85% erosion of Ranexa and 60% erosion of Letairis a trend that we expect to continue. Finally, I spent time recently in both Europe and Japan, where our teams have completed the regulatory filings for filgotinib in rheumatoid arthritis. Launch preparations are well underway in both regions as well as in the United States, which Dan noted we plan to file before the end of the year. I believe that, we truly have an opportunity to make a difference in the lives of people with RA, and in the future other inflammatory diseases. We're actively preparing for competitive and innovative launch of a differentiated JAK inhibitor across our key markets. I really look forward to working with this great team of people to deliver on the promise of these medicines. So, thank you very much for joining today's call and now let's turn it over to questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Michael Yee : Hey guys. Thanks for the questions. I had a question for Dan. Obviously Dan, you've spent a lot of time this year putting in the right people, getting everything all set up. You did Galapagos deal to build up the pipeline a bit. I guess in thinking about the pipeline and building that out where are you focusing your priorities on? How should we think about your next area whether that's in NASH or oncology? How should we think about that? And maybe just give us a little state of the union there? Daniel O'Day: Yes. Thanks Michael very much for the question and delighted that we now have the team coming together for the future. I think it's really good diverse team with some strong Gilead legacy colleagues, as well as combined with some talent from the outside the organization with different perspectives. And I think it's going to lead to a really strong good team that will help us drive kind of the future chapters of Gilead moving forward. Also pleased Michael that we had the Galapagos transaction finalized in the quarter, we're obviously getting going now on a deeper collaboration beyond filgotinib. And as I said to you in the past and I'll say it again, I mean, I think the team here and I have the pipeline as our number one priority of course. And that -- we approach that from a variety of different ways; one is, the strength of our internal pipeline looking for ways to accelerate differentiated medicines that we can internally and with Galapagos now significantly expanding our research base in addition to other collaborations we have externally that allow us to essentially double our research base of medicines coming into the portfolio -- the development portfolio. In terms of therapeutic area, I would say our approach to external partnerships and M&A will be very much the same of what you saw in the past. So first and foremost, it will be driven by science, driven by where we think the most unique opportunities are. Secondarily, will be informed by our own expertise, as you know we play across four therapeutic areas today and strong scientific understanding in the base in antivirals and immuno modulation. And there is no one size fits all of course. I mean, at times it make sense to just do a partnership, but other times it makes sense to do a full acquisition and other times it makes sense to do something like a Galapagos arrangement where we have a deep partnership associated with that. So we'll continue on in that area. I think more to come as the team comes together as we continue to evaluate. Certainly the areas that you mentioned are areas that we're looking at carefully to complement our internal expertise, but we're not driven by any one therapeutic area. We're driven much more by where is the next innovation going to come from in science and how do we complement that portfolio. With an acknowledgment by the way that we understand that we have to accelerate the development of our later-stage pipeline as well. And that can happen by both accelerating our internal pipeline or having partnerships arrangements with the companies outside of the Gilead orbit today. So Michael more to come and obviously some of the conferences coming up and into next year, I can be even more specific and articulate about how some of our strategies are forming. Michael Yee : Perfect. Looks forward to that. Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Thanks Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Brian Abrahams : Hi, there. Thanks very much for taking my question. So you narrowed the R&D and SG&A guidance to the upper end of the previous ranges. And so I guess -- I'm wondering maybe bigger picture perhaps longer term especially as we're getting closer now to the filgotinib launch how do you guys balance the importance of margin preservation and earnings growth against the potential to invest as you build out in inflammation? And how might the changes in leadership potentially influence this? Thanks. Daniel O'Day: Yes. Let's -- let Robin give her commentary Brian and then maybe I'll add as well so please. Robin Washington : Hi, Brian. Thanks for the questions. I'd say we manage them very carefully. As you know we've always been a very highly efficient organization, really focused on operational excellence and ensuring that even as we've grown, we've grown profitably as we think about margins. And at the same time, as you've heard me say before we're always balancing the need to invest for the long term, and as you know that can have implications in the short term. You've seen us with previous launches and with acquisitions make the necessary investments upfront that may yield shorter operating margins in a short term, but ultimately get us to higher revenues in overall margins long term. So I think that's how we think about our model. There's -- it's not by quarter or by year, it's really ensuring that when we make investments that we make the necessary actions in the short time to ensure the overall ROI on those investments. And I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about the future but I think we're pretty much aligned going forward. Daniel O'Day: It's well said Robin. And Brian you may want to hear it from my vantage point as well just particularly with the CFO transition to make sure you understand the stability from my side as well. So I have really admired Gilead's efficiency as Robin mentioned and the careful management of expenses. And I think that's something that we will continue to make sure that we have the size here as well. I've also been a student of the history here at Gilead and I've looked back in the past and seen in times of important launches that investment has increased correspondingly in the interest of patients, in the interest of shareholders. And I think that type of philosophy I think will continue. And certainly we will also be -- as we have generic erosion, of course, coming now this year and next year, we also have the ability to redeploy those resources as we already have done with cardiopulmonary to other areas of focus and interest including the upcoming -- or the current launch for DESCOVY in PrEP. And then we will also make sure that we have a competitive launch of filgotinib because we know that it will be essential to have the right share of voice to get that off to a good start. We have one chance to launch a product in this industry and therefore we have to make that accordingly. So as we get into providing you with more guidance in 2020, we can elaborate a little bit further about how we see that expense management for next year. But I hope you get a sense that much of the discipline that Gilead has in the past you can expect to have in the future as well Brian. Brian Abrahams : Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Geoff Meacham : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Congrats, Andy and Robin. It's been great to work together. Wish you the best. Just wanted to ask about HIV market expansion outside of PrEP, and with Biktarvy, the share gains are impressive and with its profile, are you seeing an uptick though in treated patients on ART overall? I just wanted to ask because HIV market expansion used to be a secondary driver of the market but I'm not sure about that today. And how do you think this differs in Europe? Thanks so much. Johanna Mercier : Maybe I'll take that one. Geoff, it's Johanna. I think as you're mentioning the HIV business overall and treatment is a huge part of that 80% of our total HIV business has never been stronger. And what we're seeing, it's a bit of a mix what you're saying, but in those U.S. and Europe, you have about 80% of the patients that are switch patients and 20% are na\u00efve patients. So the na\u00efve patients is a smaller play and less of a market expansion per se to your earlier point, but much more in the switch. And so where the switch come from are really important to us for Biktarvy. And what we're seeing with Biktarvy and that's been our strategy all along in our expectations is, we are seeing about 20% to 25% are coming from dolutegravir-based regimens and about a 1/3 coming from Truvada-based regimen and then the rest -- another 1/3 probably from Genvoya and so that's the piece where from a switch standpoint that's the biggest most important piece of the business. Both in U.S. and Europe it's quite similar actually. The challenge in Europe is obviously there is more Truvada pieces of the puzzle just because of the genericization in Europe. But, overall, what we're seeing is very consistent both in na\u00efve and switch and Biktarvy is number one not just in the U.S. but also in Germany, France and Spain and we only just got reimbursement in the last quarter for U.K. and Italy, but those launches are off to the similar, very consistent way of launching than we've seen in the other markets. Daniel O'Day: Thank you, Geoff. So we'll go on to the next questioner. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with SVB Leerink. Your line is now open. Geoff Porges : Thank you very much. I'm just wondering if you could help me understand a little bit on the research side. You've sort of lost over that a bit. Firsthand, could you break out the $4 billion or so in annual spend that you have now between immunology, oncology, hepatology and then research? Just give us a sense of those allocations? And then, related to that, Dan, could you talk about, if you were to contemplate significant M&A or for that matter, additional licensing, do you envisage that that $4 billion run rate will have to go up to accommodate those new programs? Or do you have some savings from big trials coming to an end and/or other efficiencies that might take the $4 billion down and accommodate incremental programs from outside the company? Daniel O'Day: Terrific. Yes. Thanks, Geoff. And actually, I'm glad you asked the question because on the previous question I spoke more about how we look at allocation resources on the commercial side more so than the research side. So, yes, let me first of all state that -- the first part of your question relative to how we allocate that across therapeutic areas, it's not something that we disclose accordingly. So I can't help you with that but I think I can help you with the forward question, which is, as we think forward to either partnerships or M&A, how is that going to help -- or what impact will that have, if you like, on the overall R&D spend. Now, I think, there's one aspect of that that's very important which is -- and you mentioned it a bit. But, A, we're constantly prioritizing our portfolio internally. And that is based upon making sure that we have the most-attractive programs that we're funding. Every organization has to draw a line and I think we also have to do that as well. And of course, things change, because of the nature of data that's read out, competitive environments, variety of things that happen. So the portfolio is constantly kind of evolving and moving internally based on that portfolio. And therefore, to your point, there are times when we stop studies, studies come to a natural conclusion and they've been successful and we have those to then reinvest again accordingly. Many of the structures that we've looked at in our partnerships have also been designed to be, first of all, innovation forward but also allow for some balanced risk across the portfolio and spend. For instance, with Galapagos. Our relationship with them is that they are covering trials up until Phase 2 and they take the decisions and they take the risk associated with that and all the diversity and benefit that comes from having another organization look at that differently. And then, post our opt-in of course then we would start to incur expenses on our R&D line as well. So many of our partnerships and collaborations have been designed with that in mind as well and we'll continue to do it that way to be efficient with risk versus investment. And I think that's the way we'll continue to look at moving forward. So more to come on that. I would just say -- I mean, the one thing we do disclose Geoff on the R&D line is that around 15% to 20% of the $4 billion goes into research and the remaining is into development human trials accordingly. So that I can give you. But we don't really break it down further by therapeutic area. Does that help? Geoff Porges : Somewhat. Thanks, Dan. Daniel O'Day: As much as I can, I think. But thanks, Geoff. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, I was hoping you could just talk briefly, I know it's very early in the switch from Truvada to Descovy. But maybe you could talk about your expectations for some of the markers we should be looking for there and then maybe anecdotal feedback, as you maybe been in the market a couple weeks already with that. Thanks. Robin Washington : Thanks, Matthew, for the question. So, yes, only a few weeks in, right? We got the approval early October. But even within a few weeks we're off to a strong start. I think, the team is very excited about it, but more importantly the early feedback from physicians is very positive and we're hearing a lot of enthusiasm from our prescribers. I do want to explain that the PrEP market is a little bit different than the treatment market and that is that it's much larger in the number of prescribers. So there's over 50,000 prescribers that have actually written at least one script of PrEP with Truvada. So having said that, more than half of the volume that we're seeing in PrEP is actually very concentrated in a couple of thousand specialists who also prescribe in treatment. So that has been our number one focus and target physicians that we have been calling on over the last couple of weeks, because these are folks that obviously largest volume pool, but also folks that have experienced converting from TDF to TAF and also understand the value of DESCOVY and its clinical profile, specifically around the safety with bone and renal. So we assume a very similar conversion than what we've seen in the past. We have a lot of experience here of TDF to TAF conversions and we assume that same conversion rate will happen with these top prescribers. For the balance of the volume, obviously we are assuming a little bit of a slower uptake with those prescribers just because it's so much more diffuse. But having said that, we've augmented the field team. I think Dan mentioned this earlier, how we've taken a lot of our field forces from the cardiopulmonary in light of the generics hitting there. We basically train them and move them over there to supplement the team and also augmented our consumer approach to get really rapid awareness of DESCOVY both to physicians as well as targeted consumers. So so far so good, very excited about the launch and probably in the next quarter we'll have more to talk about with data. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open. Alethia Young : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And I just wanted to talk a little bit about NASH strategy from here. I understand you have the ATLAS study in the fourth quarter, but I also saw you started semaglutide GLP-1 study combination with doubles and triples. So can you maybe frame for us how you think about like what might be your backbone asset in NASH and possibly your plans going forward there? Daniel O'Day: Yes. Thank you very much, Alethia. So I think you rightly pointed kind of an important data point coming up here that will allow us to think about how we pivot our NASH strategy moving forward and that's the ATLAS study that we will be reading out before the end of the year. So those of you that don't know, I mean that's a combination trial that will allow us to look at the results of a variety of different combinations on the progression of NASH. But as you also know I mean, we've had a number of other collaborations, we've looked at with Novo Nordisk on GLP-1 and some of the other ones that you've already mentioned there Alethia that are approaching this from different angles as well. So I do think though that most progressed clinical trial is currently the ATLAS trial. And once we can see the results for that and dig into that then I think it will help us really understand how to progress ahead with NASH in what format and what way. I would just mentioned that as we've always mentioned, we think that NASH is a very high unmet medical need, but also a challenging disease to develop in given the nature of the disease, given the heterogeneity of the disease, given the end points. And yet, we think a company like Gilead with expertise in this area need to be informed by the science and solve the science to see what our path forward will be. So more on the NASH strategy after the ATLAS trial at the end of this year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Umer Raffat : Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to focus on a couple of R&D topics if I may. One on filgotinib. I noticed FDA called entospletinib review documents. FDA effectively implied class labeling on thrombosis risk for the class. And my question is what's your expectation? Do you think you'll get a black box for thrombosis? And do you think that impacts commercial uptake? And then secondly, there was a program in your pipeline which I was starting to get really excited about perhaps mostly because it was sort of in the exactly type of thing Gilead has been very good at novel nukes GS-9131 and it could have formed a base of life cycle management. I noticed it's not in the slide deck this time around and I was wondering if you could catch us up on any learnings from that program. Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Terrific, Umer. So we're going to start with John and - then we'll go to Diana for HIV question. John Sundy : Sure. Umer, I mean as you know and we've spoken of before, we know that patients with inflammatory diseases are at risk for thrombosis. And so it's always a comparison against expected background rates of this event in patients. And we think it's possible that selected JAK1 inhibition as we have with filgotinib may have some advantages. But certainly at this point it would be premature to speculate on what the label outcomes maybe. We're going to go through the process. We believe we have a strong story with regard to thrombosis risk and at the same time reassured by the overall efficacy and safety profile. So we've seen this across all of our programs and we are looking forward to having that discussion with the regulators. Diana Brainard : This is Diana Brainard. I'll speak to your question around GS-9131, which is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor with an improved resistance profile over the currently improved drugs in that class. And this is a compound that we've been excited about and moving through the clinic in early phase studies because we do have a commitment to highly treatment-experienced patients who have failed higher regimens and have multidrug resistance. In parallel with the GS-9131 program, as you know, our capsid inhibitor program with GS-6207 has also progressed very rapidly. And GS-6207 is the first-in-class compound. It's got a novel mechanism of action. It's got an orthogonal resistance profile. We haven't seen any pre-existing resistance among all of the samples we've tested from treatment-na\u00efve patients and heavily treatment-experienced patients. These data have been published at recent conferences. And so because of this novel mechanism of action, because of the potency, because of the lack of pre-existing resistance, we really feel that the capsid inhibitor is the really best and lead compound to bring forward in highly treatment-experienced patients. And in fact its promised was recognized by FDA when they granted us breakthrough designation for this population. And so we're moving ahead with capsid in this population into a registrational trial. And therefore won't be bringing GS-9131 forward for this population because we prioritize our capsid inhibitor. Q \u2013 Umer Raffat : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thanks for taking my question. So looking at your slides, you have some plans to develop capsid inhibitor in the Phase 2 -- started trial in Phase 2 trial with capsid inhibitor. Have you discussed internally about what kind of combination agent you will be using for this long-acting treatment at this point? And when can we learn more about your PrEP strategy for capsid inhibitor? Thank you. Johanna Mercier : Sure. So we're really envisioning the capsid inhibitor to have multiple different applications for people living with HIV. I just mentioned, its use for heavily treatment-experienced patients where it could be added on to optimize background therapy as is commonly done for this population. But it also has a huge potential for people living with HIV who might want to switch to a long-acting regimen because of its ability to be given at least every three months, every six months and potentially in the future longer. And there we are still actively looking for what's the right partner for our capsid inhibitor will be and we have multiple internal programs which are preclinical or in the very earliest stage of assessments in the clinic. And we're looking forward to sharing more details as we have more certainty about what the right combination will be to partner with capsid. What we're prioritizing is ease of administration. So we're looking at subcutaneously administered drugs. We're looking at drugs that can go the distance in terms of longer, at least monthly, if not longer and match capsid's potential. And so as we prioritize those features and bring forward different compounds we'll -- we're really excited actually to share that data. Mohit Bansal : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Cory Kasimov : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit more about the quarter-over-quarter trends for Yescarta? I know you mentioned there are or there were a higher number of potential patients going into clinical trials in 3Q, but how much do you think this sequential drop can also be attributed to the launch of Polivy? Are you seeing center slot that in the head of CAR T products or potentially any other dynamics taking place? Thanks. Daniel O'Day: Yes. Absolutely, Cory. No, thanks for the question. Happy to talk about it. I mean, I think it is important that I start out with letting you know that the team here is really confident with the longer-term opportunity of the Yescarta and also cell therapy. But as we know, I mean this is a pioneering platform and just to point out some of the dynamics that we're seeing in the market, cell therapy really literally changes everything to the touches, from patient identification to clinical practice to reimbursement to safety management. So I would say, some of the growing challenges with getting the pioneering technology in or what we would expect. But what's kind of unquestionable is in the patient set, where it has been studied so relapsed/refractory DLBCL so far in the market, I mean the efficacy and durability are unprecedented. I mean the majority of extremely six patients who are alive at two years, and as we know and many of my colleagues and the team hematology/oncology is a data-driven space. So I would say that -- and we also have a very strong and good manufacturing capacity which is critical for this technology. Now you mentioned some of the challenges. Let me talk about some of the drivers and some of the challenges that we're seeing in general in the market. I mean on the positive side the NTAP improvement that just went into effect in October 2019 from reimbursement by CMS of 50% to 65% is a step in the right direction. We -- it does take there is a lag time before that gets fully absorbed and introduced into the community. I would point out the ASH data coming up. We'll have three key events there; the survival data at three years in relapse/refractory DLBCL, early steroid use and also data on the KTE-X19 in MCL. Would just also point out the ZUMA-7 is now fully enrolled. So that's the second line DLBCL. I look forward to that trial playing through. And hopefully as we go into next year we can look towards a DRG for CAR-T as well. So those are some of the real positive things we're seeing in the market. And then to your point, I mean there are still challenges with Medicare reimbursement update. There is a high rate of clinical trial usage in DLBCL which is good news for patients. It's just -- there's quite a few clinical trials there still getting the patient referral flow downs. We do have some new market entrants early days on those. You mentioned one on the call here today and this whole concept between inpatient and outpatient reimbursement. So I think the team is kind of systematically working through these and that's why we see some quarter-on-quarter fluctuation in the United States. I would point out that we're now getting going in Europe which is also terrific and very good growth there and different -- some of these dynamics are different in Europe as well. So I think as we learn quarter-to-quarter on some of the dynamics and as the data matures and develops out there, I think that's going to be a real telltale sign for how we continue to see the uptake here. But taking a big step back, the type of data we're seeing and the duration of response in the patients that we've studied is second to none. So hopefully, as some of this becomes more the trends become more clear in future quarters we'll be able to be more precise about some of these as well. But thanks for the question Cory. Cory Kasimov : Thanks Dan. Appreciate the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Salim Syed with Mizuho. Your line is now open. Salim Syed : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. And congrats to Robin and welcome to Andy. Just one for me on hepatitis B; as in boy, if I can, I mean if you guys can give us an update on the core inhibitor what's the status there? I know there's been some safety issues for the core inhibitor class predominantly coming from HAV and SBA derivatives. So I was wondering if you can just give us a little bit of color, if your core inhibitor whether is in development or not in development and whether it is one of those derivatives? Thanks so much. Diana Brainard : Salim, this is Diana Brainard. Are you talking about the capsid inhibitor? Salim Syed : For hepatitis B as in boy? Diana Brainard : Yes. You're talking about the capsid inhibitor? Yes. Salim Syed : Yes correct, yes. Diana Brainard : Yes. So I think that we have seen the competitor data regarding capsid and we're looking very closely at our compounds preclinically as well as clinically. Because obviously with hepatitis B we've got a lot of experience in this space and we know very well the value of suppressive treatment and the safety of those regimens and the benefit that viral suppression brings in terms of reducing cirrhosis, reducing rates of hepatocellular carcinoma. So, while we're committed to cure and recognize that we're going to need combination therapies, we're also really cognizant of the safety barrier that really has to be exceeded to bring combinations forward. And I think that's really all we can say about that right now. Salim Syed : Are you still developing? Is it still ongoing -- there's been some speculation that it's been terminated in the marketplace? Diana Brainard : I think that we're in the process of continually evaluating what our best next steps are. And I think in terms of how we prioritize what we bring forward we've got the TLR8 in Phase 2 and we really want to see the results of those studies before making any final decisions on next steps and future combinations. Salim Syed : Okay, got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Phil Nadeau : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just one question on filgotinib. Maybe to ask Umer's question a different way. You've talked a lot about differentiating filgotinib. How important is the differentiated label to that process commercially? How else -- what other key points will you have in differentiating filgotinib? And then second filgotinib question. We have been expecting data from filgotinib as well as GS-9876 in Sjogren's and CLE in the second half this year. I noticed in your slides neither of those programs are mentioned. Is there any update on those two Phase 2 programs? Thanks. Daniel O'Day: Yes. I'll let -- Johanna can start on the commercial side Phil, and then we'll go to John on the development. Johanna Mercier : Okay. So, Phil more on the competitive concept. So, as you know this environment is super competitive and many of us know it well including myself. And so we've really pulled together a team that has considerable experience in this field. The piece that you would say that the differentiated label, I think it's twofold. I think from a label standpoint what we've seen thus far from the FDA is a little bit of a more of a class labeling. And so our expectations and we'll go through the process, but we're also being conservative in our expectations. One of the things that I would say is the importance of our data. And I think that if you look at the results of the three FINCH 3 studies in three different patient groups those are really exciting for us, both from an efficacy standpoint as well as safety standpoint. So, a lot of the work that's being done right now is sub-analysis to ensure that we can better educate physicians about our data. So, that's kind of the plan there. And I do think that the opportunity here is to potentially have a best-in-class drug inhibitor and that could be also related to the sale activity of the JAK1. So, having said that, that's what we're doing. All hands are on JAK to prepare for a competitive launch, but a differentiated one and an innovative one at the same time. So, we're excited about that and obviously we'll know more about the label in the coming months through 2020. So, John maybe on the other. John Sundy : Sure. Let me update you on the status of cutaneous lupus and Sjogren's studies that we conducted. So, these are proof-of-concept studies as you probably know we looked at a couple or even three different drugs in the same trials for these. These studies were exploratory in nature. We set a high bar for ourselves to proceed. And while we did not see or meet the primary endpoint in these studies, I think I would like to point out is that we did see evidence of activity with filgotinib, particularly in patients who had markers or evidence of more active disease. So, we just got the first look at these data, we're looking at the full set of data from all of these studies and we'll determine the next steps that we take an Lupus and Sjogren's disease and we'll share those results at an upcoming meeting soon. Phil Nadeau : That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Evan Seigerman : Hi there and thank you for taking my questions and I also want to extend my best wishes to Robin on her retirement. Just one on the Kite franchise. So, I'm just wondering if you can help me better understand the rationale for the increased investment, namely with the manufacturing facility. But more broadly how is expansion into cell therapy beyond Yescarta fit within your kind of new strategy for Gilead then? And aside from Yescarta, are there any programs that you should think we should focusing on that drive near-term value for the franchise? Daniel O'Day: Thanks very much for the question. And \u2013 yeah, again I would probably start with the investments that you mentioned. I mean I think, it's really important that we acknowledge the fact that the ability to manufacture and the turnaround time associated with cell therapy is absolutely fundamental to patient benefits and also to the efficacy results that we see. And I think it's a real competitive advantage to be able to have a network of manufacturing facilities that are state-of-the-art and are able to reduce that turnaround time including as you mentioned we have made a decision to establish a viral vector facility in one of our current manufacturing sites in Oceanside California that will allow us to not only supports the current products but also future products in the pipeline. So look I mentioned some of the near-term things on CAR T in addition to what we currently have out there with the Yescarta profile today. The state on the Yescarta at ASH I think will be important looking at the three-year data and the early steroid use. The Kite X19 is now a second product for MCL and we look forward to presenting that data as well. ZUMA-7 goes back to a Yescarta in an earlier line sitting. So when you think about the long duration of effect, the efficacy and durability that we've seen in the relapse/refractory third line setting, I mean the real question is and more natural obviously oncology developments avenue is to say, can you bring that affect up into earlier lines of therapy and potentially have this effect with more patients and potentially for longer duration, because you're treating them earlier. So the strategy is very much to continue to expand out the hematology indications first and foremost. I think that's where the greatest product exists or CAR T is right now, but we do also have mid to longer term programs on solid tumors on allergenic and those although risker and earlier are also programs we\u2019re fully committed to as we looked around out our leadership in cell therapy accordingly. So more to come on this. I personally to the broader oncology strategy, I mean as I said before and I'll say it again, I think the concept of Gilead getting deeper into oncology by starting with a pioneering technology, I think is a smart thing to do in oncology. I mean really to think about where you can get long durations of responses with a new technology. Having said that, we also have a great deal of expertise in our home-based technologies such as small molecules and an evolving biologic modality expertise at Gilead. And although I'm not prepared to talk more about that today and look forward to Merdad and others coming into the organization, so that we can continue to evolve our oncology strategy. I think there are opportunities certainly that we can look at outside of cell therapy and complementary to cell therapy, so more on that. We\u2019re literally in the process of really doing deep dives on this. As you know we also have some partnerships with other companies where we are fully committed to different aspects of oncology. And it's been a common question and I totally accept it and it's one that as we go into next year will be laying out deeper and deeper our holistic strategy around oncology that will include cell therapy but not the only cell therapy as we move ahead. So more to come on that. Evan Seigerman : Great. Thanks for the question. Appreciate it. Daniel O\u2019Day: Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Tyler Van Buren : Thanks guys. Good afternoon. Earlier in the session you guys spoke towards your strategic areas of focus for business development and the Galapagos deal makes a lot of sense from a long-term, broadening out the pipeline perspective and acquiring additional scientific talent in Europe. But could you guys speak a little bit further to your urgency to acquire late-stage or on-market assets particularly maybe within the next year to add to the top-line, which as it stands is relatively flat? Daniel O\u2019Day: No. Thanks Tyler. I mean, obviously, we're a company that's firmly focused on differentiated medicines and will be driven again by the science both internally and externally. And, obviously, it won't be too long before we start to talk about the guidance for 2020 and beyond and I'm not going to talk about that today. But the bottom-line is we're -- if I take a big step back and think about my confidence in the long-term growth potential of Gilead, it is captured within the strength of the HIV business. I mean that same business that you see offsetting some of the patent expiry this year continues to be we think a very durable business for the foreseeable future. You have a more predictable HIV-HCV business at this time. And then we have upside potential in filgotinib launching next year and I won't repeat, but the Yescarta programs and success accordingly. Having said that, we understand that we want to find ways to continue to look to increase and accelerate our growth in the coming years. And that will happen both through internal strategies associated with the launch products and programs I mentioned and then also outside partnerships and M&A. So rest assured, that we are looking at everything that could help complement our later-stage portfolio out there. And yes, and as you've seen, I think, our behaviors we will be disciplined about that. We will make sure that it's something that we feel scientifically is very strong something that we can add something to and provide strength to. And when and if those opportunities come up we certainly have the financial capacity and ability to act. So that's paramount on our mind. We are in it for short, medium, long-term and we're looking to improve all three of those time periods. But clearly the portfolio is absolutely key for me and a key for the leadership team. So thank you Tyler for your question. Tyler Van Buren : Yes, thanks very much. Operator : That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Sung Lee for closing remarks. Sung Lee : Thank you, Liz and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on our future progress. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Liz, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Douglas Maffei from Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Douglas Maffei : Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release with earnings results for fourth quarter and full year 2019. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations website. Speakers on today's call will be Daniel O'Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Andrew Dickinson, Chief Financial Officer; Johanna Mercier, Chief Commercial Officer; and Merdad Parsey, Chief Medical Officer. Also in the room are Christi Shaw, Chief Executive Officer of Kite; and Diana Brainard, Senior Vice President and Head of our HIV and Emerging Viruses Therapeutic Area. Before we begin with our prepared comments, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections, and the use of capital and 2020 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the Company's underlying business performance. Starting in 2020, Gilead will no longer regularly exclude stock-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP financial information. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, as well as on our website. I will now turn the call over to Dan. Daniel O'Day: Thank you, Doug, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll share a few opening comments before I turn the call over to Andy. And then, Johanna will take you through the commercial highlights of the quarter. And Merdad Parsey, whom as you know, joined us as Chief Medical Officer in November, will offer a few remarks before we open up the call to questions. We had a very strong quarter capping a solid year for Gilead. Our financial results in 2019 were driven in large part by the outstanding performance of our HIV franchise. It's now been almost a year since I arrived at Gilead. We made key decisions and changes that have positioned us for success. Over the past decade, the Company has set a high bar, and we hope to raise that high bar over the decades to come. Today, I'm going to focus my comments on three areas. One, our strong base business; two, the existing pipeline opportunities; and three, our new strategy to drive innovation and growth. So, I'll begin by saying a few words about the strengths of our core business, starting with HIV where we again achieved record revenue for both the quarter and the year. Today, approximately 80% of people living with HIV, who are on therapy in the U.S. are on a Gilead-based regimen. Across the franchise, we've seen durability and sustainability of the business, which we expect to continue in 2020 and beyond. Much of the strength is being driven by Biktarvy. Today, in the U.S., approximately one in two patients who are new to therapy and patients who are switching therapy are initiating on Biktarvy. We're also very pleased with the early progress with Descovy for PrEP, the strength of the launch and the positive response we are seeing from patients and providers. Johanna will share more details shortly on that. Looking to the future, we're focused on the potential of our capsid inhibitor as the anchor molecule for multiple long-acting HIV options. We may be able to dose as infrequently as twice a year, and we're working rapidly to progress this medicine for both HIV prevention and treatment. Rounding out the antiviral picture, we continue to see sustained revenue from our HCV business. Since the introduction of authorized generics in the U.S., we've regained market share and now hold around 60% share through Asegua and Gilead up 18 points from the beginning of last year. Finally, as we look across our core business, I'd like to highlight the geographic expansion, and in particular China. During the fourth quarter, we had four medicines Vemlidy, Epclusa, Harvoni and Genvoya included in China's national reimbursement drug list. This is a significant accomplishment that will enable much broader access to these medicines in the region. So, beyond our core business, our current pipeline concludes several important opportunities that I'd like to cover. We have 14 late-stage studies underway, four of which have received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA. During the fourth quarter, we submitted a regulatory filing for filgotinib to the FDA and it's now under priority review for rheumatoid arthritis. Filgotinib is also under review in Japan and the EU. We're actively preparing for competitive launches globally, which Johanna will talk more about later. I'm encouraged about the potential of filgotinib to be best in class among the JAK inhibitors, and the strength of the gene we have in place to market the medicine following approval. Beyond filgotinib, we are pleased with what we see in the Galapagos pipeline and believe that the partnership has the potential to drive significant future growth. We are looking forward to the ulcerative colitis data this year, and we remain very optimistic about both our partnership with Galapagos as well as the promising inflammation pipeline we have in hand. In cell therapy, we have a pioneering platform that is enabling us to advance new therapies with the goal of driving long-term innovation and growth. To that end, our second cell therapy treatment KTE-X19 is now under review in the U.S. and Europe as a treatment for relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma. This followed the presentation of positive data at the American Society of Hematology meeting in the fourth quarter of this year. We also presented data at ASH showing the approximately half of patients treated with Yescarta for relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma were still alive after three years of treatment in the ZUMA-1 study, confirming Yescarta\u2019s benefit risk profile in the real world setting. These long-term data speak to the durability of the Yescarta's treatment. Finally, in cell therapy, we look forward to sharing results from our Yescarta Phase 3 second line DLBCL trial in the second half of this year. Merdad will offer some more color on our pipeline in just a few minutes. In addition to the programs I described that we have in hand, I introduced our new corporate strategy last month. This strategy will guide our work as we seek to drive innovation and growth over the next decade. Over the next 10 years, we aim to introduce 10 new transformative therapies. To help us achieve that ambition we will expand our access to internal and external innovation. We've already been very active in business development with around 33 strategic partnerships and investment transaction since January 2018. We'll continue to pursue a broad range of opportunities with a clear focus on our core scientific areas of strength. Specifically, we will continue to make investments in our external pipeline including transformative partnerships such as Galapagos and small to medium-sized bolts-on acquisitions. Andy will talk more in a few minutes about our capital allocation priorities, including today's announcement of a further increase in our dividend and an additional share repurchase authorization and our strong financial position, which gives us the opportunity to look externally as we strengthen our pipeline. Before I hand off to Andy who we'll delve into a more detailed financial review, I'd like to say just a few words about the broadening outbreak of coronavirus. As an organization, Gilead has committed to collaborating with global health organizations to support pandemic responses, including this one. Our investigational compound, Remdesivir, has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity in animal models against the viral pathogens, MERS and SARS, which are structurally similar to the current strain of the coronavirus. However, there are no antiviral data that show activity against the strain. We're working with the government and non-government organizations and regulatory authorities to develop a strategy to provide Remdesivir to patients with coronavirus for emergency treatment in the absence of any approved treatment options and to support clinical trials to determine whether it can safely and effectively be used to treat the current strain of the coronavirus. As a reminder, Remdesivir is an investigational agent. It is not approved anywhere globally and has not been demonstrated to be safe or effective for any use. I'm proud of our teams and the work we've done to offer expertise and resources to help patients and communities fighting coronavirus. In closing, I'm very optimistic about where we are today and the future. Our base business is strong, durable and growing. As demonstrated by our fourth quarter numbers and year-end results that near-term pipeline provides several important opportunities with readouts expected later this year with filgotinib and Yescarta. And over the long term, we've introduced a new strategy to drive growth by growing our pipeline internally and importantly also externally through our ongoing BD activities. On behalf of leadership team, I'd like to thank all of our employees and partners around the world for their dedication and hard work that led to the success of 2019, and whose commitment is driving our success in 2020 and beyond. I remain excited about the potential of Gilead as we enter the next chapter. With that, I'll turn the call over to Andy. Andrew Dickinson : Thank you, Dan. I'm excited to take on the role of CFO, especially during this time as Gilead enters a new chapter. We're pleased to share our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2019 and provide 2020 guidance today. I'll first review financials followed by comments from Johanna. Turning to our financials. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $5.9 billion with non-GAAP earnings of $1.30 per diluted share. This compares to revenue of $5.8 billion with non-GAAP earnings of $1.44 per diluted share for the same period last year. Our non-GAAP earnings would have been $1.77 and $1.75 in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively, excluding unfavorable cost of goods sold impacts. These impacts were primarily driven by inventory write-downs of $500 million and $410 million, respectively for slow-moving and excess raw material and work in process inventory largely due to lower long-term demand for our HCV products. For the full year 2019, total revenues were $22.4 billion, up 1% year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings were $6.63 per share for the year, down from $6.67 per share for the full year of 2018. Excluding the unfavorable cost of goods impacts I mentioned previously, our non-GAAP earnings would have been $7.14 per share for 2019 and $7.01 per share for the prior year. As noted in our earnings press release, our full year 2019 GAAP diluted earnings of $4.22 per share included a total unfavorable impact of $3.30 per share from the following items. First, pre-tax upfront collaboration licensing expense of $3.9 billion associated with our global research and development collaboration agreement with Galapagos; secondly, pre-tax impairment charge of $800 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily related to in-process research and development intangible assets for the treatment of indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; and pre-tax write-downs of $547 million for slow-moving and excess raw materials and work in process inventory. The unfavorable impact was partially offset by a favorable impact of $1.94 per share due to a deferred tax benefit of $1.2 billion related to an intra-entity transfer of intangible assets and gains of $1.2 billion from equity securities held for investments. Now, turning to our product sales. Product sales for the fourth quarter were $5.8 billion, up 5% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. For the full year, product sales were $22.1 billion, up 2% year-over-year, primarily due to the continued revenue growth of our HIV franchise, partially offset by the impact of loss of exclusivity on our cardiopulmonary franchise and market dynamics of our HCV franchise. In the U.S., product sales for the quarter were $4.5 billion, up 8% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. Demand for Biktarvy and Descovy for PrEP was the primary driver of the sequential growth. The seasonal inventory purchases also contributed approximately $290 million to the sequential performance. In Europe, product sales for the quarter were $840 million, up 4% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. Recall that both the third quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by unfavorable adjustments for statutory rebates. Turning to cell therapy. Worldwide Yescarta sales for the fourth quarter were $122 million, up 3% sequentially and 51% year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was driven by a higher number of therapies provided to patients and Kite's continued expansion in Europe. Now, turning to expenses for the full year 2019. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $3.5 billion, down 1% compared to $3.6 billion in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower royalty expenses, partially offset by higher inventory write-downs. During 2019 and 2018, we recorded write-downs of $547 million and $440 million, respectively for slow-moving and excess raw materials and work in process inventories, primarily due to lower long-term demand for our HCV products. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $3.8 billion, up 7% compared to $3.5 billion in 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs to support cell therapy business. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $4.1 billion, up 13% compared to $3.6 billion in 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher promotional expenses related to Biktarvy and Descovy for PrEP in the U.S. and expenses associated with the expansion of our business in Japan and China. Turning to our balance sheet. We generated $9.1 billion in cash from operations for the full year of 2019 and $2.6 billion for the quarter. We ended the year with $25.8 billion in cash and marketable debt securities. During 2019, we paid $5.6 billion in connection with our global research and development collaboration with Galapagos and our equity investments in Galapagos. In addition, we repaid $2.8 billion of debt. We paid cash dividends of $3.2 billion and we repurchased 26 million shares of stock for $1.7 billion. Earlier today, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividends from $0.63 a share to $0.68 per share, which will be effective in the first quarter of 2020 . This is our fifth consecutive annual increase in our dividends. In addition, our Board authorized an additional $5 billion share repurchase program in January 2020. We now have over $8 billion of share repurchase authorization available. In 2020, our capital allocation priorities will remain unchanged. First and foremost, we will focus on investment to augment internal and external research and development, our internal research and external development pipeline. Second, we intend to grow the dividend over time, pointing out of course that any dividend is increased is subject to the approval of our Board. Finally, our commitment to repurchase share in excess of dilution from our equity compensation and at a minimum we expect to repurchase shares in 2020 on par with our 2019 share repurchases. Turning to guidance. Our 2020 non-GAAP financial guidance is summarized on slides 23 to 26 in the earnings presentation available on our corporate website. Before I start, I'd like to highlight three things that are important for you to understand. The first change is that beginning in the first quarter, we will no longer regularly exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP financial information. Stock-based compensation has always been an important part of how we reward our employees in a way that aligns their interests with those of our shareholders, and it's an important component of our compensation structure. As such, although it's not a cash expense, we believe it to be a cost that should be included when measuring our financial performance. For comparability purposes, full year 2019 non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been $10.4 billion and $6.13 per share, respectively, had stock-based compensation expense not been excluded. Our second change is that we're modifying our guidance metrics for 2020 as we will now be providing guidance for earnings and operating income. In addition to the metrics that we've historically shared. Our guidance is aligned with how the management team and our Board evaluate our financial performance and manage our operations. Finally, our guidance excludes the impact of any future significant business development transactions, certain development milestones, and any product option exercise fees that they're contingent on various future events, which have a high degree of uncertainty. With that background, we expect that our product sales for 2020 will be in the range of $21.8 billion to $22.2 billion. This guidance reflects robust underlying growth in our base business of approximately $800 million to $1 billion, which is expected to offset the full year impact of the loss of exclusivity for our cardiopulmonary products in 2019 and the initial entry of the generic version of Truvada in the U.S later this year. I would also like to highlight that as we look towards Q1 of 2020, we anticipate that total product sales will decline sequentially that quarter by a percentage similar to what we've seen over the past three years, which has been as high as 12% to 14%, primarily driven by U.S. seasonal inventory patterns and buying patterns of public payers that negatively impact our payer mix. We also anticipate that our Q1 2020 product sales will decline in comparison to Q1 2019, primarily due to lower sales of our cardiopulmonary products, Ranexa for Nexon and Letairis. As a reminder, generic versions of our Ranexa and Letairis were launched in the first quarter and second quarter of 2019, respectively. Despite this anticipated sequential decline in total product sales in Q1, I want to underscore our confidence in the health of our worldwide HIV business from which we expect year-on-year growth again in 2020. Turning to our product gross margins. Our non-GAAP product gross margins are expected to be in the range of 86% to 87% in 2020. We expect that both non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses will increase mid single digit percentage in support of our continued growth at Biktarvy, our Descovy for PrEP launch, preparation for competitive launches of filgotinib in RA in the U.S. Japan and Europe, and continued investments in our pipeline, cell therapy and external partnerships. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $10.1 billion to $10.8 billion. For the full year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21%. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.05 per share to $6.45 per share, which again, I'll remind you, no longer excludes stock-based compensation. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.15 to $5.55. Finally, our diluted EPS guidance includes repurchases, largely consistent with 2019. I'll now turn the call over to Johanna. Johanna Mercier : Thank you, Andy. And good afternoon everyone. I'm really pleased to share the highlights of our excellent Q4 and full year commercial performance. I wanted to begin with a continued strength of our HIV franchise, which was driven by the continued uptake of Biktarvy as well as the successful early launch of Descovy for PrEP. I'll then provide an update on HCV, touch briefly on our cardiopulmonary business and finally close with a few remarks as we look ahead to the filgotinib launch. As Dan mentioned, approximately 80% of people living with HIV who are on therapy in the U.S. are taking at least one Gilead drug as sign of a sustained and durable strength we see across the franchise. We reached another all-time high with our HIV product sales for both the full year and quarter. For 2019 HIV sales were $16.4 billion, up 12% from 2018. Global HIV sales for Q4 were $4.6 billion, up 9% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth for the franchise. U.S. HIV product sales were $3.8 billion in Q4, up 11% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by underlying prescription demand growth of 10%. Within our prevention market, we're really pleased with the early progress of Descovy for PrEP, which launched in the U.S. in Q4 2019. Approximately 27% of individuals on PrEP are now taking Descovy, and by Q4 2020, we expect that number will have risen to anywhere between 40% and 45%. Across the prevention market, we saw a growth of more than 20% in the number of individuals taking PrEP year-over-year. There are now more than 230,000 people taking one of our HIV prevention medicines in the U.S., and this only represents approximately 20% of those who could actually benefit from it. Turning to the U.S. HIV treatment market, Biktarvy sales were $1.4 billion in Q4, up 23% sequentially. The market is continuing to consolidate around Biktarvy, which is the number one prescribed HIV regimen in the U.S. and as Dan noted, approximately one in two of every na\u00efve and switch patients are now initiated on Biktarvy. In Europe, Q4 HIV product sale were $562 million, up 1% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. The year-over-year growth was driven by the continued strength of our Biktarvy launches in Europe, declining impact of generic launches and unfavorable non-recurring pricing adjustments in Q4 of the prior year. Biktarvy is now available in 29 countries in Europe and it's number one in na\u00efve and switch in Germany, France, Spain, and now Italy as well. Turning to our HCV business. Q4 HCV sales were $630 million, down 7% sequentially and 15% year-over-year. 2019 sales were $2.9 billion for the full year, down 20%, primarily due to lower average net selling price and declining patient starts. U.S. revenues for Q4 were $337 million, down 11% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. In the U.S., we now have approximately 60% market share with our Gilead branded and authorized generic partner products and are continuing to sustain revenue. In Europe HCV product sales for Q4 were $151 million, up 36% sequentially and down 20% year-over-year. The sequential performance was impacted by the seasonality of product sales. Overall, the HCV market continued to see a more predictable decline in patient starts and performed in line with our expectations. Before turning to filgotinib, I just wanted to make a few comments on the cardiopulmonary business where we have seen generic competition enter the market early last year. As anticipated, significant volume erosion has occurred. And as of last December, we have seen 90% erosion of Ranexa and 65% erosion of Letairis, a trend that we expect to continue into this year. So, in closing, I'm really excited to share with you a few words about the filgotinib launch. As Dan noted, our teams have now completed regulatory filings for rheumatoid arthritis in the U.S. where filgotinib is under priority review, as well as in Europe and Japan. In December, we announced a co-promotion agreement in Japan with Eisai. It's estimated that approximately 600,000 to 1 million people in Japan are living with RA, and this agreement allows us to draw on the strengths of both companies with the goal of bringing this important new medicine to those individuals. As you're aware, despite currently available treatment options, many patients are still living with symptoms of inadequately controlled RA around the world. In fact, only one out of five patients living with RA achieve complete remission at year one, which means four to five do not. Filgotinib has a compelling and differentiated clinical profile that we believe may uniquely address the significant unmet need for patients with RA. We have highly experienced teams preparing for the launch later this year and our focus will be on the strength of our data and the compelling risk benefit profile which serves across both tested doses of this oral medicine. I look forward to working with this great team of people to deliver on the promise of these medicines. And I'll now turn the call over to Merdad. Merdad Parsey : Thank you, Johanna, and good afternoon, everyone. It's been a pleasure to meet some of you over the past few weeks. I'm pleased to participate in the first earnings call at Gilead today. I'm excited to join a team to extend the Gilead story and improve the lives of patients around the world. As we implement our new corporate strategy, I'm confident we can leverage our existing pipeline and to expand with internal and external approaches. Building on Gilead's impressive innovation in HIV, including the launch of 11 products in 17 years, our goal is to continue to transform the lives of people affected by HIV. Our next wave of HIV innovation will be driven by long-acting options for treatment and prevention. We listen to what patients want and we're committed to continuing to pursue and provide more options that meet the needs of people affected by HIV. We believe our capsid inhibitor has the potential for a truly unique profile, offering both oral and subcutaneous dosing, the potential for self administration as well as multiple dosing frequencies and options for HIV treatment and prevention. We recently presented data from two Phase 1 studies, demonstrating potent antiviral activity and the potential dosing in role of up to every six months. We've initiated Phase 2 -- 3 studies including one of the -- one in heavily treatment experienced patients and we received breakthrough therapy designation for this use. The capsid inhibitor will be the foundation of our long-acting options and we're exploring multiple partner agents to pair with it. As Dan said, we've set the ambitious goal of bringing 10 transformative medicines to patients over next decade. The first of these 10 transformative medicines will be filgotinib, which has a potential best-in-class profile. I've been impressed with the strength of the filgotinib data. And speaking with key opinion leaders, there's a real appreciation for the results and an excitement for the potential combination of efficacy and safety of this selective oral JAK 1 inhibitor. Across the FINCH studies, we've seen consistently strong efficacy and demonstrated the safety profile that is highly favorable from a benefit-risk standpoint, and this is true at both doses tested. We've now filed filgotinib in three regions, the U.S., Europe and Japan, and as Johanna mentioned, we are gearing up for the launch. Filgotinib has the potential for five new indication launches in the next four years, and we look forward to the upcoming ulcerative colitis data this year. This timing could get filgotinib one of the first labels in ulcerative colitis for a JAK inhibitor. We've also had -- I've also had the opportunity to meet the Galapagos team and discuss opportunities that are being pursued beyond filgotinib. This remarkable partnership has a potential to double our research footprint and has a number of programs that could add to our inflammation portfolio. Turning to oncology, we have a broad portfolio today including Kite and have a total of 15 clinical stage programs. Our approach is to build transformative therapies across complementary immuno-oncology platforms including both cell therapy and non-cell therapy. We're actively pursuing and evaluating innovative programs and technologies externally to build our presence in oncology. In total, across our current pipeline, we have 40 clinical stage programs. As Dan mentioned, of these programs, 14 are either being registered right now or in label enabling trials, and four of these programs have breakthrough therapy designation. As we pursue external opportunities, we'll continue to build around antiviral therapies, inflammation, fibrosis and immuno-oncology. I'm excited to work with Dan and the entire Gilead team to expand on the great things that have been done to date and go further for people living with HIV and the patients we serve. This work internal and external will enable us to grow in the mid to long term. I look forward to sharing more with all of you about our progress in future calls. Thank you very much. And now, we'll open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Michael Yee : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question, and thanks for the color on the guidance. I guess, I just wanted to ask about your perspective on guidance for 2020, and thinking about both the revenue guidance, which is seemingly flat to downish versus \u201819 and EPS on backing out the stock option seems to be flattish to downish. Maybe you can just comment about your perspective of 2020, is that an investment year? Is there potential to be a growth year, both on revenue and EPS? And how do you think about it -- of 2020 versus, say, what you think about broadly speaking for \u201821? Thanks. Daniel O'Day: Yes. Thanks a lot, Michael, for the question. And I would say, again, based upon the strong results coming off of 2019 that our base business, our HIV business is really robust and continues to grow. And of course we need to offset, as Andy mentioned in his comments, the full year effect of the cardiopulmonary franchise and just the beginning of the Truvada expiry. And we feel confident in our ability to be able to do that. Our guidance reflects the revenue that is essentially flat year-on-year, and of course, we'll keep you updated as we go throughout the year, based on a variety of events on the commercial side. On the investment side, I would say, yes, absolutely, we feel that we need to invest on the commercial side to make sure that we are preparing ourselves well for the most recent launches that have gone out, and that's Biktarvy and Descovy but also well prepare ourselves for a very competitive launch for filgotinib, where you've heard us say, we really think we have a unique medicine with a best-in-class profile. And we want to make sure, as we know, there's only one chance to get a launch right. We want to make sure we're well prepared for that. Now, we have obviously looked hard at our expense base on a commercial side, reallocated resources from cardiopulmonary and are well-prepared to put our investments on the growth drivers. And as you can see in our qualitative guidance, feel we need to increase slightly from year-on-year for the SG&A guidance. Likewise, with the investments that we've made both in our internal pipeline, the expansion of life cycle programs around medicines like filgotinib and others that we need and including external innovation that we've brought in over the past two years, including 33 different collaborations and/or acquisitions, we want to make sure, we invest appropriately in those to take them to the next decision point and decide about future investment accordingly. And we'll continue to work on that portfolio as we move forward. Andy, do you have some other things you want to add to that. Andrew Dickinson : Yes. Thank you. And, Michael, thanks for the question. I would just add two things. Again, as many of you\u2019ve heard, our primary focus is on building a predictable, sustainable top-line growth profile that you would expect to see of companies like Gilead, so. And that at times requires investment. It has in the history of Gilead, as you go back to the Pharmasset acquisition and the investments that were made following that and it will going forward. So, that is our primary focus, as you know. And then, I'd also add that we also felt that it was important to provide additional transparency and accuracy in measuring our financial performance. And that's why you're seeing additional guidance that helps give you a fuller picture of how we see the business for the coming year. And I think the guidance speaks for itself, and Dan's points were right on. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Brian Abrahams : Thanks so much for taking my question. As you look across your mid stage portfolio and to new corporate strategy, I was wondering, if you could elaborate a little bit more on the areas of most interest to build out or to wind down. Where does Gilead's team stand today to most optimally take advantage of external opportunities? And how do you guys balance potential versus risk as you look at investing in assets both internally and externally? Thanks. Daniel O'Day: Great. Thanks a lot, Brian. I'll start, and then I'll ask Merdad to comment on the portfolio because one of the big efforts that we have underway is with Merdad coming to the organization, his breadth of experience in building world-class portfolios. That's exactly what he's involved in right now, and really leveraging the strengths accordingly, across the portfolio. So, I'd say a couple of things, Brian. I think, as you know, we've kind of elevated the full disclosure and openness on our portfolio. We started that at JP Morgan. You can expect us to continue to be very transparent about the portfolio, the decisions we take and we make. But, I think, just the very fact that we have 40 clinical stage programs, 14 of which are in registrational trials is something that I think may be underappreciated as we -- from the outside. Now, you asked about, what are the things that are most interesting? I'm going to let Merdad give that as well. But I remind you that our strength in viral diseases will continue to be invested in and that's the discussion around capsid, and really, truly providing kind of next generation therapies that we think patients and customers, -- well, we know patients and customers are asking for out there. Having said that, I think, the extension of our inflammatory disease portfolio with the Galapagos transaction is something that excites me. I think, there's lots of potential shots on goals there. There's ways to think about between Gilead and Galapagos, building combination approaches in the future. And I think, we've really got a strength in inflammatory diseases that is building. Fibrotic diseases is something that we have a depth of expertise in. And we understand the challenges associated with that disease state. And so, as Merdad builds the portfolio, I think he'll come in, we have to make sure that we're putting the right level of investment in there that makes sense for the big unmet medical need, but also the risk associated with some of the natures of those diseases. And then, finally, there's been significant effort, long before Merdad or I joined on oncology. Of course, the Kite acquisition provides was the immediate step up and knowledge and knowhow and a breadth of portfolio there. But the non-Merdad portfolio is something that's really built up over the past couple of years, both internally and through our collaborative. We know it's early and we know that we're going to have to continue to pursue those programs and build on it.  So, that's my two cents. And Merdad, you have a deeper and kind of a refresh view cause you've just entered not too long ago. So, it'd be good to hear your reaction. Merdad Parsey : Yes. And I won't belabor what Dan said. I think, he hit on the main things, which is sort of making sure, the capsid molecule looks really interesting. And I think we're pretty excited about that one. And building a partner for that -- for both treatment and prevention is going to be an important goal of ours. And then, in inflammation, getting the filgo launch, right. And then, supplementing, filgo in our -- filgotinib in our pipeline is going to be an important task for us to focus on as well to build around the inflammation portfolio and to enable broader reach as we develop there. And then, oncology. I think, that's an area where we are going to spend time building out, looking for opportunities, especially in immuno-oncology and working with our colleagues at Kite to make sure that we're finding the right balance and bringing the non-cell therapy portfolio upto complement the cell based therapy. I think more qualitatively, maybe I'd say, I think what you're hearing is this idea about focus for us, making sure that we're really thoughtful about where we focus and where we build our expertise so that we can build a portfolio around those areas of focus as you've heard me and Dan lay out. And also that we find a balance to address your other question around risk, to find balance around how we approach the overall portfolio. So, that we have a mix in there, some high risk, high reward programs, balanced with some other programs that are less risky and have a more higher likelihood of success. And so, we are going to approach the portfolio that way and broadly across the entire portfolio inclusive of oncology inflammation, fibrosis and HIV. Operator : Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Geoff Meacham : Johanna, I wanted to ask you a couple on HIV. So, the Descovy and PrEP targets, what gets you there to 40%, 45% and how are you dealing so far with generics to grab share. And then, when you look at the Biktarvy franchise, obviously pretty dominating share there. But what populations have you seen of late that are going to continue to add to the switch dynamic? I mean, I guess the question is how many of the switches that you've seen thus far in the U.S. are kind of laggards and maybe where they're coming from? Thank you very much. Johanna Mercier : So, maybe, I'll hit your Descovy question first and then go to Biktarvy. So, we exited the year about 27% with Descovy and what we're seeing is really nice uptake. But if you recall, there's a real fragmented market in the prevention market versus the treatment market. In the treatment market, you have 3,000, 4,000 prescribers. In the prevention market, it's much larger than that, like five, tenfold. And so therefore it's really -- how do we get there is making sure we focus on the higher volume, which is the same folks that actually are prescribing and prevention are also prescribing in the treatment -- HIV treatment world. And those are physicians that truly understand the benefits of going from a TDF agent to task with all the boat and renal safety that comes with it. And so, we've actually seen that share of that segment increase very rapidly. We also have another big piece of the pie that is about 20%, 25% of the volume that are folks that have never prescribed an HIV treatment. And so, these are folks that we are visiting and obviously using different means of communication to make sure they're educated around the fact of the benefits for a tap agent like Descovy. And so, what we're seeing is that increase month-to-month, and we're very pleased with where we are today, after only three months of launch. Having said that, we believe that's going to continue with some challenges potentially on the payer side. And that's how we get to the 40%, 45%, towards the end of the year in light of the fact that Truvada is losing its patent later this year in October. And so, some payers are already planning ahead a little bit on that one. And so, we're working with them very closely to make sure that patients get the best, most appropriate compound for them. And so, I guess, we're -- we believe that that's where we're going to adapt about 40%, 45% of conversion by October of this year. So, that's the Descovy story. From a Biktarvy standpoint, I think what you were saying, good quarter, and I think, I would say it's an excellent quarter for Biktarvy, if I do think of it myself. I'm very proud of the team on that front. And it's been obviously very active, very competitive in the market space as you well know. The Biktarvy is really being used for with the majority of patients, and that's really the profile of Biktarvy and what it brings to the table in light of the combination of convenience, tolerability, the high barrier to antiviral resistance. And so that kind of what Biktarvy has to offer. What I would say is, as you think about all the ending the epidemic initiatives, that's where the rapid start with Biktarvy is becoming a really increasingly point of differentiation and very important one for physicians. And I think that's really helping the Biktarvy growth as well as, as you move forward. So, the fact that, one out of two patients are actually starting on Biktarvy, whether that's a na\u00efve patient or a switch patient, that is really where you're seeing how the market is consolidating around Biktarvy. And we believe that will just continue, not only in 2020 but beyond that just because of what Biktarvy has to offer for patients. Hopefully that answered your question, Geoff. Geoff Meacham : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges with SVBLeerink. Your line is now open. Geoffrey Porges : Thank you very much. I appreciate the question. I have to ask one about Remdesivir, which is, have there been any other anecdotal reports or responses other than the one that was in the journal, over the weekend? And do you have manufacturing capacity that you could scale up quickly? And then, I just wondered if Merdad could talk a little bit about fibrotic disease. You're obviously still involved in NASH, but there are a lot of other fibrotic diseases. And I just wondered if your ambition span all fibrotic diseases, or still pretty much confined to NASH. Sorry about the double up. Daniel O'Day: That's all right. Thanks for the question. On Remdesivir, we have not had any other anecdotal reports to date. And so, we'll obviously keep an eye on that very closely and see how that progresses. In terms of manufacturing, our team has really been working night and day, it's been very impressive to watch this team over the past couple of weeks really ramp up to the extent that we can. Our capacity is going up every day. We're looking at all the options we have expecting to be prepared for what may come. Obviously we are waiting for data, both in vitro and then in people to ensure that the drug actually works. And it's important just for everyone to keep that in mind that this is still investigational and we are still waiting for more data to know. But at risk, we are investing pretty heavily to make sure that we're prepared as best as we can. In terms of fibrotic disease, we think of it fairly broadly, but I guess from my perspective, when I think about fibrotic disease, to your point, we -- NASH, as you know, we've had programs in diabetic, kidney disease, we have a program idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis right now. And those are biologically related. And one of the things that we are always have in our mind is to think about where to apply a particular mechanism, which disease to apply particular mechanism. And so, what I would say is that as we see the readouts on the IPF study as they come forward, as we have the discussions with the agency about the NASH program and as we see novel molecules that come through, we'll do those in a gated way. Fibrosis is a challenging area, and we don't underestimate how difficult that's going to be. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Matthew Harrison : I was hoping you could address what you see as the opportunity in China. You obviously mentioned that fervently and then pointed out some of your HCV medicines are approved there. But I don't think you've talked about how big you think that could be or how much a contributor you think that could be over the next couple of years? Thanks. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Matt. We\u2019ll have Johanna address that. Thanks. Johanna Mercier : Yes. So, in China, we're excited about the fact that this is really our first opportunity with reimbursed compounds. So, I think, Dan mentioned which ones. But just to highlight, from a hepatitis C stand point, it's Harvoni and Epclusa. And then, only other product is with a tender process in China and the only other product approved is [indiscernible], reimbursed, I should say. And so, I mean, of course, this is more of a volume opportunity than anything else. And this is one that we believe many patients are in need. And we have a real opportunity to help those patients. That's in hepatitis C. In hepatitis B, vemlidy also got reimbursement, which of course as you know, hepatitis B is biggest market from a patient standpoint, it\u2019s also in China. And then last one is Genvoya and HIV, which HIV is going to be the first time that actually products will get reimbursed in China, in HIV the class. And so, we believe that's also one that we're cautiously optimistic that more patients can really get that treatment that they need. So, we are cautiously optimistic about our China business opportunity. You can appreciate that with everything going on right now in China, the focus is not on some of these new products that got reimbursement. The focus is really on the people and what's going on with the coronavirus. And so, we do think that might be a little bit delayed in 2020 as we see kind of that play out. But I do think from a longer term standpoint, this is how we should be thinking about China and the opportunity moving forward, because of the patient pool that is so predominant in the specific disease areas that we offer potential solutions for patients. Daniel O'Day: I think that's great, Matthew. The only thing I would say, Johanna\u2019s captured it really well. But, we kind of put this into the durable base part of our strategic story. And I think, that's because it is a volume game. I think, there is real opportunity here obviously for patients in China but also for our business, but it helps us kind of stabilize and navigate that durable base over the course of the years to come. And it's important for patients and also for our business to build that in. And then, we have the inflection points on top of that with Yescarta business with filgotinib with a variety of things that are in our hands right now and a larger portfolio to inflect for the -- to provide our confidence in the mid-to-long term growth. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Umer Raffat : Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Perhaps first one for Johanna. Johanna, I know you worked -- in your prior role, you headed a commercial organization which was best in class in oncology and a very established organization in primary care with the Eliquis. And my question to you is, as you look at Gilead where it stands today, how prepared is the organization to compete with AbbVie and Pfizer, two companies very well entrenched in the -- with their JAKs respectively? I'm just trying to understand, the level of organizational preparedness, especially in light of which I think is probably something like $200 million plus or minus the year-over-year incremental SG&A expense possibly heading into the filgotinib launch. And one for Merdad. I know, the filgotinib UC trial selection one's due any day. I also understand that there's inadequate responders to Entyvio in there. So, those patients in particular, what percentage is that of the trial? And do you expect filgotinib to be active in Entyvio non-responders. Thank you. Johanna Mercier : So maybe I'll kick it off, Umer, with your first part of your question. So, specific to filgotinib, I think that you're right. Obviously, we are very well aware that it's going to be a very competitive environment. There's no doubt about that. But, I think we're being really smart about it. And what I mean by that is because I think what we're thinking about is making sure we're going to bring focus to the table. So, we\u2019re going to be -- we are very clear about where we want to play, and where we play, we win. And that's about commercial excellence and medical excellence, to be honest with you. Because medical and commercial are going to need to partner very closely and we are already around the clinical data and the profile of this compound, and how that really needs to be at the center of everything we do with filgotinib. I would also say that, if I take other disease areas where we had similar competitive dynamics and similar competitors to be honest, we've done actually quite well in that space. And HCV is a great example of that where we've regained share. Now, we're at 60% share in HCV across the marketplace, which I do think shows others including internally and externally that we can be very comparative when we need to be. And I think that's exactly what you're going to see with filgotinib. We are preparing the teams. We are making sure that we are hiring the right people, with the right level of experiences to making sure that we are absolutely ready for an expected launch later this year. And, I think that I'm really excited about it, to be honest with you. I think, the team has really come up as a line, and I think we've brought in some really good external talent that we already had some very good internal talent as well. And building the two together, I think we'll make for a very successful launch moving forward. Merdad Parsey : Maybe I'll start by clarifying the timing because I think you may have given my team a heart attack. I don't think it's any day now. I think we've got it to a little bit later in the first half of the year. So, please be patient with us. We will get it out there as quickly as we can. In terms of the Entyvio non-responders, I won't know the precise proportion until after we see the demography of the study afterwards, after the trial is done. So, I'm not going to -- I\u2019ll be speculating as to sort of where we land on that. So, I'm going to beg your patients on that one as well. But, in terms of expectations of response, I think if you look at this population, as you know, they cycle through a variety of medications. And while the response rate, when they cycle to the next medication, isn't usually as robust as a na\u00efve patient, there are good -- there's good evidence that going from let's say Entyvio to a TNF inhibitor or vice versa, you have -- you still have a good proportion of patients who respond in that. So, I think our expectations are fairly realistic about what the response -- that we'll have responders in there to filgotinib. Operator : Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Cory Kasimov : I wanted to ask you on the corporate strategy front with -- well, everyone's pretty clearly waiting for the Company to engage in more substantial business development, but how much of a sense of urgency do you have on this front, given kind of the new management team all coming together now? And how successful do you think Gilead can be without outside help, basically relying on the first two pillars of your strategy? Daniel O'Day: Yes. Thanks, Cory. I'll give a start and if Andy wants to add as well. So look, I think, first of all, I believe we're coming at this from a position of strength, a position of strength now that we have a complete management team with depth of experience. Of course, we're still building experience in some of our new therapeutic areas. But, we have now a team that is accomplished, that understands what good looks like, that understands how to take appropriate risks and that's relatively recent that we have this team together like this. So, it allows us, if you like, when we look at external opportunities in our areas of expertise, which is not unimportant because we've really decided to focus there. I think, it allows us to move fast. And we know that moving fast is important, and being first to the table at the right time, some cases, that's more risk, some cases that\u2019s the less risk, depending on the nature of what we're looking at. But, I think we're well prepared to be able to pivot to be first at the table or close to first at table and to make things happen. So, we have a solid pipeline, but we have a sense of urgency of course around building this. And I think we've been clear about the areas we intend to build in. We will also be disciplined. We're not going to -- we're going to take appropriate risks, but I think risks that will help us build the shape of the portfolio, very much like Merdad mentioned before. And we'll take that into account too. So, it's not just about an individual target or assets, it's also about how that fits into the complementary nature of that therapeutic area and, or other therapeutic areas. And that's where we'll pivot and move with. But rest assured, our sense of urgency around this is high, but so is our expertise I would say as well. Andy, do you want to add to that? Andrew Dickinson : The only thing I would add, I agree that there is a sense of urgency. We'll be disciplined. I\u2019d say, to some extent, Cory that that best proxy is just looking at the past couple of years. I mean, we've outperformed commercially the last two years. We've given very clear guidance for 2020. Obviously, we will work incredibly hard to outperform again. We see opportunities, things that we can potentially do better. We would like to find external assets to supplement our pipeline, but we also feel that the durability of our existing business and our existing pipeline are both underappreciated. So to answer your second question on, can we compete without doing large business development deals? Absolutely. I mean, and we think that we can continue to build a sustainable business. Would we like to supplement it with outside assets, especially to build our late stage pipeline? Yes. And we are actively working on that. But, to reiterate what Dan said, we're going to be thoughtful and disciplined in how we do it. Operator : Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Citi. Your line is now open. Mohit Bansal : Thanks for taking my question. And if you could talk a little bit about the market opportunity with the capsid inhibitor, especially in heavily treated patients? Should we think about this as an incremental opportunity, or you think the portion of it could be from existing Gilead products? Thank you. Johanna Mercier : So, I think, I can touch on it from a commercial standpoint and then maybe pass it over to Diana to touch a little bit more on its clinical profile and its offerings. From a commercial standpoint, we're thinking about the caspid in two ways. One, in prevention and the other one in treatment. Obviously, we think there's probably an opportunity we'll see to see if there's monotherapy and prevention and potentially obviously, we're looking for combination in the treatment. And Diana can touch on that a little bit more. In prevention, I do think with Descovy right now in prevention and the launch of what's going on, we do think that\u2019s probably going to be something that could be very interesting for patients, if you think about that marketplace and thinking potentially after six months. And that's really what patients are looking for to have something every six months. This could be something very interesting and exciting for patients. And that would be with the timing that we're thinking about for this compound is assuming all plays out, then it could be actually more of a switch in the prevention market from Descovy to the capsid inhibitor. Having said that in treatment that could look very different. And I do think that\u2019s potentially a market expansion because it would really be, if we can find a combination that would really work in the treatment setting, I do think that would offer a long-acting that patients actually really want. And that's the biggest piece of the puzzle. What we're trying to do is making sure that we match up what the patients are telling us with our clinical development plan. And what I mean by that is as we've done so much market research with our patient pool, what they're telling us is yes, weekly oral would be interesting and potentially something that they might be interested over a daily compound, but it's not for everyone. And then, when you go from weekly oral to potentially what else would they want, would they rather an injectable to subcu, subcu wins out, if they'd rather three months in six months, six months wins out. And so, that's really where we have focused our clinical development team to make sure that we're addressing the needs of patients. And maybe with that, I'll turn it over to Diana. Diana Brainard : We recognize the bar is very high because Biktarvy has really set the standard. But, we also know that within the U.S., for example only 85% of people with HIV are in treatment. And if we want to end the epidemic, we have to do better. And the capsid inhibitor is going to be one of those tools. And we really see it, as Johanna was saying, as a market expander. Because one of the reasons that those people aren't in treatment is that the treatments right now are not amenable to their lifestyles. And so, a long-acting is a way to make the umbrella a little bit larger. It's a complement to Biktarvy and what we have already. Operator : Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open. Alethia Young : I just wanted to ask maybe perhaps Dan and Merdad about the NASH and hep B space. I mean, I know it's one that's been pretty tough in the clinical side, but obviously there's a lot of leverage to your business, since you have the sales force in place. So, I guess, I'm just trying to figure out where are you guys going to think about that going forward over the next 12 months? Thanks. Merdad Parsey : For NASH, I think, we definitely are working hard on the results from the ATLAS trial. And we'll be talking with the regulators and looking to see what the path forward is. As you said\u2026 Daniel O'Day: The data will be published at EASL. Merdad Parsey : EASL, right, exactly. So, in April we'll show the data to everyone in April at EASL. And we have plans for a sort of midyear discussion with the agency to sort of see if there's a path forward and what that might look like and make a decision based on those discussions. Just a reminder that we've been studying more F3 and F4 patients, the more severe patients than most of the other competition has where they're looking at the milder patient populations, the F1s to F3s --F2s and F3s, sorry, primarily. So, it does pose some unique challenges. So, we will continue to work there. And I think that -- I would say the same thing for HBV, right? I think it's -- HBV is a bit different in that. It is a core part of our business. We have therapies, we have a sales force, to your point on that. We're continuing to be committed to that space and working there. Our focus is on a cure. We have ongoing work with a number of programs to try to hit our move from where we are today in treatment to moving towards a cure. That's going to be a challenging road, but we're committed to it and continue to work there. Daniel O'Day: Yes. I think, I couldn\u2019t agree more with Merdad\u2019s view. The only thing I would maybe add to that, Alethia, is just to say, particularly in hep B we understand that at the end of the day this is going to take partnerships. So, we have to decide, what do we do internally, what do we do with partners. Care is significantly more difficult than treatment in this area. And so, I think that gets back into some of the comments that both Merdad and I had around how much do we invest in ourselves, how much do we do with partnerships, what percentage of our total investment goes into these very, very important unmet medical needs and making sure that we also invest appropriately in other areas that we know have even greater realization potential that also have big unmet medical needs. So, that balance will continue to play out. The reality is we have very good expertise in both these diseases. And I think we'll be able to make good decisions. Operator : Our next question comes from Salim Syed with Mizuho. Your line is now open. Salim Syed : Thanks so much guys for taking my question. And I appreciate all the color on the guidance, Andy. Just one for me on sort of the long-term picture here. And I\u2019m not asking for long-term guidance. Maybe this is for Dan or Andy. Obviously, you guys provided a lot of color. Johanna, you mentioned Biktarvy, majority of patients through 2033. You guys seem relatively excited about what you have currently in the pipeline with filgotinib et cetera. But with consensus as you modeled at $22 billion, sort of flattish for the next few years, do you need M&A to grow your top-line or do you think you can grow your top line without any additional M&A? Thanks so much. Daniel O'Day: Yes. Thanks, Salim. I\u2019ll certainly have others comment here as well. But look, I think, as we've tried to build the story and as I've come to investigate the story and some of the other colleagues around the table, I think the first answer to your question is how durable is our base business. Because I think that has a very different -- depending on how durable you feel it is, that has a very different perspective on our confidence around the mid to long term growth. So, I think, and we've talked quite a bit about this, we feel very confident with the durability of our base business. And this is different, by the way, compared to a lot of companies in the industry. Yes, we have, as you know, from our guidance we\u2019re issuing today, we've got some patent expiry to deal with this year and some patent expiry to deal with next year in terms of Truvada. But then, as you look out in terms of time, we feel well-prepared for the Descovy patent expiry in \u201825, \u201826. And we basically then have a very durable franchise out until 2033. So that's the first part of the answer into the story. Then we do feel that we have growth engines internally and that's exactly why we've tried to highlight them a bit more, give you exposure to them, be transparent about it, but also be very clear about where those inflection points are, things that we have in our hands today. And of course, some of the obvious ones, we have on the plate with things like ulcerative colitis, potentially reading out this year, second line DLBCL, capsid inhibitor coming next year, but we didn't talk about a variety of things that are coming to the Galapagos pipeline that also have optionality for us, if you like. And that's, osteoarthritis, the Phase 2 will come true this year. And then we'll have an IPF interim next year. So, there are a variety of things in our hands, including other collaborations. I'm not speaking out here today that are in Phase 1 or label enabling Phase 2s that are going to read out. And we're giving you all the exposure to the pipeline and portfolio. So, can we grow based upon what we have in house? Yes. I'm confident we can. And I also believe that we're going to supplement that and de-risk that over time. And we're going to continue to do it in a way that you've seen us do that with proper partnerships and proper M&A transactions to get to a portfolio strength that's even more obvious to everybody and even more reliable. And that's going to take some time to build that and to grow it. But, we're firmly committed to do that and we have the resources to be able to do it. I mean, that's what I would say, Andy. Would you\u2026 Andrew Dickinson : No. I think that\u2019s perfect. I don\u2019t have anything else to add. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company. Your line now open. Phil Nadeau : One question for Andy, the 2020 guidance, just kind of maybe three moving parts that weren't mentioned on slide 25. and I was just curious to get your thoughts on whether these will materially impact revenue in 2020. So, the positive side first is filgotinib, any expectations for filgotinib revenue contemplated in your guidance? Then, maybe as potential headwinds in HIV, the nucleotide sparing regimens are launching, any expectation for those to gain share through the course of the year? And on HCV, price has been deteriorating over the last couple of years, any expectations for further declines in price, again, contemplated in the guidance? Thank you. Andy Dickinson : Yes. At a high level, and Johanna may want to comment on the HIV headwinds. In filgo, there's limited contribution in 2020, as you'd expect, given the projected launch date. So, there is potential upside there, if that develops. We think it's been a lot of time in the HIV market. So, as you might expect, our expectations for the competitive dynamic in the HIV market are built into our guidance. And then, in the HCV space, we do expect there to be continued price pressure in the HCV space. If you see from third quarter to the fourth quarter, if you look at our slides, the number of patients that were treated actually went up. Nonetheless, revenues are down, given kind of the dynamic in that space. So, obviously, it's a smaller -- speaking HCV, it's a smaller piece of our business. But, we -- our guidance assumes continued decrease in that business over time, but it's still an important business for us. It generates a lot of cash flow. And on a percentage basis, although the increase is the same on a dollar basis, it's less and less year-over-year, and at some point, it may stabilize. But, that's how I would think about it, still at a high level. I don't know, Johanna, if you want to add, anything to that. Johanna Mercier : Yes. No, I'm totally aligned with what you said. I would just add from HCV standpoint, the only thing I would add to that is, it's just so much more predictable today than it was. And so -- and the declines are much, much softer. And so, what you're going to see is still continued price erosion across U.S. and Europe, and the patient starts are a little bit less every single quarter. But having said that, it's nothing like what we've seen in the past. So, I think much more predictable marketplace for us. In HIV, I think we have had some of those, I guess headwinds, as you say, from a competitors standpoint, mid last year, I guess, or so when competition came into the marketplace. And we have been able to manage that extremely well and very limited impact to Biktarvy and its growth trajectory. And so, we believe the same will continue throughout 2020. Daniel O'Day: I think, that's the end of our call today. Operator? Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to introduce Senior Director of Investor Relations, Doug Maffei. Doug Maffei : Thank you, Andrew, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release with earnings results for first quarter 2020. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead Web site. The speakers on today's call will be Daniel O'Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Andrew Dickinson, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the will be Johanna Mercier, Chief Commercial Officer; Merdad Parsey, Chief Medical Officer; Christi Shaw, Chief Executive Officer of Kite; and Diana Brainard, SVP and Head of HIV and Emerging Viruses Therapeutic Area. Before we begin with our prepared comments, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including risks and uncertainties related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gilead's business and results of operations. Plans and expectations with regards to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital and 2020 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on the information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statement. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the Company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, as well as on Gilead Web site. I will now turn the call over to Dan. Daniel O'Day: Thank you very much, Doug, and good afternoon, everyone. Well, as you can imagine it's been an extraordinary week for Gilead given the terrific news on our investigational antiviral drug Remdesivir. The news shared yesterday that the data showed the potential of Remdesivir to help ease some of the burden of the pandemic, is the outcome that we had all hoped would be possible. We're incredibly humbled to think about what this news could mean for patients and communities. I'd like to start by sharing my thanks to everyone who has helped to bring Remdesivir to this point, including all those involved in the collaborative clinical trials, the trial investigators, governments, hospitals and above all, the patients who participated. I want to acknowledge our internal teams that have been working day and night on Remdesivir for the past three months, following many years of research long before the outbreak began. Because of their Remdesivir news, the original focus for today's call has somewhat shifted. I'm sure you have a lot of questions on the results and the next steps. We'll provide an overview of what was a strong first quarter for Gilead, but with an abbreviated set of opening comments so we can leave more time for questions. I'll speak briefly about the quarter and Remdesivir before turning the call over to Andy to discuss financial details and the impact of COVID-19 on our business. As Doug noted in the opening, Christie, Joanna, Mehrdad and Diana have joined us today to answer your questions at the end of the call. Gilead has been built to withstand significant challenge. There's a short-term uncertainty for all of us, but the solid foundations that Gilead has laid over the past 30 years and our focus on transformational therapeutics give us confidence in the long-term durability of the business. We'll do our best to provide you with a clear picture of where we are and what we expect as far as the near-term impact of COVID-19, while acknowledging that, as we all know, these are uncertain times with many unknowns, not least of which is how long the pandemic will last. So, turning to the quarter. I'll use the framework we introduced at the start of the year with the three pillars that will shape our future; our strong core business, our internal pipeline and supplemental growth opportunities that are being enabled through our strategies. Our performance in the first quarter demonstrated the strength of our foundational business once again with double-digit growth in HIV. We reached and in fact exceeded all of our targets. Revenues for our HIV franchise were up 14% year-over-year. This was driven by both treatment and prevention as Biktarvy remain the number one prescribed HIV regimen in the U. S. during the quarter and approximately 38% of individuals on PrEP are now taking Descovy. What I would say in general about where we stand in HIV is this. We are very confident in the underlying competitiveness of our products and our position as the leader in HIV. Completing the picture in our core antivirals business, we saw sustained revenues from our HCV franchise in the last quarter. Since the introduction of authorized generics in the U. S. we've regained market share and now hold around 61% of share through Asegua and Gilead. So moving from our core business to advancing our pipeline, I\u2019ll provide just a brief overview. More detailed information is available as part of our first quarter earnings materials in the investor relations sections of our Web site. Filgotinib, as you're aware, is under regulatory review in the United States, Europe and Japan as a potential treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Our teams are preparing for a competitive launch and remain in close contact with regulators to understand the effect COVID-19 could have on reviewed timelines. In HIV, we made progress across our pipeline, sharing important data at the virtual CROI conference. With our innovative long-acting anti viral and HIV cure programs, reinforcing our long term commitment to people living with HIV. In cell therapy, the FDA accepted Kite BLA, for KTE-X19 as a treatment for relapsed and refractory mantle cell lymphoma during the first quarter and granted a priority review designation. As you might recall, the European Medicines Agency validated our application in January. This represents really important progress patients with relapsed refractory mantle cell lymphoma, a rare form of non-Hodgkins lymphoma, are in need of new therapies. If approved, Kite would be the first company with two cell therapies on the market. So I\u2019ve touched on our strong core business and advancing our pipeline. Now I want to say a few words about the work we are doing to expand our pipeline through business development, including of course the acquisition of Forty Seven completed earlier this month. Acquiring Forty Seven is a great early example of our strategy in action. We said we would build on our core area of expertise, which as you know are virology and immuno-modulation that we would keep a high bar and then our business development efforts will focus on clinical stage assets, such as magrolimab, which we gained as a part of this acquisition. We're working to integrate the teams in the program. It\u2019s a joint effort which I'm leading with Mark McCamish, the CEO of Forty Seven with the objectives of keeping things moving smoothly with magrolimab and defining a working model that supports continued innovation. Next month researchers will present data on our next generation cancer therapies virtually at ASCO, including magrolimab and a number of abstracts that highlight the Kite cell therapy portfolio. The presentations at ASCO underscore the strength of our scientific approach in immunooncology, and we look forward to sharing this latest research. Beyond Forty Seven, our business development team remains as active as ever. In the last month, we've announced three partnerships, a collaboration with Second Genome to identify biomarkers and potential new drug targets in inflammation, a licensing agreement between Kite and Teneobio covering a dual targeting CAR-T therapies, and a three year collaboration with oNKo-innate to discover cancer immunotherapies. Overall, we continue to maintain our momentum and I'm pleased with all the progress we've made this quarter. I'll now turn to Remdesivir. The study results shared yesterday from the randomized placebo controlled Phase 3 NIAID study and from our own open label Phase 3 SIMPLE study in patients with severe disease, are important progress as we seek to understand the role that Remdesivir might play in easing the burden of COVID-19 around the world. These trials are part of a suite of clinical trials investigating the effects of Remdesivir. We designed the clinical research program to ask multiple questions in parallel, including what groups of patients are most likely to respond and when to treat and for how long. Various study designs were used from placebo controlled to open label to answer very specific questions in each case. We expected that the answers would emerge around the same time and that taken together, they would form a clear picture of how Remdesivir might best be used for patients. Yesterday, we answered important questions with the initial results of the NIAID trial and SIMPLE trials. The NIAID data demonstrated that patients with COVID-19 who received Remdesivir recovered faster than similar patients who received placebo. The results from the Gilead-sponsored SIMPLE study address a critical question about dosing. The data from the first of the SIMPLE studies showed similar clinical improvements in patients with severe symptoms with COVID-19 regardless of whether they received 5 or 10 days of treatment. The ability to shorten duration for severely ill patients is very important. It means patients can go home earlier, hospital resources can be freed up and it has a positive impact of course on our supply. We had calculated having 1.5 million doses by the end of May, amounting to 140,000 treatment courses at a 10 day treatment duration. The Gilead SIMPLE study suggests we may now be able to significantly increase the number of courses available with a 5 day treatment duration for certain patients. As we announced previously, we are donating our entire existing supply, frankly because this is the right thing to do at this time and the human health need in the pandemic. As you know, we've been ramping up production since January. We\u2019ve significantly reduced lead times and expanded our global network of partners. As additional raw materials come available, we'll have an exponential increase in supplies towards the latter half of this year. We hope to have produced enough supplies to treat over a million patients by year end. We are also working to build a global consortium of pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturers to expand global capacity and production. It will be essential for countries to work together to create enough supply for people all over the world, and we look forward to these collaborative efforts. For access and allocation, we'll work closely with government and healthcare system to provide access. We intend to allocate our available supply based on guiding principles that aim to direct global access for appropriate patients in urgent need of treatment. We recognize there's a lot of work left to be done and a long way to go in finding medical solutions to end the pandemic, and we'll continue to work with regulatory authorities and the best path forward for Remdesivir. At the same time, all of us at Gilead are relieved and grateful that our efforts in Remdesivir have led to this important progress at a time when we all need a beacon of hope. Before I turn the call over to Andy, I want to re reiterate how grateful we are for the partnership with many groups outside Gilead to support the work on Remdesivir. Our collaboration throughout this pandemic has been critical [Technical Difficulty]. Andrew Dickinson : Sounds like we lost Dan. I'll just finish Dan's comments. We also want to say how proud we are of the way our employees have demonstrated such dedication to meeting the needs of patients those with COVID-19, as well as those with conditions, including HIV, viral hepatitis and cancer who depend on us for their medications. So with that, I will turn to our financial comments and then we'll move to Q&A. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Andrew Dickinson. I'm the company's CFO. Before I start, I'd also like to acknowledge the incredible work of our 12,000 employees and what they're doing during these challenging times. Their dedication and resilience is really inspiring. In addition from the outset, I'd like to emphasize that our core business is very strong, durable, and provides a solid foundation to navigate the current environment. We continue to have confidence in 2020 and beyond. The pandemic has not diminished that view at all, and we remain confident in our long term outlook. I'd like to first briefly share some commentary on our very strong first quarter results. And I'll remind you that the earnings materials posted on our Web site can help all of the details, including preliminary color on the impact of COVID-19 on our business to date, as well as our preliminary expectations for the coming months. We are happy to walk through the results and the impact of COVID-19 on our business today in detail during the Q&A session. Starting with our revenues for the quarter. Total revenues for the first quarter were $5.5 billion with non-GAAP earnings of $1.68 per diluted share. This compares to revenue of $5.3 billion with non-GAAP earnings of $1.67 per diluted share for the same period last year. Product sales for the first quarter were $5.5 billion, down 6% sequentially and up 5% year-over-year. I'd like to call out that we believe approximately $200 million of revenues were pulled forward in Q1, primarily for our HIV franchise due to the COVID-19 pandemic across the U. S. and Europe. This was the result of payers and pharmacies providing greater access to medicines by allowing 90 day refills and in some cases, early refills among other operators. We expect this to reverse itself out over subsequent quarters. Now, turning to our expenses, non-GAAP R&D expense was $1 billion for the quarter, up 8% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the ramp up of Remdesivir, including manufacturing scale up and clinical trial costs. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $1.1 billion, up 4% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher promotional expenses in the United States related to our HIV products. As Dan highlighted, we completed our acquisition of Forty Seven this month. We currently expect to incur approximately $120 million in expenses this year related to Forty Seven, primarily in research and development. In addition, I'd like to highlight that the acquisition qualifies as an asset acquisition. And as a result, we currently expect to incur approximately $4.8 billion in GAAP R&D expense, primarily related to in process research and development. Turning to our strong balance sheet. During the quarter, we generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations. We ended the quarter with $24.3 billion in cash and marketable debt securities. We repaid $500 million of debt, paid cash dividends of $874 million and repurchased $19 million shares of stock for $1.3 billion. I want to note that we paid approximately $4.9 billion in cash upon closing the Forty Seven in April. Our strong balance sheet and disciplined allocation of capital has positioned us to continue to grow and build our business despite current environment and associated risks. We remain very confident in the durability of our business, and expect to generate significant operating cash flow during 2020. I'll turn now to COVID-19 and its impact on our business. Like others, we have anticipated that there could be a short-term financial impact to our company and to the sector as a whole. We continue to carefully review our results to assess the potential magnitude of that impact. Towards the end of the quarter ending April, we did begin to see some effects on our business, primarily as fewer patients access healthcare and the number of new starts in HCV and HIV prevention began to slow. However, to-date, the overall effect on our business has been modest and it remains unclear what the ultimate impact will be. Given this significant uncertainty regarding the duration and magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are actively planning for a number of scenarios. And we'd like to focus on our base case assumptions today, which we are making from data drawn from a number of sources, including epidemiologists, economists and public health officials. First, these base case assumptions suggest the pandemic will peak between March and July. We would point the recent data from Johns Hopkins would show trends reflecting a slowing of the rate of new cases since late March in the United States, and a declining number of new patients in some critically affected regions of the world. Second, if the virus returns in the fall or winter, the impact will be lessened due to preparedness and hopefully the emergence of therapeutics, including potentially our own Remdesivir. Third, the global economy will begin recovery late in Q2 and a return to the pre-COVID dynamics will be underway by year end. We have of course considered external views that anticipate more or -- and less favorable scenarios, but we believe this base case provides the best foundation at this time to plan in this uncertain situation. Let me share a few qualitative perspectives on potential business implications of this scenario. Please bear in mind the forward-looking statement disclosures we shared at the beginning of the call. I'd also like to highlight again that we have added significant commentary throughout the investor presentation that's posted on our Web site and we would encourage you to review those materials. There are three key takeaways from our perspective; first, we had a very strong quarter; second, to-date, the impact on our business has been modest; and third, we remain very confident in our long-term outlook. That said, on the commercial side driven by lessened healthcare provider access and fewer patient visits, we may see revenues adversely impacted in Q2 and potentially beyond. This would likely be different across our franchises with our HCV franchise disproportionately affected due to the acute care nature of the therapy. We believe that the majority of any revenue decrease in HCV revenue due to the pandemic could be recouped in a warehousing type effect later in 2020 or into 2021. In HIV, early signals suggest that switches both for treatment and prevention patients maybe impacted by COVID-19 as people defer healthcare visits. Specifically, in April, we are observing reductions in Descovy for PrEP initiations and lower switch volume. PrEP refills may also be effected, but it's still too early to fully understand any trends here. In contrast, our HIV treatment business is less likely to be significantly impacted as we believe patients will continue to prioritize refilling their prescriptions and access their physicians through telemedicine. In cell therapy, reduced access to authorized treatment centers could unfortunately result in critically ill patients having access challenges, which would impact the business. Turning to clinical development. Like many others in our industry, we are pausing enrollment for most trials. The exception to this is studies where patient outcomes are critically impacted, such as trials of our HIV Capsid inhibitor in heavily pretreated individuals who have few other treatment options and some of our study programs that have enrolled patients with cancer who are critically ill. Enrollment in these studies is at the discretion of the investigators. Overall, we expect reduced clinical development expenses in the short term. In addition, the dynamic could lead to delays and potential approvals for pipeline assets over the longer run. With challenge brings opportunity to help. And as Dan described earlier, we are excited by emerging results in Remdesivir as a potential therapy for COVID-19. As we ramp up further development and manufacturing of Remdesivir, we will incur additional costs beyond those forecasts the beginning of the year. The magnitude of this investment is dependent on the continued evolution of the data, the duration of the pandemic and other factors. The potential range of this investment for 2020 is up to $1 billion and the accounting treatment of this investment is dependent upon a number of factors, including potential regulatory approvals. We\u2019re authorized by regulatory authorities that Gilead will focus on making Remdesivir both accessible and affordable to governments and patients around the world. Given the continued uncertainty in the trajectory of the pandemic and in Remdesivir clinical data, it's premature to define what the right post donation business model is to create a sustainable long term supply for global needs. In the context of strong underlying business and Q1 results, we will continue to monitor the situation and expect to provide additional insights and outlook on our Q2 earnings call. I'd like to close by thanking our team for their extraordinary efforts and for delivering a very strong first quarter during these challenging times. We can now turn the call over to Q&A. Operator? Operator : Thank you [Operator instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael Yee : So my question is for you guys on Remdesivir as it relates to [Technical Difficulty]. One, can you just describe the inputs into how to think about what revenue [impact] [ph] to the positive Remdesivir could have this year [Technical Difficulty] what are the impacts on that, inputs into that? And on expenses you guys obviously don't [Technical Difficulty] guidance you kind of walk through that, you described [Technical Difficulty] dollars for Remdesivir. Maybe just walk through the inputs there and how to think about why would it be on the lower end and a comment on that, because [indiscernible] model you're [Technical Difficulty]? Thanks. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Michael. Appreciate the questions and sorry guys that I got cut off there before. Thanks, Andy, for picking up. I want to conclude with my comments is probably the most important comment is to really thank the colleagues throughout Gilead that are working on Remdesivir and non-Remdesivir projects alike, they've really kept the momentum going in quarter one. And I'm humbled and proud to be working with them. So Michael, thank you for the call. On the revenue side, it is just as Andy mentioned also and I mentioned, it's too premature. You know there's a lot of moving parts right now. Our focus will be on making sure we come up with a sustainable model that allows us to provide Remdesivir to patients around the globe that is intent on providing access and affordability. We're just now going through the clinical data, the demand scenarios, the regulatory approvals, all these things are essential for us to put inputs into our plan about how that will work post the donation. So we can't really give more insight into that at this stage, but certainly when we can we will. On the expense side, Andy, I mean, obviously you had mentioned already that up to $1 billion and unclear on how the accounting will occur. But perhaps you want to add something else to Michael's question. Andrew Dickinson : At this point, it's too early to tell you where that's going to [fall on the] [ph] P&L because there\u2019re number of scenarios. Those expenses could fall into cost of goods sold. As you know, there could be R&D expenses and in some scenarios, a portion of them could also be SG&A expenses. So at a high level, the expenses that we're referencing as you would expect come from manufacturing predominantly and to a lesser extent clinical trials. And I think that's our best good faith estimate at this time based on what we know in terms of the expenses that we see as we ramp up over the year. And we'll do everything we can to provide more color and commentary in particular on our Q2 earnings call. Michael Yee : I appreciate it. [A billion] [ph] of expenses and not knowing the revenue, its an interesting position. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JP Morgan. Cory Kasimov : I wanted to also ask on Remdesivir, no surprise. I was wondering if you could talk about the formulation work that's underway to potentially develop an oral and/or an inhaled version of the product. How far along might you be on this front and when can we expect to see something more there? Daniel O'Day: Thanks Corey. I'll start it out and maybe others on the call want to add. But our focus, as you can imagine since January, has been on ramping up the supply, particularly so that we have the lyophilized version that's appropriate for an intravenous administration, the clinical program, all of that. So, it's really where we have been. At the same time though, we have had a team just as with everything with this program, including the supply we've had teams that have been really since the very day one in January have been focusing on success. And so if successful, how else could we potentially develop this medicine? I think that's been taken into account from the totality of the clinical trial program, looking at those critical, severe and moderate patients. But likewise, we've done the same thing with other alternative delivery mechanisms, presuming success that might make it more convenient for patients or allowed us to broaden the patient groups that could benefit from a successful antiviral. And that work is, as you can imagine, still early. But we can say a couple of things. It's not, this particular medicine, because it's heavily first half metabolized in the liver, is not really appropriate as an oral formulation. We've known that for years, probably a decade. But we are looking into things like subcutaneous formulations and potentially inhaled formulations. And although, it's too premature to give you timelines on that, rest assured that we've been actively working on those. And as soon as we can give some timelines, we will see now particularly because of the efficacy that we've seen this week, we'll continue to pursue those with a great sense of urgency. But timeline is a little premature. Just know that we've been working on it now for several months. I don't know Merdad, if you want to add anything. You\u2019re okay, good. Merdad is okay. Okay, Cory, I know you need more, but we'll give you more as soon as we can. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Brian Abrahams : Two questions on Remdesivir if I could and appreciate all the work that you guys are doing to bring this treatment to patients, first off on the NIAID study. Can you give us any sense of the proportion of patients who are involved in the interim? Is there any additional update that we should be expecting that could be a gating factor to availability, and your level of confidence that differences and baseline risk factors didn't influence those results as may have happened in the China study? And then secondly, related to supply, any particular subsets of patients across the studies where you may be seeing the most optimal benefits where you might consider working regulators to direct the [indiscernible] while you're scaling up? Thanks. Daniel O'Day: Just to be clear on your second one related to supply, you said is there any subset of patients. Can you just complete that one more time? Brian Abrahams : Yes, any subset of patients where you might be seeing more benefits, more optimal benefits across the study, where you might consider working with regulators to try and direct the [indiscernible] initially as supply gets [Multiple Speakers]... Daniel O'Day: I get it . In terms of like an allocation. Yes, with limited allocation or limited [Multiple Speakers]\u2026 Brian Abrahams : Exactly\u2026 Daniel O'Day: Yes, got it. Okay, I'm going to turn it over to Merdad and I'll let Merdad take a stab at both of those. Merdad Parsey : On the first question, we've not seen a lot of the baseline demography and the sorts of data that would help in terms of answering your question on the NIAID study. So I think we're all going to have to wait for those data to get published and put out for us all for review. So, I think that's pending and we'll look for that to come out. In terms of patient subsets, I think our data and if you look at who's been enrolled in the trials overall, I think we're clearly looking at the hospitalized patient population and we're looking at patients who are requiring supplemental oxygen is the primary population that we're after, including those that may either become ventilated or may start out mechanically ventilated. Certainly, our data support that from our open label trials, the NIAID study enrolled that breadth of patients but we have not seen subgroup analyses of the different patient populations to give you clarity there. But we believe it'll be in that fairly broad population early on. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Just want to say great job for the whole team really for Remdesivir development. A couple of points here on COVID-19. Have you guys looked at other nukes for earlier stage patients? Just thinking about 938 or [indiscernible]. I know you guys have a lot probably that is there that could be more applicable to some mild to moderate patients. And then on Remdesivir access, is there a model to license out IP and their manufacturing? I'm just thinking about how to accelerate perhaps broader access outside the U. S. Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Yes, thanks so much, Jeff for the thoughts. Everybody at Gilead will appreciate your sentiment. Let's start with COVID and the other nukes. I didn't know whether Merdad or Andy you want to handle that, I'm not sure how you want to. Merdad Parsey : Sure. I think right now. This is Merdad again, Jeff. Thanks for the question. Right now, we do believe that Remdesivir is the best molecule and has the best potency against the coronavirus. Anything we do we look at and you know both we and others have been looking for other molecules that could have potency here. But Remdesivir is certainly the most potent molecule that we have and that's been our focus. We'll certainly keep looking there. One of the reasons we are focused on looking at alternative formulations for Remdesivir is to address the question that you asked is just how can we get to other patient populations who may benefit from the drug as outpatients, for example. And I think in the short run, I believe that that's going to be the -- short to medium-term, I think that will be the best approach for us to go. And then I think your second question was about manufacturing, right? Geoff Meacham : Yes. Daniel O'Day: I mean, Andy, maybe you want take this question as well, because you\u2019re leading the group on this. Andrew Dickinson : On the manufacturing side, I'd say a couple of things at a high level. Again, our primary focus is on providing access to patients around the world. So, just like we did with our HIV medicines and HCV medicines, we are deeply focused on this. We have two separate work streams. One is working on our internal supply chain and making sure that we have the robust supply of starting materials, intermediate and a strong manufacturing consortium to build with companies around the world. You've seen some of the references to that in Dan, CEO's letters and I would expect it will provide some additional information over the coming weeks and months. We do have a second work stream, where we are in discussions with large sophisticated companies around the globe exploring the potential for other companies to help establish separate end-to-end manufacturing supply chains. The difficulty there, as you might imagine, is that given the scarcity of some of the starting materials, we want to make sure that we don't do anything to impact our supply chain, given that that is the quickest route to getting product to patients who need it all around the world. But we are looking at alternatives. It's too early to give you any specific guidance or to tell you where we're going to land on it. But we are working with a number of companies around the world that you and others know well to see what we could do together and if there's an opportunity to benefit patients in that way. So I'll leave it at that and then we will see\u2026 Daniel O'Day: That's great Andy, and appreciate your leadership there with your business development head on, working with manufacturing. I would just add that we've been a student of other small molecules in this type of setting, whether it's [Tamiflu] in the past and some of the scale up and stockpiling that occurred there, or students of our own work, if you like, within our HIV portfolio between the developed and the developing world. So we're putting all that knowledge to work as we think about moving fast and wide in terms of our ability to produce supply, but also thinking very thoughtfully about a global footprint here, which would allow for this to, as Andy said, have different geographic representation, which we think is going to be really important. So more to come on that but we've had teams really focused on that day and night for the past several months, just to give you an idea of that. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink. Geoffrey Porges : Thank you very much, and echo the comments and appreciate all the great communication as well from down on down. So on Remdesivir, I'll ask a controversial question, that's no surprise. But Dan, Gilead has generated effective returns for investors and effective return on capital from treating hepatitis C and potentially nearly eliminating hepatitis C from treating HIV and turning it into a chronic disease, and to building a really important global stockpile of antiviral for influenza. So, what's special about COVID. Should we assume that the capital returns with the profitability for providing global treatment for COVID long-term after the first 200,000 or 300,000 courses of provided on a donation basis. Should we assume the returns are going to be similar to the returns that you've generated in other parts of the business? And then just quickly, can you give us an filgotinib? And can you launch this on a virtual basis or do you expect to be out of the virtual basis by the time that approval comes? Daniel O'Day: So, Johanna, I\u2019ll let you handle the filgotinib. But let me start with your first question, Jeff and thanks again. Obviously, we are conscious of the fact that this is unique and this is different. You mentioned some parallels to HIV, HCV even Tamiflu. But there's been no other time like this in the history of the planet than any of us have been alive. In terms of the far reaching effect of this pandemic, both medically from a patient perspective most importantly but also economically. And so I think there is no guidebook out there. There is no rulebook out there, other than that we need to be very thoughtful about how we can make sure we provide access of our medicines to patients around the globe. And do that in a sustainable way for the company for you as shareholders and we acknowledge that. And so points well taken and I would, I guess the short answer to your question is, I don't think there is a precedent to this. And so we understand our responsibility and we understand our responsibility to arrive at different audiences as we approach this. So, we'll be working back with you and we'll certainly be getting feedback from different individuals as we evolve this and as we understand for data around this. But rest assured, we understand our responsibility. With that I'm going to turn it over to Johanna please to talk a little bit filgotinib. Johanna Mercier : So, Geoffrey, I think just a quick update on filgo. We basically have hired all of our home office personnelj, both from a commercial medical standpoint, we've hired our sales leadership, field leadership as well and we're monitoring the situation really closely to be honest with you, because nobody really knows when this ends or what's the new normal and when not begin. And so we're just kind of monitoring that and planning for success to be honest with you to make sure that we are ready for launch for the second half of 2020 across all of the markets where we hope to get regulatory approval with the U. S., Japan, as well as Europe towards the end of this year. I think from a virtual launch standpoint, I think those are considerations that we're looking at in scenario planning and we haven't made a decision obviously that will be linked to the timing of this pandemic. Having said that, I will also tell you that a lot of our teams are doing virtual right now, many of the markets are doing remote detailing, virtual speaker programs, et cetera. And working through this environment despite obviously the opposites and patients not being open at this point in time. So, we're working through all that and looking at the different scenarios. But I think we need to know a little bit more information on the timing of this pandemic and how that plays out towards the end of this year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : I'm going to ask two on HIV. One, can you just talk a little bit about PrEP conversion with Descovy? I think you said you were 38%, which is actually fairly close to the target you guys were talking about. Do you think you can do better than that or not this year? And then I also noticed in the back of the slides, you were talking about a long acting Biktarvy that you\u2019re putting into clinical studies. Maybe you could comment on that. Thanks. Daniel O'Day: Thank you so much Matthew for the comments. So Joanna, why don't you start and perhaps Diana can add on the development side. Johanna Mercier : So HIV overall business have of course another solid quarter again this year. It's the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, and that's obviously driven by both the treatment and the PrEP business. So your question specific to Descovy. Yes, so we just hit 38%. And so, tracking exactly to our plan, right. We had said anywhere between 40% to 45% towards the end of this year. So, we feel confident with that number. Obviously, as Andy mentioned in his opening comments, there has been a little bit of a slowdown from a switch standpoint in the PrEP market for obvious reasons, because patients are not going there to the physicians offices. But it's modest thus far and we think a lot of those will be able to recoup towards the end of this year, when the pandemic does left. So, we feel still very confident that, yes, we think we're going to be in the range of that 40%, 45% that we had originally set out and maybe even, if all goes well and we can get out of this pandemic a little bit earlier, maybe a little bit north of that. So Diana, maybe to address the long acting. Diana Brainard : So, as you probably know, we're really pursuing multiple shots on goals for developing a partner for capsid inhibitor. We are looking at molecules across different classes, and part of that is looking at the integrase inhibitor class, and we've got really what's the best-in-class, ideal integrase inhibitor right now with Biktarvy. And so, one of our efforts has been in formulating that such that it could be a long-acting injectable and that potential sort of first-generation partner for capsid inhibitor. We've made a lot of progress. As you know, we've got a great formulation team here and we're on the verge of getting that into the clinic. Now, most Phase 1 centers globally really have been shut down or paused. So, the timing there is a little bit uncertain but we're ready and hoping to have data by the end of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Umer Raffat : Dan, we really admire Gilead\u2019s efforts during the pandemic and the drug donations et cetera. But as we go beyond that, it does seem like there will be a commercial business in the broader COVID landscape. And I don't want to peg you to $1 number but I do want to ask this. Do you envision Gilead\u2019s product offerings for COVID been beyond them Remdesivir? For example, PI combinations and/or even partnering with vaccine companies of sorts. I'm just trying to understand how you envision this category for Gilead, if I may. And Merdad, if I may ask you a quick two part question. First, do you have a certain lung concentrations in mind that you're targeting, and is that much less than the 20 micro molar as laid out in the New England Journal paper? And do you have any data from humans on what lung concentrations are we actually seeing with Remdesivir with the dose that\u2019s in the clinic? Thank you so much. Daniel O'Day: Getting back to Remdesivir and I would see this playing out over time. Again, I'm going to have to come back to some of the basis of what I said before, which is we really need some time now to reflect upon a very volatile changing situation to determine, both on a clinical side, regulatory side and pandemic side, epidemiology, what's the right sustainable model is. Rest assured that we'll come back to you as soon as we can digest that and as soon as actually a little bit more time passes, which was also one of the important reasons for the donation to allow us to obtain more information as well, what that sustainable plan a model is. But I'll just make a couple of comments on what we said in the results, so record Dr. Fauci yesterday, which is with the NIAID results and the highly statistically significant reduction in time to recovery, this now changes the landscape of your life for drug development within COVID-19. Being that one has to now think about comparing to Remdesivir and/or looking at adding to Remdesivir, which I think is exactly what the NIAID trial is going to do now. And I'm sure all of our collaborators within the drug development space, we have been working with them, we're going to continue to work with them on the most thoughtful hypotheses around how we might be fitter, just as one reflects upon the HIV building decades ago, that Remdesivir become kind of the base therapy and one looks to try to improve symptomology improvements, mortality improvements, expanding patient populations. And so that is yet another factor that will go into how we determine how best to create a sustainable solution for Remdesivir. But clearly, all those things we have been thinking about and now we have to accelerate now that we have these trial results. So, more to come on that. I will have, Merdad, you answer the lung question, if you could, please for Umer. Merdad Parsey : So what I would say is the concentration that we're looking for, as you know, we think our EASL50 in human cells is in the 10s of nanomolar range, and we know our serum concentration gets in the micromolar range. And so we should be more than adequately covered by achieving those levels with the current dosing paradigm that we have, probably by an order of magnitude or two. And certainly in the serum and based on model data in nonhuman primates, as well as mice, we see more than adequate concentrations getting into the lung of those animals and in vivo efficacy in those animals. And I think, the clinical benefits we're seeing suggests that, that's exactly what's happening in humans as well. So I think we're pretty comfortable with where we are in terms of both dosing and exposure, including in the lung. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald. Alethia Young : Thanks for taking my question, and thank you for your contribution in solving the world's problems. Maybe just one and a half from me. Were you surprised just with Remdesivir kind of working as it did with an antiretroviral that you kind of think that you might need to have people kind of earlier on virus for it to work, and do you think it worked better there? And then the second question is just a little bit around HIV. Are you seeing buying patterns changing in the public market? So like the Medicaid, the presence, et cetera, et cetera. Thanks. Daniel O'Day: Thanks a lot again for your comments. I'm going to turn the first question over to Mehrdad and the second one over to Joanna. But just as I do on your first question, and I think Merdad can fill in the details here. But, there's been a surprising consistency across all the different data elements in our clinical program from compassionate use, to interrogating what we know about the China trial, to the severe trial to the NIAID trial. And I think that is maybe not something that's completely well understood out there. And I think, Merdad, it\u2019s a part of your response, I think it'd be helpful for you to reflect upon that as well, if it's okay. Merdad Parsey : No, of course. I think, Alethia, we all were using the parallel construct of influenza for our thinking around Remdesivir, which was, you got to get in really early, given the viral kinetics and influenza and getting into late probably won't have much of an impact. And I remember at investor call a couple of months ago where I said that as well, and that was certainly our expectation. However, the wild card here and I think we're still learning is what are the viral kinetics in patients with this virus? How long does that last? And how quickly does it go up? And how quickly can we have an impact on it? So, I think the data or the data essentially that we are seeing efficacy across both patient populations, but also across trials that are really all tracking in the same direction as Dan alluded to. So even if you look at for the China data, the hazard ratios for improvement are consistently positive. The study was underpowered and I think the hazard ratios we\u2019ll probably see from the NIAID study, are going to be in the same ballpark. But with an appropriate sample size, they're highly statistically significant. Similarly, I think when we look at the mortality data, when we look at all of those different factors, this virus seems to be behaving differently. Remdesivir seems to be having efficacy in relatively broad patient population. And so, I think we're learning as we go. We'll learn more as more data are generated. We have our moderate data coming up where we\u2019ll be looking at an even less severely ill patient population. So there will be more data coming out in that population that may add to our knowledge base here to understand the spectrum. And as we talked about earlier, understanding the efficacy in the subgroups and the NIAID study will be really interesting in this and we don't have that information yet. So, I think all of those data will contribute to our overall understanding of how early do you need to be in new patients who have symptoms for less time do better. Those are certainly the trends. But there certainly seems to be benefit even in patients who have longer duration of symptoms right now. So, I'll hand it off to Johanna for the HIV question. Johanna Mercier : So Alethia, just a couple of things. We have a couple of moving pieces in the first quarter for HIV. So, I just want to -- because it's not just one piece that's making the difference here. And so the first one is obviously your seasonal inventory. So there\u2019s Q4 load off and then Q1 draw down, so that's definitely happening in Q1. Then we also had towards late March, like I'm sure many did as well, the prescription, number of days for prescription rise and inventories rise towards the end of March. We've had a bit of a mix of those two things. And specifically to government channels that you're asking the buying pattern, we do normally seem to run a little bit more of a higher mix towards government channels in the first quarter, and that obviously may negatively impacts our payer mix. So that is definitely happening in the first quarter of this year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Citigroup. Mohit Bansal : Great, thanks for taking my question. And I would also add my appreciation for your efforts against COVID-19. A quick one from my side, if you can help me. If you can update us on your collaboration programs with Galapagos timelines at this point, both for IPF as well as osteoarthritis, and specifically on osteoarthritis program? How important is it for Gilead to see the improvement in pain than we see the data for you to take a decision to opt in there? Thank you. Merdad Parsey : So with the IPF program, there is a scheduled interim analysis that will be coming up early next year and we think things will stay on track. Again, I'll put some error bars around the pandemic, but I don't think that should be impacted at least today. So, that will be something that we\u2019ll be clearly looking forward to and will be important to how we proceed there. In terms of the osteoarthritis, it's a great question. I think while seeing structural improvement is going to be really important and interesting. Certainly, thus far the regulatory guidance has included looking at symptoms like pain for improvement. So we can push on that. Obviously, if we see special improvement and we haven't been powered for example for pain then we'll have to look at that and think about what the implications of that are and discuss it with the regulators. So, I think what we'll be looking for is directionality on all the endpoints that we will be measuring to make a smart decision in terms of moving forward with that program. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with SunTrust. Robyn Karnauskas : Hey, guys thanks for taking my questions. And again, great work on all the things you're doing to help it help us with COVID. So, there's a lot of talk about the Remdesivir being approved for emergency use, and can you just clarify. Does that mean that at that point in time versus now where it's compassionate you actually could charge for the drug? And when you say affordable, does that mean a positive margin for the product? And lastly, from a science point of view, help me understand what would it take first in these drugs, or your drug on top of other drugs to work in a ventilator patient do you think theoretically? Thank you. Daniel O'Day: So, I'll turn the ventilator question over to Merdad in just a second, but thanks. So to clarify the EUA. So, yes, I mean, under an emergency use authorization, one could charge for the product. We made a decision, as you know, to donate 1.5 million vials, which has the entirety of our supplies through the early summer and that's for a variety of uses, right. I mean that's for clinical trials as one would expect not to charge for those of course, compassionate use, [EAP] in other countries, but also available is that supply for regulatory approvals around the world, and then we'll allocate accordingly as those regulatory approvals come online. So yes, it is possible to charge. I would just say that our goal here is to get a full approval for Remdesivir. We feel the data supports that and then EUA therefore is a step to really a more formalized approval. The reason the agency and we are talking about that is these are extraordinary times. So, weeks would make a difference to be able to get medicine to patients by enacting an EUA, if that's what the FDA chooses to do prior to another form of approval. And so it's a step wise approach, which allows us to immediately address these humanitarian needs, while still pursuing all the aspects of a normal approval, which we are doing with the FDA. So, I think that's probably the most important point. And again, I know Robyn and trust us. We will be answering your questions on the sustainable model for Remdesivir in the future, in the near future. We just don't have the answers yet and we -- but we deeply respect and appreciate the fact that when we get into millions of doses, we have to have a sustainable economic model that works here and that achieves access to affordability to patients around the world. So, more to come on that. If I could turn it over to Merdad on the ventilated treatment approach. Merdad Parsey : The criticality of this comes down to a timing question. It really comes down to how long is viral replication ongoing in the lungs of patients, and how quickly do patients deteriorate to needing mechanical ventilation. Certainly, what we're seeing is that, patients are very, very rapidly deteriorating, some patients deteriorate rapidly. And so getting them into viral therapy in that timeframe where it seems that there's still viral replication going on certainly seems to be benefiting those patients. And probably what's going on and this is speculation on my part is by limiting the viral replication, you're going to limit the inflammation, you're going to reduce the number of people who develop lung injury, and you're going to get them off the ventilator faster. So, the discharge rates that we're seeing where the people are being discharged four days earlier, for example, in NIAID study underlying that are patients who are deescalate their need for oxygenation and that leads them to getting on to room air more quickly. And I think -- so there's a time element in all of this that I think is probably where we're benefiting these patients. Certainly if you talk about people who've been ventilated for a week or two weeks, there the question of whether an antiviral would be beneficial, I think seems more difficult to tie into what's going on. But again, it comes down to understand the viral kinetics here and that's a work in progress, I think for all of us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Salim Syed with Mizuho. Salim Syed : Hey guys, thanks so much for the question. And I echo all my peer\u2019s comments on the great work you guys have done on Remdesivir. Dan, maybe just one for me, a high level of question here around your involvement, maybe with folks in Washington, you're discussions there. So obviously, biotech for some time has been about, from Washington perspective about drug pricing and the rhetoric has been pretty negative. I'm wondering if the rhetoric has changed at all in your view, which is when you're dealing with folks there, how it's particularly changed given -- and you guys are still key to this from Remdesivir and the solution to COVID-19? Daniel O'Day: Yes, these are unusual times for all of us, I'm sure in all of your areas of interest, as well as ours. And so what I can say is that I think people have come together in a variety of ways, and certainly that's also occurred to a certain degree in Washington. And I've spent a decent amount of time in Washington over the past several months, certainly, before the shelter in place. And I think even then, there is some change in the rhetoric. I think for highly innovative research based companies that have immediately kind of shifted their efforts to solutions on the coronavirus, it's pretty impressive actually to many of the peers in the industry, that I stay in very close touch with have spared no expense to kind of pivot and shift. So I think at the end of the day, I think this will certainly help the industry\u2019s reputation, I think the ability to solve a human crisis like this, because of the decades of investments and the at risk investments that's done by so many companies, people I think will -- and the general public will see that. And whether that's treatment, different types of treatments or vaccines, I think that will be the case. But certainly to your point, I think the tone is different in Washington. I think people are very appreciative and concerned about finding solutions here, and it's brought us all together, which I think is a good thing. I'm not suggesting that, there won't continue to be focus and pressure on drug pricing. Of course, there will be. And we continue to work appropriately to make sure that, in particular the patients that are bearing the brunt sometimes of some of the pharmaceutical pricing that legislation is put into place that supports that and improve that for patients and that we lean in as an industry and as a company to give more that flows through to patients. So all of those principles I think still apply, but it's being done now in a way where we can have an appreciation for the innovation that the industry brings. So more to come. And a lot is still to happen this year with the election coming up and with other things. But, I think from a Gilead perspective, we stay focused on innovative medicines and making sure we have access programs on leaning into legislation that supports the innovative industry and that supports reducing patient out of pocket costs, and that will be our focus accordingly, Salim. So hope that gives a little bit of a insight. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren with Piper Sandler. Tyler Van Buren : Thanks for everything that you're doing, and have a couple more Remdesivir questions of course. Given your experience, your expertise in viral infections and all the natural history that you guys are collecting in real time. Want to ask you about your best, latest thoughts on the nature of COVID-19 recurrence. Your base case assumes a peak potentially by July return in the fall and winter but a lower impact. So, is it possible provide a rough quantification of what that lower impact might be? And then also in subsequent years, is this something that you would expect in that base case to peter out or to be with us for potentially the next decade or two? And then the second question is just following up on your earlier comments on FDA interactions and potential pathways to approval, which was helpful. Have you guys had labeling discussions? Is there any color you could provide there? Daniel O'Day: On Remdesivir, right? Tyler Van Buren : Yes. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Tyler, again, for the comments and I might ask if Andy and Merdad want comment on the first question. Let me start with the second. So, yes, we've been in constant dialog with the agency on Remdesivir. I just have to really also say how thankful we are for the FDA and other members of the government, the coronavirus task force that have really made themselves available, really literally all the time when we need them and vice versa. So, it's been a very good collaborative relationship. In terms of Remdesivir and the interactions with the FDA, I mean, we have been working with them on the submission. They've been open to receiving parts of the submission, which has been very helpful under a normal process, plus there's the whole EUA process that kind of goes on top of that. So yes, the answer is and you can imagine that obviously, that's been going on for weeks and actually a couple of months now. But in the past 48 hours, it's increased in intensity. So, we are and the team is in constant kind of information exchange with the agency right now, and they're getting information from us. So obviously from NIH on the NIAID trial and there's a big sense of urgency here. I think the FDA understands the importance of reacting quickly to this. And so, it's intense right now. And we think the FDA will move quite quickly on the decision on the labeling side. So, back to the lower impact of the base case. I don't know Merdad, from a scientific perspective or Andy, if you want to provide any other -- I think, we don't have a crystal ball like it\u2019s\u2026 Merdad Parsey : Yes, I think -- and Tyler, we are as much a consumer as others. I think we are -- obviously our data, our snapshot into what's going on. But we use for on modeling, we use the external epidemiology data and use that right now to get the broader picture. So, I don't think we have any unique insights today that don't rely on the same sources that everyone else. So that's I think where we are. Obviously, as we capture more data and maybe that would change, but today I think that's where we are. And I'll just echo what Dan said. This has been an unprecedented time in terms of our interactions with the regulators, both here in the U. S., as well as outside the U. S. It's been really impressive and truly collaborative working with NIH and the FDA in parallel over the past couple of months and we talk constantly, and the same is true with EMA, same as true is Japan, where we're talking to all the regulators in parallel. So it's been a pretty unique situation and I think everyone understands the gravity. So, that's been very helpful in moving forward collaboratively. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company. Phil Nadeau : Two more questions on Remdesivir. The first is on the upcoming data from the SIMPLE trial, the modern trial due in May. Can you remind us how the enrollment criteria and endpoint definitions deferred between the NIAID trial and that upcoming data set? And so should we expect similar data or are there notable differences? And then second, just a follow up question on Tyler's on the FDA approval pathway. Dan, your answer to Tyler's question suggests that you may not need any more data to get a formal FDA approval. The NIAID trial might be sufficient. Is that your current understanding of your FDA dialog? Daniel O'Day: Yes, I'll let Merdad also discuss. So, yes I just -- look, the discussions are still ongoing in terms of what's required for a formal approval. What I meant to infer earlier is that the NIAID data are demonstrates safety and efficacy at a highly statistical level, which is usually the barrier for a full approval. So, that's what we're working with them on. And I don't want to get ahead of the agency on that, if that's okay. But again I do believe that there is most likely kind of a two step process that potentially in the UAE being granted and then moving on to the full approval. Having said that, can I turn to Merdad or Diana, so Merdad, okay on the first question. Merdad Parsey : Yes, I was actually going to see if Diana wanted to answer that question\u2026 Daniel O'Day: Okay, yes, that\u2019s great. Diana, thank you. Diana Brainard : So, in terms of endpoints, the NIAID study looks at time to clinical recovery, use 7 point retinal scale, and the ordinal scale is really tracking throughout most of the major clinical trials right now. But as our understanding of the disease has evolved the types of endpoints using that scale has evolved. And so, NIAID changed to time to clinical recovery, which basically means no longer requiring medical care within the hospital, getting off of oxygen or live discharge. In our moderate study, we're looking -- we're using the ordinal scale as well, but we're looking at the day 11 distribution along that ordinal scale. So, similar to what we did in our severe study, but looking at day 11 instead of day 14, recognizing that we're looking at a population that's less sick. So the modern study is looking at patients who are hospitalized, but they're not hypoxic, they're not requiring oxygen. The NIAID study enroll patients from starting their but all way through mechanical ventilation. So, slightly different end points for slightly different patient populations and most importantly, really looking at different questions. We're looking at treatment duration, they're looking at primary safety and efficacy with the placebo control. Phil Nadeau : That's helpful. Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Thanks a lot, Phil. So with that, I think we'll turn the call over to Doug to close. But, let me just say, thank you very much to all of you. And we really appreciate your trust and confidence in Gilead, and we'll continue to do our best throughout what we do for patients and certainly for COVID-19. So with that, Doug, do you want to have a last word? Doug Maffei : Thank you, Dan. And thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead. And the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on our future progress. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Mr. Douglas Maffei, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Douglas Maffei : Thank you, Liz. And good afternoon everyone. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the first half and second quarter 2020. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website. The speakers on today's call will be : Daniel O'Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Johanna Mercier, Chief Commercial Officer; Merdad Parsey, Chief Medical Officer; and Andrew Dickinson, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for Q&A will be Christi Shaw, Chief Executive Officer of Kite; and Diana Brainard, SVP and Head of our Virology Therapeutic Area. Before we begin with our prepared comments, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements including risks and uncertainties related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gilead's business, financial condition and results of operations, plans and expectations with regards to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, financial projections and the use of capital and 2020 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website. I will now turn the call over to Dan. Daniel O'Day: Thank you, Doug, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking our Gillian employees worldwide, who along with our partners, continue to go above and beyond to meet our many responsibilities at this time. Those responsibilities include advancing remdesivir, supporting work across our other medicines that are helping patients today and building our pipeline of future therapies. We'll cover each of those during today's call. I'm pleased to have the team with me here to provide an overview, and we all look forward to answering your questions. I\u2019ll start things off with some of my perspectives. The first thing I want to comment on is the continued strength and durability of our core HIV business. We've grown market share even as we navigated the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we're already seeing early signs of recovery from that impact in some markets. We are confident in our long-term leadership in HIV. People living with HIV depend on innovative therapies that meet their needs and Gilead is and has always been focused on meeting those needs. Like TAVI has become the gold standard in HIV treatment and we're on track with our conversion to discovery for priory treatment. The principles that have driven our HR&D growth to date still apply and will continue to drive our growth in the future. The second area I want to comment on is our role in fighting the pandemic with remdesivir. There's a growing body of clinical and real world data that continues to shape our understanding of the medicine. The data tell a consistent story of clinical benefit for patients suffering from COVID-19 across our SIMPLE studies, the NIAID data, compassionate use data, and more recently the comparative analysis that use real world data. I'd also like to highlight some details in our efforts to ensure a broad access to remdesivir in the second half of the year and beyond. As we discussed last time, we feel the full weight of our responsibilities with remdesivir and that applies to the price we set following the donation period. We price remdesivir well below the value it provides to enable access at this critical time and ensure that we continue to meet our responsibilities in the future, with further investment in remdesivir and in research that will help us to prepare for any future pandemics. The extensive clinical development work continues on remdesivir so that we can potentially extend the treatment to many more patient groups. We have begun clinical work on an inhaled solution that could be used outside of the hospital. And we'll also conduct clinical trials using the intravenous formulation in the outpatient setting, such as nursing homes. Merdad will talk more about the development program later.  As you know, we've agreed to the U.S. Government requests, following discussions about the significant rise of COVID-19 infections in the United States, the U.S. patients will receive 500 million treatment courses of our supply until the end of September, when we expect to have enough remdesivir to meet real time global demand. As announced yesterday, we are pleased to reach an agreement with the European Commission where they will centrally purchase remdesivir for patients in the European Union and the UK. European Commission will be responsible for all decisions regarding allocation among member states. The remaining supply of remdesivir will be allocated to other countries with significant rates of COVID-19 infection. We will see a significant increase in supplies in October as expected. The third theme I want to touch on is the progress we're making and shaping Gilead's growth story. You may recall that we previously shared a framework outlining the three pillars that will shape Gilead's next chapter. And you'll see these in the slides on our website today as well. I've already touched on the first pillar, which is our durable core business. And Johanna will describe our achievements on this front in more detail in a moment. Pillar two is our pipeline. And we made important progress across several potentially transformational assets in a relatively short period of time with a balance of both internal innovation and acquired investigational compounds. Pillar three is our strategy to drive future growth by accessing the highest quality external innovation in order to serve more patients. The pace of our corporate development activities has not slowed down a bit during this pandemic time. I'd like to highlight the progress we made this year on executing on our immuno-oncology strategy. Our goal is to grow or immuno-oncology pipeline and our expertise both through external opportunities and by advancing our internal efforts. The range of immuno-oncology deals we've announced this year represents significant progress towards this goal. These deals bring complimentary scientific approaches and provide access to clinical and preclinical assets with a view to both mid and long-term growth. Before I hand over to the team for the detailed comments in our progress, I want to briefly mention something that we see as another key area of responsibility for the company, the work against racial injustice. We are passionately committed to using Gilead's platform for what we see as a global issue that calls on everyone to play a role. The leadership team and I have spent the past week listening carefully to black employees as they've started to share with us how they, their families and their communities experience racial injustice in various forums. Gilead is committed to both immediate and long-term action that will have a lasting impact for our employees and the communities that we serve. Let me now hand the call off to Johanna, who will walk us through some of the key details related to our business performance. Over to you Johanna. Johanna Mercier : Thanks, Dan. And good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by saying that despite the anticipated impact of the pandemic, our business is solid and remains resilient. While COVID-19 has had an impact on parts of our business, this past quarter, we're built to withstand this kind of challenge, we remain confident in the strength of our core business. No one can actually predict the progression of this pandemic, but we do see signs of recovery and partial return to normal in Europe, as well as some parts of Asia. And we're confident that this will also play out in the U.S. once the incident stabilizes. Turning out to the specifics of Q2 in the first half for business performance, starting with HIV. Our HIV franchise is strong and durable. In both treatment and prevention we have a patient focused history of innovation and believe both will continue to be important drivers for the company over the next decade. In June, we hit our stated year-end goal this conversion to TAF-based regimens on the treatment side and are now at 90% of our total portfolio. Biktarvy uptake continues to remain strong across geographies and is the number one HIV treatment regimen across the U.S., EU5 and other key global markets in those na\u00efve and switch. For PrEP, we achieved our goal of 40% to 45% Descovy conversion with 43% at the end of June. We continue to believe that physicians and patients are benefiting from choice and are increasingly seeing Biktarvy for treatment and Descovy for PrEP as the preferred option for their patients. The quarter overall was down year-on-year, 1% and quarter-over-quarter by 3%. The impact on our HIV revenue, including Biktarvy was primarily driven by inventory dynamics. In Q2, we saw a reversal of the pandemic related stocking that happened in March during the onset of COVID across U.S. and Europe. Also on the treatment side as expected, we're seeing reduced switches due to the decline in patient visits and physicians not wanting to initiate new therapies during the pandemic. We're also seeing unfavorable shift in payer mix from commercial to government segments. Despite this, our overall demand remained robust with both the overall Gilead\u2019s portfolio and Biktarvy gaining share quarter-over-quarter and year-on-year. The pandemic impacted PrEP demand as expected, and we saw reduced initiations and therapy discontinuations due to fewer people seeing their health care providers and social dynamics. We're starting to see gradual recovery across our markets, including in the U.S., where we saw improving PrEP churns in June. Sound Biktarvy uptake and Descovy for PrEP conversion during the quarter underscores the confidence we have in our core HIV business, as we expect to recover from the pandemic over the remainder of the year and going into 2021. If we look at our HIV business comparing the first half of revenues this year versus 2019, we see the robust underlying business with 6% growth. The half year view normalizes the inventory dynamic associated with the pandemic. So now, if we turn into HBV, our HBV business, which is more like an acute business was down 47% from Q2 in 2019 and down 39% from Q1 this year. As we discussed during the Q1 call reduced or delayed physician visits naturally decrease both diagnosis and patient starts. U.S. HBV starts for down 42% quarter-over-quarter. However, overall US HBV share has held strong at about 60% across segments, which is up 11 points from Q2 to 2019. Similarly, we are seeing strong and consistent share in Europe as well. As other markets start to reopen, similar to what we saw in June and July across Europe, it's likely we will see many patients return throughout the rest of the year and into 2021. As an example of this in Italy, which was heavily impacted by COVID earlier this year, we saw recovery in June as more patients, especially the higher risk patients, started to return to their physicians and begin treatment. Before I close, just let me highlight for you a range of commercial opportunities on the horizon that make us also excited to be part of the Gilead team. In the near term we're pleased with the significant volume growth we're seeing in China, despite the impact of COVID as we received foreign RDL approvals at the end of 2019. This also served as a basis for expanding HBV business, which we expect to hit one billion globally, by the end of 2022. We're preparing to launch filgotinib in RA in the coming months and are excited about the recent CHMP positive opinion. As we look to the mid-to-long-term, we're accelerating our efforts to build our portfolio and expertise in immuno-oncology. We see strong potential for magrolimab, where we recently highlighted key data at ASCO. Magrolimab could be a very important therapy for MDS patients. And lastly, on HIV and lenacapavir, we believe that long-acting will play a role in the future HIV market and see the potential for this compound to best meet patient needs. Merdad will share more on the clinical progress on lenacapavir in a moment. So let me end where I started. Our core business is durable, the fundamental demand drivers of our HIV treatment and prevention businesses remain real, and we're optimistic heading into the second half of the year. We have an incredible core portfolio driven by HIV, and we're building a compelling set of opportunities as we continue on our journey. And lastly, I just want to thank all 12,000 of our colleagues who have demonstrated that they can continue to deliver for patients who need our medicines, both in our base business and more recently with remdesivir. It's the first time in my career, I've seen a company go from an investigational compound to a launch product serving hundreds of thousands of patients in a matter of months, but it just reinforces for me, Gilead history and commitment to patient focused innovation. I'm very proud to be part of this team. Merdad, turned it over to you. Merdad Parsey : Thanks, Johanna, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm excited to be here and share with you some of the perspectives on our pipeline that continues to both progress and to grow despite these challenging times. As you've seen, our pipeline expansion continued during this period driven by the strategy that Dan referenced earlier. Of course remdesivir is an important part of this story and while managing the added responsibility of working as diligently as possible on remdesivir, we're also able to make great strides across the rest of the pipeline. Let me share some of those highlights with you. We look at a pipeline for three key things. We'd like to see that the level of diversification across the different therapeutic areas is good. The balance across the phases of development and the quality of the assets we have in development along with our associated risk. That's where I'd like to turn now. We continue to build in each of our therapeutic areas as reflected in other exciting set of clinical data readouts and presentations at scientific meetings during this quarter. This includes data that further validate our belief in some of our key assets including the magrolimab, lenacapavir and of course remdesivir. Let me share a few specific highlights in each of our strategic areas. In HIV, we continue to make progress on the next chapter of our commitment to people living with HIV by working on a long acting option. Lenacapavir, our investigational capsid inhibitor continues to show promise as a potential agent, both for long acting treatment and for prevention. The Phase II, III study that has continued to enroll during the pandemic, and we look forward to data from this trial for highly treatment-experienced people with HIV, who often have few, if any other options. People living with HIV tell us that the most desirable long-acting regimens are either a weekly oral or in every three to six months subcutaneous injection, preferably that can be self administered. The profile lenacapavir gives it the potential to achieve both of these options, and for the potential to be a key therapeutic component for both treatment and prevention. Now turning to remdesivir. A lot of the data have been generated over the past six months that all inform us about the profile of remdesivir. As Dan pointed out, the thing that stands out as a consistency across these data, and I like to take a step back and highlight a few key pieces of the story. One piece is that we see the recovery time for patients in the hospital is short. Another is at the five-day course of treatment is appropriate for those patients. And finally the drug can be [indiscernible]. We've now published data that demonstrate a benefit and mortality compared with standard of care using a comparative analysis of real world data. As you know, there was a trend towards benefit and mortality at day 14 and ID study. And we now wait the final day 28 data from that trial as well. We also continue to pursue other ways to expand the utility of remdesivir, including new formulations and exploring how combinations could be more effective. We'll begin our Phase I study on an inhaled version of remdesivir that uses commercially available nebulizers. Beyond that, we're working on the feasibility of a dry powder formulation for inhalation and a subcutaneous formulation. We're also supporting several clinical trials exploring potential combinations. In each of those studies, remdesivir is being used as a back-bone standard of care agent. We are really proud of the role, remdesivir has played in this pandemic and I couldn\u2019t be prouder the team worked so hard. As you remainder, Diana Brainard, who leads our virology team is here with us today, and she will be happy to share additional insights during the Q&A. Moving on to filgotinib. We continue to believe that this selective JAK inhibitor has a potential to provide a new option for patients suffering from a variety of inflammatory diseases. I'd like to update you on recent discussions with regulators on rheumatoid arthritis. In Europe, we're pleased to receive the positive CHMP opinion for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. The opinion includes both 100 and 200 milligram doses and indicates use is appropriate as monotherapy and in combination with methotrexate. As a reminder, anticipates a scientific recommendation to the European Commission to grant marketing authorization in Europe. We continue to have ongoing dialogue with the FDA. We've been informed that there will be an Advisory Committee meeting and the PDUFA date remains unchanged. Moving on to oncology. We made strides during the quarter, and throughout the first half of the year in advancing our pipeline and accelerating our efforts to build our portfolio and expertise in immuno-oncology with several key transactions. First, we completed the acquisition of Forty Seven that we announced during the first quarter. This brings filgotinib into a core pipeline investing compound currently being developed for [indiscernible] as well as much of the impressive 17 will now complement our internal team. We're also very excited about the Arcus partnership, which provides our ability to have tail tractions that work both for us and our partners. This partnership brings us a potentially differentiated major compound as well as investigational high PD-1 monoclonal antibody. We're also excited to work with the excellent experienced clinical team at Arcus for the development of these programs. This partnership gives the caution on everything in their pipeline and allows the Arcus team to continue to pursue groundbreaking signs. Tizona and Pionyr are deals that give us options targeting other immuno-oncology approaches. And in each of these transactions, we have the option to acquire the entire company based on clinical data. These new programs build on our existing partnerships and our internal pipeline. In cell therapy, we all congratulate Christi Shaw, our colleagues at Kite for the recent approval of Yescarta for relapsed/refractory MCL. Kite and Gilead are now the first company have multiple approved cell therapy products that will bring benefit to even more patients with difficult-to-treat cancers. The Kite team also reached a major milestone with the successful approval and launch in June of the NCCN manufacturing site with the end-to-end production that expands the ability to treat more patients. Christi is with us here today and happy to share more thoughts during the Q&A. Materials we've provided. We've shared a summary of important upcoming milestones across the pipeline. In closing, our senior R&D team continues to build with the addition of leaders in data science, clinical biomarkers, pharmacology, clinical operations, portfolio management, inflammation and oncology. All of these leaders bring added expertise to an already world-class team, and we're excited to have them join us. Let me turn the call now over to Andy. Andrew Dickinson : Thanks, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to cover three topics to round out our commentary before turning to Q&A. First, I'll provide a summary of our financial highlights for the quarter and the first half of 2020. Second, I will provide some additional color on the potential implications of COVID on the second half of 2020 based on updated assumptions drawn from external experts and outside thinking. Finally, I'd like to pull all this together and review our revised 2020 financial guidance. As a reminder, the earnings materials posted on our website contain additional information, including the details of our 2020 revised financial guidance. Turning now to our financial highlights. Total revenues for the second quarter were $5.1 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.11. As noted in the earnings press release on a GAAP basis, we recorded a diluted loss per share of $2.66, primarily due to a $4.5 billion in-process research and development charge related to our acquisition of Forty Seven. This compares to revenue of $5.7 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.72 for the same period last year. Product sales for the second quarter were $5.1 billion, down 7% sequentially and down 10% year-over-year. As anticipated, the second quarter product revenues were unfavorably impacted by COVID-19. The year-over-year quarterly decline was also impacted by approximately $160 million of favorable adjustments recorded in the second quarter of 2019 for statutory rebates, primarily to HCV and HIV prior year sales in Europe. This decline was partially offset by HIV growth driven by Biktarvy in the United States. As Johanna mentioned, the quarter-over-quarter decreases in HIV revenues was primarily driven by the reversal of the Q1 increased buying patterns due to the pandemic as well as lower U.S. PrEP demand and unfavorable U.S. payer mix. Sequentially, the decrease was partially offset by treatment growth and seasonable higher net price in the U.S. and inventory patterns. The decrease in HCV revenues sequentially and year-over-year primarily reflects lower volume due to lower diagnoses and patient starts due to the pandemic. Yescarta revenues grew sequentially and year-over-year, primarily driven by the continued patient uptake in Europe. Overall product sales for the first half of the year were $10.5 billion compared to our $10.8 billion for 2019. Excluding recent LOE products for Ranexa and Letairis, our business grew year-over-year despite the impact of the pandemic. If we compare the first half of 2020 versus the same time period in 2019, we the HIV inventory dynamics associated with COVID-19 are normalized and our first half results demonstrate strong underlying HIV demand growth, with the business up 6% over 2019. This reflects a strong and encouraging start to the year in our core HIV franchise despite the impact of COVID-19. You can find more information, including the geographic breakdown of revenues in the materials we have posted. Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $1.2 billion for the quarter, up 19% compared to the same period last year and up 18% sequentially, primarily due to our investment in remdesivir, including clinical trials and manufacturing scale-up costs. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $1.2 billion, up 6% compared to the same period last year and up 8% sequentially, primarily due to a $97 million accrual related to a previously disclosed Department of Justice investigation. From a liquidity standpoint, we continue to be very well positioned. During the quarter, we generated $2.6 billion in cash from operations, and we ended the quarter with $21.2 billion in cash and marketable debt securities. We completed our acquisition of Forty Seven this quarter for $4.7 billion, net of cash acquired, we paid cash dividends of $856 million, and we repurchased 700,000 shares of stock for $54 million. Our strong balance sheet investment portfolio are built to withstand macroeconomic events like COVID-19, and our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to focus on investment to augment internal and external innovation in support of continued pipeline expansion. In addition, we intend to support and grow our dividend over time, provided that any dividend increase is, of course, subject to approval from our Board. Finally, as it relates to repurchase of shares in 2020, we're on track relative to the directional guidance we provided in our fourth quarter 2019 and year-end earnings call in February. Turning now to the COVID-19 impact on our revised guidance. Importantly, as you heard earlier in the call, the fundamentals and durability of our long-term outlook remains very strong. We expect that our core business will gradually recover starting in Q3, following peak pandemic impact on underlying treatment initiations and switch dynamics that we observed in the second quarter. We continue to expect minimal impact on our HIV treatment business over time with maintenance of high market share. In HCV, we expect patient starts to regain momentum in the third quarter and beyond. In addition, since our first quarter earnings call, we have established global pricing for remdesivir, and we have refined our expectation for remdesivir for the year. As you would expect, there are still many uncertainties concerning the shape and duration of the recovery in the second half of the year as well as the availability and uptake of remdesivir. With that as context, let me summarize the details of our revised full year guidance. Our revised top line revenue range, including expected sales of remdesivir in 2020 is US$23 billion to US$25 billion. We're increasing our 2020 R&D and SG&A expense expectations. Our guidance on expected product gross margin and effective tax rate for 2020 remained unchanged. Our updated operating income range is $10.7 billion to $13 billion. And finally, our updated non-GAAP EPS range is $6.25 to $7.65. I'd like to highlight a few additional points that will give you more color on the assumptions that drove this updated guidance. On the expense side, R&D and SG&A guidance increase to reflect expected expenses for remdesivir, Forty Seven and the litigation accrual that I mentioned earlier. On remdesivir, as we've previously stated, we expect to manufacture 2 million or more treatment courses cumulatively in 2020. Our revenue guidance reflects that we expect to sell 1 million to 1.5 million treatment courses of remdesivir this year. We expect that remdesivir demand will be skewed towards the U.S. in the third quarter and that the proportion of ex-U.S. sales will increase in the fourth quarter and beyond. That said, the progression of the pandemic, the global economic backdrop our supply expectations, the potential uptake of remdesivir in related matters continue to be dynamic and uncertain. We expect to learn more over the coming months, and we'll update you on our latest thinking on our Q3 earnings call. Before I hand the call off for Q&A, I'd like to express my gratitude as well to our 12,000 Gilead employees globally. Without their spirit, dedication and resilience, nothing we strive to achieve for patients would be possible. Now I'd like to open the call for questions. Liz? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tyler Van Buren with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Tyler Van Buren : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess with respect to the HCV and HIV share increases that you saw during the pandemic, you talked about coming out of the pandemic stronger. So could you just provide a little bit more color on that? Daniel O'Day: Sure, Tyler. I\u2019ll turn right away to Johanna. Johanna Mercier : Okay. Thanks, Tyler. Yes. So for example, in HIV, when you think about Biktarvy and Descovy, which is our two lead brands both for treatment and prevention, Biktarvy grew share. So it's been growing here year-on-year but even quarter-over-quarter. So we grew share to 33% in Q2 for Biktarvy. And then when you think about on a very large basis, you can appreciate, so that's about a 1% share increase. And then when you think about Descovy, we were \u2013 we closed the quarter Q1 at about 37% and in the PrEP market and we ended up at the end of June at 43%. So I do think that despite some of the dynamics because of COVID-19 and some of the decrease in patient visits and screening, I still do think that that the brands are solid because of their portfolio, because of what they offer for patients. And one of the things, both of those brands are actually brands that in COVID-19 environment are actually probably the best choice for patients because if you think about Biktarvy and you think about no monitoring, no HLA testing, et cetera, those are really the rapid start with Biktarvy is critical for patients. And I think that, that's also helping to support Biktarvy throughout this transition with the pandemic. Tyler Van Buren : And just as a quick follow-up. With respect to the Biktarvy share gains, are those share gains or switches? Are they different during the pandemic as they were prior to the pandemic? Are they coming from \u2013 is the regimens that they're taking share change at all? Johanna Mercier : Yes, the sourcing of business is actually about the same. The only difference I would say is our \u2013 the switch in treatment is obviously a little bit slower than what we've seen in the past just because physicians don't want to switch there's actually guidelines that suggest no switching during the pandemic from drug to drug. So it's more the naive patient population that's feeding Biktarvy right now versus the switch population and older compounds are keeping share. So since Gilead has about 75% within HIV, basically what you are seeing is some of our older brands are keeping higher share versus then switching over to newer compounds like Biktarvy. Tyler Van Buren : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Tyler. Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from comes from Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink. Your line is now open. Geoffrey Porges : Thank you very much. So, maybe a couple of questions on remdesivir. Andy, you indicated, I think you're going to sell 1 million to 1.5 million courses, but it sounds as though you're supplying 0.5 million courses just in Q3. So could you give us a sense of what your upside capacity is given the capacity initiatives that you have in place for the year? And secondly, how you see the demand beyond those 500,000 courses in Q3 are you on an allocated basis already in Q4? Or is there some uncertainty about the demand? And then could you just give us a sense of how you've incorporated that into your guidance? There must be there's a huge range in your operating income. So I presume that's being driven by remdesivir. But could you kind of give us more color on that? Andrew Dickinson : Yes. Maybe I\u2019ll start with one final point and ask Johanna. Oh, go ahead, Dan. I'm sorry. Daniel O'Day: Perfect. No, that\u2019s great. Thank you. Andrew Dickinson : Maybe I\u2019ll ask Johanna to comment on the upside of the supply and the demand in Q3 and Q4. The \u2013 there is a wide range, and it is driven by our remdesivir expectations. So Johanna mentioned we're learning more week by week. We just started commercializing recently. So we do expect that we'll be able to narrow our thinking and give you an update on the \u2013 in the third quarter, Geoff, as you would expect. Johanna, do you want to touch base on the supply and demand issue? Johanna Mercier : Sure. Yes. Sure. So maybe just add to what Andy was saying for Q4 specifically. I think the uncertainties are multiple, and it's not just our supply actually is less of an uncertainty because I think we have a pretty good idea, and the ramp-up has been impressive. The team has done incredible job ramping up, and you really see that ramp up through in Q4. We feel that \u2013 and I think Dan mentioned this \u2013 we feel that by early October, we should be in a place, assuming somewhat, I don't know if stable is the right word, but some stability within this pandemic globally across the numbers, we should be in a situation where global supply meets global demand, and that's a great place to be in. We can't wait because it's been challenging thus far. The \u2013 in Q4, the uncertainties are more around the pandemic itself and not really understanding does it stabilize, does it come to an all-time low, like we've seen in Europe? We really don't know. And so that's why it's a little bit tougher to manage on that front. As mentioned before from a supply standpoint by the end of December of this year, we should be in a position to have cumulatively of over 2 million treatment courses. And some of those, obviously were used during the donation and some are being used in Q3. So the balance of that will be in play for Q4, and we're just working with all the different governments, not just the U.S. but governments around the world to better understand what they think their real-time need is, and that's really our focus right now is the real-time need. Geoffrey Porges : Okay. Thanks very much. Daniel O'Day: Geoff, and we'll update you and everybody else in quarter three, obviously. So this is our best estimate at this stage. Geoffrey Porges : Okay. Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Michael Yee : Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. Following up on remdesivir, two questions. One is maybe you can make a comment about thinking about the actual demand and sales that you've actually done versus actually utilization. We've done some math around actual utilization, and it sounds like a lot of this could actually be a former stockpiling. So maybe you could just comment on that type of dynamic. That would help us think about future use? And then the second is just looking forward even a little bit, you've made some comments about injectable and inhaled. Is this just a PK question? What do you have to look for in Phase I data? And what are the challenges? And would you have this data and know this by, say, fourth quarter? Thanks. Daniel O'Day: Sure. I\u2019ll start, and then Johanna, you add and then we'll go to Merdad the injectable. So first of all, Michael, I think really, the vast majority of the remdesivir that we have today is being used. The allocation process with the U.S. government has gotten better over time, and they really are allocating basically at least twice a month, sometimes more frequently to where the hotspots are in the United States, and that's the vast majority of the supply. So we think there's probably very little demand that is not being utilized at this stage. Of course, it's not completely efficient, and there are some pockets where you might have some hospitals that have more remdesivir than patients. But right now, given the tremendous human need in the United States, in particular, and a variety of other countries we're working with, we're really just working on the real-time demand right now. So that's being utilized. Johanna, do you have anything else you want to add to that. Johanna Mercier : Yes. Maybe, Dan, just to add to that, Michael, I would just add the fact that it's also based on incidents in epidemiology. Everything we are doing, working with the U.S. government, working with ex-U.S. governments as well, governments around the world, it's really based on the incidents. And what we've seen so far is that because of the way we're managing it with the HHS, a lot \u2013 some hospitals have actually said, \"no, thank you. Give it to somebody who needs it. We don't need it right now.\" So I do think that people are coming together to work through this, understanding that there is a shortage of supply and understanding that it really needs to go to patients in need, and the worst thing that could ever happen is products sitting idle somewhere. So we're being very, very careful to make sure that doesn't happen anywhere in the world. Daniel O'Day: I think the earliest is October, Michael, that we would start to see actual demand and utilization perhaps be different and perhaps the opportunity for stockpiling, but not before October. Merdad, over to you on Michael\u2019s question. Merdad Parsey : Yes. Yes. So what I'd say is, as I mentioned, we're working on both being inhaled in the subcu. The inhaled ahead and, as I mentioned, in Phase I right now in the dose escalation phase. Our \u2013 the hypothesis here is that the virus in many patients, especially early is primarily in the one. And so the question is for a patient, can we treat an outpatient with an inhaled or [indiscernible] or potentially even an inpatient. With inhaled version get where it needs to be a narrowing in the lung and whether that would have a benefit for those patients. So that's the extent we're going to be running with the inhaled version. As far as subcutaneous, we'll continue to work on that. That currently is not in the clinic. And as I mentioned, we're looking at feasibility and other parameters of bringing that online. Michael Yee : Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Michael. Good, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Terence Flynn : Hi, thanks for taking the question and thank you for all the work on the COVID front. I was wondering, first, just on the financials, if you could try to quantify the impact from COVID on a dollar basis that you saw in the quarter? And then I was wondering, as you think about capsid, obviously, important long-term opportunity for you guys. Just conceptually, are you focused on finding a partner for that internally to continue to dominate the market in terms of share? Or are you open to looking for an external partner? And as a result, splitting the economics on the future market? Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Great. So why don\u2019t Andy you take the financials, and we'll have Diana take the capsid question. Andrew Dickinson : Yes. Thanks, Dan. And hi, Terence. Thanks for the question. As you know, we don't provide specific \u2013 we didn't provide a specific guidance in terms of the COVID impact. I would say, at a high level, it impacted our business exactly in the way that we expected, so it hit predominantly. As you heard from Johanna in the HCV treatment and HIV PrEP business, the impact was substantially less than $0.5 billion on our top-line revenue in the first half. So rather than thinking about it on a quarterly basis, Terence, I think it's easier to think about it on the first half basis as you've heard from other companies as well, given the pull forward of inventory at the end of the first quarter. Hopefully, that's helpful. Diana Brainard : Great. And I can speak to our capsid inhibitor and our vision of our long-acting HIV franchise. And there, what I would say is we're looking at our past success, and it's really been driven by focusing on trying to meet the needs of patients and doing that agnostic to where we come up with the compounds of the regimen. And so in the past, that's been through acquisitions. It's been through partnerships, and it's, of course, been through internal discovery. And we really do have unparalleled excellence in terms of our internal discovery, and we're doing a lot of work there to try to find a partner for capsid. So we are also open and always looking externally as well with the idea that we will be successful if we create the best regimen for patients. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Terence for the question. Okay, can we go to the next one please. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Market. Your line is now open. Brian Abrahams : Hi, there. Thanks very much for taking my question. Question on filgotinib. With the PDUFA upcoming and the current state of the pandemic, I'm curious, your latest thoughts on launch approach and potential for differentiation through the label or otherwise, how that shapes your commercial strategy. And then I'm also wondering if there's any reason that why the CHMP recommendations on dosing and indication. Wouldn't necessarily be illustrative of global positioning for the product? Do you think FDA and EMA are still looking at the JAK benefit risk profiles differently? Thanks. Johanna Mercier : Thanks. Maybe I can start... Daniel O'Day: Yes. Go ahead Johanna, why don\u2019t you start and Merdad wants\u2019 to add anything as well. But go ahead, please. Johanna Mercier : Okay. Thanks for the question. So yes, so obviously, pleased with the recent positive CHMP opinion, and we are working \u2013 we've been working diligently with the teams around the world to prepare for launch with filgotinib. We are looking at the COVID situation. And in assessing the situation, to be honest with you, maybe a couple of months back, we were thinking virtual, not virtual. But I think in light of kind of what \u2013 where we're seeing the dynamics of the market, I think virtual is the way to go. And so we're looking at how we do this and the best approach. So more to come on that front, a lot of work going on to make sure that we do this as competitively as possible. From a differentiation standpoint, it's in line with what we've talked about before. We believe in the profile of filgotinib and the differentiation that it offers. And so therefore that that's really an opportunity medically to make sure that to our medical teams, that conversation, that education happens with physicians. Merdad, do you want to comment on the regulatory piece? Daniel O'Day: I think Merdad is having a bit of an audio issue, so I'll feed in here Brian. I think it's kind of premature to anticipate exactly what's going to happen in different regulatory authorities around the world. We continue to have discussions with all regulatory authorities, obviously Europe was the first one out of the gate. We're pleased with that. And as soon as we have some additional information, we'll let you know, but difficult to speculate. Thanks. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open. Alethia Young : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. And congrats on everything that you guys have been doing here, it's incredible. I guess I just wanted you to kind of maybe talk big picture about like, of course, there's some remdesivir, which could have some earlier kind of utility beyond in the treatment cycle, but just where we are with that things as well and kind of how you think about the positioning of remdesivir, maybe perhaps over the next couple of years? Even though I know I'm asking to look at a crystal ball. Thank you. Daniel O'Day: You're a great cheerleader for us. Thank you very much Alethia. So yes obviously, I think, our general position on this is that you will always need effective therapeutics and effective vaccines to control any type of a viral outbreak of any type and certainly one in a pandemic. So I think we're firmly committed to working to expand remdesivir's impact. We\u2019re really pleased at every piece of data in our hands or in other people's hands has been consistent, consistent about the effect in terms of reduction in hospital space, consistent around the ability to use it earlier in hospitals space and get even bigger impacts. And I think that will continue regardless of vaccination. Now our hope obviously is like you have the normal influenza that with an effective vaccine appropriately administered to as many patients as will take a vaccine around the globe that you could reduce the number of patients that ever have to enter the hospital. But, as we know, vaccines are never a hundred percent effective, they are never a hundred percent utilized, so there will always be patients that need therapeutics. And what we're excited about in terms of the potency of remdesivir is the ability to use it earlier on patients to get them out of the hospital faster. And also to make sure that the types of work we're doing now using remdesivir outside the hospital could prevent patients from ever having to go in. Of course that's all to be determined. So I think it will be hand in glove with vaccines. And obviously we're looking forward also to the work that's going on in terms of looking at antiviral, a potent antiviral that has been proven like remdesivir in patients to be used, perhaps in combination with other therapeutics to get an even stronger treatment effect. But that continues to be, I think, our view and we're hoping, and I'm really proud to be working in this industry at this stage because my colleagues around the industry, I know are doing everything possible, including the collaboration that they have with us in remdesivir to bring new therapeutics and vaccines to patients. And so we're excited about that. So thank you very much for the question. Operator : Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. And this is Matthew on for Cory. So just to go back to Biktarvy, are you able to quantify how much of the 2Q weakness was due to inventory pull through versus other factors that you mentioned? And should we expect these other factors such as a shift in payor mix and slow down in patients, which is to persist for the remainder of 2020? Daniel O'Day: Thanks. Over to you, Johanna. Thanks, Matthew. Johanna Mercier : Thanks Matthew for their questions. If I understood it, sorry you broke up a little bit, but if I understood it correctly, it was specific to the Biktarvy and the shift in what's driving it and it's really the inventory fluctuations, that's what's driving the shift from Q1 to Q2. And you can appreciate Q4 always a little bit higher, it plays out in Q1, it bleeds out in Q1, but then we saw the uptake because of COVID-19 in late March and we saw that bleed out in Q2. So it's really what's driving the Biktarvy piece. We have seen a payer mix shift in the last two quarters, where due to unemployment we're seeing a shift from commercial payers to government channels, specifically PHF and Medicaid, but at this point in time that's really not impacting or modestly impacting our business overall. So it's really inventory-driven. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Johanna Mercier : Hopefully I answered your question. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Johanna Mercier : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Geoff Meacham : Hey guys, thanks for the question. I had a strategic one for Dan or even Andy. Dan, when you took over the narrative for Gilead was a return to growth as hep C was stabilizing. And of course, I get the headwinds from COVID, but sustainable growth has still been evasive. So the question is, do you view remdesivir as new product that anchors your long-term growth, or do you feel like you need other assets, obviously recognize that filgo and Kite are also in growth mode, but you need other assets to help drive sustainable more long-term growth. Thank you very much. Daniel O'Day: Yes, sorry about that Geoff I was chatting the way there. Let me say, it's certainly the latter to your question, Jeff. And that is that as happy as we are, that we can have an impact on patients in the COVID crisis with remdesivir. We completely understand that hopefully by the way for the world, that we'll get to a stage where the pandemic is much more predictable and remdesivir is playing a role. But not what we're relying upon for our mid-to long-term growth in the company.  So we believe that rather the continued emphasis on our core business to make sure that we not only continue to lead with HIV today, but also tomorrow with the next generation of medicines combined with what we have in our internal pipeline. And then growing our overall immuno-oncology business, both Kite and outside of Kite. And I think that's what you see as we think about now outside of virology, moving into inflammation, moving more deeply into oncology, particularly outside of Kite. You are going to continue to see, I think, more of what you've seen in the first half of this year, which is an ability to both optimize our current portfolio in house and continue to do smart, targeted deals that allow us to bring transformational medicine innovation into our house at different stages of development. And obviously that goes along with different risk profiles, right? And that's, I think, where BD team under Andy's leadership has done a really good job of making sure we're doing fit-for-purpose transactions, where when we're going after first or best-in-class, there's risk associated with it. We're trying to be prudent about how much capital we deploy upfront particularly on the earlier stage assets and kind of pay for success over that period of time. And there are others where we've seen the late-stage data like Forty Seven where we feel quite confident and bullish about bringing that in and using the breadth and depth of Gilead to look at expense of life cycle management on a medicine like magrolimab that has a leading position in a competitive environment to allow us to think about multiple different indications in hematologic malignancies, and possibly also looking at solid tumors. So that type of a strategy is absolutely fundamental to grounding us and continuing to build on our mid-to long-term growth story. Andy, anything which you'd like to add from your side? Andrew Dickinson : I think you said it well, that captures it. Geoff Meacham : Thanks Dan. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Evan Seigerman : Thank you so much for taking the question. I actually have one for Christi. I know you haven't spoken much on the call and congrats on your very recent approval of Tecartus. Can you help us better understand kind of how you view the commercial's potential for this asset? And have you seen the reversal in trends around CAR-T used this month versus say June or May? And how should we think about the trajectory over the course of the year? Christi Shaw : Thanks for the question, making sure I'm wide awake and listening. We\u2019re so pleased about being the first company to be able to deliver for mantle cell lymphoma patients, Tecartus that has a curative intent. And so, although it's not a huge opportunity relative to DLBCL or some of our other studies that will be coming up like second line, it really is a differentiator for us in the marketplace to continue to demonstrate our leadership. Just like with Yescarta, our manufacturing footprint, we're gearing up. We have a ready to go in seven days, authorized sites \u2013 authorized for the new product within 30 days. So we're very hopeful that all of these patients that have nothing else to keep them alive, actually have something that can help them with such great efficacy. When we look at what happened in Q2, I'd say we were maybe pleasantly surprised that more patients were treated than we thought would be, based on COVID. And I will say that with what's happening now with the states in the U.S. we continue to see slowdown versus what we saw in the Q1 in terms of registrations. So I do think we're not going to see huge uplift in Q3, and we could be a flat and I don't know if we maybe lose some growth. But right now it's too early to tell. But I'm not as optimistic about Q3 and hopefully, when we come out of this situation we\u2019ll get better. And I'm really proud of the Kite team, because as you can imagine with all of the flights being canceled early on, and with having to figure out which ATC is to bring T cells back to where you didn't originate being able to hold T-cells where we haven't before, the team hasn't missed a beat and hasn't missed a delivery. So as I look at the whole of Kite and we look at the whole of the opportunity, it's really multiple indications in a very short period of time with mantle cell lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's, indolent Hodgkin's lymphoma by the end of this year being submitted. We have ALL being submitted and with priority review next year being approved. And we also have the big indication of second line DLBCL to be submitted next year. So as you look at that combination, I do think it gives us the best opportunity for growth and to potentially cure more patients of their cancer. Evan Seigerman : Thank you so much. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Evan, and we're looking forward to hearing more from Christi as that Kite business develops. More to hear from you. Thanks Evan. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Matthew Harrison : Great, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask a little bit more about filgotinib and MANTA. So it sounds like you've finished enrollment, I think, it's either about three months when you take the primary end point there. So I'm just wondering how the timing of getting the data from MANTA, which it sounds like it could come towards the end of this year versus the approval timeline for filgotinib. How those two work and your ability to get that data to the FDA or how that influences the application? Thanks. Daniel O'Day : Hey thanks Matt we'll turn it right over to Merdad. Merdad Parsey : Hi Matthew its Merdad. I hope everybody can hear me. Sorry I got disconnected earlier. So you are right in some regards Matthew, the patients are all enrolled. I don't \u2013 we don't anticipate that the three months is going to be the duration necessarily that will be sufficient for the regulators, in terms of looking at both onset and recovery. So while that first three months is a critical period, we think that's the blinded period, there's probably longer to be that's necessary. So we're looking at probably late in this year, early next year for us to have the data and then for us to submit it to the agency in the first half of next year. Those are the kinds of timelines we're looking at. Matthew Harrison : Okay. Thanks very much for your question. Merdad Parsey : That\u2019s it or do you have a question, thanks, Matthew. Matthew Harrison : Yes, no, that's it. Thanks Dan. Daniel O'Day: Thanks. Next please. Operator : Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Robyn Karnauskas : Hi guys. Thank you for taking the question. First one Dan, any thoughts on what you think about the executive orders being implemented and how you might run the business if they were to do so going forward, especially on business development? And for Christi, what would you like to augment your CAR-T portfolio? It\u2019s done a lot of deals in IO. What else do you think you might need to be competitive in the space with the biospecifics and other things moving forward? Thanks. Daniel O'Day: Yes, thanks Robyn. I mean, first of all, let me just take a big step back from the executive orders. I mean, I know that we all agree at Gilead that the current system in the U.S. needs to change. And we're leaning into that in a variety of different fronts have been now for a couple of years. What's really important is that when we look at changes in the U.S. system that is done in a way that ensures that patients are the one to benefit and at the same time that we maintain the U.S. innovation model. So, the types of things that we've been working with the different packages within the Congress and the Senate have all reflected that. And now, as we look at these executive orders, we'll be looking forward to engaging with the White House and with others to have the very principles that I just mentioned articulated and that's where we\u2019ll go. In terms of how that impacts, how we think about the future business, I would say that we have so many healthcare systems around the world, I think, that we're working with of course the U.S. is disproportionally important to us. But our belief firmly is that if you hold the bar high enough on transformational medicine, so in other words, if you really think hard about first-in-class and best-in-class and keep the bar high regard, because remember our cycle time is so long, our capital investment is in a decade that we can't be pivoting to one or the other particular governmental action. The bottom line is that we keep that bar high enough under any system under any scenario. I think we'll do first of all, well for patients and we'll do well for shareholders as a result of that. So that's my firm belief. Christi, over to you on Robyn\u2019s question please. Christi Shaw : Yes. Thanks Robin. So I think in the short term, we're looking at how do we cure those patients that aren't getting the effects of CAR T cell that we'd like. Yescarta is the only CAR-T that's been able to show the longest duration of over three years with almost 50% of patients being alive and how do we help the other 50% of the patients. So as you look at some of the portfolio that Gilead is building and being able to actually combine in the future other therapies, non-cell therapies with cell therapies would be one of our strategies to build on the strengths of both of the companies together. And then as we look at the mid to longer term, we've got three studies that are in solid tumor. Have INDs Phase 1s, and that would be our biggest long-term bets in terms of being able to really penetrate the solid tumor area. And there's specific areas that are kind of the low-hanging fruit, where the science is a little bit easier and others where it's very complex and the bar is just too high compared to standard of care. So those two areas in terms of launching success today, being able to get more efficacy and lead in hematological malignancies, and then moving to solid tumor. I will tell you, in addition though that we're not keeping our eyes closed, or head in the sand, as we look at possible disruptors with allogeneic iPSC technology, NK cells and that's what you see a lot of the business development deals that we did, some of them Kite alone with cell therapy, and some of them with Gilead where we can both partake in the potential positive outcomes that could come from that. So as we look at different ways off-the-shelf that were the first movers in that arena, both internally and as we look at some of our partners externally. Robyn Karnauskas : Thank you. Christi Shaw : Sure. Daniel O'Day: Thank you, Robyn. So I now that we\u2019re kind of at time, if there is one more question, we could take that in respect for everybody's time Liz. Operator : Our last question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Umer Raffat : Hi guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I have two if I may. First Merdad, curious what the feedback is from your team on the lung exposure of remdesivir with the IV form and how many fold higher can you get with the inhaled form at the highest dose? I'd be very curious. And secondly, I know there's this Phase 2 trial coming up in the multidrug resistant patients on HIV for your capsid inhibitor. My question is if that hits, why shouldn't it form the basis for an accelerated filing, given the unmet need in multidrug resistant patients? Thank you very much. Daniel O'Day: Umer terrific. Merdad I\u2019ll decide \u2013 you decide if you or Diana want to feed the numbers. That's great. Thanks. Merdad Parsey : Sure. Well, I'll do the lung exposure Diana, and you can talk about capsid. So we are targeting to get with inhaled version as good as it and hopefully greater exposure in the lung, than we did with the IV. We think we get obviously great exposure with the IV version and we think we can do at least that good if not better depending on how high you can go and what the lung deposition is. That's a very empiric thing we need to see how the trials go, but that's our goal. Diana, would you want to talk about the capsid? Diana Brainard : Yes, that would be great. So Umer in terms of that study in highly treatment experienced patients, it's actually a Phase 2/3 because of the urgent unmet need in that patient population, the agency granted us breakthrough designation, and they agreed that we could move directly from Phase 1b to a registrational trial in that population. And so this study that's ongoing right now, should the results pan out, will form the basis for an application for approval in the highly treatment experienced patients with lenacapavir dosed every six months. Umer Raffat : Thank you so much. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Douglas Maffei for closing remarks. Douglas Maffei : Thank you, Liz. And thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead. And the team here looked forward to providing you with updates on our future progress. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, as well as on the Gilead website. I will now turn the call over to Dan. Daniel O'Day: Thank you, Doug, and good afternoon, everyone. This has really been a pivotal quarter for Gilead. With last week\u2019s closing of the Immunomedics acquisition, we\u2019ve effectively transformed our near and long-term growth story. Trodelvy, an approved medicine for third-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer has tremendous potential for patients today and significant pan-tumor potential for the future. We're all excited to deliver on that potential along with the teams from Immunomedics who became a part of the Gilead family last week. I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone at Immunomedics for the extraordinary work that you've done on Trodelvy to-date. It's an honor to work with all of you now to build on those efforts to the benefit of patients with cancer around the world. The acquisition is undoubtedly an inflection point in terms of our growth and adds to the growing pipeline of transformational medicines that we've been strengthening over the course of the year. All of this is building on the strong foundation of our core business. We've seen the strength and durability of our HIV business once again in the past quarter, and we're confident in our long-term leadership. I'd like to briefly talk about the changing nature of our growth prospects, driven primarily by the acquisition of Immunomedics. I'll also touch on our core business and I'll share a few words about Veklury or remdesivir, which just gained FDA approval, and then Johanna and Merdad will pick up with more details. I'll start with Immunomedics and Trodelvy. The acquisition of Immunomedics is the largest transaction in Gilead's history and undoubtedly marked a turning point for the Company. As you know, Trodelvy is already approved in the U.S. for third-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. The recent data at ESMO underscored its transformative potential for this particularly challenging form of cancer, as well as the potential for treating bladder cancer. We will explore expansion into earlier lines of therapy in the short term, and overall we see Trodelvy as a pipeline and a product. The prevalence of Trop-2 in multiple cancer types means Trodelvy has pan-tumor potential. Secondly, in addition to its extensive potential as a monotherapy, Trodelvy stands out because of the way it lends itself to combinations. The early data are promising and we look forward to exploring combinations with various types of agents going forward. The acquisition gives us an immediate presence in the field of solid tumors and brings us a significant expertise of the teams from Immunomedics. We're complementing our existing strengths in hematologic cancers, through our combined Kite and Gilead pipelines, and building on the important progress we've already made this year in building our oncology pipeline. Including Immunomedics, we've completed a total of 10 transactions in oncology so far this year. I'll just mention two of the significant opportunities that are the results of those transactions. Magrolimab is now in Phase 3 for MDS [and offers a] [ph] potential first-in-class option utilizing the CD47 pathway to activate the innate immune system. Our partnership with Arcus is progressing well. We are particularly excited by the potential of the TIGIT compound, as well as other work that's coming out of that collaboration. In cell therapy, we're now the only company with two FDA approved therapies, Yescarta and Tecartus from Kite. Earlier this month, we received a positive opinion for KTE-X19 from the European Medicines Agency, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. I'm also pleased to announce that the FDA has accepted the Yescarta sBLA for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. The agency also granted priority review for this application. ZUMA-7, the industry's first ever randomized trial in cell therapy and the only cell therapy in second-line with overall survival as an endpoint will be delayed slightly due to the slowdown in the rates of events. However, we expect the data in the first half of 2021, and based upon that data, we're ready to submit quickly after. In summary, we made great progress in building out and advancing our pipelines to drive growth this year. And Trodelvy represents a true growth inflection point, changing our outlook significantly, and positioning Gilead as an important contributor in the field of oncology. The foundation for all this additional growth is our durable core business. In HIV, we saw a solid rebound in the third quarter with 14% quarterly sequential growth in the global franchise. While COVID-19 continued to impact our business, there were clear signs of recovery in the third quarter. Moreover, the underlying demand is strong as Biktarvy continues to be the treatment of choice for patients and providers. On the prevention side, we exceeded the goal we set at the beginning of the year of switching 40% to 45% of clinically appropriate at-risk individuals on PrEP to Descovy. As of October 1st, we were at 46%. Johanna will share more perspectives on our third quarter sales in a few moments. Finally, I'd like to briefly comment on remdesivir, what we now refer to by its brand name of Veklury. Veklury received full FDA approval this month for treating hospitalized patients of COVID-19. It\u2019s the only FDA approved therapy for COVID-19 in addition to being authorized or approved for use in more than 50 countries worldwide. We are also now in a position to meet global demand because of the work we've done since January to ramp up our supply. It's worth stepping back for just a moment to recognize how remarkable it is that we are in this position today. At the start of the year, most of the world had not even heard of COVID-19. The scientific community knew very little about the virus or its devastating potential. Today, less than 10 months later, we have an FDA approved therapy that is helping patients around the world to recover faster, and for some groups of patients Veklury is lowering the risk of death. All of this comes at a time when the rates of hospitalization sadly in many places are increasing. We have repeatedly seen the clinical benefits of Veklury across multiple clinical trials. In the past quarter, these benefits have been unequivocally demonstrated by the gold standard of global clinical trials. The definitive results from the fully powered double-blind placebo-controlled and randomized NIAID ACTT-1 trial showed an average reduction in recovery time of five days. I sometimes imagine how I would feel if a family member was hospitalized for COVID-19. And I'm sure many of you think of this as well. I'm extremely grateful that a therapy exists that has been validated with all of the rigor required for an FDA approval and whose benefits have been demonstrated in peer-reviewed data from a trial that is without question the pinnacle of clinical studies today. Merdad will talk about all the recent data on Veklury, including what we've seen from the WHO study and the ongoing development program, shortly. Johanna will talk about the recent move to a commercial distribution model in the U.S., which is going very well. I'd just like to close on Veklury by expressing my gratitude once again to all the Gilead employees who've put their hearts and souls into this work since January, along with our many partners. On behalf of all of us, I want to say how privileged we feel to play a role in helping with the pandemic and be able to put our antiviral expertise to work for patients with COVID-19. I also want to emphasize that we will continue to do all it takes to fulfill our responsibility with Veklury. To wrap up my prepared remarks, I want to emphasize that our portfolio and pipeline are much stronger going into the fourth quarter and 2021. By executing on our strategy in a disciplined way throughout the past 12 months, we have significantly changed the nature of our growth process, especially following the acquisition of Immunomedics, and we have maintained the long-term durability of our core HIV franchise. We're not done, of course, but we made significant progress. And for that, I want to thank all the teams at Gilead and Kite, and our many partners worldwide. With this, I'll hand the call now over to Johanna. Johanna Mercier : Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to begin by building on Dan's comments about our durable core business. Our results through Q3 amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have been strong. And as anticipated, we continue to see signs of recovery during the quarter in underlying demand trends across our core franchises in U.S. and Europe. Looking at our HIV business. We continue to make great progress in both treatment and prevention. Biktarvy in treatment and Descovy for prevention continue to gain share quarter-over-quarter. In treatment, Biktarvy remains the number one regimen across key global markets. In the U.S., one in two new patients start on Biktarvy and roughly one in two patients switching to Biktarvy do so from a non-Gilead single tablet regimen, growing overall Gilead share. In PrEP, despite COVID dynamics, we continue to make progress with Descovy with 46% conversion of clinically appropriate individuals at risk at the end of September, exceeding our stated goal of 40% to 45%. Our overall HIV revenue in Q3 was very strong with 14% sequential growth over Q2 and 8% year-over-year growth, driven by both, strong demand fundamentals and normalized inventory dynamics. The unique quarterly phasing of inventory dynamics this year and the recent Truvada loss of exclusivity will impact our sequential quarterly revenue dynamics in the fourth quarter. With 91% of Gilead's U.S. patients having converted to TAF-based regimens, we will continue to build on our strength in HIV, including long-acting formulations for both, treatment and prevention. Now, briefly on HCV. Our HCV business showed 4% sequential growth over Q2 while down 31% from Q3 last year due to lower patient starts year-on-year. As markets started to reopen in the U.S. and Europe, we saw an increase in diagnosis and patient starts in Q3. Our stock market share across core markets puts us in a position of strength as patients return through the rest of the year and into 2021. I'd like to now highlight some specifics on the initial commercialization of Veklury, which began in the third quarter. As our teams have begun reaching out to physicians and hospital systems, it has been incredibly inspiring to hear their stories of how they have used this medication and what it meant to patients as well as their loved ones. As a reminder, the commercial model in the third quarter was governed by an agreement with the U.S. government to allocate 90% of our supply to patients in the U.S. through a partnership with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. During the quarter, we recorded Veklury sales of $873 million. A portion of inventory that will be consumed in Q4 was recognized as revenue in the third quarter. As Dan mentioned, we have now pivoted beginning October 1st to a more traditional commercial model, working directly with AmerisourceBergen to provide Veklury directly to U.S. hospitals. AmerisourceBergen will remain our sole distributor of Veklury through the end of the year to ensure consistency and continuity. In Europe, we signed a joint procurement agreement with the European Commission on October 8th that enables participating countries in the EU, the European Economic Area and UK to purchase Veklury to meet both, real-time demand and stockpiling needs, coordinated by the European Commission. This agreement temporarily removes the need for country-by-country reimbursement processes that typically follow marketing authorization, recognizing the urgency of the current health crisis. It encompasses purchases of Veklury over the next six months and can be extended, if needed. Predicting the underlying demand of core Veklury continues to be challenging, given so many variables, including incidence rates, hospitalization rate as well as future vaccines and emerging treatments. Now, turning to Trodelvy. As you know, the Immunomedics deal closed less than a week ago, and we're already working closely with the joint team to ensure the continuity of Trodelvy's strong launch in third-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and accelerate its future potential. It is a true catalyst for growth, and the joint team is energized as we continue to accelerate the work on this transformational therapy together as one team. While not part of our third quarter results, I'd like to highlight Immunomedics Q3 results for Trodelvy in the U.S. Trodelvy achieved $53 million in net sales in Q3, the first full quarter of commercial availability. Total net sales were $73 million in the first five months of commercial launch in the midst of a pandemic. Over 1,000 accounts ordered Trodelvy in the first five months of commercial launch, and of those about 488 were new and unique in Q3. We've seen robust adoption continue in Q3 in both, community and academic centers. We look forward to expanding commercialization to Europe and other markets around the world as quickly as possible, starting with an EU submission in Q1 of next year. And to close, a few words on Jyseleca, which is the brand name for filgotinib. Jyseleca has now launched in Germany, and launch planning is well underway across Europe as well as Japan. We anticipate sales in both regions during the fourth quarter. Despite a crowded and competitive marketplace, the teams are well-prepared to differentiate Jyseleca. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the future. Merdad will provide a little bit more color on the ongoing regulatory considerations and our thinking there. And so, with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Merdad. Merdad Parsey : Thanks, Johanna, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to share some perspectives on several clinical pipeline-related updates and progress. Starting with Veklury. We're very pleased with the recent full approval of Veklury by the FDA. Veklury is now approved in the U.S. for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19-based disease on a strong and consistent body of evidence from three rigorous, randomized, controlled clinical trials over the past six months to inform us about the profile of Veklury. It's the first antiviral treatment proven to help patients hospitalized with COVID-19, recover and leave the hospital more quickly, a significant benefit for patients, their families and society. The results include the double-blind, placebo-controlled NIAID Phase 3 ACTT-1 trial, published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study met its primary endpoint of time to clinical recovery through day 29, demonstrating Veklury plus standard of care, reduced the time of recovery through day 29 compared with placebo plus standard of care from 15 to 10 days with a P-value of less than 0.001. The key secondary endpoint of clinical status at day 15 was also met. Patients receiving Veklury were 50% more likely to have it improved by day 15 compared with those receiving placebo, and the effect was maintained through day 29. The secondary mortality endpoint in the overall population only showed a trend towards reduced mortality with a P-value of 0.07. Recall that when we started these trials with the NIAID, we knew very little about the disease itself and didn't know which patients might be most likely to benefit from Veklury. Given the range of disease severity in the overall study population and the emerging understanding that clinical outcomes are highly dependent on a patient's requirement for oxygen at baseline, an exploratory post-hoc analysis was conducted to determine whether there were differences in mortality based on patients' baseline clinical status with respect to the requirement for oxygen support. In this post-hoc analysis, in patients requiring low flow oxygen at baseline, the largest subgroup of patients in the trial, over 40% of patients, those who received Veklury had a 72% reduction in mortality at day 15 and a 70% reduction in mortality at day 29, with confidence intervals that do not cross one. These results are what we would have expected and hoped for with an antiviral therapy that should have the most impact when given earlier in the course of the disease before the inflammatory cascade leads to critical illness. These data add to the breadth of evidence from two additional randomized controlled clinical trials, establishing the use of Veklury as a standard of care for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. All three of these Phase 3 trials have been published in peer-reviewed journals, and the raw data was shared with the FDA as part of the NDA review process for them to perform their own independent analyses as is their standard approach. We continue to pursue other ways to expand the utility of remdesivir as a backbone of treatment, including exploring how combinations could be more effective and new means of administering the drug that don't require intravenous administration. Now, last week, interim results from the World Health Organization Solidarity trial were released through a preprint server. These results don't alter the demonstration of efficacy observed with remdesivir in the studies I just described. That trial was intentionally designed to be pragmatic and enable participation across a wide range of healthcare settings. They are components of the study design and data that should provide pause. These may be clarified or placed into appropriate context during the peer review process. Given that we haven't received the data, nor have there been peer reviewed -- nor have these data been peer reviewed, it's difficult for us to discuss the study. Some of the issues we and others have identified in WHO study include the lack of a PCR confirmation of COVID-19 at the time of enrollment, the lack of distinction between patients requiring low-flow or high-flow oxygen in the results, no data monitoring, no data verification, and 20% of the data being reported as missing from the preliminary analysis. We can only speculate at this point that these factors may have contributed to the negative outcomes reported in this study. It is, however, important to note that the totality of data generated thus far for Veklury suggests that antivirals are most effective earlier in the disease course. As you get sicker, inflammation, such as ARDS or fibrosis, potentially things like vascular blood clots and bacterial pneumonias could kick in. The NIAID data suggests that patients on low-flow oxygen are those that show the greatest benefit in time to discharge and mortality. An antiviral doesn't clear inflammation or blood clots once they're formed. So, this makes sense. Sicker patients on high-flow oxygen and mechanical ventilation may need an antiviral, but it will be insufficient to treat the inflammation. In those patients, treatment in addition to antivirals such as dexamethasone may be beneficial and have been demonstrated to be that way, using WHO data. We look forward to learning more about the Solidarity trial results and sharing this information with regulators, once we have the data in hand. Most importantly, at this moment, the world is combating a pandemic that isn't going away. As we see infections once again on the rise across the U.S. and Europe, it's critical that physicians have every tool possible at their disposal, and that patients are encouraged to seek care for what we know can be a rapidly progressing and deadly virus. We're proud of the role Veklury has played in this pandemic, and I'm proud of and profoundly grateful to the team who's worked so hard to advance this medicine for patients, including those collaborators at the NIAID, the investigators and patients who've been integral to the conduct of these studies. We regularly receive letters of gratitude from people who've been treated with Veklury, and we're grateful for the opportunity to provide this important treatment during this time. So, now, I'd like to turn to oncology. As Dan mentioned, we're very excited now to have the Trodelvy program in-house with the closing of the Immunomedics transaction. We're excited to welcome the impressive Immunomedics team to Gilead. As Dan and Johanna both mentioned, Trodelvy represents a growth inflection point for the Company, and I'd like to highlight recent progress that has us excited about the full potential of this medicine. You may have seen the ESMO data that Immunomedics presented from the confirmatory Phase 3 ASCENT study. In this study, despite having received a median of four prior anticancer treatments, patients treated with Trodelvy showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival with a median of 12.1 months versus 6.7 months for chemotherapy and a hazard ratio of 0.48 and a P-value of less than 0.0001. Trodelvy also demonstrated statistically significant improvement in ORR, 35% versus 5%, and CBR, 45% versus 9%, when compared with chemotherapy. These remarkable results should establish Trodelvy as a new standard of care in patients with third-line metastatic TNBC. In urothelial cancer, another area of focus, as reported at ESMO last month, Immunomedics released the positive results from cohort one of the pivotal Phase 2 TROPHY U-01 study of Trodelvy in cisplatin-eligible patients with metastatic urothelial cancer. These results confirm the interim findings in prior Phase 1/2 study results, showing Trodelvy has significant activity and is well tolerated in patients with heavily pretreated metastatic urothelial cancer who progressed despite platinum-based chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors. Trodelvy has a potential to be an important new treatment for patients with metastatic urothelial cancer. Based on these exciting data, in terms of the path forward for Trodelvy, the BLA -- supplemental BLA seeking expansion of Trodelvy's label to include the ASCENT result is expected to be submitted in Q4 to the FDA under the RTOR program. The sBLA submission to the FDA for an accelerated approval of Trodelvy in metastatic urothelial cancer is expected in Q4 as well. In addition, the MAA for Trodelvy in metastatic TNBC in Europe is planned for submission to the EMA in the first quarter of 2021. The potential for Trodelvy in earlier lines of therapy and additional tumor types is something we're really excited to explore. Results from studies with combinations of PARP inhibitors and separately checkpoint inhibitors give us even more options to explore the potential of this new treatment for patients. Beyond Trodelvy, I'd like to highlight other opportunities in our oncology pipeline that continue to excite us. On magrolimab, our anti-CD47 asset, we continue to pursue options for filing an accelerated approval pathway from magrolimab in addition to azacitidine and MDS in 2021 based on the ongoing single-arm study. As with all single arm studies, the risk and the FDA will make a decision based on the totality of the data and whether the data support a substantial benefit from available standard of care. The recent breakthrough designation for magrolimab provides recognition by the FDA the potential for magrolimab, and enables us to have more frequent FDA interactions. We also have obtained prime designation from magrolimab, another recognition of the potential for magrolimab. We've initiated our enhanced randomized Phase 3 study comparing magrolimab plus azacitidine versus azacitidine alone in higher risk MDS patients to confirm the Phase 1 results for potential full approval. The emerging data from our partner, Arcus, is very exciting, and we look forward to updating you in due course. Moving to antivirals. We continue to be excited about lenacapavir, the Company's investigational long-acting HIV1 capsid inhibitor, an injectable administered every six months. The study evaluating lenacapavir in highly treatment-experienced HIV patients is progressing, and we're on track for a planned filing in 2021. We also recently announced the addition of a new study arm of lenacapavir to the women's -- to the existing planned women's HIV prevention study, evaluating Descovy and Truvada in women at risk of HIV. In parallel, we will also initiate a study of lenacapavir for HIV prevention in men and transgender people who have sex with men. Turning to filgotinib. We're excited about the launch of Jyseleca for rheumatoid arthritis in Europe. During the quarter, we shared data from the Phase 2b/3 selection trial in ulcerative colitis showing filgotinib 200 milligrams, induced remission at week 10 and achieved endoscopic, histologic and six-month corticosteroid free remission at week 58 with a consistent safety profile. We plan to file filgotinib for ulcerative colitis in Europe before the year-end and Japan early next year. As we previously shared, in August, the FDA issued a complete response letter for filgotinib in rheumatoid arthritis, requesting data from the MANTA and MANTA-RAy studies and expressing concerns regarding the benefit risk profile of the 200-milligram dose. We met with the FDA for a Type C meeting to discuss MANTA, and we'll meet again for a Type A meeting in Q4 to further discuss the CRL. In the meantime, we're pausing screening and enrollment for ongoing trials in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and uveitis as we believe the FDA meeting will inform the broader filgotinib development program. We continue to believe in the benefit risk profile of filgotinib. I'd also like to highlight that we remain committed to inflammation into our long-term collaboration with Galapagos. Finally, I wanted to highlight that we are focused on ongoing strategic portfolio review and disciplined prioritization of our overall portfolio. We've shared a summary of important upcoming milestones across the pipeline in the materials we've provided. I'll turn over the call to Andy now. Andrew Dickinson : Thanks, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter performance was strong, and it reflects the solid underlying fundamentals in our core HIV franchise and the start of the post donation phase for Veklury. It also reflects the ongoing and dynamic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. You will find our detailed Q3 results in the press release and materials we have posted. In my following remarks, I will review elements of our Q3 performance and provide you with an update on our full year guidance. Turning now to the financial highlights. Total revenues for the third quarter of 2020 were $6.6 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.11. This compares to total revenue of $5.6 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.64 for the same period last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2020 increased 29% year-over-year, primarily due to higher operating income driven by growth in HIV product sales and our initial Veklury sales as well as lower non-GAAP tax rate. As noted in the earnings press release, on a GAAP basis, the third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.29, primarily due to $1.2 billion in charges related to our collaborations and equity investments in building out our oncology pipeline as well as a $900 million loss from unfavorable changes in the fair value of our equity investment in Galapagos. Product sales for the third quarter of 2020 were $6.5 billion, up 28% sequentially and up 18% year-over-year, primarily due to Veklury sales and our core HIV products driven by stronger demand as well as higher volume as channel inventory continues to normalize in the United States. HIV revenues grew sequentially 14%, driven by a continued patient uptake of Biktarvy and Descovy for PrEP and increased channel inventory purchases in the United States. HIV revenues increased 8% year-over-year, primarily due to higher demand driven by Biktarvy, and as I said earlier, the normalization of inventory purchases in the U.S., partially offset by lower sales of Truvada. HCV revenues grew 4% sequentially, primarily due to higher patient starts in the United States and Europe, but the revenues were down 31% year-over-year, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on patient starts. Cell therapy revenues were down 6% sequentially due to COVID-19 and up 25% year-over-year, driven by continued patient uptake and expansion of Yescarta in Europe. Now, sturning to our expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $1.2 billion for the quarter, down 3% sequentially and up 12% year-over-year. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by lower investments in remdesivir in the third quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher investments in remdesivir, partially offset by pauses or deferrals of certain clinical trials due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $1.1 billion, down 6% sequentially and up 5% year-over-year. The sequential decrease in expenses was primarily driven by the second quarter accrual of $97 million related to a Department of Justice matter, which subsequently settled in the third quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by headcount growth, partially offset by lower marketing spend due to COVID-19. Now, moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We finished the quarter with $26 billion in cash and marketable debt securities. During the quarter, we generated $2.3 billion in cash flow from operations. We paid dividends of $861 million. We repaid $2 billion of maturing debt, and we repurchased $201 million of stock. In addition, we issued $7.25 billion of senior notes and arranged a $1 billion term loan, which we drew down in Q4 to partially fund the acquisition of Immunomedics. After closing the Immunomedics acquisition, our balance sheet remains strong and our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We have, however, curtailed our share repurchase program in the near term as we focus on paying down debt incurred in the acquisition. As Dan indicated, the acquisition will immediately accelerate our revenue growth and is expected to be neutral to accretive to our non-GAAP EPS in 2023 -- by 2023 and significantly accretive thereafter. Turning now to COVID and its continued impact on our business and the broader business environment. As we do every quarter, we've updated our base case utilizing external projections and views. As you know, the pandemic continues to progress in unpredictable ways. The recent uptick of infection and hospitalization rates in the U.S. and Europe is obviously of concern to all and will potentially impact the business environment during the fourth quarter and into 2021. Globally, external views suggest widespread vaccination will not become a reality until late in 2021. As a result, we expect the pandemic to continue to impact our business and broader market dynamics, including in particular, HCV, HIV PrEP and Veklury demand into 2021 and potentially beyond. We also expect that our HIV treatment business will continue to remain largely unaffected and that the remainder of our core business will continue to recover in the fourth quarter and into the first half of 2021. With that as context, let me turn to our updated full year 2020 guidance. It's important to reiterate that we are operating in a highly complex and dynamic environment and that projections are subject to greater uncertainty than it\u2019s historically been the case. We have reaffirmed and narrowed our revenue guidance range to $23 billion to $23.5 billion, reflecting the latest estimates for Veklury. The guidance range provided during our second quarter earnings reflected underlying uncertainty in demand -- in the demand dynamics for Veklury, given the nature of this pandemic, and as Johanna mentioned earlier, factors such as the rate of infections by region, severity, hospitalizations and stockpiling demand, all of which have been difficult to forecast. On the expense side, we're raising our SG&A expense guidance to low-double-digit percentage growth, reflecting the Immunomedics acquisition. Our full year operating income guidance range is reaffirmed and narrowed and is now US$10.7 billion to US$11.2 billion. Our full year non-GAAP EPS range is also reaffirmed and narrowed and is now 6.25 to -- $6.25 to $6.60 per share. As we think about our performance to date and our guidance, we are encouraged by the significant process we've made in such a challenging environment this year. Before we hand the call off for Q&A, we would like to express our gratitude to our 12,000 Gilead and Kite employees globally. Their spirit, dedication and resilience make it possible for us to have a meaningful impact on patients with some of the world's hardest to treat diseases. We'd now like to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] I show our first question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, on filgotinib, can you guys maybe just describe what you're thinking in terms of the potential outcomes here once you have that Type A meeting? Is this something where you could decide not to launch the drug in the U.S. at all, or is this more a nuanced approach where maybe you won't move forward with RA, but move forward with the IBD indication? Thanks very much. Merdad Parsey : Hi. Matthew, it's Merdad. Yes. I think, the outcomes -- it's hard to predict what the outcomes are. I do think that both the options you suggested are possible. And I would sort of tend towards your latter approach, which is that we would -- if things aren't able to move forward with RA, we'd like to keep the door open for us to continue to move forward in IBD and continue those discussions, obviously, dependent on the MANTA and the MANTA-RAy data outcome. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Evan Seigerman : So, with the recent review of Galapagos' Toledo program, Merdad, what do you really need to see from the proof-of-concept trials to opt in and be comfortable, potentially incorporating this into your portfolio, given your focus on portfolio optimization? Thank you. Merdad Parsey : Yes. Thanks. Great question. They're doing a really great job of exploring the potential of that program in multiple indications. And they have a great approach of trying to get there quickly, looking for early signals of activity. On our end, obviously, we would like to see the programs de-risked to the appropriate level at the time that we opt in. That will vary based on the signals we see and the magnitude of the improvement that we see. So, obviously, if you saw, hypothetically, a huge response in one indication that was really unexpected and blew it out of the water, we might opt-in more early. Whereas if it's more nuanced in a small trial, we might want to flush that out a little bit more before we opt in. Our contract allows us to continue to work with them as the programs are de-risked. And our desire is to opt in and move as quickly as possible once we have an appropriate level of risk. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JP Morgan. Cory Kasimov : I wanted to ask about remdesivir and the change to guidance now. I guess, I'm just trying to better understand kind of what has changed since your guidance in 2Q that leads to the lowering of fiscal year guidance by $1.5 billion. And I mean, just given the pace of infections that we're seeing across the country, can you just kind of go into a little bit more detail on why this -- why the lowering and kind of how this market is evolving, in your eyes? Andrew Dickinson : Cory, it's Andy. I'll start, and Johanna can jump in as well. I think, it's relatively straightforward. I mean, it's a dynamic situation. It's very difficult to forecast, as we've discussed. And as I think most people understand, the rate of hospitalizations is the biggest factor that has moved around a lot over the last six months, and it continues to move today. So, what you're seeing is our -- the latest estimate based on the information that we have we're pleased with the uptake in the third quarter, obviously, with the formal U.S. approval, the joint procurement agreement in place, Johanna and her team, I think, have a better sense of where we see the year, but it's still very dynamic and is unusual compared to what you have to typically forecast. Johanna, if you want to add anything to that? Johanna Mercier : Yes. Maybe just to add to that, Andy, I think, what we're also seeing is the severity of the disease. So, I think as you saw through the summer months, even though there were surges, going through the U.S. mostly, some of those were younger patient population. And therefore, the hospitalization rates really dropped over the summer months. We were seeing closer to 12% to 15% late Q2. And as you go into Q3, they're closer to 5%. So, we're really tracking those very closely. It's not just the incidence. It's really, to Andy's point, the hospitalization rates. And obviously, the assumption is, in light of the surge this fall, both in Europe as well as in the U.S., that those numbers will pop back up a little bit. So, that would be one piece of the puzzle. The other piece, I would say, is we looked at some of our assumptions around stockpiling, and although we've seen some stockpiling, not at the level that we had originally projected. And so, we're adapting to that as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Michael Yee : I wanted to follow up a little more on filgotinib. Obviously, it's an important driver, and you said you'll have a Type A meeting and you'll make some decisions. Can you just clarify what you would actually learn from a Type A? And if you were to, as you said, maybe keep IBD, isn't 200-milligram is really important, and so that would tie together with RA being approved at 200? So, maybe just explain a little bit where these scenarios would evolve from. And could you just make tough decisions to not go forward at all? Thank you. Daniel O\u2019Day: Sure, Michael. Yes, couldn't agree more. Look, I think, the conversation we\u2019ll have in the Type A meeting will center around really what level of evidence the FDA would be looking for on both of those issues, right, in terms of trying to get to a better benefit risk understanding. And so, that will depend -- so we need to find that out from the 200-milligram standpoint, and we need to find it out from the MANTA and MANTA-RAy standpoint. So, those two things we will get guidance from the FDA at the Type A meeting. And then, based on that outcome, we will make some decisions how to go forward, whether it's -- whether there's a clear path, whether we have to only go forward in IBD or whether 200 milligrams is not viable until MANTA reads out -- MANTA-RAy readout. All those are possibilities. So, it's hard to speculate what the outcome of that will be. We'll be transparent obviously as we have that discussion with how we'll proceed. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Geoffrey Porges : One question -- a multipart question on Veklury and then a quick one on Trodelvy. So, on Veklury, could you give us a sense of how many patients have been treated so far or at least in the quarter and disclose for us what the inventory stocking was? And then, a little bit of color about what proportion of hospitalized patients are getting remdesivir because we get the sense the standard of care. And then, Merdad, could you just talk a little bit about the profile of Trodelvy and combinations? It does have some significant safety and tolerability liabilities. So, which of the combinations do you think it makes the most sense to use it in? Thanks. Johanna Mercier : So, let me start, Geoff, with the Veklury question around usage. So, what we've seen is, obviously, in Q3, a little bit of a interesting dynamic in light of most of the supply was committed through the HHS to U.S. patient population. So, there was a bit of an inventory build through the Q3 that you're going to see play out in Q4 in the U.S. specifically. We're also in a situation due to the incredible work that's been done by our manufacturing teams to be in a situation where our current supply now is at a level where it is exceeding global demand. So, we feel very confident in making sure we can -- global demand around the world, namely in Europe right now, in light of not only the drug procurement agreement, but in light of the recent surge that you're seeing across countries in Europe. I think, to your point about percentage of patients, it really varies across countries but also regions. And I do think that that percentage is increasing as we speak. As the FDA approval came out last week, we're already seeing a lot more noise around that, but also in light of the fact that we have a field team. So medical and commercial that are now going out to make sure that physicians are aware and educated on where best to use Veklury. And I think that's one of the pieces that's the most important. So, that's playing out as we speak. But, we have seen probably out of hospitalization rates in many countries anywhere between 40% to 50% in the U.S. usage of remdesivir. And of course, that number will only grow as people better understand the data now that it's been published as well as approved through the FDA. And maybe, Merdad, on Trodelvy. Merdad Parsey : Yes. And I'll take the Trodelvy question, Geoffrey. Yes. Look, I think, what we know so far with the Trodelvy [indiscernible] combo is a couple of things. One is just looking at the combos where it's been tested, there's data with the parts and there's data with checkpoint inhibitors. And so far, those data seem to support the ability to go forward with combos. And that obviously opens a number of doors there for us to investigate. When we look at the adverse event profile and we look at what -- and we talk to the investigators about what they're seeing and how they're managing it, the tox is largely the neutropenia and the diarrhea, and often that the investigators are saying that toxicity seems to be manageable, something they're comfortable managing. And we're getting a lot of encouragement to move earlier in lines of therapy, based on that adverse event profile. The individual combinations will be dictated by the indication that we're in, right, whether it's breast, urothelial, lung, those combinations will depend. But, I think a big one will probably be the checkpoint inhibitors where I think we're optimistic and have reasonably good data about being able to combine there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Alethia Young : I just wanted to talk a little bit about kind of big picture immunology. So, maybe depending on what you decide with filgotinib next year based on some of the conversations, like how are you thinking about the space? Are you still committed? Would you consider doing M&A or do you have an internal pipeline that continues to drive potential revenues there? Thanks Daniel O\u2019Day: Thanks, Alethia. I'll start and then maybe Merdad can add as well. But first of all, I mean, nothing has changed about our dedication to our three disease areas. As you know, I mean, our strategy that we announced at the beginning of the year was based upon two really strong scientific disciplines that we have from a discovery perspective at Gilead and with our partners, and that is antivirals and immunomodulation. And we've been firmly focused on that strategy in terms of how it plays out in both, antivirals, inflammation and fibrosis, and then also oncology. So, we think there's a lot of synergies associated with that science. Obviously, immunology, as you know, Alethia, goes across so many disease states. Immunology plays in the antivirals, for instance, particularly when we look at some of our HBV cure programs. But clearly, in the field of inflammation, we've already spoken about where we stand with filgotinib. We have a variety of follow-on agents within our Gilead research, with our partners with Galapagos, and we'll maintain an external view on opportunities to continue to advance our inflammation portfolio in-house. And you can see, of course, what we've done in the oncology field, predominantly immuno-oncology over the past year, really building up our oncology base based upon -- largely based upon immuno-oncology. Trodelvy allows us to have a really strong footprint now into solid tumors in a pan-tumor way, which we think will be very complementary to our first-in-class, best-in-class immuno-oncology portfolio. Merdad, maybe you want to add as well, your view on the -- on that question as well. Merdad Parsey : I think, you hit all the key points, Dan. I think, we -- the only thing I'd add is I think we really have a great team here. And I think that team is going to be really great about charting our future in immunology. But as Dan said, we remain committed to that. And we'll continue to look at both near and long-term opportunities there that makes sense for us in the portfolio. Daniel O\u2019Day: I mean, maybe, Merdad, it's just important to emphasize the unmet medical need in that area. It's still a very significant. Merdad Parsey : Yes. And we look at -- maybe the only other thing I'd add is that we look at it through a fairly broad lens of what immunology means. There are a lot of indications with a lot of unmet need that persist in that space. And we'll be looking for that transformative profile. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould from Barclays. Carter Gould : Maybe just to follow up on that same sort of question on portfolio construction. Historically, old Gilead was routinely criticized for not being as disciplined with many of its mid-stage assets. Clearly, the pipeline is much broader. You guys highlighted sort of a return to discipline. Yet, it doesn't seem to be apparent, I guess, when we look to the pipeline side. When you think about the size and breadth of the pipeline today, are you comfortable with that? And I guess, will we start to see some of those prioritization decisions start to manifest soon, or if there's things you can point to today? That would be helpful. Daniel O\u2019Day: Yes, Carter. Again, I think. the entire team here is dedicated to putting together a portfolio management process that's state of the art. I think, your question is very well taken. It's a work in progress, right? So, we're -- first of all, we've hired a lot of new people into the organization with terrific expertise in different therapeutic areas. We're putting processes into place across research and development, into our commercial organization to help us make decisions accordingly. And I think, you'll see some of those play out in the near term as well. But, the philosophy that Merdad and Johanna and the rest of the team and I are firmly committed to is drawing the line at a level that makes sure that the programs that hurdle that line are really first and best-in-class. And I'm really pleased with how the organizations progress, both from an operational perspective, but then also from a scientific perspective over the course of the past year. But, as you know, I mean, this is a continual process. And we need to make sure that we're constantly looking at the outside environment, looking at the unmet medical need, going back to where that line is drawn in our organization and making consequential decisions on the portfolio. And we intend to do that. We intend to make tough decisions and fund those most attractive opportunities. I would also say, the other thing we're looking very hard at is a balance in our portfolio. I think, in the past, Gilead has also been -- seen as a company that went after a lot of high-risk, high-reward projects. In some cases, those were not successful in the late stages. I think, we're firmly committed to having a balanced portfolio where we're always holding the bar high for innovation, but making sure we derisk as much as possible earlier in the stages of development such that when you get into the late-stage investments in Phase 3, things have been de-risked, and therefore, your ability to succeed rises as well. So, these are all very conscious things we're working on together. Merdad, again, I apologize if -- you've trained me well. You [indiscernible] things to add on that as one of the leaders in organizing this portfolio. Merdad Parsey : The only thing I'd add, Carter, it's a really insightful question. And it's something that we -- as Dan said, we're really committed to doing. And, what I would say is that you will see us exercising that discipline. That will be something that will be apparent sooner than later. And recognize that there are a lot of things that are in-flight that they don't make sense to deprioritize because they're already ongoing. So, we'll let those things read out. So, it'll probably take a little bit longer for everything to get taken care of in the wash, if you will. But you will definitely see that playing out with us as data get read out and as new things enter into the portfolio that we'll be exercising that discipline to make sure we're making some tough decisions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets. Brian Abrahams : A question on HIV, inventory and stockpiling. I'm wondering if you could quantify if what you observed in the third quarter was a benefit or just normalization. And if you look to fourth quarter and beyond, what should we expect with respect to potential stockpiling, just given the newest COVID spike versus inventory drawdowns? Johanna Mercier : So, maybe I'll take that one, Brian. I think, that as we're seeing Q3 -- this whole year, and I'm sure everybody kind of seeing this full year has been really interesting when it comes to inventory because we've seen a pattern that's very different than prior years, obviously, due to COVID-19. The expectation that we have this year is, as you normally see in Q4, you actually do have a lift in product supply at the end of December that plays into our total inventory for 2020. Having said that that's a little bit also impacted by the fact that Truvada\u2019s LOE, and there's now a generic on the market with Teva as of early October. And so, we believe that number is a little lower than the norm that we've seen in the past. We haven't assumed a -- stockpiling to your point about COVID-19 because it's already -- usually, Q4 is already on the rise versus other quarters. So, we've assumed that. What we've seen in Q3, to the first part of your question, I think, it\u2019s just normalization of the last couple of quarters. And you kind of -- if you recall, Q1 usually draws down on Q4 supply. What we saw is a pickup in March because of COVID-19 that then kind of bled out in Q2, and then we saw a pickup again in Q3, which I think is really the normalization of those two quarters. So assuming Q4 is like other quarters in the past, that's what's currently in our current projection. Hopefully, that addresses the thinking there for HIV. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Tyler Van Buren : I was just hoping to get a little bit more precision on the Veklury guidance. I guess if you take the midpoint of the updated guidance relative to the guidance in the beginning of the year and the Q3 sales, it could suggest that sales could be down significantly in Q4 quarter-over-quarter. So -- but then obviously, the core business has been impacted a bit by the pandemic, which could offset and make it more flat. So, I wanted to understand what you\u2019re modeling for Veklury in Q4 or what your guidance incorporates. And then, the second part of the question is, on the outpatient and the inhaled studies, can you give any more granularity on when we should expect that data? And how much do you think demand could increase if those studies are successful? Daniel O\u2019Day: Great. Thanks, Tyler. So, Andy, why don't you handle the guidance, and maybe we'll go to Diana for the updates on Veklury's next generation? Andrew Dickinson : Sure. Hi, Tyler. Thanks for the question. I appreciate it. We're not providing specific product guidance, as you know, and we typically don't. But, as you suggested and as we mentioned earlier, the revision in guidance is tied not entirely, but almost entirely to expectations around Veklury. Johanna also mentioned that there was some excess inventory in the channel as a result of the terrific work that our manufacturing team did. And you'll see in our materials that we're on track to meet the expectation that we had set in terms of 2 million treatment courses by the end of the year. So, as inventory was moving into the channel in the third quarter, at the same time that hospitalization rates and the severity of the outbreak in the U.S., at least at that time, was coming down, there was less demand in the third quarter than expected. And then, you see that play through in the fourth quarter. So, we didn't recognize revenue for all of the Veklury that was shipped in the third quarter, to be clear. Some of that was constrained, and then you see that playing through in the fourth quarter and the full year guidance. So, we can't be more specific than that. Happy to provide any additional color that we can, but we're not going to provide specific product level guidance. Maybe over to Diana. Diana Brainard : Hi, Tyler. So, our outpatient study is ongoing. We're recruiting actively. And in terms of our predictions, we think that that study will wrap up early next year, and we should have results in the first quarter. It is harder than is typical to predict the dynamics of trial enrollment for COVID-19. So much depends on the number of cases, the competition with other clinical trials. So, we're going to have to kind of take it month-by-month and see how the dynamics go. As you know, we're approved with Veklury for hospitalized patients or patients in equivalent in-patient setting. So, in terms of then what that does for us once we have the trial results, if it were successful, we would then look to getting an expanded label for that population. So, that would be further down the line. But our first step is to get the study enrolled and see how Veklury performs in the outpatient setting where we're trying to present hospitalization rather than hasten recovery in the hospital. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat : Just two very quick ones. First, on Biktarvy perhaps, the IMS trends don't appear particularly encouraging for the last six months or so. I know it's growing, but not the way it was in the past. I would love to get your take on that. And secondly, on the capsid inhibitor, Merdad, how are you thinking about possible candidates for a combo? I know, there are other companies with HIV candidates as well, and this has been an ongoing question. Where are you guys headed at? Daniel O\u2019Day: Sure. Johanna can start, and then take it from there. Johanna, do you want to start? Johanna Mercier : Yes. Thanks, Umer. So, listen, we're really proud of actually Biktarvy growth. And I think that if you look at the share growth, it's basically 8 points of share year-on-year when you think about as Q3 '19 to Q3 '20. And when you look at Q2 to Q3, it's a point of share. So, we do think that the growth continues. Where we've seen a little bit more of an impact is from a market standpoint because if you think about the impact of COVID-19, it had a larger impact in our HIV treatment business really when it comes to switches. And so, it'll impact disproportionately newer agents in the market because physicians aren't switching to newer agents. But obviously, Biktarvy is part of that pool. The overall share of Gilead still remains really strong because of that because we -- more than 75% of patients are actually on a Gilead compound. And so, therefore, they're just remaining. There's less switches. We've seen that rebound a little bit in Q3. We expect that to continue through Q4. But I think, overall, if you think about it in the U.S., which is our larger business, right now, 1 out of 2 -- actually, more than 1 out of 2 patients starts on Biktarvy. We have about a 56% share of naive patients. And when you think about the switches, although the market for switches is a little bit lower, we're still roughly about 1 in 2 patients going to Biktarvy, and they're going to Biktarvy from a non-Gilead single treatment regimen, which I also think is a great place to be. So, we continue to feel extremely confident in Biktarvy's continued growth because you're seeing it basically happen across all of the markets around the world to really consolidate around Biktarvy. In addition to the fact that COVID-19 is actually for na\u00efve patients, a real advantage with Biktarvy because of the rapid start. And that's something that even guidelines are recognizing in light of the fact that you don't need to -- there's no genotype testing, there's no HLA testing, et cetera. So, that's also helping to continue to grow our share in the naive patient population. So with that, Merdad or Diana on the capsid. Merdad Parsey : Yes. I have to take that. Hey, Umer. As you mentioned, look, we have both, internal candidates for combining with lenacapavir, and we remain open. As you said, there are other agents out there that could potentially be combination partners. And we remain definitely open to figuring out what's in the best interest of patients. And we'll continue to be diligent on that front. So, I think both possibilities remain there. Operator : And I show our last question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham : I just had a couple on remdesivir. Dan, you've talked about likely not making a major long-term contribution. So, I just wanted to ask, are the investments in nebulized or next-gen programs still a priority in the near term? And the second one related is, how do you manage your inventories for when the infection step down happens, which is hopefully sometime next year? Daniel O\u2019Day: Thanks, Geoff, for the question. Really helpful, I mean, to hear your context on that. I mean, let me say a couple of things, first of all. I mean, we think Veklury remdesivir will make a significant contribution certainly to Gilead. I mean, it already has, as you've seen in the sales to date, and we think through the end of this year and into 2021. And potentially, on a seasonal basis, beyond, I mean, one has to -- there's a lot we still don't know about the pandemic, of course. But I think what we do know is that in order to get us all back to normal, this is going to take a variety of approaches. Of course, it's going to take vaccines. It's going to take therapeutics in the hospital. It's going to potentially take combinations of therapies in the hospitals. And then, it's going to need therapeutics pre-hospitals. So, I think we're proud to be at the front end of this with a very potent antiviral, which is a bedrock I think of any approach to a pandemic. But, we'll continue to need investment. We're fully committed to the investment in line extensions here and in seeing where else we might be able to play in that continuum from pre-hospital setting to hospitalized patients. Obviously, we're not going to play in the area of vaccines, but in area of therapeutics. We think there's a very good return on that investment. I think, the challenge we have is -- by the way, we used to have a Tamiflu when I was at Roche, is it becomes difficult to predict. And you've seen it already in our -- at the half year, of course, we gave quite wide guidance to give us opportunities to understand where the pandemic was going and exactly how this into play a role in it. And now, what we've done is we've reaffirmed that guidance, but we've narrowed it. And I think as we go into next year and the year after, we're just going to need to stay adaptable and flexible on how much of a contributor Veklury is to us, but we do feel very strongly that Veklury will contribute to our overall sales, be an important source of cash for our business and allow us to pay down debt and make sure that we continue to invest in the routine part of our business in antivirals and beyond. I think, the other statement I would make though, Geoff, is that as a result of both the internal and external portfolio development over the past year, and in particular, the Immunomedics and Trodelvy transaction, excluding Veklury, we're now very confident in our ability to grow in the short and midterm. So I think, Veklury will come on top of that and may have year-to-year variability. But, I think that's really the story of today's call and the evolution of the course of the past year. And thanks for giving me the opportunity to kind of put that into context. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Douglas Maffei for closing remarks. Douglas Maffei : Thank you, Dillon, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead. And the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on our future progress. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today to Andrew Ang, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead. Andrew Ang : Thank you, Dillon. And good afternoon, everyone. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2020. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investors section of the Gilead website. The speakers on today's call will be Daniel O'Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Johanna Mercier, Chief Commercial Officer; Merdad Parsey, Chief Medical Officer; and Andrew Dickinson, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for Q&A will be Christi Shaw, Chief Executive Officer of Kite. Before we begin with our prepared remarks, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including risks and uncertainties related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gilead's business, financial condition and results of operations, plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, financial projections and the use of capital, and 2021 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risk and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.  A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, as well as on the Gilead website. I will now turn the call over to Dan. Daniel O'Day: Thank you, Andrew. And good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to have this opportunity to provide an update on our progress and answer your questions. I'll begin by offering brief remarks and then hand off to the team to go into more detail.  Before I begin, I want to thank all those who contributed to the progress we will highlight today, both our teams across the company and our many partners and collaborators worldwide.  Let me start by looking back at the fourth quarter. Our work continued across three main areas as it had throughout 2020, responding to the pandemic with our antiviral therapy, Veklury, delivering on our commitment to people with HIV, cancer, viral hepatitis, and other conditions; and thirdly, executing on our strategy. As a result of our efforts to expand and strengthen our portfolio, we're going into 2021 in a very different position to how we began 2020. Last month, we provided updated guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2020 to ensure that you had a clear picture coming into today's earnings announcement. This updated guidance was largely based on the significant increase in the uptake of Veklury.  In the United States alone, hospitalizations quadrupled between October and January, and approximately one out of every two patients hospitalized in the US are being treated with Veklury today.  We're grateful that Veklury is able to play such an important role in getting patients out of the hospital faster, five days on average based on the NIAID ACTT-1 trial, especially as many parts of the world struggle with hospital capacity.  The higher uptake of Veklury along with the continued growth of our leading treatment for HIV, Biktarvy, helped to offset the ongoing impact of the pandemic on some parts of our business. Veklury and Biktarvy also helped to mitigate the expected impact of loss of exclusivity for Atripla and Truvada in October.  Our efforts to build out our portfolio of medicines continued in the fourth quarter, with our agreement to acquire MYR. The acquisition, which is on track to close in the first quarter of this year, subject to regulatory clearances and other closing conditions, will bring us a first in class medicine called Hepcludex for the treatment of hepatitis D or HDV.  This is the most severe form of viral hepatitis and affects some patients who are already infected with hepatitis B. Hepcludex is conditionally approved in Europe and has FDA breakthrough therapy designation as an investigational agent in the United States. The acquisition of Immunomedics closed in the fourth quarter, bringing the most significant recent addition to our pipeline, Trodelvy. Trodelvy is a foundational medicine in our cancer portfolio with significant potential across multiple tumor types. We're very pleased with how the integration with Immunomedics is going and look forward to updating you on our progress with Trodelvy.  Andy, Johanna, and Merdad will share more detail on the quarter. I'd like to turn now to the year ahead. The first thing I would say is that we're moving forward with a clear path to growth. We have multiple opportunities in new therapeutic areas, especially oncology. We're very pleased with the strong and diverse oncology portfolio we have today. This portfolio consists of both marketed therapies such as Trodelvy and Tecartus and Yescarta from Kite and programs across various stages of the pipeline. There are currently 27 internal ongoing clinical stage programs for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. We also have many promising opt-in opportunities. One of those options is for the anti-TIGIT program through our collaboration with Arcus Biosciences. Earlier this week, it was announced that we are increasing our investment in Arcus to help fund the continued progress of the promising Arcus pipeline.  The foundation for our near- and long-term growth is our continued leadership in antivirals. We are confident in the longevity of our HIV business. We expect Biktarvy to continue to be a mainstay of HIV treatment long into the future. And our investigational capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir, could be a best-in-class, long-acting option for both treatment and prevention. Lenacapavir is highly potent, and importantly it\u2019s flexible dosing profile gives us the potential to develop multiple long-acting treatment and prevention options.  In 2021, we expect a number of important milestones in the areas I've just mentioned. Merdad will provide more detail on the regulatory milestones, and I will highlight a few for now within the broader context of what you can expect from us. Starting with our leadership in antivirals. We will of course be focused on the continued growth of Biktarvy and maintaining its leadership as the number one prescribed treatment for HIV in major markets. We plan to file an NDA in the US for lenacapavir in the heavily treatment-experienced population. This should be in the second half of the year.  We will also continue to explore the right options for combinations. In viral hepatitis, we look forward to expanding our business in HBV and HDV by growing sales of Vemlidy in the US and Asia; and pending completion of the MYR acquisition, the anticipated filing of a BLA in the second half of the year.  For Veklury, we look to realize the full potential of the therapy as the pandemic evolves. As you know, we are studying new formulations and routes of administration for Veklury as a treatment for COVID-19.  With the strong antiviral business as our foundation, we are looking forward to the continued expansion of oncology as a new pillar of growth. Trodelvy, which will have its first full year on the market following approval will be a significant contributor to our growth this year. We expect to hear about conversion from accelerated to full approval in the coming weeks based on the FDA review of the ASCENT data.  At the same time, we'll be pursuing the many pipeline opportunities for Trodelvy. It is currently being studied in 10 different tumor types. We expect to hear from the FDA on accelerated approval for Trodelvy in metastatic urothelial cancer in the first half of the year.  And we're also anticipating a readout of the Phase III TROPiCS-02 study in hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer in the second half. Data from the Phase III ZUMA-7 study is expected in the first half of the year for Yescarta's potential expansion into second line DLBCL. And we should see Phase I-b data from magrolimab in MDS in the second half of the year with the possibility of a regulatory submission based on these results. In addition, we'll assess opt-in opportunities throughout the year as data becomes available and continue to advance our internal programs.  I want to add that we are focused on prioritizing in order to deliver on these opportunities. We now have a portfolio that allows us to be much more selective in terms of what we take forward. This means being very disciplined about investing where there is highest potential value. You've seen some of that with our decisions around filgotinib and our investment in Trodelvy.  Just briefly on the enterprise level activities, we will continue to expand our talent base and deepen our expertise outside antivirals as we did in 2020.  We will also maintain our strong focus on inclusion and diversity. As part of this, we are strengthening our efforts to promote racial equity. Today, we announced that Gilead has become a founding member of a coalition called OneTen. This is a group of US companies that is committed to hiring and promoting 1 million black Americans into family sustaining jobs over the next 10 years.  In addition, we'll continue to advance our ESG program and targets in line with our strategy. We will update you on our progress in these areas each quarter. There's a lot of important work ahead of us in 2021. And we're very much looking forward to turning our opportunities into tangible progress that will benefit patients, communities and our shareholders.  With that, I'll now pass over the call to Andy. Andrew Dickinson : Thank you, Dan. And good afternoon, everyone. Our performance was strong for the fourth quarter and full-year 2020, a clear reflection of solid underlying fundamentals of our business and the increased demand we saw for Veklury, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. You will find our detailed Q4 and full-year 2020 results in the press release and materials we have posted on our website. Today, I will review our Q4 and full-year 2020 performance and provide our guidance for 2021.  Turning now to the financial highlights. Total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $7.4 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.19. This compares to total revenue of $5.9 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.10 for the same period last year. Non GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased 99% year-over-year, primarily due to higher product sales, improved gross margin driven by a prior-year inventory charge and a lower tax rate. This was partially offset by increased R&D and SG&A investments, including $190 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to amending our agreement with Galapagos. Product sales for the fourth quarter and full year were $7.3 billion and $24.4 billion, up 26% and 10%, respectively, compared to the same periods last year as the most recent COVID-19 surge drove uptake of Veklury. Sequentially, this increase was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity of Atripla and Truvada in the US in October.  Veklury contributed $1.9 billion and $2.8 billion in sales for the fourth quarter and full year 2020, largely driven by increased utilization and COVID-19 hospitalizations in the US. For the full year excluding Veklury, product sales were down 3% due to the recent losses of exclusivity for Atripla, Truvada, Letairis and Ranexa in the US, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our HIV and HCV franchises. Despite the impact of the pandemic and the LOEs related to Atripla and Truvada in the US, HIV revenue grew 3% year-over-year, driven by Biktarvy and Descovy. For Q4, product sales excluding Veklury decreased 4% sequentially, primarily due to the Atripla and Truvada LOEs.  Cell therapy revenues were up 34% for the fourth quarter and 33% for the year, primarily due to the continued uptake of Yescarta in Europe and the US launch of Tecartus in July.  Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $918 million for the fourth quarter and $3.3 billion for the year, down 35% and 8% respectively compared to the same periods last year. 2020 cost of goods sold was lower primarily because of a $500 million inventory write-down charge in Q4 of 2019. Excluding this, non-GAAP product margins remain relatively flat year-over-year.  Non-GAAP R&D expense for the quarter was $1.5 billion, up 31% sequentially and up 37% year-over-year, primarily driven by the $190 million charge associated with the Galapagos amendment that I mentioned earlier and approximately $70 million in milestones paid to Pioneer as well as pipeline investments in Trodelvy and magrolimab.  For the full year, non-GAAP R&D expense was up 20% year-over-year, primarily due to our significant investment in Veklury. We also increased our investment in oncology programs, including Trodelvy and magrolimab.  These increases in investment were partially offset by lower clinical expenses from the completion of certain inflammation programs and postponement of certain clinical trials due to the pandemic.  Non-GAAP SG&A expense for the quarter was $1.5 billion, up 37% sequentially and up 25% year-over-year. The increase in the quarter was driven by the timing of marketing expenses related to Biktarvy, along with Veklury and Trodelvy commercialization efforts and higher spend on corporate grants to support philanthropic organizations.  We allocated significant additional funds to nonprofit grantees in Q4 to support racial equity and social justice efforts, help our nonprofit grantees weather the pandemic and provide for our signature giving programs, including COMPASS, RADIAN and HepConnect. For the full year, non-GAAP SG&A expense increased 10% as a result of higher costs associated with the commercialization efforts for Veklury, our continued expansion in China, increased corporate grants, remdesivir donations and a $97 million charge related to a previously disclosed legal settlement.  Turning to our balance sheet. During the quarter, we generated $1.9 billion of cash flow from operations, paid $858 million in dividends, and drew down a $1 billion term loan in connection with the closing of our $21 billion acquisition of Immunomedics.  For the year, we returned approximately 67% of free cash flow to our shareholders, consisting of $3.4 billion in dividends and $1.6 billion in share repurchases. We also repaid $1 billion of debt on January 1 of this year. Turning to our guidance for 2021. Our 2021 non-GAAP financial guidance is summarized on slides 18 and 19 in the earnings presentation available on our website. As always, our guidance is based on our current expectations for our business in 2021 and results may vary depending upon, among other things, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which remain unpredictable.  In addition, while our guidance reflects the impact of recent corporate development transactions and our planned acquisition of MYR, as well as funding for ordinary course partnering activities in 2021, our guidance does not factor in the possibility of any extraordinary business development costs or acquisitions or significant opt-ins that we may complete over the course of the coming year.  With that background, we expect that product sales excluding Veklury for 2021 will be in the range of $21.7 billion to $22.1 billion. Due to the uncertainty related to pandemic, we expect Veklury revenue to be in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion, which results in total product sales range of $23.7 billion to $25.1 billion.  As we've discussed over the past quarters, Veklury in many ways acts as a hedge against the potential impacts of the continued COVID-19 pandemic. This guidance reflects anticipated revenue growth of approximately 9% to 10%, excluding LOEs and Veklury, driven by growth from Biktarvy, Trodelvy, Vemlidy and our cell therapy franchise.  And while there remains uncertainty with the pandemic, we are making certain assumptions regarding the recovery and underlying market dynamics starting in the second quarter of 2021. As COVID-19 vaccinations accelerate, any delay with the vaccine rollouts or any significant reacceleration of the global pandemic could once again adversely impact our business. As a reminder, looking ahead to Q1, we anticipate total product sales excluding Veklury will decline by low single digit percentage, similar to what we've seen over the past three years. This is expected to be driven by customary US seasonal inventory patterns and buying patterns of public payers that negatively affect our payer mix in the first quarter.  In addition, unlike prior years, Q1 of 2021 will also be impacted by the recent loss of exclusivity of Atripla and Truvada in the United States. Despite this anticipated sequential decline in Q1 total product sales, we remain very confident in the health of our business as reflected in our guidance for the coming year.  Turning to our expectations for our product gross margins in 2021. Our non-GAAP product gross margins are expected to be in the range of 87% to 88% in 2021, consistent with our historic range.  With respect to our operating expenses in 2021, we expect that both non-GAAP R&D and non-GAAP SG&A expenses will see a flat to low single digit percentage decline through disciplined expense management, with flexibility to continue investing in our R&D pipeline and other strategic opportunities going forward.  This guidance includes the impact of our planned acquisition of MYR, as well as our allocation of approximately $350 million for future investments and ordinary course R&D collaborations.  In addition, our SG&A guidance reflects the expected impact in 2021 of our oncology build out and funding for a number of time-limited corporate initiatives related to information technology and data analytics. Our non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $11.5 billion to $12.9 billion in 2021. And our non GAAP effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 21%, which is higher than 2020, primarily due to a decrease in tax credits and settlements with tax authorities that reduced our 2020 tax rate.  Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.75 per share to $7.45 per share, driven by increased operational efficiencies as compared to 2020 and partially offset by the higher non-GAAP effective tax rate, along with greater projected interest expense and lower projected interest income as compared to 2020. Our balance sheet remains robust and our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. We remain focused on continuing to prioritize investment in our business and R&D pipeline, and maintaining a rigorous focus on disciplined expense management.  Finally, we continue to be committed to growing our dividend over time. And we are pleased to announce earlier today that we have increased our dividend by 4.4% for 2021.  Additionally, as we disclosed a few weeks ago, we plan to repay at least $4 billion of debt this year, including the $1 billion of debt we repaid at the beginning of this year. We also expect to repurchase shares to offset dilution from equity compensation plans.  I'll now turn the call over to Johanna. Johanna Mercier : Thanks, Andy. And good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin by taking you through some of the market dynamics we saw in the fourth quarter as we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact that it's had on our business.  As we entered the quarter in the US and around the world, the number of COVID-19 cases surged. This had two significant effects on our business. Recovery was dampened by our Hep C and HIV medications as people delayed visits to their health care providers. And the number of hospitalizations of patients with COVID-19 dramatically increased, leading to significant uptake of Veklury.  Driven by Veklury, we had robust growth in Q4, with a 13% increase in total product sales compared to the prior quarter. Excluding Veklury revenues, our business declined 4% amid the pandemic and loss of exclusivity for Atripla and Truvada in the US.  Overall, while we expect the pandemic to continue to cause near term uncertainty, we're confident in the strong underlying trends, which I'll highlight for you this afternoon, starting with HIV. We saw 3% growth in sales across our HIV franchise in 2020 compared with the prior year, despite the Atripla and Truvada LOE. Biktarvy continued to stand out in the HIV treatment market, growing 10% sequentially and 53% year-over-year. Biktarvy remains the number one prescribed regimen across key global markets, and in the US, where one in two new patients start on Biktarvy.  In PrEP, we ended the year with a 46% US market share for Descovy, exceeding our goal of 40% to 45%. As expected, we saw generic competitor enter the market in Q4, impacting Truvada revenues as we work to maintain strong commercial assets for Descovy. Going forward, we expect demand for PrEP to recover as the pandemic subsides, and we will stay competitive growing the business with the market. The generic competition and the surge in the pandemic led to a decline in Q4 HIV revenues of 6% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. In addition, in line with historical trends, we saw seasonal inventory build in Q4, which we expect to bleed out into Q1 of this year.  We're well positioned and confident in our leadership in HIV today and in the future. Biktarvy will continue to be a key growth driver as the go-to single tablet regimen for HIV treatment with patent protection extending to 2033 in the US, as well as the European Union.  We remain enthusiastic about the prospects of growing our leadership as we advance our long acting antiviral lenacapavir. Success in the long acting market will depend on having a product candidate with the right profile for patients. We believe lenacapavir has the potential to be that product. And Merdad will share more detail about its profile in his remarks.  Turning to Trodelvy, as Dan mentioned, we completed our acquisition of Immunomedics in October. During the quarter, Trodelvy recorded $64 million in sales, with $49 million of that revenue recognized by Gilead following the close of the acquisition, for a full year totaling $137 million in revenue. I'm impressed with the progress the teams have made launching the medication amid the pandemic. In its first eight months, Trodelvy has become the clear number one therapy in third line metastatic triple negative breast cancer. The breath of Trodelvy adoption and recognition of the product continues to grow. And we're now seeing unaided Trodelvy awareness of about 90% among physicians and academic institutions.  Our ambition is to achieve similar awareness numbers with community providers, which will be driven by the anticipated full FDA approval of Trodelvy for metastatic triple negative breast cancer and publication of the previously presented ASCENT data in the first half of 2021. We're also on track to complete the European filing in the first quarter of this year.  Specific to hepatitis, the COVID-19 surge impacted the recovery we saw in Q3 across our HDV franchise. Our HDV business showed 9% sequential decline impacted by the pandemic and timing of purchases in markets outside of the US. We continue to maintain anywhere between 50% and 60% market share across our core market, which we believe sets us well for recovery.  In HBV, we expect to continue to grow our business and anticipate sales exceeding $1 billion by 2022, driven by the US and Asia market. We're looking forward to closing the MYR acquisition which will bring Hepcludex to Gilead The medicine is a first in class and potentially best in class treatment for hepatitis D, or HDD, an orphan disease that has been historically under diagnosed and for which there were no approved treatment options prior to Hepcludex. HDD is the most severe form of viral hepatitis, and is associated with poor long term survival rates. We believe our experience in hepatitis and the operational synergies with respect to Gilead's existing field force in HPV will allow us to reach patients with HDD. Hepcludex already has conditional approval in Europe and remains an investigational agent in the US. Pending the close of the deal, we anticipate filing for US approval in the second half of this year. In closing, I just want to share a few remarks about Veklury. As Dan noted, Veklury remains an important treatment option for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We're seeing utilization rates of 50% to 60% among eligible patients in the US and are very proud of the role we played in helping patients during this challenging time.  As we've seen over the past year, predicting the trajectory of the pandemic has proven difficult, to say the least. We anticipate demand will continue to fluctuate as COVID-19 cases rise and fall. While we're encouraged by the progress that our industry has made with the introduction of vaccines, we expect Veklury will remain a critical tool for patients and physicians well into the future.  And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Merdad. Merdad Parsey : Thanks, Johanna. And good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to share with you some updates on our pipeline as we made tremendous progress in 2020, expanding and diversifying our portfolio across our therapeutic areas. We enter 2021 with a larger, more balanced clinical pipeline that gives us the opportunity to advance important new therapies aimed at addressing significant unmet medical needs now and in the future.  Through acquisitions, partnerships, and by advancing internal candidates, we grew our portfolio of projects by 50% last year, and I look forward to sharing more about that with you today.  I'll start with oncology. In 2020, we significantly enhanced our oncology portfolio that now has 27 internal clinical stage oncology programs aimed at patients with the greatest unmet medical needs.  At the center of our oncology portfolio is, of course, Trodelvy. As Dan and Joanna mentioned, we anticipate several key clinical milestones this year that will help us broaden Trodelvy's views and understand which patients are most likely to benefit.  With the accelerated approval for third line, metastatic, triple negative breast cancer in hand, we look forward to the anticipated full approval of Trodelvy for patients with metastatic third line triple negative breast cancers supported by the confirmatory Phase III ASCENT study.  You'll recall that these are really strong data. Despite having received a median of four prior anti-cancer regimens, patients treated with Trodelvy showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival, with a median survival of 12.1 months compared with 6.7 months for chemotherapy and a hazard ratio of 0.48. These data had been accepted for publication and we anticipate publication of these results in a peer-reviewed journal early this year. These data have set Trodelvy on the path to becoming the new standard of care for patients with third line metastatic triple negative breast cancer.  Additional data have demonstrated that Trodelvy has a potential to transform care for people with metastatic urothelial carcinoma, the most common form of bladder cancer. We've submitted an application for accelerated approval to the FDA and anticipate a decision in the first half of this year.  Next, we're looking to further expand Trodelvy for patients with hormone receptor positive HER2 negative breast cancer, which accounts for approximately 70% to 75% of all forms of breast cancer. And those study results are expected in the second half of the year. Beyond breast and bladder cancers, we're working quickly to explore other tumors with the goal of establishing the breadth of Trodelvy's activity. We'll continue to evaluate the role of HER2 expression in tumors along the way. One of the trials we're leveraging is a TROPiCS-03 basket study where we continue to enroll patients We plan to provide an update on this study, particularly non-small cell lung cancer, in the second half of this year. We are proceeding at risk with plans to start a randomized study in lung cancer in the second half of the year as well, pending for TROPICS-03 data. We expect to begin a substantial number of new studies with Trodelvy this year, adding to the four internal and 13 ongoing investigator-sponsored studies. Now moving on to magrolimab, we're rapidly advancing this program with the goal of helping patients with hematologic malignancies and exploring the role of CD-47 inhibition in the treatment of solid tumors. The first solid tumor studies are set to begin as early as this year.  We expect results from the Phase Ib study in MDS later this year, which will inform our ongoing discussions with the FDA. Pending these data, we could potentially file for accelerated approval.  In addition, we've begun enrolling patients in the Phase III ENHANCE study intended to support full approval and to confirm the Phase Ib data. Moving to Kite, we're very pleased with the progress of our colleagues at Kite that has been made with the company's cell therapy medicines, bringing Yescarta and Tecartus to new diseases and to patients earlier in their treatment.  In addition to the second line DLBCL data that Dan mentioned that are expected in the first half of this year, we filed for approval to expand the use of Yescarta to patients with indolent NHL. If approved, this would be the first CAR T therapy for patients with this form of lymphoma.  We're also excited about the emerging data from our partnerships, including Arcus anti-TIGIT and CD-73 inhibitor programs, as well as our collaborations with Pioneer and Tizona to name a few.  Taken in total, these agreements in both oncology and other therapeutic areas allow us to expand the breadth of our portfolio with access to cutting edge research programs in a way that manages the risk of our internal portfolio. We've intentionally constructed a pipeline with a large number of programs in Phase I and fewer derisk programs in Phases II and III, with the goal of creating a long-term sustainable productive pipeline to fuel our future.  Turning the HIV, I want to echo Johanna's comments about the impact once a week Biktarvy has for people living with HIV. At the same time, we recognize some individuals prefer less frequent long-acting regiments. We are excited about the potential of long-acting antivirals and believe that our capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir, has a number of attributes that have important possibilities for both treatment and prevention.  Beginning with treatment, people living with HIV tell us that either a weekly oral regimen or a subcutaneous injection every three to six months are preferred regimens. As we look at how we'll combine lenacapavir with other agents, the potential dosing flexibility of lenacapavir offers possibilities to explore in clinical research, both oral and subcutaneous administration.  We expect to identify an internally developed agent or an external partner for lenacapavir to move into combination trials over the next 12 to 18 months. This will complement our first lenacapavir FDA filing expected in the second half of this year for use in heavily treatment experienced individuals with HIV.  Turning to prevention, we also believe there are many people for whom subcutaneous injection possibly as infrequently as once every six months could provide a significant advantage. I'm pleased to share that we'll begin Phase III studies this year with lenacapavir as monotherapy for the prevention of HIV. We're planning two Phase III studies.  The first will be in cisgender men, transgender women and men, and gender non-binary people who have sex with men. That will begin in the first half of 2021. The second is in adolescent girls and young women, and that'll begin in the second half of 2021.  Finally, I want to close with some commentary on Veklury and our ongoing commitment to patients amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Like so many others, we're encouraged to see the progress with the approval of the first vaccines and induction of other therapeutics. Veklury continues to be a critical tool for patients and physicians in the fight against COVID-19.  Clinical data from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled NIAID ACTT-1 trial has established the efficacy and safety of remdesivir. The Gilead-sponsored simple studies and real world patient and physician experience continue to support the critical role of Veklury as a standard of care in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.  Veklury is the only antiviral medicine that has been approved or granted temporary authorization for the treatment of COVID-19 in approximately 50 countries worldwide. We welcome the addition of new medicines that are helping to ease the burden and we'll continue to work to understand how best to use Veklury and how to advance the use of Veklury in additional settings and formulations, with the goal of treating additional patients who may benefit. As Dan shared with you, you can expect to hear from us often as we look ahead toward a number of exciting milestones. A growing pipeline means we hope to have more data to share and more news about regulatory filings.  We're focused on delivering important transformative therapies to improve care for people with serious illnesses, and I look forward to discussing the expansion of Trodelvy, magrolimab data, the lenacapavir milestones and the initiation of key Phase III trials over the course of the year.  Now, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Michael Yee : Congrats on a great year. My question is maybe for Andy or Dan. When you think about the various uncertainties about growth that I think has been a bit of a controversy for Gilead and a little bit muddied for Veklury recently, do you think about 2021 as a growth year into 2022? And put another way, do you think that this is a trough period and you're very confident about growth off this year? Thank you so much. Daniel O'Day: I'll start and then add Andy to provide a bit. Look, I think you heard us at JP Morgan. I think we reiterate our confidence that the next chapter of Gilead is here and that we are very confident in our ability to grow the business in the top and bottom line, excluding Veklury. It doesn't belie \u2013 our confidence in Veklury exists, but of course \u2013 and we're seeing it track, obviously, very well with hospitalizations. But we also want to have, and we want you to have confidence in our ability to grow the underlying business, excluding Veklury. So, yes, we're committed to that. Yeah, I think you see that in the guidance that we delivered here today for 2021. And we're committed \u2013 and that's despite the fact that we are offsetting significant amount of generic erosion with Atripla and Truvada. So, obviously, as we head into 2022 and beyond, we don't have that headwind as well.  So, I would pass it over to Andy for some additional comments as well from your side, Andy. Andrew Dickinson : The simple answer to your question is yes. I think that we do see this as a really important year where we said at JP Morgan, picking up on Dan's points, we expect to grow in the short term, the medium term, and the long run from here, and we think we have all the puzzle pieces together that will allow us to do that.  Our guidance, and you see in some of the pages that we tried to help people think through the core business and the materials that we posted, and I would emphasize and focus people on the 9% to 10% growth in the core business excluding the impact of the LOEs. So, we're going to grow through the LOEs, and then we think we should have some additional momentum coming out of 2021 into the subsequent years. And we also have a very capital-efficient and efficient corporate model, as you know, Michael. So, when you talk about kind of bottom-line growth, we see a lot of potential for leverage as we're driving top line growth to really expand the EPS growth over the coming years as well. So, we're excited about where we are and where we're going and look forward to updating you throughout the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : A two part on lenacapavir for me. One, can you talk a little bit in detail about what internal combinations you might be pursuing in terms of mechanisms and how you might be able to give us some idea around when we might see some initial data on those. And second, can you just talk about the dosing frequency that you're going to be pursuing in the monotherapy studies? Are you going to look at six months only or are you going to look at other frequencies for the PrEP study? Thanks. Daniel O'Day: I'm going to hand it over to Merdad, obviously, but just a couple of points to kind of frame this. I think there are two points I want to make. One is, Gilead has prided itself on making sure we really understand what patients need out there every step of the way for the past couple of decades, which led us obviously to the robustness around Biktarvy as really the standard of care in the treatment setting and Descovy. And we also pursue a philosophy of having an anchor molecule. And what we're really excited about with capsid is this presents the opportunity for a true anchor molecule for long acting that meets patients' needs, the types of needs that we think are really going to move, potentially move some of the patients from a very convenient one from once a day to a less frequent dosing. So, I remind you that we've got lots of options with lenacapavir. And I'll turn it over to Merdad to go through some of those. Over to you, Merdad. Merdad Parsey : To your point, we haven't talked too much about it. Look, we have a number of internal assets that we can combine with lenacapavir, given that lenacapavir is a capsid inhibitor and gives us a lot of flexibility to look for what the second component could be there. So, ranging from things like bictegravir and TAF to other things in our pipeline , we believe those can all internally form part of a combination regimen going forward. We would anticipate that we'll start doing Phase I studies this year, and then data will follow from that in terms of which combination partner we would choose.  On the second part of your question whether we would look only at six months, I would say it's important to think about lenacapavir both having oral and subcutaneous approaches. So, on the oral side, we think we can dose orally about once a week. And so, that could form one regimen that we would approach to go for a once-weekly oral regimen. For subcu, it'll partly depend on what the combination molecule would be and what dosing interval we can get with that. We'd certainly like to target six months, but if necessary, we can go to every three months or something like that, so it'll really depend on what the partner is. The key issue here is that we have a lot of flexibility with lenacapavir, and it gives us a lot of options to sort of see how we can work, and that's where we're going to go.  And the last thing I'd say is for PrEP, the studies I mentioned, the ones that are getting started are going to be every six months. So, that is the regimen we're using for PrEP. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young from Cantor. Alethia Young : Congrats on everything that you've done over the past 12 months. I kind of wanted to stay with lenacapavir a little bit. And it seems like there's a robust backbone potential. And I guess I want to get your perspective on the potential opportunity to grow the market from where you are since you could possibly use it in both treatment and prevention or do you kind of see it more like an opportunity for switches? And if so, like, what drugs do you think Biktarvy switches are a potentially likely thing? Thanks. Daniel O'Day: Johanna and her team have done a lot of work on it. So, I'll let her start and see if anybody else in the team wants to add. Over to you, Johanna. Johanna Mercier : I think the way we're looking at it, and I'll start with actually the first filing, right, which is heavily treatment experienced, which is expected to file towards the end of this year. I think that one for us was really an opportunity to go into the market, fast opportunity to get physician experience with lenacapavir and kind of create that foundation for lena.  I would split up the question between treatment and PrEP. I think in treatment, the expectation is the market will continue to grow at the 2%, 3% that we've been seeing year-over-year. And so, I think it'll be little bit of a switch from oral to long acting within the treatment. I think the real opportunity for expansion with long acting will be in the prevention market. We've said before that we've only scratched the surface at about 20%, 25% of the total market today in prevention with Truvada and Descovy. I think the opportunity really is to expand that market with long actings that would make it much more flexible for folks, people at risk of HIV. And so, I think that's a true expansion strategy, but more intervention than in treatment. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets. Brian Abrahams : Congrats on all the progress. I'm interested in learning more about the upside and use you might expect in Yescarta with the DLBCL second line readout. And I guess I'm curious, how much of any current hurdles are related to complexity of administration and pandemic versus the labeled indication and available data. And when you do get the ZUMA-7 data, what are some of the pushes and pulls with respect to efficacy and safety that would guide how you'd look at the future growth opportunity in CAR T? Thanks. Daniel O'Day: We're very enthusiastic about the potential for Yescarta and obviously the second line readout. And Christi is on the line. So, I'll let her break down the different pieces of that for you between COVID and non-COVID some of the dynamics. So, over to you, Christi. Christi Shaw : Overall, from a cell therapy performance, we grew 33% year-over-year. As you look at Yescarta, it's growing externally, outside the US, in what we call ACE, which is Europe, Canada and Australia. Also in the US, Tecartus is growing significantly above our expectations. The dynamic in the US for Yescarta is a couple fold. As we saw with our other CAR T therapies on the market, the class overall has declined from 23% to 20%, which is significant in Q4. And the reason for that is referrals are down because of COVID, obviously, and that's driving the majority of it and also a lack of ICU beds. The lack of ICU beds does disproportionately affect Yescarta because majority of our sales are in the inpatient sites.  So, as we look at what specifically, not just COVID overall, but you dig down to under what is COVID, you have the referral aspect when the community physicians aren't seeing patients, patients aren't going into the offices and then you also have, at the ATC, the issue of ICU bed capacity, and where else can you treat those patients? So, overall, the biggest driver is the class share decline. And secondarily is a little bit of the product sales baseline, the ICU beds. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink. Geoffrey Porges : Just have some slightly housekeeping questions. First, Andy, could just give us a sense of what your share count guidance is for 2021? Secondly, Merdad, could you tell us whether you're seeing any remdesivir resistant variants emerging and indeed whether remdesivir is active against these variants that have been identified already? And then lastly, perhaps Dan could tell us why shouldn't we look at the buy-in to Arcus as a positive indicator for your expectations for one of the upcoming readouts? Why would you have done that if you weren't positively inclined to those events? Daniel O'Day: Andy, why don't you start. Merdad and I'll bring us home. Andrew Dickinson : On the share count, we're assuming a flat share count year-over-year. So, to be clear, the EPS guidance is not being driven by share buybacks or share counts. Our base assumption is that we will just do repurchases to offset employee stock issuance over the year. We maintain, obviously, the flexibility to opportunistically repurchase more shares if we conclude over the year that that's a good use of our capital. But right now, the base case is that we will just repurchase shares to offset employee share issuance. Merdad Parsey : Just to follow up on your question on resistance, as you know, most of the variants that have popped up are in the spike protein. And that's been the source of the problem, which is why people are talking about sort of the vaccine issues and potentially the monoclonal antibodies because they're directed at the spike. But remdesivir targets the RNA polymerase.  So, for the RNA polymerase, we haven't seen so far mutants that would impact the efficacy of remdesivir at least when we're looking at the sequences. So far, knock wood, we haven't seen anything. Geoffrey Porges : Can I just follow-up? Have you sequenced any individuals who've failed remdesivir to see if there's any resistance in the virus? Merdad Parsey : We have not to my knowledge. Daniel O'Day: And, Geoff, just bringing us home, I think you asked a bit of a double negative question. Let me put it into a positive. I think you can read into our continued investment in Arcus as us viewing the entirety of their portfolio as attractive, right? Not any one asset. But I'll just mention a couple. Of course, in the TIGIT space, there are potentially two different mechanisms, as you know, both an FC and a non-FC receptor. There's a variety of adenosine programs. There's the PERIOD-1. And there's a variety of earlier stage programs. So I think you're absolutely right to see that additional investment as an additional confidence in the science and frankly the people at Arcus. And we're very, very pleased with the way we're cooperating and collaborating. Couldn't be more seamless. And the opportunity I think to think of [technical difficulty]/  I was just going to emphasize, in addition to the Arcus portfolio, the combination potential with our other agents, we're really excited about the potential to think about two, possibly three drug combinations between what we have within our Gilead portfolio today, the Arcus portfolio and other options that we have now and in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Truist. Robyn Karnauskas : Two ones. One on Arcus and ARC-7, obviously, if the triple works, that's game changing. You're one of the few companies that has the triple. And I was just thinking about the amount of trials you might want to begin at that point. So like, talk to me a little bit about how you're thinking about margins and maintaining margins with so many trials that you might want to begin and the robustness of that. And then also talk to me about, do you have a perspective on the likelihood of the combination, a triple combination working versus the doublet because other people have the doublet. So, I'm just getting your perspective on the confidence you have, and then also on thinking about all these trials that you may want to begin, and if you can maintain some sort of \u2013 give us some sense of margins and R&D expense going in the out years. Thanks. Andrew Dickinson : It's Andy. Let me start with \u2013 we lost Dave again. Sorry. Let me start with the margin question. So, we're not providing longer term guidance, but we have flexibility in the way that we structured the deals as you know. So, until we opt in, the R&D expense is borne by Arcus, as with many of our partnerships. Obviously, we're planning for success and looking at our R&D expense in the future and making sure that we have the flexibility in our capital structure and otherwise to push these programs forward if the data supports it. And we have a lot of leverage in our models. So we, again, have very strong margins. At a high level, Robyn, what I'd say is we don't expect that any of the opt-ins unless we're really opting into all of the programs across the board that we have options on would fundamentally change our margin profile. And if they did, obviously, that would be in the short term, potentially a good problem to have. So, we're really comfortable with the structure that we have, where we are with our margins today, where we see them going. We like our R&D load today in terms of the amount of scale we've added to our R&D programs and our spend levels. You see that we're going to work very hard to manage our expenses thoughtfully with our team. So, from our vantage point, we're in a good spot.  Let me hand it over to Merdad on the clinical question. Merdad Parsey : It's a great observation. And I think one of the things we really appreciate about the team at Arcus is they're really focused on two things, with the TIGIT asset. In particular, one is to, to try to be as fast as possible, taking the appropriate kinds of risks to make sure that we are really in the hunt. And I think what's exciting there is a possibility to be potentially second to market with that asset. And secondly, to look at combinations within the portfolio to look for evidence of even better activity that could really position us uniquely out there. So, getting back to the earlier question about Arcus and our relationship, they're a very impressive group and have been doing great work. So, we're excited to see how those data play out. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Cory Kasimov : I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the latest trends you're seeing in the PrEP market today and how we should be thinking about that? Really thinking about Descovy going forward in the face of Truvada generics, especially given that it wasn't in your more granular sales guidance slide either up as a like a headwind or a tailwind? Johanna Mercier : As I mentioned, earlier, this year has been actually quite stable. So, what we've seen is really, with Truvada LOE, what we've seen is a little bit of mix within Truvada between branded and generic. But we haven't seen that impacted Descovy at all. On the contrary, it stayed strong at that level of share. And we expect that to continue to basically be anywhere between 40% and 45% or so throughout the year.  Having said that, we did see a little bit of a decline quarter over quarter, about 6% or so. And that was largely due to the contracting to maintain some commercial access. So, the one difference has been much more around \u2013 because it's TAP, because it's in prevention, it's highly commercially \u2013 commercial payers. And so therefore, we're really quite focused on just making sure that people at risk have access to Descovy in light of its strong profile and safety profile that it offers. And so, we've definitely seen erosion with Truvada, strong erosion in Q4. And that will continue as we think about coming quarters this year. But really, from a Descovy standpoint, the expectation is that we continue to maintain strong commercial access. And obviously, that might mean a little bit more contracting. So, a little bit more discount on that front. But one that's important for us to make sure that people living at risk have access to Descovy as we continue forward. So, hopefully, that kind of addresses your question on PrEP market. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer Raffat : I have two, if I may. First, perhaps on Trodelvy, I know there's the HR positive Phase III coming up in breast. And my question was that originally the protocol allowed for an interim ORR analysis to support an accelerated approval. I'm curious if that still happening in the first half.  And secondly, curious what the observations are to date from the inhaled remdesivir's Phase Ib in early COVID. And I'm mostly wondering, given the ongoing pandemic as well as given all the Phase III safety data, what if the Phase Ib data form the basis for a potential EUA along with the safety data that exists? Thank you very much. Merdad Parsey : So, on Trodelvy, you're right that there was a planned ORR. But we don't think that the ORR evaluation, the interim analysis was actually going to form substantive enough data to get an approval in HR positive. So what we did is we looked initially at the study as part of the evaluation together with the team in Immunomedics. We resized the study to power it appropriately for overall survival. And at the end of the year, we'll read out PFS, which we think has a much better opportunity for reading out and giving us a fileable endpoint. So, I think that was really the \u2013 our conclusion was essentially that the ORR was only just going to cost us alphabet, not really get us something that we could file with. And we have not unblinded any data. It was not based on anything other than wanting to get to the PFS.  So, on the inhaled remdesivir, it's going well. That study is moving through Phase I and has moved move forward nicely. And, no, the Phase I study is probably not adequate \u2013 not probably, it's not adequate for approval. When you move from parenteral to an inhaled approach, it's effectively moving it to a drug device combination approach. And so, all the issues there \u2013 a PK bridge is usually when you can show that the exposure is the same, but since the exposure will be very different systemically, it will be \u2013 primarily, the exposure will be in the lung. You can't do a bridging for PK. So, it ends up being a clinical efficacy question as opposed to just a PK question. So, the studies are designed to \u2013 will be designed to go forward with evidence of clinical efficacy for approval. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : I was just wondering if you can comment at all about breadth of prescribing with Trodelvy, what you're currently seeing out there, how you expect that to change over the course of the year. And then the randomized lung cancer trial that you mentioned, Merdad, would that be a Phase II or Phase III trial? And then just one for Andy on the expense cadence in 2021, what that looks like if you were to exclude kind of underlying remdesivir spend? Thank you. Johanna Mercier : I think we're really pleased to see the evolution of Trodelvy, right? It's only eight months in, so they haven't had a full year yet. And what we're seeing in 2020 is very encouraging. As of last October, more than one out of four patients were initiated on Trodelvy in third line metastatic triple negative breast cancer. What we also are seeing is, in December, when physicians were actually asked to report their own prescribing, so a little bit of an ATU type approach, they were suggesting somewhere north of 40% of their third line metastatic triple negative breast cancer patients were receiving Trodelvy. And so, we're seeing a nice uptake. I think we have an opportunity to continue that uptake as we think about expanding not only in the academic centers, but also with our community providers. And I think that's the opportunity as we think in the next little while. And I think that'll be driven mostly with the fact that we'll be able to promote the overall survival data soon with the FDA approval, the full approval for the ASCENT data and the publication. So, all of those things will be important inflection points for us as we move forward. But we're very excited as we see positions and really getting physician feedback around making sure that they can get through their second line options pretty quickly to get to third line and we have very strong payer support as well in reimbursement. So there's been no barriers on that front either. So good shape so far. I'll turn it over to Merdad on the lung cancer question. Merdad Parsey : Just to be clear, maybe I'll just say both. So, the study I was referencing that will read out for PFS is a hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative study. That is a Phase III study. For lung cancer, right now, it's a Phase I study, the TROPiCS-03 studies, a Phase I basket trial. And pending those data, we would \u2013 our plan is that we would open a Phase III trial in lung cancer in the second half of the year. Andrew Dickinson : Terrence, on your last question, we haven't provided specific expense guidance on any of our products. As you know, what we've said on remdesivir is that there still will be a meaningful amount of expenses in 2021, as you'd expect, but the expense load is lower than it was in 2020. And we're not providing more specific guidance, but it's real. It's important. We continue to see the significant potential for the product for patients. So, we're continuing to invest appropriately. And it is baked into our guidance, but it's a reduction year-over-year. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau from Cowen and Company. Phil Nadeau : Congrats on the progress. Just two follow up questions for me. First for Johanna on Descovy. You suggested that maybe there's a little price compression because of renegotiations with commercial plans with the availability of Truvada generic. As we're doing our modeling, should we expect another round of negotiations after more generics enter in Q2 and could that impact price in the second half of 2021? Merdad, a question for you on Trodelvy. Just to follow up on that Phase III lung cancer study. I believe this is the first time we've heard you're kind of committing to moving forward there. What gave rise to that? Is the data you're seeing from the basket study or something you saw at World Lung. And what do you need to see from TROPiCS-03 in order to stick with that plan? Thank you. Johanna Mercier : So exactly what you described. I think we're going to be very choiceful. And obviously, it needs to make sense. But there could be continued pressures. I think we've seen many of them. And we've been managing it as best we can to make sure that people living at risk do have access to Descovy as it really is quite differentiated.  I think as you think about your model for 2021, there's two pieces. One is, as you know, the market in prevention was quite depressed because of the pandemic. And we started to see us coming out of it in Q3. But of course, in Q4, with a surge of cases in hospitalization, we saw that dampening again. Assuming that we come back to some new normal this year, we should see that market pick up again. So between the market pickup, as well as some continued smaller price contractions, I think those two things will balance each other out quite nicely. Merdad Parsey : And then on the Trodelvy, so the way we're thinking about it is that \u2013 Phil, is that, as you know, the disclosed data from Immunomedics on lung have been promising. Because of the competitive situation right now with other molecules in lung, our own interest in lung, and the fact that we'll see additional data from tropics three, we are planning at risk to do a Phase III study. Now, that will depend entirely on how the data read out and the strength of the data. We may need to or want to adapt from there. But we want to be aggressive and make sure that we don't lose any advantage that we may have. So, we're just being aggressive based on our conviction on the molecule and MOA. Daniel O'Day: And it just leaves me to just say a few things at the end. I know I speak on behalf of the entire leadership team that we are clearly behind this next chapter of growth in Gilead. And it's here. And it's a variety of things. Of course, it's a clear path to growth in a sustainable and diverse portfolio. It's also the fact that we have a stable dividend that we're committed to growing over time with an industry leading dividend yield, consistently strong cash flow, robust balance sheet.  So, we're entering 2021 with confidence on this clear path to growth. And I think you'll see us deliver on our new opportunities in oncology and sustain our leadership in HIV. And we look forward to updating you every quarter on our progress throughout 2021. So, thank you all for joining. I'll let Andrew have the last word here. But I also want to make sure we thank all the colleagues at Gilead and our partners that made all this possible.  So, Andrew, over to you. Andrew Dickinson : Thank you to them. And thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and the team here looks forward to providing you with the updates on our future progress. Thanks again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jacquie Ross, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jacquie Ross : Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the first quarter of 2021. The press release, slides, and supplementary data are available on the investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today\u2019s call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day, our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier, our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey, and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we\u2019ll open up the call to Q&A, where the team will be joined by Christi Shaw, the Chief Executive Officer of Kite. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward\u2010looking statements, including those related to the impact of the COVID\u201019 pandemic on Gilead\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations; our plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, financial projections and the use of capital; and our 2021 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward\u2010looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward\u2010looking statements. Non\u2010GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company\u2019s underlying business performance. The GAAP to non\u2010GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, in our supplementary data sheet, as well as on the Gilead website. I will now turn the call over to Dan. Daniel O'Day: Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Before I hand over to the team to go into the details of our commercial, pipeline and financial results, I wanted to share our overall assessment of Gilead\u2019s first quarter. 2021 is a pivotal year for Gilead, and as you can see on Slide 4, we are off to a solid start. Our first quarter total product sales were in\u2010line with our internal expectations. While our core business was more impacted by COVID\u201019 than we anticipated, this was offset by higher Veklury sales. In the United States, one in two hospitalized patients are receiving Veklury, and worldwide Veklury continues to play a key role as a standard of care treatment for patients who are hospitalized with COVID\u201019. Given the desperate situation in India, Gilead has been working with the Indian government, health authorities and our voluntary licensees to increase supply of remdesivir and provide donated medicine. As the trajectory of the pandemic evolves globally, we will continue to invest in multiple clinical studies of Veklury, including alternative formulations. Earlier this month, we received two FDA approvals for Trodelvy. The full approval for metastatic triple negative breast cancer extended the label to second\u2010line plus patients. This means, Trodelvy could help many more patients, as there are more than double the number of patients in this category as there are in the third line setting. We also received accelerated approval in second\u2010line plus metastatic urothelial cancer. In March, we announced a new partnership to combine investigational lenacapavir with Merck\u2019s investigational islatravir for long\u2010acting HIV treatment, accelerating the path to the next wave of therapies. While many people living with HIV may prefer a daily regimen like Biktarvy, we believe that broadening their options to include weekly oral therapies and infrequent injections every three months or longer addresses a significant patient need, and sets up strong, sustainable HIV leadership into the late 2030s. Long\u2010acting formulations, such as lenacapavir as monotherapy, are also likely to unlock further PrEP usage and reach many more people at risk of HIV. We are also pleased with our progress in advancing lenacapavir in both treatment and prevention settings as part of our internal clinical development. This past quarter, we reported compelling long-acting efficacy data for lenacapavir in heavily treatment\u2010experienced people with multi\u2010drug resistant HIV. We are fully confident that lenacapavir will be the foundation for our long-acting HIV treatment and prevention portfolio. And while we advance lenacapavir, Biktarvy usage continues to grow, with one in two people living with HIV starting their treatment on Biktarvy in the U.S. In addition, Biktarvy is capturing one in two switches, and approximately, half of those are switching from a regimen that includes a non\u2010Gilead agent. In addition to securing regulatory approvals in oncology, we have already achieved several other pipeline milestones, including EMA validation of the Trodelvy MAA for metastatic triple\u2010negative breast cancer and submission of the supplemental biologics license application to FDA for Tecartus in relapse or refractory ALL. Building on the work we did last year, we continue with the disciplined prioritization of our pipeline across Gilead. To share one example, Kite completed an optimization exercise this past quarter, to ensure that resources are focused on the most promising opportunities to make a difference for patients. Finally, we're looking forward to a full-year of clinical news flow for Gilead. Our pipeline list for 2021 includes over 20 milestones across therapeutic areas. While they are all important steps in Gilead's journey to serve more patients and diversify our business, Slide 5 lists the most significant items, so you can track our progress more clearly. These include the Phase 3 TROPiCS-02 PFS readout for Trodelvy in hormone receptor positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer; Yescarta's Phase 3 ZUMA-7 readout for second-line DLBCL, which could result in an sBLA submission later this year; the Phase 3 readout for Hepcludex that could lead to BLA filing; ARC-2 Domvanalimab Phase 2 or seven interim readout in non-small cell lung cancer, which could inform an opt-in decision; Magrolimab's Phase 1b data readout in MDS, which could lead to a submission for accelerated approval later this year; and potential Phase 2 initiation of lenacapavir and islatravir as a long-acting oral HIV treatment in the second-half of 2021. Our aspirations for patients are bold and our pipeline offers diversity across indications and risk profiles. While execution will continue to be a focus, these milestones give us a great deal of optimism about the future and our ability to deliver therapies that make a meaningful difference for patients. Before I hand off, I want to take a moment to thank Dr. Bill Lee, who is retiring from his role as Executive Vice President of Research after 30 years at Gilead. On behalf of all of us, I want to offer my sincere gratitude to Bill for his outstanding contributions that have helped to benefit millions of patients around the world. I would also like to welcome Dr. Flavius Martin, who joined Gilead as the new EVP of Research on April 12. Flavius has an impressive track record in overseeing industry-leading research and advancing new therapeutic candidates. With that, I'll invite Johanna to update you on our commercial operations in the first quarter. Johanna Mercier : Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting on Slide 7, it was a solid quarter of execution for the commercial team with total product revenue of $6.3 billion, up 16% from the first quarter of last year. This was in line with our internal expectations as Veklury sales offset a more substantial pandemic-related impact on our core business than we had anticipated. Excluding Veklury, total product revenue was $4.9 billion, reflecting inventory and pricing seasonality the anticipated HIV loss of exclusivity in the U.S., and ongoing pandemic-related dynamics in HIV and HCV. Moving to HIV on Slide 8. Revenue was down sequentially as expected, primarily due to seasonal trends. As a reminder, two things happen every year to our HIV business that contribute to a sequential decline from Q4 to Q1. First, the channel builds inventory in the fourth quarter then draws it down in Q1. In the first quarter of 2021, this inventory impact contributed an estimated $410 million to the sequential decline. Second, we've realized lower net HIV prices in the first quarter, due to items such as increased co-pay support and Part D discounts, which tend to normalize throughout the rest of the year. This quarter, we had two additional impacts. A year-over-year decline of $335 million in Truvada NHFR revenue associated with LOEs in the US. And a difficult comparison in the first quarter of 2020 given the pandemic-related HIV stocking we saw in March of 2020, as well as the impact of the pandemic on HIV market demand. Our focus is on share-driven by demand. Overall, three and four people living with HIV initiate or switch to Gilead products, highlighting the strength in demand for our life-changing medicines. While the pandemic dampened market size and switched volumes, we maintain share in line with prior quarters across our total HIV portfolio despite generic erosion. In terms of product lines, Biktarvy was up 8% year-over-year, but down sequentially as expected driven by seasonal inventory and pricing dynamics. Despite the pandemic impact on the new starts and switch volume in HIV, demand fundamental for Biktarvy remains strong, with five share point growth compared to the same time last year and two share point growth just in the last quarter in the United States. As Dan mentioned earlier, one out of two people living with HIV initiating or switching therapy is prescribed Biktarvy. Further, nearly half of Biktarvy switches come from incremental sources. Descovy revenue was down sequentially and year-over-year largely driven by seasonal inventory and pricing dynamics. Although, PrEP volume continues to be impacted by the pandemic, Descovy share remains stable around 45% and positions us well as the PrEP market recovers post\u2010pandemic. Moving to Slide 9, HCV first quarter revenue was $510 million. We continue to maintain a leading share of about 60% in the US and 50% in Europe. Despite COVID continuing to impact patient starts, we did see a very modest sequential improvement overall in patient volume, although it remains depressed versus pre\u2010COVID levels. HCV also benefited from a pricing adjustment in France. As shown on Slide 10, in Q1, HBV and HDV sales totaled $220 million with HBV sales of $214 million, growing 15% year\u2010over\u2010year, driven by strong Vemlidy demand, most notably in China and in the US. We continue to expect the HBV franchise sales to reach $1 billion by full year 2022. With the completion of the MYR acquisition during the first quarter, our portfolio now includes Hepcludex. There are currently no available treatments for HDV, making Hepcludex, which has received conditional approval by the EMA, a first\u2010in\u2010class treatment. This innovative drug blocks viral entry into liver cells. We are targeting a BLA submission later this year, and are excited by the opportunity to make Hepcludex more broadly available and address the unmet need for people who are infected with HDV. Moving to Slide 11, Trodelvy delivered $72 million in its first full quarter as part of the Gilead portfolio. In a span of just three weeks this month, Trodelvy received FDA full approval for second\u2010line plus metastatic triple negative breast cancer, received accelerated approval in second\u2010line plus metastatic urothelial cancer, and had its ASCENT Phase III data published in The New England Journal of Medicine just a week ago. We can now leverage treatment efficacy data from the full trial population in our discussions with physicians, and build even greater confidence to consider this potentially transformative therapy. This more than doubles the patient population, extending our reach to 6,000 second line metastatic TNBC patients in the US, in addition to over 4,000 patients in the third\u2010line plus population. Given the poor prognosis and difficulty in treating both second and third line metastatic TNBC patients, Trodelvy could extend median overall survival by almost a year while also nearly tripling the median progression free survival compared to chemotherapy. Outside the US, we submitted the TNBC Marketing Authorization Application based on the ASCENT Phase III clinical study for an accelerated review process. We look forward to continuing discussions with the European Medicines Agency and anticipate approval as early as December of this year. Additionally, Trodelvy is under review for TNBC in the UK, Canada, Switzerland, and Australia as part of Project Orbis. On Slide 12, Christi is on the call to answer your questions shortly, but you can see that our Cell Therapy business had a strong quarter, with revenue of $191 million, up 36% from the same quarter last year, driven by growing adoption of Yescarta in Europe, with our industry\u2010leading four\u2010year 44% overall survival. The recent approval for Yescarta in follicular lymphoma will broaden our addressable patient population and support our ongoing growth. Tecartus continues to see strong launch demand as physicians and patients adopt the first and only cell therapy approved for relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. Moving to Veklury on Slide 13, first quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, with demand tracking hospitalization rates. Although we saw lower hospitalization rates and increasing vaccination rates in certain parts of the world, overall progress was more gradual than expected over the first quarter and as such, we are now assuming a slower pandemic\u2010recovery for the second quarter. As the pace of recovery builds momentum in the second half of the year, this should contribute to a modest recovery in patient starts for our HCV and HIV franchises. We will continue to play our part to support broader access for eligible patients in need of remdesivir. We are working with our voluntary licensees to accelerate production capacity for India, while also donating 450,000 vials of Veklury to help patients as the supply of licensed generics increases. Our thoughts are with those who continue to tackle the worst of this pandemic. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Merdad. Merdad Parsey : Thank you, Johanna. As both Dan and Johanna mentioned, we are off to a solid start in a catalyst heavy 2021, and my comments today will focus on the nearer\u2010term events and changes to our pipeline. A comprehensive update on our broader pipeline is included in the appendix of the slide deck available on our IR website. I\u2019ll start with our virology pipeline. We remain as focused as ever on driving innovation in HIV therapies, and there are no changes to the expected timelines associated with our lenacapavir programs. In HIV prevention, we are activating sites for our first Phase III study for lenacapavir as monotherapy for the prevention of HIV and will begin screening patients later this quarter. This study will focus on preventing infection in cisgender men, transgender women and men, and gender non\u2010binary people who have sex with men. In the second half of 2021, we plan to initiate a study looking at lenacapavir for the prevention of HIV infections in adolescent girls and young women. In treatment, we presented additional data from Phase II/III CAPELLA trial for lenacapavir at CROI and we continue to expect our first lenacapavir filing for use with other anti-retrovirals and heavily treatment experienced individuals in the second half of this year. We anticipate data later this year from the Phase 2 CALIBRATE study in the treatment-naive population to support a virologically suppressed indication. And we plan to launch a Phase 2 trial for a long-acting oral treatment combination of Gilead's lenacapavir and Merck's islatravir in the second half of this year. Both medicines have shown long half-lives and high potency at low doses. As such, we believe that the lenacapavir plus islatravir combination is promising and we're excited by our new partnership and working with our colleagues at Merck to bring the maximum benefit possible to people living with HIV. Based on our commitment to HIV, we continue to work towards a potential cure. We have several early-stage programs evaluating combinations to understand the biology and identify path for this important mission. Leveraging our internal expertise as well as external partnerships, including Aelix and Gritstone. On Slide 16, moving on to the oncology pipeline, which has over 20 internal clinical stage programs, including many built around Trodelvy. We're excited to have received full FDA approval of Trodelvy in second-line plus metastatic triple-negative breast cancer based on the confirmatory Phase 3 ASCENT trial data. In the US alone this indication expands upon the accelerated approval for third line metastatic triple negative breast cancer to now include second-line patients, who've had at least one prior treatment for metastatic disease. Trodelvy has the potential to significantly improve overall survival and progression-free survival outcomes for patients. In the US, there's a population of 10,000 patients who may benefit from Trodelvy. We also received FDA accelerated approval for second-line metastatic urothelial carcinoma based on positive data from the Phase 2 TROPHY study. With almost one-third of patients responding to treatment and the 7.2-month median duration of response, Trodelvy offers a much-needed new treatment option for the many patients with metastatic urothelial cancer, whose disease continues to progress despite receiving available first and second-line treatment. In the US alone, we estimate there are roughly 8,000 addressable patients. 2021 will continue to be an exciting year for Trodelvy, and there have been no changes to the 2021 timelines we shared previously. We submitted the MAA to the EMA for Trodelvy in second-line plus metastatic TNBC in March, and it's now under accelerated review. We continue to target EU approval in the second half of this year. Later this year, we anticipate a Phase 3 TROPiCS\u201002 progression free survival readout for hormone receptor positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Pending data, we'll evaluate and determine the appropriate next steps from a regulatory standpoint. We estimate there are roughly 17,000 patients in the US who could benefit from Trodelvy in this setting. We're now actively recruiting additional patients for the Phase 2 TROPiCS-03 basket study in solid tumors to expand eligibility to patients regardless of TROPiCS-02 expression. We've already decided to initiate a Phase 3 trial in non-small cell lung cancer in the second half of this year, and we'll share updates on additional plan studies later this year. Moving on to cell therapy on Slide 17. With FDA's accelerated approval of the Yescarta for patients with third-line plus follicular lymphoma in March, we now have added a third indication for the Kite portfolio. ZUMA-5 study data showed the 91% of patients responded to a single infusion with an estimated 74% of patients in continued remission at 18 months. We're working towards making this option available to patients outside the US and continue to target an MAA filing in the next several months. There are no changes to the expected timelines for the ZUMA-7 study assessing Yescarta for the second-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or DLBCL patients. We expect to announce the top-line Phase 3 outcome later this quarter, followed by sBLA and MAA submissions in the second half of the year. Additionally, the FDA has approved the inclusion of the ZUMA-1 Cohort 4s updated safety data into Yescarta's label for third-line DLBCL. Cohort 4 demonstrated that early use of corticosteroids and/or tocilizumab led to reductions in cytokine release syndrome or neurological events. Moving on to Tecartus, we submitted our sBLA for relapsed or refractory adult B-cell precursor, acute lymphocytic leukemia or ALL just after the end of the first quarter. If approved, Tecartus would add a much-needed treatment option for patients 18 and older. We plan to share the ZUMA-3 data at ASCO this summer and we continue to enroll patients for ZUMA-4 to evaluate Tecartus for ALL in the pediatric population. Consistent with our ongoing diligence across both Gilead and Kite, we will continue to focus and streamline the Kite portfolio to align with our key strategic priorities and expertise in hematologic malignancies, specifically lymphoma and leukemia. Moving on to Slide 18. In addition to the previously mentioned milestones for virology Trodelvy and Kite, we have several other notable upcoming events. First, I want to take a moment to highlight magrolimab's progress and outlook in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. In MDS, we expect to see Phase 1b data in the second half of this year, pending results those data could lead to a BLA submission before the end of the year. If approved, magrolimab will be the first-in-class macrophage checkpoint inhibitor targeting CD47 and Gilead's first run frontline oncology indication. There's a significant unmet need for MDS with no new treatments approved in 14 years, despite 15,000 new patients diagnosed each year in the US alone. We're also exploring pivotal studies in frontline AML. Additionally, we continue to evaluate multiple solid tumor indications for magrolimab most recently initiating a Phase Ib/II second-line plus solid tumor basket study and a randomized Phase II study for head and neck cancer in combination with chemotherapy and Merck's KEYTRUDA. Second in Virology, we're thrilled to officially add Hepcludex into our portfolio and look forward to Phase III data readout later this quarter with the potential for a BLA filing in the second half of the year. As for potential opt-in programs Arcus' ARC-7 non-small cell lung cancer study is expected to evaluate an interim data in the second quarter. We and the Arcus team have indicated that the interim analysis is targeting an ORR of 50% or greater and a clear separation in ORR from the Zimberelimab monotherapy arm when compared to the Domvanalimab plus Zimberelimab combination arm. Last on Slide 19, you can see our robust and diversified pipeline across oncology virology and inflammation. In addition to the readouts on the previous slide we have multiple collaboration programs that we're monitoring closely including Arcus' eight -- ARC-8 study in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and ARC-6 study for castration-resistant prostate cancer expect -- both of which expect initial readouts later this year. And the Galapagos 623 Toledo proof-of-concept trials across psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and RA are expected to have readouts later this year. In closing, we're pleased to see how our portfolio has grown from about 30 clinical stage programs two years ago to 47 today, while maintaining our focus on disciplined management of R&D expenses. We've also gone from six molecules approved filed or in registrational studies to 15. Our teams have worked tirelessly to continuously evaluate and accelerate priority programs. We're thrilled to see how our portfolio is developing. And we look forward to accelerating innovation to help transform patient care. With that I'd like to hand the call over to Andy. Andrew Dickinson : Thank you Merdad and good afternoon everyone. As you can see we are building momentum in our clinical pipeline and we expect to have plenty of data to share as we move through the rest of 2021. Moving to Slide 21. The first quarter was a good start to the year with total product sales in line with our internal expectations overall as modestly higher Veklury sales offset a slower pandemic-related recovery than we had anticipated. In addition to pandemic impacts, our HIV business reflected the inventory seasonality we typically see in the first quarter. Total product sales were $6.3 billion up 16% year-over-year driven primarily by Veklury. The first quarter reflects continued growth from Biktarvy, our first full quarter of Trodelvy sales and strong growth in HBV as well as cell therapy. This growth was offset by ongoing COVID-related softness across our business in addition to the Truvada and Atripla LOEs. As also indicated by Johanna, there is the difficult comparison to the first quarter of 2020 given the pandemic-related HIV stocking observed last year. As a result total product sales excluding Veklury were $4.9 billion down 11% year-over-year. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 86.5%, 60 basis points lower year-over-year primarily associated with product mix and a small inventory charge partially offset by favorable royalty adjustments. Non-GAAP R&D was $1 billion, up 4% year-over-year primarily driven by investment in new pipeline products including Trodelvy and magrolimab offset by timing of certain clinical studies and lower Veklury-related expenses. Non-GAAP SG&A was also $1 billion, down 4% from Q1 2020 due to timing of grants and sales and marketing activities. This was partially offset by higher commercialization investments associated with Veklury, Trodelvy cell therapy and HBV and HIV in China. Moving to tax. We realized a lower rate of 18% for the quarter due to recognition of favorable settlements with tax authorities. Overall our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.08 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $1.68 for the same period last year. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to Veklury revenues, flat operating expenses and a lower tax rate offset in part by lower interest income. You can see on Slide 22 that there is no change to our full year non-GAAP guidance. While the pandemic remains unpredictable and as we realized a more substantial impact to our core business in the first quarter than we had anticipated, we are nonetheless encouraged by the lower hospitalization rates and increased vaccinations. We have modified our assumptions on the timing of pandemic recovery to allow a more gradual improvement starting in the second quarter. We continue to expect total product sales excluding Veklury of $21.7 billion to $22.1 billion. We continue to expect full year non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses each to be flat to down low single-digit percentages year-over-year. Given our first quarter results, you can see our R&D expenses are somewhat back-end loaded in 2021 based on the timing of clinical activities which include the anticipated initiation of the solid tumor study with magrolimab advancing internal long-acting combinations with lenacapavir for the treatment of HIV and other pipeline activities. Our work with Merck on a long-acting treatment regimen for people living with HIV is also underway and will ramp-up during 2021, although, we are able to absorb this program into our current R&D expense guidance. In SG&A, we are ramping up sales and marketing to support efforts such as the ongoing and expected launches of Trodelvy in the U.S. for bladder cancer and in Europe for triple-negative breast cancer. Additionally, we expect to start seeing higher travel and other costs scale-up in the second half of the year, as social distancing restrictions lighten-up in some geographies. Despite the lighter expenses in the first quarter, we're leaving our operating expense guidance unchanged, as we expect to catch up on this to some extent later in the year. And for now, retain the flexibility to manage the timing of clinical and commercial investments. We continue to expect our non-GAAP tax-rate to be 21% for the year. While we are carefully monitoring the discussions on a higher corporate tax-rate here in the United States, we believe any impact is more likely in 2022 and beyond, although, of course, a more immediate change could alter our current-tax guidance. Finally, with no changes to our revenue or operating expense guidance we continue to expect non-GAAP diluted EPS of $6.75 to $7.45 for the year. We have updated our GAAP diluted EPS guidance and now expect to be in the range of $4.75 to $5.45, down from $5.25 to $5.95, reflecting fair value losses for our equity holdings in the first quarter, donation expenses and other pre-tax charges including upfront payments related to collaboration. On Slide 23, you can see that we remain diligent in our capital allocation priorities. Already this year, we have repaid $1.25 billion in debt. And we're on track to pay down at least $4 billion in total by the end of the year. We have also returned $1.2 billion to shareholders, through dividends and repurchase of shares. To close, we remain committed to delivering for patients and for shareholders, as we look to invest in our business and R&D pipeline, while paying close attention to our expenses. With that, I'll hand the call back to Dan for a few closing comments. Dan? Daniel O'Day: Thanks Andy. And before we open-up for questions, I'd like to thank the broadly Gilead team, who accomplished a great deal in the first quarter, setting the stage I think for quite an exciting year reaching catalysts across our clinical portfolio. Of course, Gilead would not be the company it is today without the vision of John Martin, Gilead's Chief Executive Officer for 20 years, who passed away in March. Under his leadership, Gilead transformed the treatment of HIV and viral hepatitis and became a global organization, firmly rooted in its commitment to science and to patients. That commitment will be a constant, as we work to take John's legacy forward in Gilead's next chapter. With that, I'll invite the operator to begin the Q&A. Question-and: Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Brian Abrahams : Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. It looks like you're seeing steady growth in adoption of Trodelvy. So I'm just wondering, how should we think about the potential for a near-term inflection and update, now that you'd have full approval in triple-negative, the publication out and label expansion into urothelial? And I'm curious, are you starting to see some pull through. And where do you stand with respect to community physician awareness? How important is that as well for adoption? Thanks. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Brian. Johanna, please. Johanna Mercier : Sure. Thanks, Brian, for the question. And we're really excited with the recent news that we got with Trodelvy. It's really going to help us gain momentum, exactly what you said. We have strong awareness in academic centers above 80%. We haven't been able to break through. We're only at about 50% or so in the community. And as you well know, if three quarters of the patients sit in the community, that's an incredible opportunity for us to make sure that we make sure the messages come across. We haven't been in a position in the past to promote overall survival, in light of the fact that we just had that conditional approval. And so now, with the full approval not only do we get to double the patient population that Trodelvy can actually help, but actually we also get to promote the overall survival, which is the only agent with overall survival in this setting. So I think it's really going to help us ramp-up. And the focus is still going to be despite the urothelial bladder indication. We -- the focus is really going to be more like a 90-10, 90% on second-line plus, triple-negative breast cancer and then 10% from a promotional standpoint on urothelial cancer. We believe that that's going to work well, because there's a high overlap. There's about 70% of physicians that overlap from bladder cancer and also treat TNBC. So we're going to be in good shape to ramp this up. This is really the opportunity for Trodelvy right now for this year. Operator : Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company. Phil Nadeau : Merdad, I had a two-part question for you. You highlighted a couple of oncology events happening in the second-half of the year, namely the magrolimab Phase Ib data and Trodelvy data in the ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer. On magrolimab, can you give us some sense of what data needs to be produced to support a filing? And on Trodelvy, there's been a fair amount of breast cancer data recently. Has anything that you've seen questioned the powering assumptions behind the revised design of the TROPiCS-02 trial? Thanks. Merdad Parsey : Thanks, Phil. Great questions. In terms of magro, in terms of what we think we need to see. Look, I think, the challenge there is, obviously, that we're looking at external comparisons. So we believe that it's really around the strength of the data and its consistency with what we've seen already in that setting with magrolimab. I think, our assumption is, as long as we are consistent with the data that has emerged that will give us really good grounds to go and approach regulators to discuss a potential filing. So we're, I would say, reasonably confident there and our expectation is, as long as things continue to go the way they have been, we'll be fine. In terms of the breast cancer data for Trodelvy. Yes, I think, in terms of our confidence, I think, we remain confident that we're really well powered in that study to show benefit, in particular, in PFS, as well as OS in that trial. So I don't think we've seen anything emerge that shakes our confidence around that. Operator : Our next question comes from Louise Pearson with Redburn. Louise Pearson : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. On Yescarta, I was just wondering, could you find the incremental effort that would be required on your side to access the second-line DLBCL population should see the 7 readout positively? Just thinking in terms of any overlap there might be in the sort of centers where these patients are treated? And kind of, on a related note, has there been much COVID impact on the cell therapy franchise, Germany seems to have performed pretty robustly? Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Louise. Over to you, Christi. Christi Shaw : Thank you. So I'll take the last one first maybe, which is the COVID impact. We did see COVID impact and slowing of our ramp-up that we started doing well Q1 of last year and there was a slowdown in Q3, Q4. We've seen that rebound in Q1. We do believe that that has to do with less COVID impact, especially in the U.S., Europe, in spite of the COVID impact, continued to grow over those quarters. Germany and Italy, being the exceptions, where the COVID impact has been greater on our business there. Overall, though, we're very pleased with what we're seeing from quarter four to quarter one of this year, significant growth and coming off a couple of down quarters for Yescarta, both the U.S. and the \u2013 and Europe up quarter-over-quarter now with Yescarta. And on the second-line DLBCL question. So the good news is, the APCs are already set up, just like with Yescarta's we're able to launch quickly. So moving up to the second-line doubles the market opportunity, doubles the number of patients that we can serve. We also have community reps in the field already, both in Europe and in the U.S. So this referral pattern will continue to be something that we work on. But the belief, or my belief is, that as we look at patients in the third-line plus, those are typically patients that are going for palliative care and quality of life and short-term quantity of life is being managed whereas with ZUMA-7 in the second-line versus stem cell transplant, physicians and patients are still looking for a cure. So if the study is positive, we're looking at replacing stem cell transplant as a standard of care in second-line for curative potential. Remember, stem cell only cures 20% of the patients that are sent there. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Christi Operator : Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I wanted to ask one on Biktarvy. The adoption has been hugely successful and really for quite some time. So the question is, where do you see share maximizing in the U.S.? And what are the bigger growth opportunities? And then in the EU, what has been the primary headwind to greater share? Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Geoff. Over to you, Johanna, please. Johanna Mercier : Yes. Thanks, Geoff, for the question. Yes, we're really quite pleased with Biktarvy's performance. It just continues. And obviously, there's been some ins and out because of dynamics around us from a market standpoint, because of COVID and inventory, but the share growth 8% year-over-year, as well as the fact that we continue to grow share and even 2 points in the last quarter. We also grew 2 points not only in the U.S., but we also grew just under 2 points in Europe and about 5 points year-over-year as well. So we are seeing solid growth in Europe and we are seeing, in other markets as well, like, Japan and Canada, we're number one with Biktarvy. So I think that, as the data continues to show the benefits of the profile that Biktarvy offers for patients. I think there's no stopping us, Geoff. I think we need to continue to grow this business and we are well poised to get out of this COVID-19 pandemic and hopefully the markets reset. The market already has reset in the naive patient population. We're almost back to pre-COVID levels, which is great, and that's where Biktarvy truly differentiates itself. And in the switch business, we're not there yet. We're about 30% under pre-COVID levels. But again, with a share of close to 50%, also well poised for that to come back on track. So, I think, we continue to expand and continue to gain share over older agents, because of the benefits that Biktarvy offers, not just in the U.S., but really around the world. Geoff Meacham : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael Yee : Hi, thank you. And I appreciate the question. Going back to Trodelvy and the TROPiCS-02 study I think it's fantastic. You guys upsized that and overpowered it. I guess I had two questions. One was, can you describe sort of what input went into your powering assumptions for that? And then also, do you guys have a view that higher CDK4/6 matters given that that's pretty much standard of care nowadays and that's certainly evolved over the last few years as you think about the study? Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Michael. I'll take that. So two -- yes great questions. In terms of assumptions, I think, what's safe to say is we've been fairly conservative on our inputs to the assumptions in terms of looking at what the standard of care PFS looks like and using sort of that as our approach. And I'd say actually that's fairly our general approach. I think we try to take a fairly conservative approach in terms of designing our trials and balance what I would sort of a statistically significant benefit with a clinically meaningful benefit. And I think that that's -- we keep both of those in mind when we're powering our studies to make sure that we are -- we're hitting not only statistical significance, but looking for clinical significance. In terms of prior CDK4/6, I mean it's obviously something that's come up a fair bit appropriately. I think, people are looking at some data -- there are a number of hypotheses that are going around what it could be there. We're trying to take a very data-driven approach on this. And I guess, I would say a couple of things. One is that, in our hands and what we've seen so far from the prior studies, where we looked at those people who had gotten prior to CDK4/6 compared with standard of care, Trodelvy continues to bring benefit to those patients. And as a big caveat that's a fairly small number of people in that from us when we look at it, but I think we're comfortable that that continues to be the case. And secondly, we are going to look at the data from the upcoming trial and we will look at that that group of patients as a subgroup analysis to see if there is a difference in terms of how they respond compared to the overall population of patients that are going to be enrolled in that. So, we'll make sure that we segregate those patients out to make sure we learn from that. Operator : Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess maybe two-part for me. You mentioned a more gradual recovery now in the second quarter, but you maintained your guidance component. So just wanted to understand that a little bit more that you baked in more of a cushion there when you initially gave the guidance? And then on the PrEP side, how are you thinking about the recovery there in the second half of the year? Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Okay. Thanks. And so, Andy, why don't you start? And Johanna might want to add to the PrEP. Andrew Dickinson : Yes. Hi Terence. Thanks for the question. You're right. At the beginning of the year, we recognize that 2021 was likely to be more dynamic than prior years. And when we put together our guidance for the year, we looked at a range of scenarios. We're well within the range of scenarios in the first quarter. We're off to a good start. The mix was a little bit different than we expected with the additional pandemic-related headwinds that you heard about. But to be clear, when we think both about our total product revenues including Veklury, but also our base case revenues -- our base product revenues excluding Veklury, we're very comfortable with where we are and we're on target for the year. We'll provide another update of course in the middle of the year, but that's how you should think about it at a high level Terence. Daniel O'Day: And on the PrEP market -- yes Johanna. Johanna Mercier : Yes. Thanks, Dan. So, on the PrEP market, as I mentioned Descovy share is holding at about 45%, 46% in the first quarter. So we're quite pleased with that. We've obviously been working closely with payers to make sure that patients and providers had choice in their prevention approach. The market is still dampened because of this pandemic as you can appreciate with the social dynamics that we are all living with. Although, we have seen some uptake in the last month or so, we'll see how that plays out. But again I think it's going to be in line with what Andy said which is going to be a bit of a gradual recovery for the PrEP market. But I think, we're very well poised to make sure that once that market gets back to pre-COVID levels, I think we'll be in very good shape in light of our -- holding our share at this level. Terence Flynn : Thanks, Johanna. Operator : Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist. Robyn Karnauskas : Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. My kids are just sitting in the background there and excited about your earnings call. Daniel O'Day: We love it. Robyn Karnauskas : Very excited. They are very, very excited. I have a -- I just want to thank you for your outreach for India. I have a question about your guidance of $2 billion to $3 billion for Veklury. How do we think about this? I mean it doesn't feel like this is going to go on longer outside the United States than we expect. But obviously some places are cheaper than others. Can you give us some estimates on how do you think of -- general trends on pricing and thanks for what you're doing over there? And then this is a very simple question. You talked a lot upfront about cell therapy. There's still -- there is also off-the-shelf iPSCs. We talked about that a lot. Can you give us any sense if you're interested in augmenting our portfolio with one of those because those are different technologies? And again, my kids basing. Daniel O'Day: I appreciate your kids loving us. That's terrific. And thank you for acknowledging the efforts of the company for so many countries out there that are streaking with this. Can I ask Johanna to cover the Veklury question and then Christi to cover the cell therapy? Johanna Mercier : Absolutely. Thanks, Robyn for your question and comment. I think what we've seen with Veklury is a really directly proportional effect with hospitalization rates. And it's kind of what we've been saying for the last couple of quarters and we're seeing it. Yes. I mean you could literally draw the line with the hospitalizations both in the US as well as outside of the US. Where we've seen sales as in the first quarter and I think that's going to continue although to a lesser degree we've seen hospitalizations really come down in the month of March and kind of hold steady unfortunately. And hopefully, they'll keep coming down as months go by and vaccination rates increase. But what we have seen is sales are really coming out in the US, of course, also within our European region as well as Asia. There's a lot of markets in Asia that are also taking full advantage of the benefits of Veklury for their patients their appropriate patients. And so we believe, we've always said that, we think the tail is longer. I know nobody wants to hear that but I think we think the tail is longer than anybody thought originally. And I think that's what we're seeing as we go into Q2 and it will be a gradual recovery. So we do believe that Veklury still will have an important role to play within the next couple of quarters and potentially beyond into 2022. As for some of these -- for example India or other countries that are served by our voluntary licenses. Obviously, those are royalty-free during the pandemic and that is something at a much lower price level. So our price for Veklury hasn't moved. It's well below the value of Veklury for the developed countries. For the developing rolled up it's obviously quite different. With that Christi? Christi Shaw : Yes. Thanks, Robyn. Thanks for the question. So you heard a little bit in the beginning from both Merdad and Johanna and maybe Dan that we recently took a really hard look at our portfolio review. A few things are evolving or transforming if you will. Kite had such a success story in bringing the first potential cure for lymphoma. We've transformed now to a company that has multiple brands, franchise basically three indications now and with a couple more to come in the next year. As we look at that, we know a lot more now about how to affect leukemia and lymphoma in this area. So really taking a focus on making sure that we double down on our life cycle management improving the risk-benefit profile of what we have, trying to get patients with combination therapies for et cetera, to ensure we increase the efficacy. That's really our main focus on our core. We are also looking at disrupting what we have today whether it's iPSC, Allo. We do believe eventually the market will be and we'll be trying to drive that way too towards a lower cost off-the-shelf more convenient for patients' treatments. But today unfortunately from what we've seen at the recent congresses and publications and study results, it's a bit further out than we had anticipated just 12 to 18 months ago. So we really need to focus on improving autologous where we have it today, disrupting ourselves in the future. And lastly to your question beyond iPSC -- your question was iPSC, but even beyond that as we look at solid tumor, we really are the partner of choice with our successful manufacturing process, our ability to deliver reliably in a short period of time. We are looking at transformations, really good transformations where we have proof-of-concept in solid tumors where the market will be the largest in the long-term. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. A question on Galapagos and I guess there are two parts here. First part is, you've got these upcoming Toledo readouts. Merdad, maybe you could just comment on what you're potentially looking to see from those readouts given that the duration of those trials is fairly short. So maybe what you would view as sort of a positive outcome. And then I guess, second question is a more sort of broader strategic question here. But if you don't see something that's positive out of those how do you think about the longer-term relationship there? And given that you're the largest shareholder what might you consider in terms of that relationship? Thanks very much. Daniel O'Day: Great. You want to start Merdad and then I'll follow. Merdad Parsey : Yes, sure. It's a great question. And I think you -- Matthew you mentioned, I think look where we are now with the Toledo programs is looking for evidence of tolerability and proof-of-concept, proof of principle for that pathway in multiple indications. And I would describe these early small studies as a place to demonstrate that and look to see where the biggest impact could be. I think it's an early part of the longer journey ranging from -- is there a particular indication that we want to pursue further to confirm and expand on the signal to -- do we have the right molecule for that. So I think we view these together with Galapagos, I believe, we view these as sort of, very early in the story of the Toledo program. So we'll be looking to see what those data look like in the near-term. Dan, do you want add. Daniel O'Day: Sure. So maybe just to you Matthew to just give a little bit of context of people that may not be completely familiar with our relationship with Galapagos. So, of course, there was the filgotinib relationship, but then there was a separate relationship that we went into. As you know, a couple of years ago now. And that was really based on the research platform. And I would say that nothing has really changed in relation to that. I mean one of the reasons to do that was to diversify our approaches from a discovery research perspective across if you like the Gilead Group. I listened hard to the scientists at that time. I continue to listen hard to the scientists today. They think they have a very discriminated platform for screening compounds for first-in-class. And I'll remind you that's really the approach first-in-class which of course comes with some risks some of which we've seen in the later-stage programs. And, of course, Toledo is the most advanced now of those programs. But having said that there are many others within their discovery platform that we continue to be intrigued about. I think it's an important part of our overall inflammation strategy, albeit, at an earlier stage for Gilead. But when we think about our strategic approach that really focuses on immunology and virology as our core scientific skills, we have now obviously leaders in virology built up a really significant presence in oncology with inflammatory disorders really, kind of, the next step and the next stage of our platform where Galapagos presents, I think, one aspect of that but a very important aspect in terms of first-in-class approach. So we continue to be working very closely with our partners at Galapagos to determine what the next screens are and what the next targets are in the concept of our -- the entirety of our inflammation strategy. So thanks, Matt. Operator : Our next question comes from Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Ronny Gal : Yes. Just a question on Descovy. The 22% down on the year-over-year. I was wondering if you can unpack those for us. So how much of that was inventory COVID impact in price. So when it comes to price do you think this is a like a one-year giveaway? Or should we expect that kind of a pricing decline every year going forward at least when it comes to the back-class compounds? Daniel O'Day: Ronny, just at the very end what did you say? Johanna Mercier : Yes, please. Ronny Gal : Are we expecting the price declines this year to be a repeating events every year? Or is this essentially expected to be a onetime decline as to Truvada generic center. Daniel O'Day: Got you. Okay. Joanna, you got it. Johanna Mercier : Yes. Thank you. So thanks for that. I didn't hear the last part of that question originally. Yes. So for Descovy the year-over-year, obviously, it does have to do with higher payer discounts. And that was to ensure that patients and providers had choice. And make sure that we didn't have any step at it. And now we do have some step at it for some plan. But for most plans access is very open to make sure that our patients and providers choose which therapeutics is best for them for prevention. And so I think that we will continue to be smart and we will continue to be disciplined in the way that we look at those discussions with our payers, but we're also looking at data that's been pretty clear that shows that if you basically put a step at it you don't actually get the patient on a Truvada generic you actually just lose your patient. And I think as we think about ending the epidemic prevention is a big piece of that. And so that's why choice is so important and that we keep people at risk of HIV making sure that we keep those folks on the medicines that they're on without creating any access restrictions. And so if that's what we need to do moving forward to ensure that that might impact the price as we go. Our intent is obviously to keep the balance between what we do from a payer standpoint, but also what we do from a share standpoint. And that's why we're proud of the fact that we've been able to manage the payer dynamics and actually hold and even grow share in the last quarter. Operator : Our last question comes from Hartaj Singh with Oppenheimer. Hartaj Singh : Great. Thank you for the question. And I just want to also echo what Robyn said. I think people forget we donated almost one million vials of Remdesivir last year around this time which very few companies have done. Just a quick question on your partnership with Merck. What's the logic behind Gilead I guess leading the US development for the oral and then Merck on the injectable? What was the thinking that went into sort of the parameters of that and then also the cost-sharing and the revenue sharing assumptions? Any color on that would really help. Thank you for the question. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Hartaj and believe me it means a lot for you to comment on that for all the colleagues at Gilead who I think feel very strongly about the intrinsic work we do for patients and donations is just one piece of that it's part of our DNA. Andy, I think you're going to answer the question. Andrew Dickinson : Sure. Hartaj, thank you for the question. Look it was relatively simple. You have two outstanding organizations that are deeply experienced at formulation and drug development. Gilead obviously is one of the leading companies globally in terms of coformulating orals. For a single tablet regimen especially in the HIV arena and it made sense I think to both companies that have us take the lead there. And at the same time we recognize that to keep both programs moving forward quickly, it probably made the most sense to have Merck also lead a program and the injectable formulation program is one that was in their sweet spot. So this is a win-win. Both companies will be involved in both programs. And we think by doing that we're going to be able to advance these programs more quickly than we could individually. As far as the cost sharing, we took on more of the cost-sharing, because we have more of the upside, right? So it was a relatively simple. I think we are both bringing great molecules to the collaboration. We're both very excited about what we think these combinations can do in the treatment market both in oral and the subcu injectable formulations. And we recognize that when you looked at the patent life of the two products for instance was different, the franchise that we have in HIV, the impact of these on our existing franchise. When we put it all into the mix, I think there was a clear alignment between the two companies that it made sense at certain revenue levels for Gilead to share disproportionately and more of the revenue or the profits, I should say. But in exchange for that, fairly we had to agree to take a little bit more of the R&D expense, which we are happy to do. So that should -- I think Hartaj that should answer your question. Daniel O'Day: And Hartaj, I just want to end by thanking our colleagues at Merck. It's terrific. When you get two companies to come together to put patients first to accelerate treatment options for patients in need. And we have a lot of respect for our Merck colleagues. And happy to say that already the collaboration is getting off to a very strong and rapid start. So we look forward to moving fast to make a difference for patients with different treatment options. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Jacquie Ross for closing remarks. Jacquie Ross : Thank you, Liz, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and look forward to updating you on our continued progress. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jacquie Ross, VP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jacquie Ross : Thank you, Joelle. And good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the second quarter of 2021. The press release, slides, and supplementary data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com.  The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open up the call to Q&A, where the team will be joined by Christi Shaw, the Chief Executive Officer of Kite. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward\u2010looking statements, including those related to the impact of the COVID\u201019 pandemic on Gilead's business, financial condition and results of operations; plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, financial projections and the use of capital; and 2021 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward\u2010looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward\u2010looking statements.  Non\u2010GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non\u2010GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, in our supplementary data sheet, as well as on the Gilead website. I will now turn the call over to Dan. Daniel O'Day: Thank you, Jacquie. And good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the time to join us today. We're pleased to provide you with an update on our second quarter, where we delivered solid financial performance and significant progress on our increasingly diverse pipeline. 2021 is an important year for our pipeline, and we're very encouraged by the milestones we've achieved \u2013 for therapies that are potentially transformative for Gilead and for patients. All of this reinforces our confidence in our strategic direction.  I want to take this opportunity to thank our global community of Gilead and Kite employees who consistently go above and beyond to drive progress, with resilience and dedication. Different parts of the world are riding the ebb and flow of COVID\u201019 cases at various times, and while the vaccines give us hope and optimism, we are still very much living with the pandemic. Remdesivir continues to play an important role in fighting the virus and has now been used to treat an estimated 7 million hospitalized patients worldwide. Turning to the main highlights of the quarter on slide 4. The second quarter was a solid quarter overall. Veklury sales of $829 million were once again higher than anticipated, offsetting the lingering impact of the pandemic, particularly on HIV treatment.  In light of this pandemic impact, Biktarvy's performance is quite encouraging. Revenue for the quarter was $2 billion, up 24%, or $390 million from the same quarter last year. This more than offset the $322 million headwind associated with the impact of the Truvada and Atripla LOEs. Much of that headwind is now, of course, behind us.  Overall, our share of the HIV treatment market held steady quarter\u2010over\u2010quarter, and our PrEP share remained steady even with generic entries. These dynamics give us confidence that the underlying demand for our HIV products remains strong, and positions us well for growth as the overall HIV market recovery gains momentum.  Moving to our clinical pipeline, 2021 is a catalyst heavy year for Gilead and we have delivered all of our key first half pipeline commitments. Among other milestones, we shared top line data from the highly anticipated ZUMA\u20107 trial where Yescarta improved event\u2010free survival for second line Large B\u2010cell Lymphoma, or LBCL, patients by 60% compared to the standard of care. This is truly a landmark trial \u2013 the first and largest reported Phase III trial readout that demonstrates the efficacy and safety of cell therapy, and we are excited by the opportunity to bring the potential benefits of cell therapy to patients in earlier lines.  We shared positive Phase III data from MYR 301 which will help support our anticipated BLA filing for Hepcludex for HDV in the US later this year, and we submitted our NDA for use of lenacapavir in the heavily treatment experienced population with multidrug resistance. This filing was based on data from Phase II/III CAPELLA study presented earlier this month. We also shared strong lenacapavir data from the Phase II CALIBRATE study in HIV treatment, which will be used to inform our broader lenacapavir efforts. Our partner Arcus provided an interim update for ARC\u20107 that supports the continuation of both the ARC\u20107 and ARC\u201010 trials for their anti\u2010TIGIT candidate, domvanalimab.  Lastly, on slide 4, we are beginning to see the positive impact of our strategy, which we introduced early last year. The business is diversifying across indications and therapies. In particular, we are seeing Cell Therapy and Trodelvy contribute to growth and expect they will be key growth drivers for Gilead. While we build out the oncology business, we remain focused and committed on ensuring the long\u2010term competitive positioning of our virology portfolio. Next, on slide 5, we highlighted our pipeline execution so far this year, and I'd like to thank all those who helped us to deliver on this ambitious agenda, including our employees, the people who participated in the studies, our partners, and the study investigators.  As we look ahead to the rest of the year, our target milestones include a progression free survival, or PFS, readout in our event\u2010driven Phase III TROPiCS\u201002 study evaluating Trodelvy in hormone receptor positive/HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer; a Phase Ib data readout for magrolimab in myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS. Depending on the data, timing and results, this could result in a BLA submission for accelerated approval. And initiation of the potential Phase II lenacapavir and islatravir long\u2010acting oral combination. As you know, this is in collaboration with Merck and the development and formulation work remains on track. We look forward to updating you next quarter about additional milestone progress.  We understand that continued strong and consistent pipeline execution is critical to extending the virology business and expanding further into oncology. We believe our current and pipeline therapies can address significant unmet needs.  We are very encouraged by the progress Gilead and Kite are making. We are well on our way in our journey to expand and diversify into new therapeutic areas, and we are already seeing the evolution of both our pipeline and commercial portfolio. With that, I'll hand over to Johanna who will share an update on our commercial performance for the second quarter. Johanna Mercier : Thanks, Dan. And good afternoon, everyone. Starting on slide 7, total product sales of $6.2 billion were up 21% year-over-year, primarily reflecting Veklury which was not a contributor to revenue in the second quarter of 2020.  On slide 8, Veklury second quarter revenues of $829 million declined sequentially, reflecting the impact of higher vaccination rates and lower infection and hospitalization in many regions. While hospitalizations trended lower in the second quarter, Veklury remained the therapy of choice in 3 out of 5 patients hospitalized with COVID\u201019.  We estimate that, since the launch in May 2020, roughly 7 million patients globally have been treated with remdesivir. It's truly remarkable and encouraging to see how remdesivir continues to play such a key role in fighting this global pandemic.  Excluding Veklury, total product sales of $5.3 billion were up 5% year\u2010over\u2010year. We saw growth in cell therapy and HCV, in addition to new revenue contributions from Trodelvy and, more modestly, Hepcludex for HDV. Additionally, other product revenues of $291 million grew 20% year\u2010over\u2010year, driven by increased demand for AmBisome outside the US to treat mucormycosis, which has seen a rising incidence in patients hospitalized with COVID\u201019. Sequentially, we saw 9% growth for total product sales excluding Veklury, primarily driven by growth in Biktarvy.  Moving to slide 9, HIV product sales were $3.9 billion, up 8% sequentially and down 2% year\u2010over year. Compared to the second quarter of 2020, total HIV revenue reflected strong Biktarvy growth that more than offset the $322 million lower revenue from Truvada and Atripla following the loss of exclusivity. Compared to last quarter, HIV grew $288 million, reflecting customary seasonal inventory dynamics and growing demand for treatment. Biktarvy revenue of $2 billion was up 24% year\u2010over\u2010year and 9% sequentially, with quarter-over-quarter growth primarily driven by increased demand. Biktarvy remains the number one prescribed therapy in the US across na\u00efve, switch and continuing patients and remains number one in na\u00efve across all EU5 countries. Approximately 70% of switches from both Gilead and non\u2010Gilead regimens result in incremental revenue. Overall, and despite the ongoing impact of the pandemic, Biktarvy continues to gain market share with 1% share growth versus last quarter in both the US as well as the EU5.  Descovy revenues of $435 million grew 21% sequentially, due to a modest improvement in the demand for PrEP and more favorable inventory and pricing dynamics that we typically see in the second quarter relative to the first. As we highlighted in prior quarters, we have been working with payers to ensure patients continue to have access to Descovy in light of entry of generic alternatives for Truvada. We're really pleased to see this strong sequential growth in Descovy, and we continue to maintain mid\u201040% share despite generic impacts.  Year\u2010over\u2010year, Descovy grew 4% largely due to higher demand for PrEP. And, overall, PrEP demand is showing signs of recovery and is expected to continue to improve as pandemic restrictions phase out.  Earlier this month, federal FAQs for the US preventive services task force were released. It provided greater clarity as to the importance of PrEP in ending the epidemic, and we are really encouraged by this recent development. We hope it will help us to minimize the barriers of PrEP use going forward.  Before I transition to other products, I just want to take a moment to share some perspective on the HIV treatment market, given the longer than expected pandemic impact.  In regions outside the US, such as Europe, we are beginning to see signs of recovery in the dynamic market, with second quarter trends generally in line with our expectations. In the US, however, the pace of pandemic recovery was slower than we expected in this last quarter, and while we are seeing signs of recovery in PrEP and some sequential growth in the treatment market, it's clear that it will take several quarters for treatment to return to pre\u2010pandemic levels. In treatment, there are really two pandemic\u2010related headwinds that we observed. First, lower HIV screening and diagnosis resulting in lower treatment initiation. And second, due to the limited support services available during the pandemic, we have seen a higher number of patients discontinue their HIV treatments.  Taken together, these factors have reduced the number of active patients on HIV therapy entering 2021, thereby reducing the overall volume of new and refill prescriptions we would expect to see in 2021. We did, however, see growth resume from this lower base in the second quarter. After prior quarter-over-quarter declines, second quarter US HIV treatment prescriptions grew 2%, and we expect the market to grow at historical rates once screening and diagnosis rates return to pre\u2010pandemic levels.  To continue our efforts to advance progress against the HIV epidemic, we are partnering with healthcare professionals, advocacy groups, and policy makers to raise awareness of the unique challenges COVID19 poses to HIV screening, diagnosis, and adherence. Our goal is to help health care providers ensure that patients continue to be diagnosed and treated.  Given the strength of the demand fundamentals for Biktarvy, Descovy for PrEP, and other Gilead HIV products, we remain confident in our competitive positioning now that many communities are easing social distancing requirements.  In the meantime, we continue to see strength in underlying treatment demand with no material changes in the competitive landscape, with our total Gilead treatment market share holding steady at 75% in the US and just under 50% in Europe, despite competition and the entry of new generics. Next, on slide 10, HCV product sales in the second quarter were $549 million, up 23% compared to last year, but patient starts remain well below pre\u2010pandemic levels. The growth reflects a modest sequential recovery in HCV patient starts in the US in Q2 2021, in addition to an artificially low Q2 of 2020 that was impacted by unfavorable government rebate adjustments. We will be watching for further signs of recovery in the third quarter. Both US and EU Gilead market shares remain steady around 60% and 50%, respectively.  Moving to slide 11, HBV and HDV product sales were $237 million, up 8% year\u2010over\u2010year, with improving patient starts on Vemlidy, particularly in ex\u2010US markets. In its first full quarter as part of Gilead, Hepcludex contributed $7 million and is currently available in France, Germany, and Austria. We are excited to be working with the various reimbursement authorities to increase patient access and expect to secure full reimbursement in the major European markets in 2022.  Moving to Trodelvy on slide 12, product sales in the second quarter were $89 million, up 24% quarter-over-quarter, driven by demand for the two new indications approved in April, namely second line plus metastatic triple negative breast cancer and urothelial cancer.  We continue to be encouraged by the positive feedback from physicians on the Phase III ASCENT data, which demonstrated one\u2010year median overall survival benefit for second\u2010line metastatic TNBC patients treated with Trodelvy.  To build on this growing interest, we're increasing community awareness, especially of the expanded indication to second\u2010line in TNBC. And we expect to see growing demand as breast cancer screening ramps back up to pre\u2010pandemic levels.  IQVIA data suggest that breast cancer screening volumes were about 20% lower in the US in 2020 compared to 2019. This suggests as many as 41,500 breast cancer patients have not been diagnosed during the pandemic.  On behalf of Christi and the Kite team, I'm pleased to share our cell therapy commercial update on slide 13. Total cell therapy product sales totaled $219 million in the second quarter, representing 39% growth year\u2010over\u2010year, driven by both Yescarta and Tecartus. Yescarta growth was driven by strong demand in Europe, as well as successful follicular lymphoma launch in the US. Increased competition, particularly in third line LBCL, continues to raise the profile of cell therapy and is positive to Kite overall. We remain  confident in Yescarta's competitive profile and positioning, and are particularly proud of Kite's industry-leading manufacturing turnaround time and reliability. Our results also reflected strong momentum from the Tecartus mantle cell lymphoma launch, highlighting the unmet need for MCL patients.  We continue to add new indications and geographies for our cell therapy products. For example, the Fosun Kite joint venture recently received approval in China for Yescarta as the first cell therapy to treat third line LBCL. And we were excited to see the topline data for ZUMA\u20107, getting us a step closer to a second line LBCL cell therapy.  Even as we prepare for discussions with regulatory agencies later this year, commercial and manufacturing preparations are ramping up to ensure sufficient capacity and support for second line LBCL demand in both the US and Europe. Christi is here with the team to take your questions on cell therapy later in the call, but, for now, I'll hand it over to Merdad to walk us through the pipeline updates. Merdad Parsey : Thank you, Johanna. As Dan mentioned, it has been a gratifying year, delivering on all our key pipeline commitments, supporting Gilead's ambitions to extend our leadership in HIV and creating a broader portfolio spanning virology and oncology, and building our portfolio in inflammation.  I'll spend our time today on the highlights of the quarter, and point you to the appendix of the earnings presentation for a more complete view of our pipeline activities.  First, in HIV, as you can see on slide 15, programs for our investigational lenacapavir agent continue to progress. At the recent International AIDS Society meeting, we shared data from the Phase II/III CAPELLA study that evaluated heavily treatment\u2010experienced individuals who have already developed resistance to multiple antiretroviral drugs.  CAPELLA demonstrated lenacapavir's potency in this difficult to treat population. Despite significant prior resistance, antiviral activity was observed starting at day 15. By week 26, 81% of individuals had viral suppression when lenacapavir was combined with an optimized background regimen.  Based on these data, we have filed a New Drug Application. If approved, this would become the first six-month long\u2010acting subcutaneous injection regimen available, and deliver a welcome new option for people living with HIV who have developed multi\u2010drug\u2010resistance to other antiretrovirals.  Also at IAS, we presented strong interim results from the Phase II CALIBRATE study, evaluating lenacapavir in a treatment\u2010na\u00efve population. In CALIBRATE, participants received lenacapavir either as a subcutaneous injection or as a daily oral pill in combination with Descovy.  At week 28, 94% of subjects achieved HIV\u20101 RNA loads of less than 50 copies per mL. These findings will be used to help inform our broader efforts establishing lenacapavir as a foundational agent for our long\u2010acting franchise.  Late last month, we screened the first patient for the Phase III PURPOSE\u20102 trial studying lenacapavir for HIV prevention in cisgender men, transgender women, transgender men, and gender non-binary people who have sex with men and are at risk of HIV infection. We expect to initiate the Phase III PURPOSE\u20101 study of lenacapavir for HIV prevention in adolescent girls and young women later this year. Finally, we are actively working on the co\u2010formulation for the long\u2010acting investigational oral and injectable combinations of lenacapavir and islatravir and expect to initiate the oral Phase II trial by the end of the year.  Moving on to HDV on slide 16. Last month, at the International Liver Congress, we presented data from the MYR301 and MYR204 programs. MYR301 is a Phase III registrational study evaluating bulevirtide as monotherapy for the treatment of HDV.  Interim results demonstrated that bulevirtide was well tolerated in both cirrhotic and non\u2010cirrhotic patients with compensated chronic HDV infections. At week 24, bulevirtide treatment was associated with significantly greater HDV RNA declines and improvements in biochemical measures of disease activity compared to no treatment. Moreover, there were no treatment\u2010related serious adverse events leading to discontinuation.  These results continue to support the effectiveness of the 2 mg dose, which has received conditional approval from the EMA, and will form the basis of the BLA filing planned for later this year in the U.S.  As part of our HDV cure efforts, we also presented interim data from the MYR204 Phase IIb study investigating finite regimens of bulevirtide both as monotherapy and in combination with PEG\u2010interferon alpha. Both monotherapy and combination treatments of bulevirtide were found to be generally well tolerated and more effective than PEG\u2010interferon alone through 24 weeks of therapy. The primary endpoint analysis occurs at 24\u2010weeks after completion of therapy and includes virologic and biochemical response data. We look forward to sharing those data when available.  Moving to slide 17, and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, as you know, we shared earlier strong positive top\u2010line data from ZUMA\u20107, the landmark 359\u2010patient Phase III study evaluating Yescarta in second\u2010line LBCL. The study met the primary end point for event\u2010free survival, with a hazard ratio of 0.398, representing a 60% improvement in event\u2010free survival compared to standard of care stem cell transplant. Yescarta had a safety profile comparable to or better than what we have seen in the third line setting. This is a clinically and statistically meaningful improvement in outcomes that, if approved in the US, could extend Yescarta's reach to a total unique population of 14,000 patients annually in the second and third\u2010line LBCL setting.  ZUMA\u20107 also met the key secondary endpoint of objective response rate. As expected, data for overall survival is immature at this time, but the interim analysis suggests a favorable trend in this critical milestone.  In summary, we are very excited about the potential benefit to patients demonstrated in ZUMA\u20107 and look forward to beginning discussions with regulatory agencies later this year as we work towards potential sBLA and MAA filing for Yescarta in second\u2010line LBCL. And, separately, we are on track for the Phase II readout for first\u2010line LBCL study before the end of the year. Beyond LBCL, we have completed filing Yescarta with the EMA for patients with follicular lymphoma after three or more lines of systemic therapy. We also have a PDUFA date of October 1 under accelerated review with the FDA for Tecartus in ALL.  And, of course, while our internal focus remains on autologous cell therapies, we continue our engagement in alternative approaches, most recently partnering with Shoreline Biosciences to develop novel off\u2010the\u2010shelf, allogeneic cell therapies based on natural killer targets for hematological cancers.  Slide 18 is a recap of our pipeline execution so far this year. In addition to the items we've discussed already, our partner Arcus provided an early, interim update of their Phase II ARC\u20107 trial in late June, demonstrating clinical activity in the anti\u2010TIGIT domvanalimab\u2010based doublet and triplet combinations. Zimberelimab, our anti\u2010PD\u20101 antibody, saw similar levels of activity in the monotherapy arm compared to marketed anti\u2010PD\u20101s. Based on the interim analysis, we are pleased that ARC\u20107 and the confirmatory Phase III ARC\u201010 trial will continue to enroll as planned. We look forward to seeing how the data mature with additional patients and duration of follow\u2010up to inform our opt\u2010in decision.  Separately, our partner Galapagos also shared data readouts from their Toledo SIK2/3 programs across psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis and the plaque psoriasis from their TYK2 program. Both studies were early and had small samples, and we look forward to additional data. We also remain focused on the following upcoming milestones. For Trodelvy, we continue to target a TROPiCS\u201002 PFS readout this year. The study is an event\u2010driven Phase III trial in patients with hormone receptor positive/HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer. Pending data, we will evaluate and determine the appropriate regulatory next steps. We estimate there are roughly 17,000 patients in the US who could benefit from Trodelvy in this setting. We continue to expect the Phase III non\u2010small cell lung cancer for Trodelvy to initiate in the second half of this year. We plan to share an update from the TROPiCS\u201003 basket study on lung cancer later this year and will separately provide updates on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer as those data mature.  We anticipate a Phase Ib readout for magrolimab in MDS later this year and, pending data, will engage with regulators as we explore a potential BLA filing for accelerated approval. If approved, magrolimab would be the first\u2010in\u2010class macrophage checkpoint inhibitor targeting CD47 and Gilead's first frontline oncology indication.  There is a significant unmet need for MDS with no new treatments approved in 14 years despite 15,000 new patients being diagnosed each year in the US alone. We continue our development efforts in AML and have enrolled our first patient in the Phase III frontline AML magrolimab study.  Before I wrap the pipeline discussion, I wanted to share one last update on remdesivir. We have decided not to move forward with an inhaled formulation of remdesivir based on the results of our initial proof\u2010of\u2010concept study, suggesting sub\u2010optimal lung deposition.  To address patient needs in the evolving pandemic, we are continuing our efforts on advancing multiple novel antivirals. We expect to submit IND filings later this year or early next year for these agents. We remain committed to supporting patients through this pandemic and continuing our legacy of developing anti\u2010viral therapeutics for the treatment of emerging diseases.  Finally, on slide 19, I want to recognize the teams at Gilead and Kite. Compared to just two years ago, our pipeline has grown from 30 clinical stage programs to over 50 today and resulted in a considerably more diverse set of assets that can be transformative not only for patients, but for Gilead.  The Gilead and Kite teams have worked tirelessly to deliver on our pipeline programs during this time of dramatic growth despite the pandemic. It's a thrilling time to be part of a team with tireless dedication and commitment to helping patients. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters ahead.  With that, I'll hand the call over to Andy to walk us through the financial results of the quarter. Andrew Dickinson : Thank you, Merdad. And good afternoon, everyone. Moving to slide 21, our financial results in the second quarter were solid overall, with total product sales up 21% year\u2010over\u2010year given the important role Veklury continues to play in this pandemic. Excluding Veklury, total product sales grew 5% year\u2010over\u2010year, with strong Biktarvy growth more than offsetting lower Truvada and Atripla revenues, in addition to impressive growth in cell therapy and, of course, the new revenue contribution associated with Trodelvy which was not part of our portfolio in the second quarter of last year.  Moving down the P&L, non\u2010GAAP product gross margin was 86.4% in the second quarter, 210 basis points higher year-over-year and primarily associated with a lower royalty expense.  Non\u2010GAAP R&D was $1.1 billion, down 9% year\u2010over\u2010year, with lower remdesivir\u2010related investments as compared to the same period last year, partly offset by higher investments across our pipeline, notably Trodelvy and magrolimab.  Non\u2010GAAP SG&A expense was $1.1 billion, down 4% year\u2010over\u2010year, primarily due to lower legal expenses, offset in part by continued commercial investment in Trodelvy and Veklury outside the United States. Moving to tax, we realized a lower effective tax rate of 19.6% for the quarter, or down 320 basis points year\u2010over\u2010year, due to a shift in geographic earnings mix. Overall, our non\u2010GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.87 per share in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $1.11 for the same period last year. The year\u2010over\u2010year improvement primarily reflects higher product sales due to Veklury, higher gross margin, as well as lower operating expenses and a lower effective tax rate, offset by lower interest income.  Overall, we're encouraged by our first half results, shown on slide 22.  Moving to slide 23, you can see that we are updating our guidance for 2021. As always, the duration and magnitude of the COVID\u201019 pandemic continue to be uncertain, and the rate and degree of these pandemic impacts as well as the corresponding recovery from the pandemic may vary across our business. With that said, we now expect full-year total product sales in the range of $24.4 billion to $25 billion compared to our previous range of $23.7 billion to $25.1 billion. The new range increases the midpoint from $24.4 billion to $24.7 billion, and reflects our solid results year\u2010to\u2010date as well as our updated expectations for the second half of the year.  With first half Veklury revenue of $2.3 billion, we now expect full-year Veklury revenue in the range of $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion compared to our previous $2 billion to $3 billion range.  Our updated range reflects the ongoing role of Veklury in this pandemic, and assumes we'll continue to see regional outbreaks. The situation continues to be dynamic, and we'll likely update our thinking again when we report our earnings after the third quarter. Back to our guidance, we now expect total product sales excluding Veklury for the year to be in the range of $21.7 billion to $21.9 billion compared to our previous range of $21.7 billion to $22.1 billion. This tightening of the range reflects the longer-than-expected pandemic impact on our business, including the latest increase in COVID\u201019 cases.  As Johanna discussed, the pandemic has most notably impacted our HIV treatment business where we saw substantially fewer treatment initiations and a greater number of discontinuations than expected in 2020. It's taking longer than we expected for treated patient volume to ramp back up to more normal levels, particularly in the United States. That said, we saw encouraging signs of recovery in the HIV market in the second quarter, and our guidance assumes recovery will continue through the remainder of the year. Based on market share dynamics, we remain very confident in our competitive positioning, and we believe we are well positioned as the recovery continues.  Looking at the rest of our P&L, we now expect non\u2010GAAP product gross margin in the range of 86% to 87%, reflecting the lower mix of HIV revenue. We now expect non\u2010GAAP R&D to decline low to mid-single digit percentage compared to 2020 levels. This primarily reflects the timing of investments, and we remind you that expenses in both R&D and SG&A are back-end loaded this year, increasing sequentially from Q2 into Q3, and then even more from Q3 into Q4. Our non\u2010GAAP SG&A guidance remains unchanged at flat to low-single digit percentage decline over 2020. In R&D, we will be ramping up additional studies with magrolimab, Trodelvy, long\u2010acting combination work with lenacapavir for the treatment of HIV, and other pipeline activities.  And in SG&A, we will be ramping up marketing activities to support our growing portfolio of indications such as with Trodelvy and Tecartus.  Finally, reflecting the updates to our revenue, gross margin, and operating expense guidance, we now project non\u2010GAAP diluted EPS between $6.90 per share and $7.25 per share for the year, and GAAP diluted EPS between $4.70 and $5.05.  Additionally, our capital allocation priorities have not changed, and we remain committed to our dividend. Year\u2010to\u2010date, we have paid down $1.25 billion in debt, and we are on\u2010track to repay at least $4 billion in debt by the end of the year. With that, I'll invite the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Cory Kasimov with J.P. Morgan. Gavin Scott : This is Gavin on for Cory. Just wanted to go back to the US HIV business. Can you provide additional color, particularly in the context of why this is so much different from the ex-US markets? And what is the most important factor you'll be watching for to have confidence in the US market? normalizing? Daniel O'Day: I'm obviously going to turn that over to Johanna. I'd just point out that we continue to do really well in our share and certainly Biktarvy growth and are well positioned as the market rebounds. And with that, I'll turn it over to Johanna for some specifics. Johanna Mercier : I think from a market dynamics standpoint, what we're seeing is we saw a little bit last year in Q2, most of the industry was actually slowing down pretty quickly in Q2. HIV took a little bit longer. And it's kind of that playing out in 2021 is taking a little bit longer to come back and bounce back.  One of the major reasons for that has to do with your dynamic market being much smaller in this market. You have a very large pool of patients that are just continuing patients. And you're really playing in a dynamic market with your na\u00efve patients coming in and your switches and your restarts really around 5% or so. And so, that's why it's taking a little bit longer as we're going through this.  From a different standpoint between US and Europe, I think it has more to do with the fact that in Europe, there's diversity across some of the different countries as to the pandemics and the timing of kind of the recoveries or even some of the surges that happen. So, it's a little bit more blended than what we've seen in the US thus far. And so, I think that's just what's playing out here. Obviously, the bigger impact being in the US because that's where most of our business lies in HIV. And just to close out on that \u2013 that's from a market standpoint, and it's very different than kind of the fundamentals of our HIV business. I think what we've seen with Biktarvy, we're really quite pleased with in light of the fact that not only it's grown quarter-over-quarter by 1 point both in the US as well as the EU5, but also if you think about it over the last 12 months, it's grown 6 point share over a very strong base. We're just under 40%. We're at 39% share at this point in time. So, we're very pleased with the continued growth of Biktarvy. And you can appreciate that because it's such a larger base that's going to get more challenging as we move forward. And that's why I think we're excited about the market coming back a little bit. We've seen it come back in Q2. Where the market goes, obviously, our HIV business goes because we own 75% of the market. And so, therefore, we're watching that very closely, but we would expect that recovery to continue, although at a slower pace than we had originally expected. Gavin Scott : Anything on the indicators? I think you've mentioned \u2013 is there anything more on the indicators we should be looking? Johanna Mercier : Yeah. So, we've been looking, of course, at the HIV screening and the diagnosis and how that's playing out. And we're still under by about 13% to below pre-COVID levels. So, I think once those come back up, I think that would be something that we're watching very closely. And also, the drop off rates, we talked a little bit earlier about the adherence piece of the puzzle because you have less patient support groups around, you have less surround sound around those HIV patients, you have a lot of those case managers and physicians that have moved over to treat COVID-19 and so far impacting HIV a little bit disproportionately. And so, we're also looking at those drop-offs. And we've seen those drop-offs come back to normal to pre-COVID levels just most recently. And so that's another positive sign to the recovery of the market. Daniel O'Day: Gavin, obviously, just from a patient perspective, we had been and will continue to be dedicated to helping patients, particularly in underserved communities, get back into the care system. I think that's something that Gilead prides itself on. And that's exceptionally important as a leader in HIV medicines to make sure we are always on the side of the patients as we emerge from this pandemic. Operator : Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : A two part for me. First for Johanna. Just wondering if you can provide any more insight on the Trodelvy launch, specifically the split of sales by either setting or indication. And then, for Merdad, can you remind us of the size of the lung cancer cohort in TROPiCS\u201003? And then, how are you thinking about the potential risk of ILD in that population? Johanna Mercier : We're really pleased with the Trodelvy sales. I had 24% growth quarter-over-quarter. I think it's a very strong quarter. And I think that really has to do with the approval, the second line plus approval that we got in metastatic triple negative breast cancer early April. It's also related to the fact that because now we have the full approval, we have the opportunity to promote the incredible overall survival data that we have with the ASCENT data. And so, that's been a big piece of the puzzle.  If you're asking me to split the sales per line of therapy, that's very challenging in light of the claims data that we had. But what I would say, if it's more about bladder cancer versus triple negative breast cancer, I would say most of that is triple negative breast cancer, probably about a 90/10 ratio as our bladder cancer is much smaller, although we've done some nice inroads there already and are looking at about just under 10% share in bladder right now with Trodelvy. So we're excited about that as well. Merdad? Merdad Parsey : With TROPiCS\u201003, it's a basket study. So, the Ns per arm are not hard and fast. We'll probably be looking at data once we get to the 20, 30 range in there, but it's not predetermined. So, I wouldn't want to overstate it. Regarding ILD, we are definitely very sensitive to and watching for it, as you can imagine. To date, we haven't had any reports of that, but we're ever vigilant. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Brian Abrahams : Question regarding HIV lifecycle. You're still moving forward data for subcu lenacapavir based combo in treatment-na\u00efve HIV. I'm curious how did the learnings there with respect to the resistance profile you're observing shape how you think about the future development steps vis-\u00e0-vis potentially exploring higher doses more frequent than every six-month injections and/or combining with agents that might have a higher intrinsic barrier resistance versus F/TAF.  And then, I guess along the lines of HIV lifecycle, I'm also curious your level of confidence as to the potential of F/TAF to have exclusivity beyond 2025. Thanks. Daniel O'Day: Why don't we have you start, Merdad, and perhaps Andy can comment a little bit on the on the second piece, too? Merdad Parsey : It's a very good question. I think if you think about the patients in that trial, these are highly treatment experienced patients who often develop resistance because of non-compliance. And when these subjects are getting a subcu injection of lenacapavir, remember that these patients are going to potentially continue to go off and on their oral regimens.  As we think about the future, as you know, we are for treatment going outside of the highly treatment experienced population. We're really thinking about how we're going to combine lenacapavir with other long acting agents like islatravir. And as we do so, I think the concerns about patients potentially having effective monotherapy with lenacapavir go away in some regards, right? Ensuring that patients are taking multiple agents at the same time is going to be really important for us. Daniel O'Day: Perhaps, Andy, you want to comment on the exclusivity question for Brian? Andrew Dickinson : As you know, there's litigation that's underway. There were some recent developments that a number of analysts have wrote about. Our base case continues to be that there'll be generics arriving in 2025 and 2026 in the US and EU, respectively. But we think we have a strong case and we look forward to continuing to prosecute the case. And we'll see where it plays out. We should have an additional update later this year. So, that's really where it stands. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Next question comes from Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink. Geoffrey Porges : Just a couple of pops in my question. Could you clarify a couple of your partnerships? There's been some news from Galapagos. You've invested over $5 billion there. Are you going to take on any of those drugs from the Toledo portfolio that the company recently highlighted?  And then related to that, your Arcus partnership, does your guidance include the mild upfront costs of opting in for any of those programs? And what's the trigger and the window for when you can opt in to any of those three programs because they sort of appear on your pipeline slide, but it's not completely clear whether they're in or out? So, could you clarify where you're going with those two partnerships? Daniel O'Day: I'll start a little bit and then ask Merdad and Andy, if he wants to add any as well. First and foremost, I think we believe deeply in partnerships. We have a robust internal portfolio. And we also, as you know, have designed these opt-ins as a way to expand our portfolio in different therapeutic areas. Starting with Galapagos, as you know, which is predominantly focused on inflammation, at this stage, we don't have any opt in milestones right now with Galapagos. We're working closely with them on their science and their discovery platform, and some of their preclinical to clinical molecules to support them in their efforts. But at this stage, we don't have anything more to report other than what Galapagos has reported on the \u2013 for instance, Geoff, to your question on the Toledo program. But rest assured that as those programs evolve and mature and develop, we'll keep you informed.  Perhaps, Merdad, if you want to say anything else on Galapagos and then bridge to Arcus. Merdad Parsey : I think the stories are similar. We like to keep you apprised of what could potentially come into our portfolio, and we have the opt-in rights for Arcus. I think Dan laid out Galapagos well. For Arcus, we continue to wait for data to mature. And once the data get to a level of maturity where we can really make the call, that's when we'll have our opt in. We have not included \u2013 and Andy will confirm for me, but we have not included the financials of potential opt-in in our guidance at this point. Andrew Dickinson : I'm happy to follow-up here, Geoff. Good question. Nothing has changed from the guidance at the beginning of the year. So, our R&D spend and all of our expense guidance does not include the opt-ins on any of the programs that we have opt-ins, including the three programs that you mentioned at Arcus. You also asked about the opt-in windows. The opt-in window for the first TIGIT antibody should be coming most likely at the end of this year or it could be early next year, but it's most likely at the end of this year. We'll have enough patient data to trigger the opt-in or our desired opt-in potentially early. On the other two programs, the adenosine programs at Arcus, that's most likely next year. And again, there may be additional data that comes this year. But if it looks really strong, we want to move as quickly as we can, and we can opt-in early, Geoff, on those programs.  And then, on Toledo, it's relatively simple. On all of the Galapagos programs that opt-in comes after Phase II enabling studies, so the Toledo programs are a long ways away from a potential opt-in decision. Merdad Parsey : Phase III enabling. Andrew Dickinson : Yeah, Phase III enabling. Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Geoff, just kind of round out your question, there's obviously many other partnerships we have that we're working closely with at different phases. But those are the specific ones you asked about. Operator : Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : A question for Dan or Merdad on COVID. There's a high expectation that vaccines are here for a while now that the Delta variant has really changed the dynamic. The question is, has the strategic value of Veklury changed for you guys as new cases have ticked up? I know you decided not to pursue inhaled. But is there a lifecycle here worth investing in over the long term? Daniel O'Day: I'll start and then Merdad will either correct me or add information to it. Just to emphasize the importance of Gilad's legacy in antivirals, and frankly, our strength in that to us as well. So, being, of course, the first company to have \u2013 and the only company to have an approved antiviral for COVID is no accident. Obviously, it's decades of experience, decades of investments in a variety of emerging viruses, including COVID. And we haven't stopped. So, to your point, Geoff, I think we're all learning about this pandemic as it rolls out. And it's certainly going through different phases and we think will continue to go through different phases. And therefore, we are, if you like, kind of doubling down on an ability to think about antivirals outside the hospital setting where remdesivir plays such an important role.  And maybe with that, I'll hand it over to Merdad, as a clinician, how you might also see the future of the pandemic and then also our role in it. Merdad Parsey : I think we have been pretty been pretty consistently of the mindset that the vaccines will make a tremendous impact in the case numbers and those sorts of things. Even when we get to some sort of equilibrium, unfortunately, there will continue to be, we believe, infections. People will continue to get infected, and some proportion of those patients will end up in the hospital.  So, we do believe that Veklury in the hospitalized setting is going to continue to be really important for treating those patients. And as Dan alluded to, we continue to believe and are committed to making treatments available in the outpatient setting. So, the inhaled, nebulized approach didn't give us the results we were hoping for, the consistency we were looking for. But because we have other agents in our pipeline based on our virology expertise, we will be bringing those forward and really focusing on the outpatient setting there. So, we continue to believe that having a treatment available for people, whether they're vaccinated or not, is going to be important for the foreseeable future. Daniel O'Day: Geoff, what I might add is that our preclinical folks continue to study remdesivir against a variety of variants. In fact, all four major variants of concern. So, the Alpha from UK, the Beta from South Africa, the Gamma from Brazil and the Delta from India, and all are fully sensitive against \u2013 or remdesivir is sensitive against all of those strains, which would make sense because we're not seeing any mutations in the polymerase remdesivir binding site. And so, I think it's important as we think about next generation products to also think about medicines that will be effective against these ongoing variants, like remdesivir. So, it's an important bar for us as we move forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore. Umer Raffat : I had two quick ones as well. First, have you had an interim PFS on the HR+ study of Trodelvy? And secondly, congrats on Bill Grossman's hire from Arcus. And I was wondering to what extent was the decision of Bill bringing onboard driven elusively by Bill's familiarity with Arcus programs. Merdad Parsey : We have not done the interim PFS analysis. As we've talked about, that'll happen certainly before the end of the year, we hope. And that's still what we're tracking to, but we have not done the analysis yet. So, we remain blinded to those data. And then, in terms of Bill, I think I wouldn't necessarily tie it as you're suggesting to Arcus. It's certainly an advantage for us that, should we opt-in to Arcus programs, Bill will bring familiarity. But for us, Bill's experience and leadership and his excitement about being here and overseeing the overall portfolio were the drivers for Bill coming onboard. Daniel O'Day: I would just add, Umer, look, many of us know Bill. You know him as well. Our relationship with Arcus is extremely important and continues to be, and this was an example of Bill seeing a career opportunity and seeing an evolution for his career that made sense for him. We certainly want to make sure that Arcus continues to have the skill set that it needs to be successful, we have the skill set that we need to be successful. I think it's just a good example of how partners collaborate at times. So, I just wanted to emphasize our relationship with Arcus is unchanged and as strong as ever. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael Yee : Maybe a question for Merdad on Trodelvy. A couple of parts. In the TROPiCS\u201002 study, you had the smart decision to take a look at that, enlarge it, powered for PFS, et cetera. Did you have any information that could help give you confidence around the powering and any information that helped you give confidence in the overall study, such as the number of events that have passed or anything like that, or even knowing that it had passed a futility, if you could even comment on that?  And then, on the lung data that's coming up, can you just comment around your belief in the profile versus the competitor? Is it similar efficacy, better safety, or how should we interpret that data when it comes later this year? Merdad Parsey : On the TROPiCS\u201002 study, we have not done a futility analysis. We continue to look to those data maturing and getting the number of events that we need for the PFS analysis that we have planned. We're pretty confident in our powering and, in particular, since we expanded the sample size to make sure that we are able to hit the PFS endpoint. Of course, a relevant issue is more the duration of PFS that we get, but from a powering standpoint, we're comfortable. And it's just a matter of seeing those data.  From an ongoing event standpoint, I think we are where we thought we would be at this point. And it's really around just letting the events come in, make sure they get adjudicated, we clean the data in time to do the analysis properly. So, that's where we are with that.  And then, in terms of the lung data on efficacy, as I think we've said before, we're really proceeding somewhat at risk and pretty aggressively, partly based on our belief in the drug, partly because of what we've seen with other agents in lung and partly based on our early data that you're familiar with in lung that we've seen. Of course, we want to make those data more robust while we go into the Phase III world. So, we are going to augment our existing data to make sure that we're mitigating our risks somewhat. But thus far, I think what we are hoping for is efficacy that certainly is comparable to what the benchmark might be, even though I think it's too early to say what that benchmark is with a direct competitor. But we are, again, I think confident about our ability to bring safety profile that hopefully will be better for patients. Operator : Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Cantor. Alethia Young : I'm just curious about \u2013 again, going back to the Arcus collaboration with ARC-7, how did you think about what the hurdle is for a triple? Do you think that it has to be more than like some of the competitors like Roche have on the doublet? Merdad Parsey : I think we have the luxury of being able to look at the singlet, a doublet and a triple here. We would be, of course, excited if the triplet differentiates from the doublet and provides better efficacy. I think that's what we'd be looking for. And so, as the data mature, looking for some signals, a reason to believe that the triplet is performing more robustly than the doublet is probably going to be our focus. We'd be very excited if that plays out and gives us, I think, a pretty unique position. Operator : The last question comes from Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Ronny Gal : A question about the projections for HIV for the next couple of years. Part one, I guess, as you change your reimbursement policy on 340B clinics next year, how big essentially is that difference in terms of what it creates for you? And where on the P&L will it appear on revenue, on SG&A? And the second one, you already mentioned PrEP barriers are dropping with preventative treatment designation for PrEP. I can't figure out if this is good or bad for you from the perspective of a branded drug adoption, given that they don't have to cover branded drugs. Johanna Mercier : Ronny, I'm assuming you're talking about the patient assistance program changes. So, I want to differentiate that. Those aren't 340B changes. That's actually a program that's really in line with our commitment to help end the HIV epidemic. To date, the program's actually provided free drug to more than 250,000 individuals. And really, that's what it is, it's a free program that was always intended and will continue to provide free Gilead medication to eligible individuals to treat and prevent HIV. Unfortunately, it was not intended to be a source of funding for organizations to deliver services. And that's what we're trying to reset a little bit. So, the changes to our program model will protect our ability to be able to do this in the longer term and make it a sustainable program for us, and more importantly, for patients. So, that's the patient assistance program on that front.  The question you're asking me about PrEP, we're actually quite encouraged with the FAQ that came out from the US PSTF. And here's why. In the FAQ, they provide a lot more clarity than they had in the past. This isn't new. The recommendation actually came out \u2013the Affordable Care Act recommendation came out two years ago. But what this provided was actually more details to it and clarity on the importance of PrEP in ending the epidemic and minimizing the barriers of use.  And there's a couple of things in the FAQ that pop out for me. One is, it truly supports physician and patient choice. And that's the piece where generics or non-generics \u2013 right? So, Truvada generics or Descovy would then need to be really \u2013 the physicians and the patients get to decide together what is the right medicine for which patient. And of course, with the bone and renal safety benefits that Descovy brings, I think this is a great addition to the FAQ.  In addition to that, there's also some guidance around timely management of the request for this by payers. So, to turn it around within 24 hours, which is quite different than what's happening today.  And then, the last piece is $0 of out of pocket costs. So, I think for patients, this is great news. And I also think for patient choice and physician choice, this is quite promising as well. Daniel O'Day: Well, thank you all very much. Jacquie Ross : Thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and look forward to updating you on our progress. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

    "content": "\ufeff Daniel O\u2019day: To the significant reduction in the risk of hospitalizations after a three-day IV treatment of Veklury and the outpatient setting. In order to meet additional treatment needs, we also continued to advance our oral programs to develop a novel best-in-class therapy. Turning to HIV performance, we saw positive gains in the treatment market for the second quarter in a row, and reported record revenue for Biktarvy.  While treatment prescription volumes remained below pre -pandemic levels, we maintained total U.S. and EU treatment market share and we grew Biktarvy share sequentially in both geographies. The PrEP market continues to recover in our PrEP market share is holding steady despite generic entry.  Overall, our third quarter results give us confidence that the HIV market is recovering from the pandemic and our market share clearly highlights Giliead strong market position. As a result of the strong quarter, we have increased our full-year revenue and earnings per share guidance. That [Indiscernible] now look set to deliver close to twice the revenue we expected at the start of the year. While our base business has clearly been affected by COVID, it has also shown resilience. At the guidance midpoint, we are now expecting full year total revenue to be $1.75 billion higher than we expected at the start of the year. Our confidence in the longevity of our HIV business is in part-based on our progress in developing the next generation of HIV therapy and prevention. Lenacapavir is the cornerstone of that work, and we have 4 clinical trials evaluating Lenacapavir across treatment and prevention, highlighting our efforts to extend the options available to people living with or at risk of HIV.  This quarter, Lenacapavir was granted FDA priority review for the heavily treatment experienced population. As a reminder, Lenacapavir has breakthrough therapy designation, and if approved, would be the first long-acting treatment for people living with HIV who have multi-drug resistance, as well as the first available 6-month long acting subcutaneous injection treatment for HIV. Separately, as you know, we signed an agreement with Merck earlier this year to explore combinations of Lenacapavir and Eslatrivir in long acting treatment.  Earlier this week, we announced the start of a Phase 2 study with Mark evaluating, lenacapavir, eslatrir, long acting oral combination treatment. Our approach to long acting is very much shaped by people living with HIV. We've heard that they would welcome weekly oral or infrequent subcutaneous injections that could coincide with routine office visits or even be taken at home.  The advantages of these options include greater convenience, that potential for stronger adherence and privacy. Lenacapavir has shown promising potential in both oral and subcutaneous injections and will continue to advance both options while updating you on our progress throughout. While extending our leadership in HIV, we're also executing on the significant potential in our broad and diverse oncology portfolio.  This has potential that could bring transformational benefits for people with cancer and value for our stakeholders. Third quarter highlights include the initiation of 2 solid tumor trials from magrolimab, head and neck cancer and a multi - tumor basket study. We plan to initiate an additional Phase III study in first-line unfit, acute myeloid leukemia or AML in early 2022. The FDA approval of Tecartus for adult relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia or ALL, is our fourth approved indication in cell therapy. Additionally, the Kite team has filed an SBLA for Yescarta and second-line LBCL, which if approved, would be the first CAR T therapy in earlier line setting. And a positive CHMP opinion for Trodelvy in second-line metastatic tripling of breast cancer earlier this month, we expect an approval decision from the European Commission later this year.  And this could potentially be our 6th approval for Trodelvy in triple-negative breast cancer in 2021. Additionally, we've just announced a new clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck to evaluate the combination of Gilead's TROP -2 antibody drug conjugate for Trodelvy with Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA for the treatment of first-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. When we acquired immunomedics last year, we said that we would explore the use of Trodelvy across a wide range of tumor types, and that we would pursue combinations with both internal and external molecules. You can see this start to play out now with this Merck partnership as an early example of our approach.  Next on Slide 5, I'm pleased to note that we delivered on 3 of our target milestones for the quarter. You'll also note that the timelines for TROPiCS-02 and the Phase Ib Magrolimab have shifted as we now expect to have the PFS readout for TROPiCS-02 in late January or early February. And the topline readout for the Phase Ib Magrolimab in the First Quarter of 2022. Merdad will also touch on this later in the call.  But as you know, these modest timeline adjustments are quite normal in oncology, especially event-driven trials like TROPiCS-02. We look forward to sharing these updates in the first quarter of 2022. Taken as a whole, our oncology portfolio now stands some of the most promising targets in the field today. In addition to Trodelvy for TROP-2, CD47 and cell therapy. These include TIGIT, adenosine and many others.  We are very encouraged by the momentum across these programs and look forward to sharing much more in the coming quarters. The positive momentum overall in the third quarter gives us great confidence in the direction we are taking and the pace of our progress. We are well on our way with the plans to sustain our leadership in HIV. And while there is much more to come in oncology, we've already begun to execute on the potential in our highly promising portfolio. That glory is making a significant impact as the pandemic continues to evolve. And we are well-placed for when the HIV market bounces back. I want to thank all the Gilead kind of employees around the world who are making all this possible with their passion for scientific excellence, and their commitment to global public health. With that, I'll hand over to Johanna, who will share an update on the commercial performance in the third quarter. Johanna Mercier : Thanks, Dan. And good afternoon everyone. As you can see on Slide 7, total product sales of $7.4 billion grew 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by Veklury. Excluding Veklury, total product sales were $5.4 billion down 3% year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of the Truvada and Atripla LOEs.  Offset by continued growth in Biktarvy and contributions from our new medicines such as Trodelvy. On Slide 8, Veklury sales of 1.9 billion were up a 132% sequentially, and reflected strong U.S. demand consistent with the recent surge in COVID cases, including the Delta variant. Over 60% of patients hospitalized with COVID -19 in the U.S. with these Veklury, and we continue to expect the Veklury sales to track hospitalizations, which you can see peaked at the end of August and have been declining ever since.  Moving to HIV on Slide 9, revenue of 4.2 billion grew 6% sequentially driven by favorable net pricing and strong demand for Biktarvy, partially offset by continuation of the trends toward the less favorable payer mix. Our sequential trends were strong, total HIV revenues were down 8% year-over-year, given the impact of Truvada -Atripla LOEs and lower channel inventory, primarily driven by pandemic-related stocking in the prior year. Excluding the impact of the LOEs, HIV revenues were up 4% year-over-year. Overall, we're encouraged by the improving trends in HIV treatment. The U.S. HIV treatment market grew about 3% sequentially, suggesting a modest pickup from the recovery that started in Q2. Our steer at the overall U.S. HIV treatment market continues to hold steady at approximately 75%. And reflecting the modest pandemic recovery and strong share gain, Biktarvy revenues grew 20% year-over-year, and 14% sequentially to a record $2.3 billion.  Descovy revenue of $433 million was flat quarter-over-quarter, driven by increased demand and inventory, offset by lower net price. We continue to see recovery year-to-date with the PRAC market growing 12% quarter-over-quarter, and our encouraged to see Descovy shareholding study around 45%, despite the availability of multi-source generic versions of Truvada.  Next on Slide 10, Biktarvy continues to gain market share sequentially and year-over-year, both in the U.S. and EU5. We're particularly pleased to see sequential quarterly growth of 1.5% in the US and 1% in the EU5, especially given Biktarvy's leading market share. We're proud to see continued uptake of Biktarvy now capturing 41% of the total treatment market in the U.S. with more than 57% of people living with HIV starting treatment on Biktarvy.  On Slide 11 HCV revenue of 429 million was down 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable settlement in the Third Quarter of 2020 that did not repeat. Fewer patient starts outside of the U.S. and the timing of Department of Corrections purchases on a relative basis. Sequentially, [Indiscernible] revenue declined 22% due to inventory dynamics, including a sizable purchase by the Department of Corrections in the prior quarter and fewer patients\u2019 stats.  Although stats improved in some geographies year-over-year, we saw sequential declines in the U.S. and Europe, driven by continued pandemic-related impact on patient visits, and lower testing volumes in additional -- in addition to normal seasonality. However, we continue to be pleased that Gilead HPD market share is holding steady around 60% in the U.S. and just about 50% in the EU5. Moving to Slide 12, HBV and HDV revenues of $247 million wrap 17% year-over-year, driven by Vemlidy demand in international markets and the addition of Hepcludex to our portfolio.  Q3 revenue for Hepcludex was $12 million reflecting sales now in Germany, France, Austria, and Greece. We are actively working with government authorities to secure full reimbursement in a major European market in 2022. Moving to Trodelvy on Slide 13, third quarter revenue of a $101 million grew 13% quarter-over-quarter, driven by increased share in metastatic TNBC in part due to the expansion to second-line. Trodelvy was approved for second-line metastatic TNBC in the U.S. in April.  And we already estimate that approximately 15% of second-line patients are receiving Trodelvy. In third line or later setting, we estimate that about a third of patients with metastatic TNBC are receiving Trodelvy. In urothelial cancer, at least one in four bladder cancer patients in the third line or later setting, start treatment on Trodelvy. And with adoption and second-line still, there's continued opportunity for growth across both settings. We are pleased with the uptake so far and remain focused on broadening physician awareness in community settings. Following recent NCCN, breast cancer, and ASMO clinical guideline updates.  Trodelvy is now included as a preferred regimen in second-line metastatic TNBC in both guidelines. And we expect this will drive further adoption. We are preparing the first commercial launches of Trodelvy from metastatic TNBC in Great Britain, Australia, Canada, and Switzerland. And later this year, we are expecting a decision from the European Commission following the recent positive opinion from the CHMP. Next, on slide 14, and on behalf of Christy and the Kite team, our cell therapy products grew 51% year-over-year to $222 million.  This was driven by LBCL demand and strong launches in both mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, more than offsetting the expected impact of new U.S. entrants in LBCL. With the addition of our new MCL and FL indications, we are particularly proud that we have maintained our best-in-class manufacturing operations within 97% reliability rate. To support our expected growth, we are working to bring our new Maryland facility online in mid-2022, which will automate many of our manual processes and reduce costs. We also want to highlight the recent FDA approval of Tecartus in adults ALL.  This Makes Tecartus the first and only Car T therapy now available to these eligible patients in the U.S. The Kite team has also filed a supplemental BLA for Yescarta in second-line LBCL, which would bring us one step closer to potentially carrying even more patients. Kristy is here with the team and available to take questions on cell therapy during the Q&A. And with that, I hand it over to Merdad for pipeline updates. Merdad Parsey : Thank you Jyna. As always, our focus today on the most important updates and refer you to the appendix of the earnings presentation for a more comprehensive view of our pipeline programs. First on Slide 16 in HIV prevention, we've initiated the 5,000-plus Phase III PURPOSE-1 trials, getting Lenacapavir for the prevention in adolescent girls and young women who are risk of HIV infection.  We're also in the initial stages of recruiting for Purpose-2, to evaluate Lenacapavir for prevention over 3,000 cisgender men, transgender, and gender non-binary who have sex with men. We will provide updated timelines once enrollment is further along. In HIV treatment, the FDA granted priority review in August for Lenacapavir for the treatment of people living with HIV who have developed multi-drug resistance to other antiretrovirals.  This is based on compelling CAPELLA data that demonstrated 81% of heavily treatment experienced individuals achieved viral suppression when Lenacapavir was combined with an optimized background regimen. The PDUFA action date has been set for February 28th 2022, and if approved, Lenacapavir would become the first available 6 months long acting subcutaneous injection treatment for HIV.  Earlier this week, we announced that enrollment head started for the Phase 2 trial, for the long-acting oral combination of Lenacapavir and Eslatrivir. This is part of our collaborative work with Merck to develop more flexible options for people living with HIV with a once-weekly oral pill. Gilliat is leading the development in clinical work for this oral combination. And Merck is leading the clinical work for the injectable combination that is expected to enter Phase 1 clinical trials next year. Moving to Veklury on Slide 17, we presented a late breaker at the IDWeek 2021 conference last month based on the Phase 3 pine trees study evaluating Veklury as an outpatient intravenous COVID -19 treatment. The results demonstrated that a three-day course of Veklury significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization for high-risk patients with COVID -19. In particular, Veklury demonstrated a statistically significant 87% reduction in risk of the composite primary endpoint of COVID -19 related hospitalizations or all-cause mortality by day 28 compared with placebo.  There were no deaths in either arm of the study by day 28. We stopped PINETREE enrollment at the halfway mark of 584 patients in April due to the COVID -19 landscape at the time. But the study remains blinded and collected outcome data and the enrolled patients. Upon analysis of those data, the results were highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful. Again, demonstrating the efficacy of Veklury.  It also emphasizes the importance of early treatment with antiviral therapies. We have submitted these data to the FDA as an SNDA filing, and our discussions with federal regulatory agencies to explore approval for IV Veklury in an outpatient setting. We're also continuing our work to develop novel oral antivirals for the treatment of COVID -19. Moving to Slide 18, we continue to view Trodelvy as a pipeline interproduct. Trodelvy targets TROP-2, which is overexpressed in many solid tumor cells.  So, we believe that Trodelvy can have a meaningful impact on a wide - range of cancers. In addition to the second-line metastatic TNBC and in second-line bladder indications that are approved today. We're all eagerly anticipating the readout from the Phase 3 TROPiCS-02 study, a randomized Phase 3 trial in HR-positive HER2 -negative metastatic breast cancer. As a reminder, this is an event-driven trial evaluating disease progression. And we have not yet achieved the target number of events. As such, we now expect to have the top line data readout in late January or early February.  To be clear, data, announcements will only begin once we achieve the required number of events. We remain confident for the potential Trodelvy to deliver a clinically meaningful benefit to patients with HR-positive or 2-negative metastatic breast cancer. We also continue to do advance Trodelvy into registrational studies for other indications. For example, as recently posted on clinicaltrials.gov, we plan to initiate the Phase 3 trial in second to third line non-small cell lung cancer at risk, and look forward to sharing updates for other solid tumors as we expand the program.  As Dan mentioned, we'll also start to work with Merck on the New York clinical study looking at Trodelvy in combination with Merck's KEYTRUDA for first-line metastatic TNBC and plan to initiate the trial in the first half of 2022. Moving onto Slide 19, we continue to believe that with its synergistic potential in the safety profile observed to date [Indiscernible] could benefit patients with a variety of hematologic and solid tumors. As you know, our initial focus has been MDS and AML.  While our commitment to these patients remains unchanged, we continue to evolve our clinical programs in the context of the recent development in the MDS therapeutic landscape. The ongoing Phase 3 enhanced trial evaluating Magrolimab in higher-risk MDS is on track and enrolling well. We will discuss our development plans and regulatory path forward with the FDA before the end of the year. Meanwhile, the data from our Phase Ib trial continues to mature. We now expect to share top line data in First Quarter of 2022. Looking beyond MDS, our enhanced 2 trial from Magrolimab in first-line TP53 mutant AML is ongoing, targeting the new therapeutic option for nearly 2,000 patients in the U.S. In addition, an estimated 6,000 patients in the U.S. are diagnosed and treated annually with unfit AML. So, we're expanding our development efforts to initiate a Phase III trial for one -- first-line unfit AML by early next year. Over the past few months, we've initiated 2 solid tumor trials from Magrolimab. One in head and neck cancer, and a separate solid tumor basket study for patients with non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, and urothelial cancer. We also plan to initiate a third study in metastatic TNBC. Based on broad CD-47 expression for [Indiscernible] bimagrumab potential to be an effective therapy for solid tumors, and look forward to sharing more updates as they become available.  Next, on behalf of Christy and the Kite team, I also wanted to highlight the most recent approvals for Tecartus in adults with relapsed or refractory ALL on slide 20. There's an incredibly high unmet need for these patients with 50% of adult patients relapsing on currently available treatment. The approval was based on data from ZUMA-3, which demonstrated 65% of patients who achieved complete remission.  Additionally, as Johanna mentioned earlier, Kite has filed the sBLA for Yescarta and second-line LBCL. With a medium follow-up of 2 years, the study met the primary endpoint of event-free survival with a hazard ratio of 0.398 and a P-value of less than 0.0001, representing a potential significant advance in the standard of care for LBCL patients.  We look forward to reviewing the entire dataset a dash and expect an update next year on approval status. Lastly, moving to Slide 21, we remain very excited about our oncology partners whose works expands many promising new pathways in oncology. For example, our partners at Arcus has a pipeline that includes not only anti-TIGIT candidates but also CD73 and adenosine receptor inhibitors to promote immune responses and inhibit tumor growth.  We continue to expect to trigger the opt-in review period for Arcus ' domvanalimab likely later this year or early next year, pending the review of more mature data. Additionally, through our partnerships, we have access to several candidates that could help modulate immunosuppressive and tumor permissive cell types and pathways, including [Indiscernible] HLAGE checkpoint inhibitor, which recently expanded to Phase 1b study.  And Johnson CCR -8 Inhibitor, which received IND clearance last quarter. Other potential opt-in programs from partners include Pioneers, [Indiscernible] antibodies which are in Phase 1 trials in actively enrolling patients, and a Genesis CD-137 agonist, which is expected to be evaluated in the combination trial that will be initiated later this year. In closing on slide 22, our teams are focused on executing across our oncology virology and inflammation pipeline.  And while it's still early days for our inflammation portfolio remain committed and invested in continuing to advance our pipeline across various mechanisms of action, such as [Indiscernible] four, Alpha 4 Beta 7, and Tippl 2 in combination with our opt-in partners, our pipeline portfolio spans many of the most promising targets across our three therapeutic focus areas. Very excited and committed to build out our best-in-class and industry-leading franchise. Now hand it over to Andy. Andrew Dickinson : Thank you Merdad. And good afternoon, everyone. Moving to Slide 24, as you've heard from Johanna, our financial performance in the Third Quarter overall was strong, with total product sales up 13% year-over-year, driven by Veklury's continued role in the pandemic.  Year-over-year, total product sales excluding Veklury, fell 3% due to Truvada in a triple sales following their loss of exclusivity late last year, offset in part by the continued demand for Biktarvy and contributions from our new medicines such as Trodelvy. Sequentially, total product sales excluding Veklury were up 2%, highlighting the ongoing pandemic recovery in HIV treatment and PrEP. This was partially offset by HCV where new starts in both the U.S. and Europe continued to be impacted by the pandemic.  Turning to the rest of the P&L, non-GAAP product gross margin was 90%, 350 basis points higher year-over-year, reflecting the reversal of a previously recorded $175 million litigation reserve, as well as lower royalty expense and a change in product mix. Non-GAAP R&D was $1.1 billion down 4% year-over-year, reflecting lower remdesivir and inflammation-related expenses, offset in part by increased clinical investment in Trodelvy and Magrolimab.  Non-GAAP SG&A was $1.2 billion up 8% year-over-year, driven by increased promotional and marketing activities across all of our geographies primarily for Trodelvy. On tax, we realized a higher effective tax rate of 18.9% for the third quarter, we're up 50 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to a prior-year net discrete tax benefit.  Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.65 for the quarter compared to $2.11 for the same period last year. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher Veklury sales and product gross margin offset by a higher SG&A lower interest income and higher effective tax rate. On Slide 25, you can see that Veklury has already exceeded our prior guidance for the year with total revenues of 4.2 billion in the first nine months.  As a result, and with modestly updated expectations for the rest of our business, we are increasing our revenue and earnings per share guidance for the full-year by 6% and 13% at the mid-point respectively, as shown on Slide 26. After the wave of infections and hospitalizations in recent months, we believe we have moved past the peak of the pandemic for the year. We continue to expect that Veklury will play an important role in the treatment of patients with COVID -19 globally.  However, assuming we do not experience another surge, we expect Veklury revenue to step down significantly in the fourth quarter. As a result, we are raising our full-year total product sales in the range of 26 billion to 26.3 billion compared to our previous range of 24.4 billion to 25 billion reflecting results year-to-date in Veklury performance. We now expect full-year Veklury revenues to be in the range of 4.5 billion to 4.8 billion, up from our prior outlook of 2.7 billion to 3.1 billion. We continue to expect that sales of Veklury will track COVID -19 related hospitalizations. We now expect full-year total product sales excluding Veklury to be approximately 21.5 billion compared to the prior range of 21.7 billion to 21.9 billion, reflecting our performance year-to-date in continued pandemic related impact. As for the rest of our P&L, we expect our non-GAAP product gross margin to be approximately 87% compared to 86% to 87% previously, primarily reflecting the strong gross margin in the third quarter.  For non-GAAP operating expenses, we now expect R&D to decline mid-single-digit percentage compared to 2020 levels, as compared to our prior expectations of low to mid-single-digit percentage decline. We expect SG&A to be flat on a dollar basis compared to 2020 versus prior expectations of flat to low single-digit percentage decline. On our non-GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 21% this year.  Finally, with the updates to our revenue product gross margin and operating expenses, we now expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $7.90 and $8.10 for the full year. And GAAP diluted EPS to be between $5.50 and $5.70. On capital allocation, our priorities have not changed. We continue to invest in our business and at the same time, we've returned over $1 billion in the third quarter and $3.2 billion year-to-date to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. We have also repaid $3.75 billion in debt this year. And earlier today, we notified our 3 non-call 1-bondholders that we would exercise our ability to repay $1 billion of the notes early. Taken together, we now expect to pay down $4.75 billion of debt this year, significantly exceeding our prior guidance to pay down at least $4 billion. With that, I'll invite the Operator to begin the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions] We ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question. Then your line will be muted. If you have a follow-up, please re-queue. Our first question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Probably unsurprisingly, my question's for Merdad. Merdad, can you just comment maybe in a little bit more detail in terms of the assumptions that you previously made on TROPiCS-02 and how they were tracking or not tracking that caused you to make this change especially around the blinded event rate and anything else you were watching in the trial? Thanks. Merdad Parsey : Hi, Matthew. Sure. Happy to. Look, I think as you know, event-driven trials are inherently variable in terms of when the events occur and importantly, when those events come into the database. We had initially thought we would hit the mark this year, but as time has gone by, our best projections right now are that we'll hit that mark next year. And as we said, I think we will be able to share those results probably mid-January to mid-February time frame. That's how we're tracking to the events at this point. Johanna Mercier : Katherine, I think we're ready for our next call. Operator : Our next question comes from Tyler Van Buren with Cowen. Your line is open. Tyler Van Buren : Hey, guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I have another one on TROPiCS-02. Can you just remind us or help set expectations in terms of what you feel is a clinically meaningful benefit on PFS? A lot of people seem to be taking it at around 2 months. If you do reach that sub two-month PFS benefit, let's say, a 1.6 or 1.7, would you guys still go ahead and file or how would you view the data? Thank you. Daniel O\u2019day: Thanks, Tyler. Yes, Merdad? Merdad Parsey : Yes, Tyler, thanks. I do think the consensus that folks have seen we would've agreed d that 2 months is that threshold for clinically meaningful. I think if we were to fall short of that, which is a difficult place to speculate and not our expectations.  But if that were to happen, we would look at the totality of the data. We'd want ed to look and see if there's other areas where we could provide benefit to patients, and we look at the totality of the data before deciding what we would do. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore. Your line is open. Umer Raffat : Hi. Maybe let me focus on the Ramdevsivir for a quick second. I'm just trying to understand the reported number a little better, it's a billion five in U.S. on third quarter, which if you re-express based on the [Indiscernible] that\u2019s near our price point would imply maybe 750 thousand patients on the drug in third quarter in U.S. and we know the total U.S. COVID hospitalizations were right around 750,000 in U.S. as well. Is it just reporting artifact [Indiscernible] estimates? I'm just trying to understand why this was materially different than the 50% to 60% penetration remdesivir historically had. And I'll spare my TROPiCS question for Merdad subsequent to the call. Merdad Parsey : Thanks, Umer. Go ahead, Johanna. You want to hit that one. Johanna Mercier : Sure. Umer, I think what -- so the $9 million that Dan referred to earlier is really a mix over the year, right? So that's a little bit different than what you're referring to. The $1.5 billion you asked, most of the sales actually of the total $1.9 billion, obviously coming out of the U.S. and the patient population. So, I can't track your math per se, but what I would say is that the U.S. patient population, was the greatest, and if you just do the math on about a five-day therapy on average price for Ramdesivir that you would get to less than near 750, just doing it off the top of my head. I think it's probably a little bit lower than that and higher in other parts of the world just because of price points. Merdad Parsey : And Johanna the -- maybe also the color on the [Indiscernible] the current market share of patient for patients in the hospital. Johanna Mercier : Yeah, I thought probably a little bit north of the 60% that you're referring to. We've seen -- obviously we're looking at different databases, but we've seen up to close to 66%, 67% of share of Veklury in early days of hospitalization.  Obviously, often used with Demethazone and other inflame products that anti-inflammatory products. But we do see the share increase and we've seen that obviously with the surge in August and September, we saw that take out both from a protocol standpoint as well play out in the usage itself in the U.S. specifically. Umer Raffat : Thanks, Johanna. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Brian Abrahams : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Sticking with COVID, curious to learn more about. Your outlook on how COVID treatment will evolve into next year and beyond. I'm curious if you could give us a little bit more color around the efforts to develop oral direct-acting and antivirals for COVID that you spoke about at the beginning to call, are these primarily [Indiscernible] derivatives you're looking at protease inhibitors, potential combination cocktails. When might we learn more about those? Thanks. Daniel O\u2019day: Thanks, Brian. I think we've all been a little bit shy about predicting how the [Indiscernible] will continue to evolve because, I think, we've proven to be not always right on that. I'm going to let Merdad comment and I'll sort of the other team members have anything to comment. What I will say is back to the previous cash cushion from Umer is that there's no doubt that we see a direct connection correlation between Ramdev's use and outbreak. So that continues.  And as Johanna says we continue to get the market share, and there's also no doubt, Brian, to your point that the although injectable Ramdesivir continues to play a really important role around the world for hospitalized patients, and now the data, obviously we have in the outpatient setting. We're not satisfied yet, and we want to continue to put our science to work, and maybe Merdad, if you want to have any forecast on the future of pandemic to endemic, you're welcome to. Merdad Parsey : No, no. Thank you. No, I agree with Dan. I think it's incredibly difficult to predict outside of -- I think what we're all starting to believe is it'll be a combination of vaccines, therapeutics of various types, or course, anticipating changes in the virus over time, we'll have to keep an eye on it and see how it goes. Importantly, to date none of the variance have shown any resistance to [Indiscernible]. We think that's a positive outcome so far. We haven't disclosed yet what the oral compounds are going to be. They're -- we are moving them forward as quickly as possible and we'll share those data as those molecules begin to mature. But our hope is that they certainly provide an alternative treatment option, in particular, in the outpatient setting with Veklury remaining really a stalwart in the hospitalized and, potentially, the outpatient IV setting. Andrew Dickinson : And I would just add, Brian, I think it's fair to say that obviously we continue to work on oral versions of remdesivir. We have said before in the past, and to your point -- from a scientific standpoint, the opportunity to look at combination therapy and oral medicines for COVID to also anticipate future viral resistance. So those are all themes and then to Merdad, of course, the updating you as those medicines continue to move forward. Daniel O\u2019day: Thanks, Brian. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is open. Geoff Meacham : Afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Just had a bigger picture question on HIV. When you look in the pandemic, remdesivir has done quite well even this quarter, and your oncology pipeline has really grown. But when we look at the core HIV business, long-term great -- long-term growth rate we used to think was high single-digits and it's much lower last year and this year and I know you have generics and I know the pandemic has affected the market, but the question is, do you think you'll go back to a higher long-term growth rate in HIV and maybe just help us with the drivers of that. Thank you very much. Daniel O\u2019day: Thank you, Geoff. So, Johanna. Johanna Mercier : Sure. Geoff, are you asking specifically the market or just generally? Geoff Meacham : For you guys, maybe [Indiscernible] for the market. Johanna Mercier : Okay. I think what we said in the second quarter was exactly what's playing out today. We have seen a little bit of a recovery in Q2 and we're seeing that recovery continue, actually, and accelerate a little bit into Q3. We're at about 3% growth, we're about 2% in Q2, and we were negative 3 quarters before that. What we're -- the -- what we're assuming at this point is, actually, we're going to get back from a market standpoint back to where we were prior to COVID.  We're just starting from a much lower base, so it's going to take a little bit of time. I think the assumption is that as we get to 2022, you will see that play out, assuming no other major surges come through. That's from a market standpoint, which, obviously, will help from a product standpoint. When you think about Biktarvy and you think of our growth year-on-year at about 20%, and then of course, double-digit growth on a quarterly basis as well. We have different dynamics going on. Obviously, demand is still strong, so we're quite pleased with that. We grew about 1.5% share over the last quarter, over 6% in a full year. So, we're on a much larger base because we are our market leader. But we've also had some different pricing dynamics as well going on that are related to obviously the mix that we're looking at. So that's something that has impacted directly by the pandemic. As you think about your government versus commercial mix, and we've seen PHS channels specifically grow a little bit more rapidly than any other segment over the last couple of quarters. So those are the dynamics that we're dealing with. But if you look at the basic demand, very strong in double-digit growth. Andrew Dickinson : Jac, it's probably -- Andy, it's also probably worth highlighting again, the difference in the PrEP market and the treatment market. They just joined a touch base on the treatment market that's exactly right. Remember that a lot of the growth that you're referring to a couple of years ago was driven by the incredibly strong PrEP market as well.  We think you will see that again, it's just going to take the introduction of Lenacapavir in a couple of years to get there. So, the dynamic in the treatment market, I think is relatively constant with what we've seen historically, it's just we're building off a bigger base as Johanna said. And the market will continue to grow and then you should see the PrEP dynamic coming back in and a couple of years in terms of driving additional growth. Daniel O\u2019day: Thanks Geoff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies, your line is open. Michael Yee : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. [Indiscernible] go to TROPiCS-02 I do think it's important. I wanted to ask for Merdad what his was on the importance of OS. Obviously, it would be immature and I think Mark, which suggests you could get OS later in '22. But if you do have a TFS benefit around, 2 months, how confident are you that it still be okay and confident around OS sitting and the crush over and other impacts wouldn't impede that result? maybe just comment on that a bit. Thank you. Merdad Parsey : Sure, Michael. Happy to. Look, I think as you recall, one of the reasons we modified the stage, it's important you go back to the early part of the year, when we modified this trial. We expanded the sample size and we changed the endpoint. And I think the main purpose behind modifying the sample size was to make sure that we could hit OS with the assumptions that we had in the trial. So, I think if we hit PFS, we feel reasonably confident with all the caveats that you said right around crossover and things like that that are difficult to control, that we should be able to hit OS. So, I think that's important. And I think that really gets to the other underlying issue around this delay as we moved from investigator to central overrides of the progression events, those are the things that led to the slight delay here that we're talking about. But I think that all means we'll have a stronger outcome when the data are available. Daniel O\u2019day: And maybe just the risk because I know there's been several questions on O2 just to complement what Merdad had said. When we think about trials in the oncology space for all of us have a lot of experience, but it's certainly not uncommon when you think about event-driven trials to have to have the slight adjustments of timelines. And I would just point out that initially we anticipated that we would have this data and to Merdad's point with all the protocol adjustments that we did in the middle of the year in December of this year.  And now we're talking about those data coming in mid-January to mid-February. So, the timeline changes are really very minor. And in terms of the trial conduct and design, nothing has changed in regards to our confidence for TROPiCS-02. So, I just wanted to make sure I also had a chance to say that. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Cory Kasimov : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask you about the Arcus TIGIT program in which regard to the added data you expect to get on this asset to make the go-no-go decision. Is it just more durability or you're going to see more patients to basically just looking for your latest thoughts there on what it would take for you to opt-in. Thank you Daniel O\u2019day: Merdad, you want to take this? Merdad Parsey : Yeah. Sure. Thanks Corey. We do anticipate that the data move will mature, I think is what we've been thinking. And I think that's a combination of things. More patients per arm, as well as longer observation time for the patients that are enrolled in the study. We remain really interested in that and enthusiastic about that study. And as I said, I think we feel that it's likely that we'll be able to make our opt-in decision this year. So, we continue to believe that that's where we're headed with those data. In total, I think we do expect to see a larger, more robust dataset to decide on. Andrew Dickinson : And as we said before, what we're looking for is clear separation of the doublet from single agent and we're looking for an ORR of over 50% in the doublet and hopefully in the triplet as well, that would be upside for us. Johanna Mercier : Katherine, we're ready for the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Garlow with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Andrew Garlow : Hi. Thanks for taking my question and I just have one on the HIV pipeline. So, given you're collaborating with Merck on lenacapavir and [Indiscernible] as a combo? One of your competitors in this space claim that frontline standard of care needs to include an integration inhibitor. So, given your experience with [Indiscernible] do you agree or not that integrates Inhibitor as always likely to be needed in a first-line setting. Merdad Parsey : Yes. Thanks for the question. It's an interesting statement to make. We obviously don't believe that. That's why we're pursuing the combination approach that we are. So, I think the data will tell the story in the long run. We're pretty confident that we can get there with the combination approach that we're taking right now. Daniel O\u2019day: Thanks, Andrew. Johanna Mercier : Katherine our next caller. Operator : Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink. Your line is open. Geoffrey Porges : Thank you very much for taking the question. Why don't we go back to the [Indiscernible] impairment question for the core business? Perhaps you could give us a sense of where your stats for HCV and HIV in Q4 compared to Q4, 2019. And then secondarily, do you expect those businesses to grow in 2022? I know it's early for guidance, but you've obviously developed your plan already. Just be helpful to see how you're thinking about COVID impact on those core businesses. Daniel O\u2019day: Can I just clarify you meant Q3, Q3? Geoffrey Porges : No, we're in Q4 now. And I'm really trying to get a sense of -- you showed pretty clearly the decline in hospitalizations and in number of different therapeutic categories were recovering in Q4. So, really wondering where we are today compared to Q4 2019. Daniel O\u2019day: Got you. Johanna. Johanna Mercier : Sure. Let me start Geoff with that HBV and then I'll move onto HIV. So, at an HBV standpoint where we talked about being about 8% under year-over-year. A lot of that has to do with timing and pricing adjustments. So, it's not patient per se. We are actually flat pretty much year-over-year, about 2% positive.  What we did see though is market starts declined in Q3 and that's directly related to the pandemic, because less screening diagnosis, they were down again in Q3. And so, we believe that it will pick back up. I wouldn't go so much to say that it will be an increase. But I would say that we should be able to hold flat because you typically see HDV patient starts decline over time just because there's less patients that need the cure, but not as quickly as what we're seeing in the quarter.  So, we do think that will pick back up. It's -- so we would assume a little bit more tempered decline in 2022. The HIV piece of the puzzle, we still are seeing screenings and diagnosis less than pre - COVID -19. So, we're seeing about screenings 10% down versus 2019. And diagnosis, there's still 20% below 2019 levels. So as much as we're seeing recovery quarter-over-quarter, and we're excited about that, because that's in line with what we had assumed, we're still not back to the levels that we're needs to be.  And so I would say that you are now growing from a lower base and it's what we talked about in the last quarter where the assumption was it would come right back, but the dynamic market in HIV is very small and it's going to take a little bit longer, and therefore, we're just growing from a lower base and we do believe we'll get back to typical levels of a couple of single-digit growth from a market standpoint in 2022, is just going to take us a couple of quarters to get there. Hopefully that helps a little bit to give your perspective. Geoffrey Porges : That helps a lot. Thank you. Daniel O\u2019day: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas [Indiscernible] Securities. Your line is open. Robyn Karnauskas : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just thinking big picture on your long-term growth. Obviously, there are a lot of questions here on Trodelvy and thinking about the HIV business as -- two core areas that are very important for your long-term growth.  Can you talk about how your expectations of Trodelvy market opportunity have changed from your initial acquisition? And if you don't see the data that you want to see from TROPiCS-02 how are you going to think about your strategy for growing the business? Because it seems like that is core to the long-term future of the Company. Thanks. Daniel O\u2019day: Right, thanks Robin. All of Andy start here, and certainly ask. Andrew Dickinson : Hey, Robyn, Thanks for the question. And Johanna may want to weigh in as well. Look, I think there are a number of growth drivers. If we just step back, when you think about long-term growth there has been a number of questions. Just to paint the picture again, there are a number of growth drivers that we see driving.  We don't provide specific long-term guidance. What we've said and we'll continue to say is that the HIV business, including the long-acting collaboration that you mentioned, Trodelvy, Magrolimab, Cell Therapy, and a number of the other programs, potentially the Arcus programs are expected to drive our long-term growth.  In the short run, we see a much more promising growth profile than we did historically. We think that we've done a lot to turn the Company around and now the growth profile is improving significantly from our perspective. When you get to '24 or '25, again, we've said we see an expected inflection in our growth profile as a lot of these programs that are currently in the clinic hopefully reach the commercialization, including a number of the Trodelvy programs.  On Trodelvy, specifically, I think we continue to be very bullish on the prospects for Trodelvy overall. Similar to where we were when we did the transaction. So, you'll remember, we highlighted there are a number of ways to win with Trodelvy when we acquired Immunomedics. The hormone-receptor positive study was just one of those studies. Obviously, we're excited about the work that we're doing in lung cancer and other areas. So, there's a much broader clinical development plan for Trodelvy then the market probably fully appreciates today.  The announcement with Merck earlier today is a good example of that. That will give you a sense of where we're going and we expect to give you a much greater sense of that overall. So, I think at a macro level before I ask Johanna to comment, I'd say our expectations for Trodelvy have not changed. We continue to be very enthusiastic about where we are and where we're going and there's lots of different ways for us to get there over time. Johanna Mercier : Yeah. No, I -- thanks, Andy. I would just add, I think we are pleased with where we're going with Trodelvy today in the short-term. We still believe that there's a lot of growth opportunities specifically in the earlier lines setting betting both across triple-negative breast cancer, as well as bladder cancer.  And so, we're seeing those opportunities play out. I think the guidelines are going to help us set up for success, let alone setup for future pipeline studies such as HR -positive coming through, hopefully. in a positive way as you mentioned, and that should just [Indiscernible] expand our market opportunity even more so.  The only thing I would add to what Andy was saying is also on the HIV front, we are not looking just at the oncology opportunities, but also from an HIV standpoint, we still believe that TAR - VIR is foundational to our HIV opportunities. In addition to of course, Lenacapavir that Merdad spoke too earlier. So, we're excited about what we have going on there as well. Daniel O\u2019day: Thank you, Robyn. Operator : Our next question comes from Ronny Gal with Bernstein, your line is open. Ronny Gal : Good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask a little bit about the agreement between -- about a combination of Trodelvy and Keytruda. This might get a piece of economics that Trodelvy, can you talk a little bit about the elements of the agreement. And then one of your peers signed an agreement with Merck on non-small cell lung cancer. And I was wondering, are those steps of agreements exclusive that is, they can have another TROP-2 ADC in triple negative breast cancer, and you may partner with them in lung cancer as well. Andrew Dickinson : Yes. Hi Ronny. it's Andy. Thank you for the question. It's relatively straightforward, this is a straightforward, simple clinical collaboration Merck is providing Trodelvy. They obviously had input on the study design KEYTRUDA. I'm sorry, KEYTRUDA. To be studied, thank you.  They do not have any economics on Trodelvy as a result of the study, but they will enjoy hopefully they've added benefits to KEYTRUDA on their end. And these studies are not exclusive. They have the ability to do other studies in the same area with other agents, including other TROP-2 antibodies. And we have the ability to do studies with other PD-1 inhibitors as well. And of course, we started in triple-negative breast cancer.  You're highlighting that there's another study that they will do with another TROP-2 inhibitor in lung cancer. That of course is an area that we're going to look at as well. So, I expect that there's more to come, but these are relatively straightforward, simple, plain vanilla clinical collaborations. Daniel O\u2019day: And its part of our strategy, right Ronny, to scale the opportunity with Trodelvy because there's many things we can do ourselves. But frankly, given the multi - tumor opportunity for Trodelvy, engaging in partnerships like this allows us to expand much more than we could ourselves. And I think it's the beginning of what you'll see from as we look to really expand the promise and potential of Trodelvy. Johanna Mercier : Katherine, I think maybe we have time for 2 more questions. Operator : Okay. Our next one comes from Brian Skorney with Baird. Your line is open. Brian Skorney : Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I guess we'll be seeing a bunch of potentially transformative data in Large B-cell Lymphoma in a couple of months, I assume at ASH. I guess in addition to your own data, just thoughts on given the Telerik success, how do you think about the potential for CAR - T19 to move upwards into the frontline setting, and does the success of... actually change the market opportunity in your view for second-line as well? Thanks. Daniel O\u2019day: That's fine. Christy, please. Christi Shaw : Sure. Yes, we're very excited about our submission at the end of September for second-line and expect to hear back on the status from FDA first half of next year. But we will be presenting the data at ASH, as you said, and CAR T is really the only potential cure we're seeing right now. So, when you look at the out of class second-line agents and moving to frontline.  It typically has been a delay to [Indiscernible]. And now with this new study coming out, we'll have to see what that exact duration will be for those patients. We hope it will be successful, but we don't see a huge impact to our projections in the cell therapy marketplace. Second-line actually allows us to basically double the market that we can play in, which is about 14 thousand patients in the US.  That combined with you'll also see our frontline data ZUMA-12 which was completed, we'll be presenting that at ASH as well. You will see that on frontline, second-line and see how it may stack up, although they're not head-to-head trial. We're pretty confident in where we are, and it doesn't really change our projections for the future of cell therapy or for our specific brands. Johanna Mercier : Katherine, maybe just our last question, please. Operator : Our last question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open. Carter Gould : Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe just one on the long study that's going to get started later this year for Trodelvy. You've characterized that study at risk, but presumably you've had some insight from the basket study. Is that a fair assumption, and could we see data from that basket study, maybe by the time we see TROPiCS-02 data? Thank you. Merdad Parsey : Thanks. Great question. Our -- we're looking at the totality of the data we have. It's not just the TROPiCS-03 data, we're looking at the totality of the data in line that we have accumulated, and that's really the approach we're taking. So, I take your point, and it's arguably not that bigger risk given the data we've seen. We -- I would not expect for us to be sharing those data around the time of the tropics, too, but we do -- we will plan on sharing those data over time. So, we'll definitely share those data over time, but for now, we're pretty excited by it what we've seen in terms of the Trodelvy performance in [Indiscernible] Daniel O\u2019day: [Indiscernible] Operator : That's all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the call back to Jacquie Ross for closing remarks. Jacquie Ross : Thank you, Katherine. And thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and look forward to updating you on our progress. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jacquie Ross, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jacquie Ross : Thank you, Gigi, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. The press release, slides, and supplementary data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today\u2019s call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O\u2019Day, our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier, our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey, and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we\u2019ll open up the call to Q&A, where the team will be joined by Christi Shaw, the Chief Executive Officer of Kite. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including those related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gilead\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations; plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations, financial projections and the use of capital; and 2022 financial guidance, all of these involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the Company\u2019s underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release available on the Gilead website. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dan. Daniel O\u2019Day: Thank you, Jacquie. And good afternoon, everybody. As we head into 2022, Gilead is coming off a year of positive clinical momentum and strong financial performance, mitigating the impact of the pandemic on some parts of our business. Higher sales of Veklury more than offset the impact of COVID-19 on HIV and HCV. Veklury continues to play a critical role in helping to treat people with COVID-19, with continued activity against the Omicron variant. The FDA recently expanded its use beyond the hospital for patients at high risk of disease progression. In addition, we just initiated a Phase 1 trial of GS-5245, a novel oral COVID19 nucleoside, that once metabolized, works in the same way as remdesivir. Our full year revenue for 2021 was 11% higher than the midpoint of our initial guidance in February of 2021. It was also an important year for our transformation to becoming a business that is based on diverse, sustainable growth. In 2021, we received 7 approvals or accelerated approvals in the U.S. and Europe, and submitted an additional 6 filings. Our approvals included : three for Trodelvy, with FDA and MAA approval in second-line triple-negative breast cancer as well as an accelerated approval from FDA for metastatic bladder cancer; two for cell therapy, with Yescarta receiving accelerated approval in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma and Tecartus receiving full approval in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia; and two expanded labels in virology, one for a pediatric label for Biktarvy in the U.S. and an expanded label for Veklury in the E.U. for adults not requiring supplemental oxygen. Our 2022 plans include a significant increase in clinical development studies across our novel oncology portfolio. We are planning at least 20 additional trials, including 7 Phase 3 trials for Trodelvy. And these include : the ASCENT-03 trial, which is evaluating Trodelvy in the front-line triple-negative breast cancer in the PDL1 negative population; the ASCENT-04, in collaboration with Merck, to evaluate Trodelvy and Keytruda in front-line triple-negative breast cancer population in the PDL1 positive population; and the EVOKE-03, which will be led by Merck, to evaluate Trodelvy and Keytruda in non-small cell lung cancer. You will also see ongoing momentum in our virology portfolio as we continue to expand our leadership in antiviral therapies. We are advancing our longer-acting HIV options with lenacapavir as the foundation and look forward to potential regulatory decisions in 2022. If approved, lenacapavir would be the only HIV treatment option administered twice yearly. In addition, we\u2019ll continue to drive progress across our broader virology portfolio, including hepatitis, COVID-19, and other emerging viruses. This is a really important time in Gilead\u2019s transformation journey. After the consistent work to execute on our strategy and expand our portfolio over the last two years, you will increasingly start to see this play out in tangible results. We\u2019re confident that Gilead has all the elements in place for a strong year and a strong decade. Johanna, and Merdad and Andy will now take you through the details of our progress and our plans. And let me hand first to Johanna to talk about our commercial performance in the fourth quarter and the full year. And I\u2019ll be back to you in the Q&A. Johanna? Johanna Mercier : Thanks, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone. As you can see on slide 7, we had a strong end to the year with Q4 total product sales, excluding Veklury, of $5.8 billion, up 7% quarter-over-quarter, driven by favorable pricing and inventory dynamics. This also represented 8% growth year-over-year, driven by continued recovery in the HIV treatment market and favorable pricing dynamics. Veklury sales were higher than expected in Q4 reflecting the start of the Omicron surge, but lower than both the prior quarter and prior year, and contributing to total product sales of $7.2 billion for the quarter. Moving to slide 8, total fourth quarter Veklury sales were $1.4 billion, bringing total sales for 2021 to $5.6 billion. Gilead is proud of the role that Veklury continues to play in this pandemic. Veklury has demonstrated activity against the Omicron variant and has helped many patients with COVID-19 in the most recent surge. Although symptoms have generally been less severe, the volume of overall cases has meaningfully increased since the emergence of Omicron, and we have seen the total number of hospitalizations increase as well. While we would all prefer to put this pandemic behind us, we expect Veklury to continue to play a critical role in 2022 and beyond. As you would expect, hospitalizations remain a key indicator for in-patient Veklury sales, and we are seeing higher hospitalizations in geographies with lower vaccination adoption, including certain parts of the U.S. as well as Eastern Europe. Additionally, I\u2019m very pleased to highlight that the FDA recently approved the sNDA filing for the use of Veklury in the outpatient setting for patients at high risk of disease progression. This approval was based on data generated in the Phase 3 PINETREE study, further solidifying the credibility, importance and role of Veklury. Now Veklury will be available to help even more patients earlier and reduce risk of hospitalization for COVID-19. Next, as shown on slide 9, total HIV sales were $4.5 billion in the quarter, up 8% sequentially driven by favorable inventory and pricing dynamics as well as changes to our gross to net estimates in Q4 2021. For the full year, total HIV sales were $16.3 billion, down 4% year-over-year, primarily due to the Truvada and Atripla LOE, in addition to pandemic-related impacts and pricing dynamics. The expected impact from the LOEs, which amounted to $1.3 billion, was offset by continued Biktarvy growth. Excluding the sizeable LOE impact, HIV total product sales for the full year grew 4% compared to 2020 despite the ongoing pandemic headwinds. We now expect the Truvada and Atripla loss of exclusivity impact to be minimal going forward as the headwind dissipates starting in Q2 of this year. In HIV treatment, we continue to see signs of market recovery although the U.S. market declined 1% sequentially in Q4 following two quarters of sequential growth. On a year-over-year basis, the overall market in Q4 was up 1.5% in both the U.S. as well as the EU5, despite screening and diagnosis rates still below pre-pandemic levels. As you know, favorable dynamics play out in the fourth quarter of every year in HIV, and 2021 was no different with some year-end inventory stocking and favorable seasonal pricing as well as changes in our gross to net estimates in Q4 2021. As you think about 2022, I\u2019ll remind you of the normal HIV inventory build-up in Q4 and the New Year reset for patient copays and donut hole payments. Given these factors, along with the favorable pricing dynamics I just mentioned, we expect the sequential decline in Q1 \u201822 to be greater than Q1 \u201821. Nonetheless, we expect a strong year overall in HIV and expect continued growth in subsequent quarters. Back to Q4, Biktarvy had another record quarter with sales of $2.5 billion, up 11% sequentially and 22% year-over-year. On slide 10, you can see that Biktarvy U.S. treatment market share has increased over 5 share points in 2021, reaching 42%, which is the highest share that any complete regimen has ever achieved in this market. For the full year, Biktarvy sales were $8.6 billion, growing 19% from 2020, and Biktarvy remains the leading prescribed treatment for na\u00efve and switch patients in the U.S. as well as number 1 in na\u00efve in EU5. Descovy revenue for the fourth quarter was $473 million, up 9% quarter-over-quarter primarily as a result of favorable seasonal pricing and inventory dynamics as well as continued demand. We expect Descovy revenue to continue to be driven by PrEP as Descovy has maintained about 45% of overall PrEP market prescriptions in the U.S. We will continue to ensure access to support physician choice, and expect growing demand and market expansion to offset the impact of increased commercial contracting. Overall, while near term growth continues to be impacted by local pandemic-related social restrictions, we are encouraged by the growing PrEP market. In Q4, the overall PrEP market grew 4% quarter-over-quarter, and 31% year-over-year. Looking forward, we believe lenacapavir, our investigational longer-acting PrEP offering, could potentially catalyze the market well beyond the 25% penetration rate in PrEP that we see today. Moving to slide 11, it\u2019s clear that HCV continues to be the part of our portfolio most impacted by the pandemic. Although there was some slight quarter-over-quarter recovery in market starts in the EU5, U.S. market starts declined, resulting in flat total starts overall. While Gilead market share increased modestly on a sequential basis in both the U.S. and the EU, this was more than offset by unfavorable pricing dynamics, resulting in Q4 total sales of $393 million, down 8% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. As you can see on slide 12, our HBV and HDV franchise reported record quarterly revenues of $265 million, up 7% sequentially due to seasonal inventory and favorable pricing. The 9% year-over-year growth was primarily driven by Vemlidy demand. Total fiscal year sales for this franchise were $969 million, up 13% year-over-year. Hepcludex reported $12 million of sales in Q4 in Europe, with $37 million in 2021 sales since our acquisition in late first quarter. Hepcludex is currently available in Germany and France, in addition to a number of early access programs in countries such as Austria, Italy, and Greece. In 2022, and as part of our comprehensive commercialization plan, we expect to finalize reimbursement for launch in a number of major European markets. In the U.S., we filed a BLA in November and FDA granted priority review for accelerated approval, with a PDUFA date set for the third quarter and an Advisory Committee meeting that will be scheduled in the coming months. Moving to oncology, first with Trodelvy on slide 13, global sales were $118 million in the fourth quarter, up 17% sequentially and up 84% year-over-year compared to full Q4 2020 sales. This reflects growing adoption of the second line metastatic TNBC triple-negative breast cancer indication, which was noted as a preferred regimen in the NCCN Breast Guidelines updated in September. We are also starting to see stronger, unaided brand awareness which is resulting in continued market share growth. In second-line TNBC, Trodelvy now captures approximately 1 in 4 new starts in the U.S. We have expanded our oncology footprint globally, including tripling our U.S. headcount to further accelerate penetration of Trodelvy and prepare for our potential HR positive and HER2 negative launches. Additionally, EU approval for Trodelvy was granted in late November 2021 and we have already seen strong momentum in France and Germany since their launch. We plan to launch in a number of new countries following key reimbursement decisions this year. Now, on slide 14, on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, cell therapy Q4 sales of $239 million reflected 47% year-over-year growth, an 8% increase sequentially. For the quarter, Yescarta sales of $182 million were up 41% year-over-year driven by continued demand in relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Tecartus sales of $57 million in the quarter reflected 68% year-over-year growth based on growing global demand for relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma and early contribution from adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the U.S. As a reminder, FDA granted Tecartus approval in adult ALL in October and in just the first few months of launch, there has already been strong demand that we expect to continue in the coming quarters given the high unmet need. Full year cell therapy sales of $871 million reflected 43% year-over-year growth driven by continued LBCL and MCL demand globally as well as the new launches. The strong growth we\u2019ve seen with these recent launches reinforces our belief that cell therapy adoption will continue its positive momentum as more physicians understand the benefits for appropriate patients and therefore increase referral rates to treatment centers. Merdad will elaborate later, so I\u2019ll just quickly mention the impressive data Kite presented at ASH in December, 43% overall survival rate after five years in third line LBCL patients. The Yescarta data at ASH not only highlighted the long-term real-world safety and efficacy profile in third line LBCL, but also in earlier lines of therapy. For ZUMA-7 data in second-line LBCL, FDA has set a PDUFA date of April 1st when we hope Yescarta will be granted approval. In the meantime, the Kite team is ramping up manufacturing capacity to meet the anticipated demand. Kite expects the new Maryland facility to begin commercial operations by Q2. Combined with the Amsterdam and El Segundo facilities, we expect to increase operational capacity by up to 50% by the end of this year. Christi is here with the team and available to take questions on cell therapy during our Q&A. In closing, our oncology sales were $1.25 billion in 2021 and we expect robust growth in the coming years. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Merdad for pipeline updates. Merdad Parsey : Thanks, Johanna. Good afternoon, everyone. Building on what both Johanna and Dan have said, the Gilead team rounded out a very strong 2021 with further progress across our portfolio. In 2021 alone, we began enrolling patients in 13 oncology, 13 virology, and 4 inflammation trials, and we have recently shared the initial details of the ambitious development programs we are targeting for 2022. As we look forward, we are confident that we have the foundation to continue to build a robust, diverse portfolio across our three focus therapeutic areas. First, on slide 16, Veklury continues to play a vital role in the fight against COVID-19. Veklury was the first approved treatment for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We have received expanded indication labels in the U.S. and EU. In December, the European Commission approved a variation to the Conditional Marketing Authorization for Veklury for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults not on supplemental oxygen. And last month, based on data from the Phase 3 PINETREE study, the FDA expanded the approval of Veklury to include non-hospitalized patients at high risk for COVID-19 disease progression. These expanded indications speak to the activity of Veklury against the coronavirus variants we have seen so far, including Omicron. We believe there will continue to be a need for Veklury delivered intravenously, especially for higher risk patients. The potential for continued COVID-19 variants and infections highlight the need for more convenient oral formulations to expand the options for outpatients. As such, we have just initiated a Phase 1 trial of GS-5245, a novel oral COVID-19 nucleoside, that once metabolized, works in the same way as remdesivir. Pending data, the evolving pandemic landscape, and discussions with regulatory agencies, we are hoping to initiate a registrational trial before the end of the year. Moving to HIV on slide 17, we shared an overview of some of our long-acting development activities a few weeks ago, to highlight the diversity of our portfolio and how it targets the entire HIV life cycle. We continue to believe that our investigational agent lenacapavir is a unique and foundational asset, given its potential for extended dosing, in addition to the compelling efficacy and safety profile highlighted in the CAPELLA and CALIBRATE studies. Next, on slide 18, you can see our current clinical efforts with long-acting HIV therapeutics. As previously announced, the Phase 2 study evaluating the oral combination of lenacapavir with Merck\u2019s islatravir is on partial clinical hold, and Merck remains in discussions with FDA on next steps islatravir. In the meantime, we at Gilead continue to develop a number of other potential partner agents for lenacapavir in HIV treatment and look forward to sharing some more detail on these programs at our Virology Deep Dive later this month. We remain confident and excited about lenacapavir\u2019s future potential to deliver options for people living with HIV or those who could benefit from PrEP. I want to be very clear that the recent clinical hold for the lenacapavir trials, which the FDA initiated in December, is not associated with the lenacapavir molecule itself. Rather, the hold reflects concern about the compatibility of certain vials with the lenacapavir solution. We continue to work with the FDA to remediate the concern and to agree on a path to resume these trials. We are hopeful this can be achieved quickly. As such, we continue to expect an FDA decision for lenacapavir in heavily treatment experienced individuals in the first half of 2022. If successful, lenacapavir will become the first available six-month, long-acting subcutaneous injection for the treatment of HIV. Next, moving to Trodelvy on slide 18, I\u2019m pleased to confirm that we now expect to share both top-line progression-free survival data as well as the first planned interim analysis of overall survival from TROPiCS-02 in March. There\u2019s been a convergence of events for PFS and OS such that we will be able to conduct and report a single analysis of these outcomes rather than have two analyses separated by a short interval. Gilead remains blinded to the data, and we are excited to be able to share this more complete view later this quarter. We are targeting an sBLA filing in the second half of 2022, depending, of course, on the readout. If the data are positive, we believe that Trodelvy could represent a very important treatment option for HR+/HER2- patients who are hormone refractory and have very limited options. Reflecting our confidence in Trodelvy overall, we are expanding the number of clinical programs in 2022 to evaluate effectiveness in breast, lung and bladder cancers, with plans to initiate study start-up activities for at least 7 Phase 3 trials. Three of these are expected to enroll their first patients in 2022, including two in front line metastatic TNBC and another in front-line non-small cell lung cancer study that will be led by Merck. Going forward, we will separately disclose trial start up activities versus FPI milestones. Additionally, in the first half of this year, we plan to add a combination of Trodelvy with other Gilead portfolio assets as a study or an additional cohort in an existing study. We look forward to sharing more details at our upcoming Oncology Deep Dive in April. This is another example of the versatility and tremendous potential that Trodelvy, along with the growing oncology portfolio, can generate. Next slide, onto magrolimab. Early last week, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold pausing enrollment and screening in trials and cohorts in the U.S. evaluating magrolimab in combination with azacitidine following review of a preliminary data set suggesting an apparent imbalance in investigator reported SUSARs, or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, between treatment groups in our ongoing Phase 3 trial in high-risk MDS. A subsequent partial clinical hold has been placed on the Phase 2 multiple myeloma study and the fully enrolled Phase 2 DLBCL study. Importantly, patients currently enrolled in our magrolimab studies can continue treatment and our compassionate use programs remain open. We are working with FDA to take a comprehensive look at the safety data, and we will share the outcome as quickly as we can. In the meantime, we remain committed to the magrolimab development program and believe that it has the potential to address an important unmet medical need in these seriously ill patients. As you know, the patients in our ENHANCE Phase 3 trial have a very high unmet need, with a median overall survival of only 1 to 3 years on the current standard of care. Separate and prior to the partial clinical hold, our Phase 1b single arm study in higher risk MDS no longer has a viable path to submission based on regulatory feedback. As such, we will remain focused on our Phase 3 ENHANCE study and look forward to sharing the 1b data at an upcoming scientific meeting. Next, moving to cell therapy on slide 21, on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, I will share a brief update on the impressive data Kite presented at ASH last December. First, as you may recall, in 2020 we shared that Yescarta had a four-year overall survival rate of 44% in third-line LBCL patients. At ASH in December, we presented five-year data from ZUMA-1 in third-line LBCL patients showing Yescarta demonstrated a remarkable and durable 43% overall survival rate, stable since our four-year update. Additionally, 92% of the patients who remained alive at five years have not needed any additional cancer treatment since their one-time infusion of Yescarta. It\u2019s truly inspiring to see this type of durability for CAR T cell therapies. As announced yesterday, the FDA approved a label update for Yescarta to include use of prophylactic corticosteroids across all approved indications. Adding prophylactic steroid use can improve the management of certain side effects without compromising the activity of Yescarta. For example, the FDA label now shows no grade 3 or greater cytokine release syndrome events occurred using the Cohort 6 protocol, as compared to 13% in the original label. This label update complements data published in 2021 showing 68% of patients had no CRS or neurologic events within 72 hours of Yescarta infusion. As we look to earlier lines of treatment, the landmark ZUMA-7 trial evaluating Yescarta in second-line relapsed/refractory LBCL demonstrated a greater than 4-fold increase in median event free survival, or EFS, compared to standard of care through two years of follow-up. As you can see on the slide, the EFS curve for Yescarta is compelling. The sBLA was filed last quarter and we expect an FDA decision by April of this year. In terms of the first-line LBCL data, Yescarta demonstrated 89% overall response rate in high-risk patients, and 78% complete response with a median follow-up of 15.9 months. Given these encouraging data, the Kite team is in discussions with regulatory authorities on a potential path forward in front line LBCL. And finally, on slide 22, we highlight key 2022 catalysts across the portfolio, many of which I have just mentioned. I\u2019d also like to take a moment to highlight the three Arcus milestones in second half of this year. Last quarter, Gilead opted in to the three Arcus programs, which added four assets to our portfolio : domvanalimab, an Fc silent anti-TIGIT antibody; AB308, an Fc active anti-TIGIT antibody; etrumadenant, an adenosine receptor antagonist; and quemliclustat, a small molecule CD73 inhibitor. Together with Arcus, we expect to share ARC-7 Phase 2 PFS data in the second half of 2022, which will include data for the zimberelimab monotherapy, zim and dom doublet, as well as the zim, dom and etruma triplet arm. We look forward to sharing data when available and are very excited to collaborate more closely with Arcus to accelerate future development plans. On slide 23, you can see that Gilead\u2019s portfolio now encompasses 55 clinical stage programs, nearly doubling since 2019. Given the exciting potential of our portfolio across virology, oncology, and even early stage inflammation assets, this is just the beginning. Our teams are committed to advancing the most promising programs that will help transform patient outcomes, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you over the coming quarters and years. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Andy. Andrew Dickinson : Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. It was a strong close to 2021, driven primarily by strong HIV and Veklury revenue in the fourth quarter. For the full year, and excluding the impact of the LOEs, HIV grew 4% year-over-year, driven by the continued outperformance of Biktarvy, which achieved record U.S. market share of 42%, and sales of $8.6 billion, up 19% from 2020. Oncology was another highlight from both a pipeline and revenue perspective, with full year cell therapy sales of $871 million growing 43% from 2020, and Trodelvy sales of $380 million in its first full year. By 2030, we anticipate our oncology franchise will represent at least a third of our total revenue. Before I get into the normal P&L review and 2022 guidance, I want to address the EPS results for this quarter upfront. Slide 25 highlights two sizeable expenses that occurred after we gave our last guidance in October. First, and subsequent to the exercise of Gilead\u2019s opt-in to four Arcus assets in December, our fourth quarter results reflect a net charge of $625 million, recorded in R&D. This charge reflects our $725 million option payment recognized in Q4 less $100 million that was previously accrued. This impacted our EPS by about $0.38 in Q4 and for the full year. Second, and as part of a legal settlement with ViiV and related parties, we have agreed to make a one-time $1.25 billion payment, in addition to an ongoing 3% royalty for future sales of Biktarvy and the bictegravir component of bictegravir-containing products in the United States. This royalty extends until October 5 of 2027. The $1.25 billion payment is recorded in our fourth quarter results and reflected in our cost of goods sold. This charge constituted an approximately 17% impact to gross margin in the fourth quarter, and it impacted our EPS by $0.80 for Q4 2021 and the full year. Going forward, we expect the impact of this new royalty to be approximately 1% on our gross margin, starting in the first quarter of 2022. Excluding these items, and their combined $1.18 impact, our full year non-GAAP EPS would have exceeded the guidance range that we set back in October, helped by stronger than expected Veklury sales. Moving back to our quarterly review on slide 26, fourth quarter revenue in our base business included HIV product sales growth of 7% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Veklury sales were higher than expected due to start of the Omicron surge. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 70.5%, impacted by the legal settlement that I referenced earlier, and non-GAAP R&D was impacted by the Arcus opt-in, resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $0.69 per share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 32.2%, reflecting tax expense related to uncertain tax positions, an increase in valuation allowance, as well as the impact of discrete tax benefits related to legal settlements with tax authorities in 2020 that did not recur this year. For the full year, on slide 27, total product sales of $27 billion grew 11% driven by Veklury. Excluding Veklury, total product sales were roughly flat at $21.4 billion as growth in Biktarvy and oncology offset the $1.3 billion impact of the Truvada and Atripla LOEs in the United States. I touched on the main P&L impacts in the fourth quarter discussion, but will highlight that our non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2021 was 20.4%, despite the higher effective tax rate in the fourth quarter. Moving now to slide 28. Our 2022 guidance assumes that the recent Omicron surge represents the only major COVID-19 wave for 2022, and that our HIV business will continue to recover from the pandemic. With that in mind, we expect Product Sales in the range of $23.8 billion to $24.3 billion. Excluding Veklury, we expect product sales in the range of $21.8 billion to $22.3 billion, representing growth of 2% to 4% for our base business year-over-year. Relative to Q1, I\u2019ll remind you to expect HIV revenue to decline sequentially. This is a normal dynamic for HIV due to inventory and seasonal pricing impacts, and you\u2019ll recall last year HIV revenue declined 14% sequentially in Q1 \u201821 from Q4 of 2020. For Q122, we expect a larger sequential decline, given the favorable Q4 \u201821 changes to gross to net estimates that Johanna mentioned earlier. Nonetheless, we expect a strong year overall for our HIV business and continued growth in the subsequent quarters. Looking beyond Q1, we expect the impact of the Truvada and Atripla LOEs will be largely behind us starting in Q2, and we look forward to accelerating growth in our HIV business during the remainder of the year. For the full year 2022, we expect Veklury sales of approximately $2 billion. This assumes, as I previously indicated, that Omicron will represent the only major surge for the year, with Veklury revenue heavily weighted in the first quarter. That said, the pandemic continues to be dynamic, and we will update you on our Veklury expectations on a quarterly basis, consistent with our recent practice. Moving to the rest of the P&L. We expect our non-GAAP product gross margin to be approximately 85% to 86%, consistent with our historic guidance and allowing for the 3% royalty associated with the legal settlement. For non-GAAP operating expenses, we expect R&D to decrease by a mid-single digit percentage compared to 2021 levels. This decline is driven by the net $625 million charge related to the Arcus opt-in in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding this, we expect full year R&D expense to increase by a mid-to-high single digit percentage compared to 2021 levels. We expect SG&A to be approximately flat on a dollar basis compared to 2021. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20% this year. Finally, we expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $6.20 and $6.70 for the full-year, and GAAP diluted EPS to be between $4.70 and $5.20. On capital allocation, our priorities have not changed. We continued to invest in our business while, at the same time, we returned over $4 billion in 2021 to our shareholders, through dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we repaid $4.75 billion of debt in 2021. For 2022, we plan to repay $1.5 billion of debt, of which, we repaid $500 million this morning. With that, I will invite the operator to begin the Q&A. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Dan or Andy, maybe a higher level strategic question. I wanted to ask about your comments regarding long-term oncology sales. And the question is, are you comfortable with the aggregate assets in the portfolio? Do you think you\u2019ll need to be more aggressive on BD either to drive more near-term growth or looking longer term to have higher impact assets? Daniel O\u2019Day: Thanks, Jeff. Thanks for the question and teaming. I\u2019ll start and then hand it over to Andy. So, yes, I mean, the guide that we gave at JP Morgan was that we are confident in our ability to grow and to also have oncology by 2030 be at least a third of our overall revenue on top of a solid HIV business and virology business overall. I think, the answer to the question, Geoff, is we believe we have everything in-house to be able to fulfill on that commitment today. I mean, the number of options that we have with Trodelvy, with magrolimab, with the Arcus assets and with Cell Therapy from an oncology base provides tremendous opportunity for us to look alone and in combination of that portfolio in the coming years. And that specifically leads to the more than 30 clinical trials we have ongoing right now in our oncology portfolio. And our guide that this year will start at least another 20 in the oncology space. So really, that\u2019s the armamentarium behind our commitment and our growth. Of course, we\u2019ll continue to be opportunistic around business development and look for supplemental options out there that can complement this portfolio as a course of normal business as any healthy company should. Having said that, we really do have enough in-house to be able to fill up on that commitment. So, with that, Andy, I may have stolen all your thunder, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have some additional perspectives. Andrew Dickinson : Yes. Geoff, thank you for the question. I think it\u2019s an important question, especially in the context of the magrolimab clinical hold that maybe underpinning the question specifically. But the answer is relatively simple. We have a very strong set of assets already. The guidance that we provided at JP Morgan does not actually include all of the assets or all the indications for all the assets. So, there\u2019s a lot of ways for us to get there. We have complete confidence in where we\u2019re going, and we don\u2019t expect to change our BD strategy as a result of any of the recent developments. We\u2019re actually really excited about where we are. And there\u2019s a lot of upside to that of other assets, whether it\u2019s some of the earlier Arcus assets or the Tizona or Pionyr assets, as examples, provide additional options for patients. So, when you talk about high-impact assets, I would just summarize by saying, we already think that we have a great portfolio of high-impact assets in oncology, we\u2019re incredibly pleased with what we\u2019ve put together and nothing that\u2019s happened recently has changed that in any way. So, thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : Maybe a question for Merdad. So, in the light of new data that are emerging in HR positive and HER2-negative breast cancer, do you have any updated thoughts on how to think about overall survival in the treatment and control arms for TROPiCS-02 vis-\u00e0-vis the expectation or the assumptions in clinical trials, which I think, if I\u2019m not mistaken, 12 months for the control and 16.5 months for the treatment? So, how should we think about OS? Thank you. Daniel O\u2019Day: Thanks, Mohit. Directly over to you, Merdad. Merdad Parsey : Yes. Thanks, Mohit. It\u2019s a great question. And I think as I mentioned in my call, I think we\u2019re excited that we\u2019re going to be able to share the first interim analysis from the OS as well when we do the readout here for the PFS. So, I do think we\u2019ll look at both at the same time. You\u2019re absolutely right that there are developments in the HR-positive space, but I continue to believe, and I think that the impact on both PFS -- on PFS in particular here, but also OS continues to be, I think, if we see something in the ballpark of what you just described, we\u2019re confident that that remains incredibly clinically relevant for people suffering with HR-positive HER2-negative. It is, as you state, an increasingly competitive area, but we do think that that remains a key milestone for patients if we can achieve that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JP Morgan. Cory Kasimov : I wanted to follow up as well on the TROPiCS-02 study. And maybe, Merdad, can you talk about how you see the potential significance of this convergence of events that you alluded to when thinking about both progression-free survival and overall survival? Did you see any implications from this, or is this kind of moving along the lines as you would have expected it to? Merdad Parsey : Yes. Great question, and thanks for asking it. I think I\u2019m very reassured I would not read anything into this other than the fact that we\u2019ve been, as you can imagine, keeping track of the PFS events and the OS events all along. And we\u2019ve now gotten to the point where those OS events have occurred in a time frame that allows us to look at both of these events at the same time. I don\u2019t think it really says anything about -- I think what you\u2019re getting at is does it have any implications for the underlying positive or negative or anything like that. And I really don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way to interpret that right now. It would be pure speculation to think that there\u2019s some underlying driver of bringing those endpoints together. And actually, it\u2019s not that unexpected. It\u2019s a little bit closer than we thought it would be, but not by that much. So, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it. I\u2019m just excited we\u2019ll be able to do it. It will be a more robust look. And I think as I\u2019ve said before, we think the regulators are going to want to see those robust looks at the OS to help them with sort of, in a sense, supporting the PFS endpoint. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets. Brian Abrahams : I wanted to better understand the potential signals from magrolimab. I think you guys have said that you haven\u2019t observed any clear AE trend. I was curious, where is the disconnect versus what the FDA and investigator concerns are here? And maybe talk a little bit about the potential path to resolution, what additional safety data would be needed and your level of confidence you will reach a resolution? Thanks. Daniel O\u2019Day: That\u2019s great. Thanks, Brian. Merdad Parsey : Thanks, Cory. Yes. So look, I think the way to think about it is some of -- there have been a couple of events that the agency wants to make sure that they have a chance to look at the overall safety profile. I remain blinded to the safety data. So, what is going on is we are gathering the safety data, and we\u2019re going to share it with the FDA and with the data monitoring committee. I can tell you that we feel that these are temporary challenges right now and we\u2019re going to work through resolving it as quickly as possible. I don\u2019t think these challenges really shake our confidence for the portfolio overall and our overall strategy hasn\u2019t changed. We\u2019re really committed to the macro development program, and we think that it really continues to have the potential to really address -- an important unmet medical need. The only thing I\u2019d add is, remember, these are very generally pretty sick patients. And with that underlying illness, I think it\u2019s appropriate to be cautious to make sure that we\u2019re striking the right balance as we go forward. But we\u2019ll work through it by looking at the overall safety at the overall safety profile, Brian, and make sure that we are able to resolve those issues with the FDA. Daniel O\u2019Day: And Brian, we\u2019ll keep you informed as that evolves. We have obviously a lot of patients on magrolimab that continue to be served by magrolimab. So, we have a sense of urgency in working with the agency around this. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Salveen Richter : You referred to the Arcus portfolio. Can you just comment on what you\u2019re most excited about outside of TIGIT and when you might start the triplet study? Daniel O\u2019Day: Sure. Merdad, why don\u2019t you start on that? Merdad Parsey : Sure. I think in addition to the TIGIT asset, as you know, the adenosine portfolio, if you will, the 2 molecules, the 2 inhibitors of adenosine, both in terms of the synthesis inhibitor, CD73, as well as the receptor blocker are really interesting to us. They\u2019re early programs, but we think that there is a real potential for those assets to provide significant upside to treatment, both in terms of where -- in lung cancer, where we think there\u2019s some -- the trial that\u2019s ongoing that is looking at the addition of adenosine inhibition to TIGIT plus PD-1 as well as in some of the indications that Arcus is evaluating with monotherapy in particular, pancreatic cancer. So, I think for us, there are a number of opportunities there and the broad potential of adenosine inhibitors to add on to immuno-oncology in general and TIGIT plus PD-1 in particular really strike us is a really great opportunity that hopefully as the data mature, we\u2019ll be able to share more and really underpin the optimism we have around where those programs are headed. Daniel O\u2019Day: Right. And I think there was a question around when to start the... Merdad Parsey : And then the triplet study, yes, we\u2019ll -- we haven\u2019t announced that yet. We need to work through some details. Thanks for reminding me, Dan. We\u2019re working through some approach. Really, the question here for us is how to go from the doublet, where we\u2019re really looking at a TIGIT inhibitor being an unapproved agent, right, and then potentially bringing in a second unapproved agent. So we have to work through in a sense, the regulatory complications of how we have to sequence and stage those studies to allow us to assess the contribution of components such that we can move forward aggressively. So, we\u2019re working really closely with our adenosine colleague -- our adenosine colleagues, our Arcus colleagues, and we\u2019ll work through the regulatory pathways to make sure that we can get to a robust base Phase 3 trials with those. So, as we do so, we\u2019ll certainly share the timing in the pathway. Daniel O\u2019Day: And Salveen, the only thing I\u2019d add on top of Merdad\u2019s eloquent response is the potential to combine this attractive portfolio for markets with other medicines that we have within Gilead, including Trodelvy and possibly magrolimab and others, so his combination of having access to a PD-1 2 TIGIT compounds to adenosine combined with Trodelvy provides a rich opportunity to look at rational-based combinations. And we\u2019ll be getting more into that as we do a deeper dive in oncology as a starting point in April. And then obviously, throughout the year, we\u2019ll continue to update you on that. And it\u2019s one of the major reasons why opting in early was important to us because we can work really fluidly now across a very rich portfolio. And with the additional expertise and colleagues from Arcus, it really expands all of our potential and clinical science and beyond. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Michael Yee : Maybe back to Merdad on Trodelvy, appreciating that I know there\u2019s a lot of focus on this interim OS. I would love to give you the opportunity to perhaps frame expectations at an interim. Interims have different connotations and there\u2019s different interims at different percent of events that have accrued. So, could you just explain what percent of events this interim is based on? Do you actually expect to hit stat significant, or do you just expecting a trend of a few months? Maybe just talk to that a bit, because I think there\u2019s different implications of just an interim. Daniel O\u2019Day: Yes. Thanks, Michael. And maybe just a suggestion, as you answer, Michael\u2019s specific question, it might be helpful for the whole audience to hear again kind of your overall view of the potential success of this indication. Merdad Parsey : Yes. Michael, it\u2019s a great question. And I think, thank you for asking it. So, as a reminder, I think from a PFS standpoint, the primary endpoint of the study, we believe we\u2019re really well powered to detect a difference there. And as I\u2019ll remind folks, we did redesign the study a year ago in order to power the study adequately for OS as well. I would -- I think as excited as I am that we will be able to report out that first interim analysis, Michael, you\u2019re absolutely right on that. I would not expect statistical significance at this first interim because it is relatively early in the time frame that we\u2019re seeing. So, my expectation is that again, pending a positive outcome that we are well powered to see a PFS improvement at a statistically significant level. And the OS will be supportive data at that point that will give us directionality as to where we\u2019re headed. And then hopefully, subsequent to that as the events accrue, we\u2019ll see where we\u2019re headed with OS and down the road. It\u2019s a great question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Ronny Gal : Switching over to talk a little bit about Yescarta. Can you tell us if there\u2019s already impact, the use of Yescarta in second line, or is it still ahead of us? And you\u2019ve mentioned you\u2019re increasing your capacity by 50%. Are you currently capacity-constrained or demand-constrained? Essentially, will all that demand be used if it comes on line? Daniel O\u2019Day: Yes. Thanks, Ronny. And as I turn it over to Christi, let me just say how many patients we\u2019ve been able to impact with cell therapy in 2021, and that being just the beginning, I think, of our promise for the future. We certainly invested in the manufacturing capacity to anticipate demand and success in the second-line, and Christi can go into the details with you. Christi, over to you. Christi Shaw : Thanks, Dan. Thanks for the question. Yes, we\u2019re very excited about not only the second-line, which is the most important to help the most patients, but the continued success of third line plus with the five-year data that was presented at ASH where year four, you saw 43% of patients still alive, and at -- 44% of the patients still on life of four years and 43% at five years, which I think you heard Merdad say. So, based on those as well as new indications coming out, we\u2019re really seeing an increase in demand. Our capacity, we\u2019re well positioned. We have the El Segundo manufacturing site here in California. Amsterdam was approved during COVID and with up to its capacity by the end of last year. And now, we have the Maryland site, which will be going online in the first half of this year where you\u2019ll see our automation as well. So, not only increasing capacity, but also the ability to reduce costs. So, things are coming along nicely in terms of our ability to deliver, and we still have that reliability of 97% success when we give the cells back, which is so critically important to patients. So, not a capacity issue. We had a transparency, a couple of issues last year where we had a scheduling issue where physicians were asking for the exact same slot all at the same time. And we quickly addressed that and no longer have that concern. So, we\u2019re doing well and preparing for, hopefully, what we\u2019ll see is helping a lot more patients stay live a lot longer. Daniel O\u2019Day: Thanks so much, Christi. And overall, Ronny, we\u2019re expecting about a 50% increase in capacity over the course of 2022, so continued investment there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow from UBS. Colin Bristow : On magrolimab, maybe could you explain why the multiple myeloma and DLBCL trials were also on hold given they\u2019re not in combination with aza? And then, just somewhat related to that, the $1.50 in acquisition-related expenses in the \u201822 guide, is there any component of that, that\u2019s related to the Forty Seven acquisition. Daniel O\u2019Day: Great. So I\u2019ll have Andy answer the second. Maybe you want to touch base on the first, Merdad, also telling about the stage of those 2 trials. Merdad Parsey : Yes, it\u2019s really important to -- I think this may have not been entirely clear. First of all, I think -- look, I think whenever there\u2019s a safety question, the agency is going to err on the side of being cautious. And so we\u2019ll work through with them on how to go forward. And I agree in those studies, we are not combining with azacitidine. So again, I think as we share the data and the analysis with the agency, hopefully, we can come to resolution sooner than later. And it\u2019s important to note that for the multiple myeloma study, we actually hadn\u2019t really started enrolling patients at that point. So I think that was one consideration. And by contrast for the DLBCL study, that is completely enrolled. So, the partial hold there actually doesn\u2019t have much of a practical impact on that study because we\u2019re going to continue dosing the patients who are already enrolled in that study. So, I think -- remember that the way it works is maybe the context here, the holds are placed on an IND, not on a study-by-study basis, generally. So, this was a hold to the IND. And so, that\u2019s sort of the context to think about it. I\u2019ll hand it off to Andy to answer the second part of the question. Andrew Dickinson : I\u2019m not sure that I fully understood the question, but what I can tell you is none of the -- none of the updates that we provided in terms of the onetime fourth quarter expenses nor none of our 2022 guidance has anything to do with expenses. So you and I can maybe talk separately to understand what your question is specifically, but there\u2019s nothing related to or the Forty Seven acquisition that was either part of our fourth quarter update, year-end update or part of the 2022 guide specifically. Daniel O\u2019Day: Thanks, Colin. Happy to take that up separately, too. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Hartaj Singh from Oppenheimer. Hartaj Singh : This is just a question on Veklury. You\u2019re starting to get a pretty consistent franchise there. I mean, unfortunately, COVID-19 is still out there. Various experts have indicated and even some of the companies we cover, we\u2019re going from a pandemic to an endemic kind of state over this year into next year. How do we -- how do you think of Veklury going forward? I know it\u2019s difficult to give guidance there, but you\u2019ve got a year and a half worth of data underneath your belt. How are you thinking of hospitalizations going forward, whether that\u2019s through breakthrough infections, or do you see as unvaccinated individuals get less and less that hospitalization will concomitantly decrease? Any thoughts there? And then, assuming the oral program gets approved, how do you see remdesivir IV and then the oral option working together going forward? And again, thanks for the questions, and a really nice quarter. Daniel O\u2019Day: Thanks, Hartaj. So, I think Johanna can start with some of the pandemic -- endemic and then Merdad could also comment a little bit on the forward portfolio. But please, Johanna, over to you. Johanna Mercier : Thanks, Hartaj, for the question. Basically, what we\u2019ve seen since the very beginning is how that Veklury sales truly track to the hospitalizations. And we\u2019ve seen that most recently again with the Omicron surge. What we did see as well is the fact that -- despite the fact that Omicron seemed to may be less severe impact, unfortunately, the number of cases were much greater and therefore just the pure absolute numbers of hospitalizations went up. And so, we\u2019ve tracked every single time pretty much in line, parallel to the hospitalization rates. And we assume that will continue. We do think the hospitalizations will get impacted by some of the oral compounds, even some of the outpatient use of Veklury, but also neutralizing antibodies as well as the oral treatments as well like the PI from Pfizer. And so, we do think that will decrease hospitalizations over time. The one thing we had assumed maybe about a year ago is we really thought the vaccination rates would continue to rise and they didn\u2019t. They basically stabilize at around the 60%, 65% rate. And of course, there are variances across the country. So, what we\u2019ve seen is the use of different treatments as well as the vaccinations -- the vaccination rates are really dictating a little bit kind of the hospitalizations and therefore, the Veklury usage. And yet again, in the December, January time frame, we\u2019ve really seen Veklury play a critical role here for these hospitalizations, also having to do with the fact that many of the other previous agents that were on the market were no longer effective against the Omicron variant. And we haven\u2019t seen any of that. We\u2019ve seen very strong efficacy with Veklury, which has also helped that. I think most recently, the outpatient data that\u2019s just come out in addition to the indication really plays a critical role when there are surges and hospitals are overcapacity, so that they really can look at outpatient setting with Veklury, and we think that will just kind of play hand in hand. And I would propose, as I turn it over to Merdad to address the oral piece of the puzzle, I actually think you need both. I think you need the oral setting, so more players in the oral setting is critical and you still need hospitalizations because, unfortunately, as this -- if it does become endemic, I do think you\u2019ll see a steady rate of hospitalizations as we go through, and that\u2019s where Veklury plays a critical role. Merdad? Merdad Parsey : Yes. Thanks. And I guess, I\u2019d make two points. The first is, is very early days with the oral program. And so, I would keep that in mind. We just started Phase 1. So, a lot of things can happen. And so I would just keep that in mind. Obviously, if things go well, we\u2019ll move as aggressively as possible. And I agree with Johanna. I think that there will always be a role for both oral and IV therapies. There will be a -- what we\u2019re seeing now, I think, in terms of how folks are approaching it is that as availability of oral therapies becomes broader, they\u2019re used relatively early in the course of disease. Many people may progress and/or not get treated early enough and end up in the hospital. And at that point, I think that\u2019s where that hospitalized or carry hospitalization more severe disease is where the role of IV therapies is going to come in, Veklury in particular is going to come in. So, I have too much to add to what Johanna said, but I do think there\u2019ll be a role for both in the long run. Daniel O\u2019Day: Hartaj, just to complement what Johanna and Merdad said, I think we clearly see that as this becomes endemic that there\u2019ll be potentially a need for multiple mechanisms in the outpatient setting. So, that\u2019s one of the reasons why approaching it from a preliminary standpoint as well as to a protease standpoint, we think could make sense over the long term for resistance patterns. And the last thing I\u2019ll say is I think what we\u2019ve seen this, whether it\u2019s pandemic or endemic, remdesivir is going to firmly trench now as a standard of care in the hospital setting. And so, as goes hospitalization, so will go remdesivir over time, and we think that\u2019s going to be an important part of our ongoing business and our benefit to patients. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould from Barclays. Carter Gould : I wanted to come back to Trodelvy but a little bit more from the commercial and strategic angle and wanted to -- just sort of the decision to triple the sales force at this point, ahead of TROPiCS-02, is that decision dependent upon positive data from TROPiCS-02, or could that potentially be revisited, depending on that outcome? And then, specifically around sort of what you\u2019re seeing in -- with the sales, it seems like the growth on an absolute basis quarter-on-quarter does seem to be sort of slowing a bit. Can you maybe just talk about how the real-world duration of use has maybe evolved, and if that\u2019s sort of in line with what you saw in the studies -- in the pivotal studies? Thank you. Daniel O\u2019Day: Thanks, Carter. Right over to Johanna, please. Johanna Mercier : Sure, Carter. Thanks for the question. Just a couple of things. One is the footprint, the geographic footprint that we\u2019ve just initiated and that ramp-up and the tripling. It has really maybe three objectives. One is to further support our initial launches of both metastatic TNBC triple-negative breast cancer as well as bladder. So, that\u2019s definitely number one, and that is here and now. the potential to support a potential indication in HR positive, which is what you were referring to. And the third one is also setting up for the future success of our total oncology portfolio. So, assuming positive data, of course, is what we\u2019ve decided to go for, but having said that, even if that didn\u2019t play out, this is the right team for the future for Gilead Oncology. So that was the first part of your question. The second part of your question about the growth slowing, I actually think we\u2019re quite pleased, actually, as we got into Q4, what we\u2019ve seen is the share really drive up post NCCN breast guidelines update in September. And so, we had good data point of share. The last data point we have is October, and that\u2019s the 1 in 4 that you heard me talk about earlier. And so, that\u2019s doubling from where we were in April. So, we were at about half of that share in second line. And now we\u2019re at about 24%, 25% share in second line. So, a real nice growth on that front and definitely more to come. I think there\u2019s an incredible opportunity for Trodelvy in this patient setting, especially with the high unmet medical need and the incredible OS data that we have with Trodelvy. So more to come on that. Daniel O\u2019Day: Terrific. Thank you so much, Carter. We can take one last question, everybody. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : Just one clarification and one question. So, for Merdad, can you just clarify, it was unclear to me from your comments whether the FDA had asked for the OS data, and that\u2019s why you were including this interim now for the filing or if that had been your plan all along. So, if you could just clarify that would be great. And then, second, any comments you can make specifically around the stocking tailwind as well as the gross to net tailwind that you have from HIV in the fourth quarter? Thanks. Daniel O\u2019Day: Thanks a lot, Matthew. We\u2019ll go to Merdad and then Johanna. Merdad Parsey : Yes, very quickly. I think as I mentioned, we did upsize the study last year for OS because we\u2019ve always believed, especially in HR-positive that having OS data are going to be important to support a file. It\u2019s not the primary endpoint, and we think it\u2019s going to be important supportive data to go. So, that didn\u2019t really have much to do with this confluence of events here. It\u2019s a fortuitous event in terms of timing here that will support our data. So hopefully, that answers... Daniel O\u2019Day: The FDA did not ask for it. Merdad Parsey : The FDA didn\u2019t specifically ask us for it. No. It\u2019s always -- we\u2019re always going to take a look at OS with the first PFS data cut at this point in order -- instead of doing a look and then an interim, we\u2019re just going to do the PFS and the interim at the same time. Daniel O\u2019Day: Thanks, Matthew. Johanna? Johanna Mercier : And Matthew, the second part of your question around the Q4 piece of the puzzle. So, as you well know, right, as you go into Q4, you usually have a bit of a seasonal inventory build in the subchannel play. And then, of course, that bleeds out in Q1. So, that\u2019s one piece of the puzzle. In Q1, the other difference is, of course, you increased your co-pay support, your donut hole coverage and so all those pieces and your payer mix kind of changes in your first quarter. Having said that, in addition to that, there was some favorability in Q4 of 2021 from a gross-to-net standpoint, which will then create an even bigger kind of decline in Q1, and that\u2019s what we were referring to. So, hopefully, that helps a little bit. It\u2019s a onetime thing in Q4. And it\u2019s just more around the comparison versus Q1 over Q4 as we get through the first quarter, and that\u2019s what I was trying to signal. Daniel O\u2019Day: Great, Matthew. And I just want to, before I turn it over to Jacquie, thank all of you for joining from our perspective. We are really excited about the build that we\u2019ve had at Gilead over the past two years and the team and the people that we have on board. We\u2019ve got a lot to do this year, and we\u2019re really teed up for a good strong year and a strong decade ahead with this portfolio. With that, Jacquie, over to you, please. Jacquie Ross : Thank you, Dan, and thanks to our operator, Gigi, for your help today, and indeed to all of you for joining us. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and hope that you can join us for our Virology Deep Dive scheduled for Thursday, the 17th of February. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

I will now like to hand the call over to your host for today's program, Jacquie Ross, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jacquie Ross : Thank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the first quarter of 2022. The press release, slides and supplementary data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com.  The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer; Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open up the call to Q&A where the team will be joined by Christi Shaw, the Chief Executive Officer of Kite.  Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including those related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gilead's business, financial condition and results of operations, plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations, financial projections and the use of capital, and 2022 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.  Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, in our supplementary data sheet as well as on the Gilead website.  Now I'll turn the call over to Dan. Daniel O'Day: Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everybody. We appreciate you taking the time with Gilead today, and I also want to thank those of you who joined our virology and oncology deep dives over the last few months. These 2 events provided a more in-depth view of our portfolio, our strategy and the teams behind them. We shared a much broader view of our growing clinical pipeline than we had in the past, highlighting its potential to deliver a number of new therapies to address unmet needs for patients across a diverse range of conditions.  For those of you who joined, I hope you got a deeper sense of why we're confident of sustaining our leadership in virology and growing our oncology revenue so that it becomes more than 1/3 of our total revenue in 2030. I'll turn now to our performance this quarter, and I'm pleased to share that the year is off to a strong start in line with guidance, as shown on Slide 4. Total product revenue was up 3% from last year to USD 6.5 billion, with cell therapy, Veklury, Trodelvy and HIV driving growth. HIV grew 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by Biktarvy, which grew 18%, and reported more than 4% market share growth compared to the first quarter of 2021. This is notable given the impact of our Truvada LOE.  Sequentially, HIV was down 18%, primarily as a result of first quarter seasonality. Our growing oncology portfolio performed well, with Trodelvy revenue doubling compared to the first quarter of 2021 and cell therapy delivering another strong quarter of growth.  We recently expanded our portfolio of marketed cancer therapies following the FDA approval of Yescarta for second-line relapsed and refractory LBCL. I'm also pleased to highlight the FDA approval of our new cell therapy facility in Maryland, which is part of the expected 50% increase in our manufacturing capacity by the end of 2022. The new facility will support our cell therapy growth expectations over the next several years.  Moving to the pipeline. We shared the Phase III top line readout from TROPiCS-02 in March showing that the study met its primary endpoint with a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival versus physician's choice in chemotherapy. Additionally, the first interim analysis of the key secondary endpoint of overall survival demonstrated a trend in improvement.  As you know, we are exploring potential pathways for approval with regulatory authorities to bring Trodelvy to these later-stage patients. The details of the study results will be shared at ASCO in June.  At the oncology deep dive earlier this month, we highlighted the broad potential for Trodelvy across multiple tumor types and lines of therapy, with plans to initiate 13 more Trodelvy trials through 2023, including 4 more in 2022. Turning to Slide 5. As you know, the timing for TROPiCS-02 and the NDA decision for CAPELLA are subject to change. In the case of CAPELLA, this is due to the biocompatibility issue that we're working to resolve, and we're fully confident in lenacapavir itself. Other than that, we are on track with the remaining targeted milestones we shared with you in January.  We've added some of the newly disclosed trials from our oncology deep dive as well on this slide. Additionally, we're pleased to note that the partial clinical hold for the pivotal magrolimab trials, including ENHANCE free for first-line unfit AML shown on the slide have been lifted. I'm also pleased to share that despite the hold, there's no change to the timing of the first interim readout for ENHANCE for first-line high-risk MDS, which we expect in the first half of 2023. Merdad will share more pipeline details later in the call.  Before I pass it over to Johanna, I just want to take a moment to thank the Gilead and Kite teams who are putting the full weight of their expertise, passion and commitment behind all of this work that you're seeing. It's thanks to our 14,000 employees across the world that we\u2019re delivering for patients with diverse conditions and diseases today and advancing a pipeline of innovative new therapies for the future. We have some gold ambitions for the coming years, and we're confident in achieving them given the level of innovation and capabilities that we have in place today.  Now I'll invite Johanna to share an update on our first quarter commercial performance. Over to you, Johanna. Johanna Mercier : Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. So turning to Slide 7. We had a solid start to the year with total product sales, excluding Veklury, of USD 5 billion for the quarter, up 2% year-over-year driven by cell therapy, Trodelvy and HIV, and offset in part by HCV pricing dynamics. Quarter-over-quarter, total product sales, excluding Veklury, were down 14% as a result of the seasonality we typically see in the first quarter of the year, primarily in our HIV business.  On Slide 8, you can see that HIV sales were down 18% quarter-over-quarter to $3.7 billion, consistent with our guidance, given the seasonality we customarily experienced in the first quarter of every year. First, the channels build their inventories over the fourth quarter and then draw them down during Q1. On a dollar basis, the majority of the sequential decline was associated with inventory drawdown. Second, we realized lower net prices in part due to increased copay support, Part D discounts and other efforts to maintain access and affordability of our HIV medicines as patients' insurance plans reset. This is a customary Q1 dynamic that we expect to normalize throughout the rest of this year.  Year-over-year, HIV sales were up 2% driven by market growth for both treatment and PrEP, often in part by the impact of the lost exclusivity for Truvada in 2020. The year-over-year impact of this LOE is expected to be minimal starting in this quarter, second quarter of this year. And excluding the LOE impact, HIV sales increased 5%. Overall, we're encouraged by the signs of recovery seen in the HIV treatment market despite screening and diagnosis rates still below prepandemic levels and the continued impact on market growth due to the Omicron surge in Q1. As a result, both the U.S. and European HIV treatment markets were down slightly on a sequential basis. On a year-over-year basis, the European market was roughly flat, and the U.S. market grew a little over 3%. The PrEP market grew 33% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Notably, Descovy continues to hold approximately 45% market share, and we'll continue to engage with payers to ensure those who benefit from PrEP have access to their preferred regimen.  We believe Gilead remains well positioned in PrEP. And as highlighted during our virology deep dive in February, we expect the market to double by 2030, catalyzed by the launch of long-acting regimens such as lenacapavir.  Descovy sales in the first quarter were $374 million, up 4% year-over-year, driven by continued PrEP market growth and partially offset by generic competition in switches to newer treatment medicines such as Biktarvy. Turning to Slide 9. Biktarvy sales of $2.2 billion in the first quarter were up 18% year-over-year driven by U.S. market growth, and notably, continued share gains in both the U.S. and in Europe. Biktarvy remains the leading regimen for new starts and switches in the U.S. and new starts in Europe. In fact, Biktarvy share is up 4.5% year-over-year to 43% share in the U.S., almost 8x larger than the next leading promoted medicine and representing the highest share of any complete regimen for the treatment of HIV.  Moving to Slide 10 in HCV. We maintained steady market share, and the 22% decline year-over-year was primarily driven by unfavorable pricing dynamics. Sequentially, HCV was up 2%, while the overall market and new patient starts continue to be impacted by the pandemic. HBV and HDV on Slide 11 were up 7% year-over-year due to higher demand for Vemlidy, namely in Asia. Sequentially, HBV and HDV declined 11% driven by the same HBV seasonal inventory and pricing dynamics impacting HIV.  Hepcludex sales were $11 million for the quarter, primarily reflecting sales in Germany and France where full reimbursement has been established. Our discussions with regulatory values and other countries across Europe are ongoing. And of course, we look forward to potential approval in the U.S. in the second half of this year.  Veklury revenues in the first quarter were $1.5 billion, as shown on Slide 12. The clear utilization tracks hospitalization rates, and therefore, due to the timing of Omicron surges, was lower in the U.S. after January but higher in Europe and Asia later in the quarter. We're optimistic that there will not be another surge this year in the U.S. And overall, we will maintain our readiness to support hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. There's no change to our commitment to COVID-19 patients globally. And in that regard, we were very pleased to receive the World Health Organization's revised COVID-19 guidelines. These guidelines now conditionally recommend Veklury for the treatment of patients with nonsevere COVID-19 at highest risk of hospitalization. And earlier this week, Veklury received FDA approval for the treatment of certain pediatric patients for at least 28 days old, highlighting our ongoing commitment to extend the reach of Veklury where we can. Now turning to oncology. Trodelvy sales were up 103% year-over-year and 24% sequentially, as shown on Slide 13. We're encouraged by adoption not just in the U.S., but notably, in Germany and France, and continue to work with health authorities and reimbursement bodies to extend Trodelvy's reach to patients globally. We've completed the expansion of our field force to support the U.S. and Europe and believe we are now at right scale to support physicians and make Trodelvy available across all approved indications to patients who could benefit from it. We're extremely excited by the feedback from physicians about Trodelvy's impact on patients, both those who are prescribing Trodelvy today and those who expect to have access to it soon. With strong physician uptake and our expanded field footprint starting in April, we believe Trodelvy will benefit more than the 1 in 4 second-line metastatic TNBC patients we're reaching in the U.S. today.  We look forward to sharing more updates as we progress throughout the year.  Turning to Slide 14. And on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, cell therapy sales for the first quarter of 2022 were $274 million, up 43% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. For the quarter, Yescarta sales of $211 million were up 32% year-over-year and 16% sequentially driven by continued global demand in relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma as well as in follicular lymphoma. This highlights the growing recognition of the durable long-term survival benefit showcased at last December's American Society of Hematology Meeting.  For Tecartus, sales of $63 million were up 103% year-over-year due to strong demand in relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. We're pleased with the strong early uptake for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the U.S. following approval last October, which contributed to the 11% sequential growth in Tecartus.  The strong momentum we've seen across our cell therapy portfolio continued with the approval of Yescarta in second-line relapsed or refractory LBCL earlier this month as well as FDA's approval for our new Maryland manufacturing facility announced just last week. Through capacity improvements across our existing in-house CAR-T manufacturing site in addition to the new Maryland site, we expect our manufacturing capacity to increase by up to 50% and support our aspiration to serve a cumulative 25,000-plus patients by the end of 2025.  Second-line orders started coming in the day after the FDA approval and have been steady ever since. It is truly heartening to see the immediate help we can provide for patients. Given the Yescarta second-line inclusion in the NCCN guidelines and robust clinical data, we expect Yescarta to shift the paradigm in the standard of care for LBCL patients.  Christi is here with the team and is available to take any questions on cell therapy during our Q&A. And so with that, I will hand over the call to Merdad for an update on our clinical pipeline. Merdad Parsey : Thank you, Johanna, and hi, everyone. 2022 is full of clinical activity here at Gilead, and I hope the virology and oncology deep dives were helpful in highlighting the breadth and depth of our portfolio. By the end of 2022, we expect to have more than 90 clinical trials underway across oncology, virology and inflammation. With such a broad portfolio, our focus is firmly on innovation and execution to ensure that we fully leverage its potential.  Moving to HIV on Slide 16. We shared exciting 1-year data from the CAPELLA trials at CROI in February, reporting 83% virologic suppression and heavily treatment-experienced people living with multidrug-resistant HIV. Given the significant unmet need of this patient population, the lenacapavir NDA was designated prior review by the FDA, and we're planning to resubmit the NDA as soon as we resolve the clinical hold and complete response letter. As you know, the basis of these FDA actions was the compatibility of lenacapavir with vials in use at that time, not lenacapavir itself. We're an ongoing dialogue with the agency to consider an alternative vial and look forward to updating you of our progress in due course. Separately, we're on track for the HTE MAA approval in Europe in the second half of the year.  At a virology deep dive in February, we shared details of the 8 internal candidates that could partner with lenacapavir for treatment and highlighted the additional early development or discovery assets shown on Slide 17. In addition to our PrEP programs, these assets give us a high degree of confidence that Gilead will sustain its leadership in HIV through the 2020s and beyond. In the immediate term, we continue to generate very strong data for Biktarvy. At CROI, we showed biologic suppression at or above 98% in the MA analysis and 0 cases of treatment failure due to resistance to any components of the single-tablet regimen in 2 5-year Phase III trials. Of note, this 5-year duration is unprecedented for an HIV regimen.  Moving to Slide 18. Veklury is playing an important role in the fight against COVID-19 and is the only antiviral approved for use in both hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. Just in the past few days, the FDA approved an sNDA for Veklury for the treatment of pediatric patients who are at least 28 days old and either hospitalized with COVID-19 or with mild to moderate COVID-19 and considered high risk for progression to severe COVID-19.  In addition to Veklury, we have an ongoing Phase I trial GS-5245, our investigational oral COVID-19 nucleoside that once metabolized works in the same way as remdesivir. Results from this study could lead to a registrational trial. So even while we hope the worst of this pandemic is behind us, we will continue to work to ensure that COVID-19 therapies are available to as many patients as possible.  Moving to oncology, and specifically Trodelvy, on Slide 19, we'll share more detailed data from the TROPiCS-02 study at ASCO in June. As a reminder, we announced that the study minutes primary endpoint with statistically significant PFS versus physician's choice of chemotherapy in late-line patients. And that results are consistent with the Trodelvy arm in the Immunomedics-132-01 Phase I/II trial. OS showed a trended improvement at the first interim analysis, and we're now targeting a final OS analysis in 2024, depending on the timing of events.  In the meantime, we're engaging with regulatory authorities to explore potential pathways given the high unmet need. As a reminder, TROPiCS-02 targeted a more advanced patient population than best knee breast 04. The encouraging clinical data we've seen in this more challenging patient group has strengthened our excitement in exploring earlier-stage patients.  As we shared 2 weeks ago, we're planning a pivotal study for frontline HR-positive/HER2-negative patients, and we'll share more information in due course. In addition to TROPiCS-02, we're targeting first patient in, or FPI, for a number of new Trodelvy trials this year. In the first half of 2022, this includes front-line studies for non-small cell lung cancer and PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative metastatic TNBC. In the second half of the year, we're targeting FPI for the EVOQUE 3 Phase III trial for first-line non-small cell lung cancer. TROPiCS-04 for metastatic urothelial carcinoma is ongoing, and we anticipate a readout in the 2023, 2024 time frame.  As you can see on this slide, shared for the first time in our oncology deep dive earlier this month, we are in the earliest stages of evaluating how Trodelvy, either alone or in combination, could bring new options to people with cancer. In total, we're studying more than 25 combinations, including 7 Phase III combination studies.  On behalf of my Kite colleagues and on Slide 20, I'm pleased to highlight the FDA approval of Yescarta for the second-line treatment of relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma earlier this month. The approval is based on the ZUMA-7 trial data that showed that 2.5x more patients receiving Yescarta were alive at 2 years without disease progression or need for additional cancer treatment versus the standard of care. This was the first cell therapy approved by FDA for initial treatment of refractory or relapsed LBCL and within 12 months of initial treatment. Yescarta was also added to the NCCN's B-cell lymphoma treatment guidelines for these patients.  Moving to magrolimab on Slide 21. We're very pleased that the FDA lifted the partial clinical holds for our MDS and AML trials, and we resumed enrollment in our 3 pivotal studies. I'll note that the remaining partial clinical holds on DLBCL and multiple myeloma are being reviewed by a different division of the FDA, and we're actively working to resolve them as quickly as possible. In the meantime, the impact of these remaining partial holds is limited since the DLBCL trial was already fully enrolled at the time of the partial clinical hold and the multiple myeloma trial had just initiated.  Overall, we're excited by magrolimab's potential to be the first new treatment for first-line high-risk MDS patients in 15 years and have completed patient enrollment for the first interim analysis that we expect to share in early 2023. In the meantime, we look forward to sharing data from our Phase Ib trial for high-risk MDS and first-line TP53 AML with more patients and longer follow-up at ASCO in June.  Finally, on Slide 22 and noting that the timing for the potential submission of TROPiCS-02 NDA decision for CAPELLA are subject to change, there are no updates to the targeted milestones shared with you in January. With our partner, Arcus, we're targeting a number of data readouts in the second half of the year and have added some new trials, including STAR-121, evaluating zimberelimab and dominilumab in combination with chemotherapy for front-line non-small cell lung cancer and R-21 to evaluate the same combination of upper GI malignancies. With that, I'll hand the call over to Andy. Andrew Dickinson : Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into the Q1 P&L review and the guidance update, I wanted to touch on the $2.7 billion partial in-process R&D impairment related to assets acquired from Immunomedics in 2020. This had a $1.63 per share impact on our Q1 GAAP results and on our full year GAAP EPS guidance. There is no impact to our non-GAAP EPS in Q1 or to our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year. With the TROPiCS-02 data readout in March, we have reassessed the value of the assets acquired. While no final decisions have been made pending discussions with regulatory authorities, as a result of the data, we have taken a $2.7 billion impairment to reflect the likelihood of a delayed launch of Trodelvy for third-line-plus HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer in the United States as well as Europe and the possibility of a reduced market share in late-line patients given the emerging competitive landscape. Prior to today's update, Gilead was carrying $14.7 billion for the IP R&D indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired with Immunomedics. This now values these assets at $12 billion.  Recall that the carrying value of Trodelvy reflected 4 potential indications in progress at the time of the acquisition, triple-negative breast cancer and hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, bladder cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. At that time, we knew that Trodelvy's potential extended beyond these indications, but for accounting purposes did not assign value for the incremental opportunities that we are exploring in prostate, endometrial and other solid tumors as well as potential combinations such as with magrolimab, venelumab and PD-1s like pembrolizumab.  As you saw at our oncology deep dive earlier this month, there are 13 Trodelvy programs targeted for initiation through 2023, including a number of incremental opportunities. As a result, we remain confident Trodelvy will deliver an attractive return to our shareholders over time.  Moving to Slide 24. The first quarter was a strong start to the year despite the expected seasonality observed in our HIV business and was stronger-than-expected Veklury sales. Total product sales were $6.5 billion, up 3% year-over-year, with growth in cell therapy, Veklury, Trodelvy and HIV, offset in part by lower HCV revenue. Of note, FX negatively impacted first quarter revenue by almost $100 million, net of hedges, representing approximately 160 basis points of growth. Total product sales, excluding Veklury, were up 2% from the first quarter of 2021 to $5 billion.  In HIV, on a sequential basis, we were impacted, as expected, by the normal seasonality associated with Q1 inventory burn following a build in Q4 in addition to the typical first quarter pricing headwinds that improved throughout the rest of the year. With Q1 now behind us, we expect sequential growth in HIV throughout the rest of the year. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 87.4% for Q1, up 90 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to lower inventory reserve adjustment. First quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were largely consistent with our expectations as we support the expansion of our oncology business. Non-GAAP R&D was $1.2 billion, up 10% year-over-year. And non-GAAP SG&A was $1.1 billion, up 5% year-over-year, both primarily due to higher costs associated with Trodelvy.  Moving to tax. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the first quarter was 18.4%. Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.12 in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $2.04 for the same period last year, reflecting the higher revenue and higher gross margin, offset in part by higher operating expenses.  On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate and earnings per share were impacted by the $2.7 billion impairment.  We are excited about the strong start to the year. And as you can see on Slide 25, the only revision to our outlook is to our GAAP EPS, primarily to reflect the $1.63 share impact of the impairment discussed earlier. We now expect GAAP EPS in the range of $3 to $3.50 per share from $4.70 to $5.20.  On Veklury, we note the strong revenue start to the year, but also, fortunately, the significant drop-off in U.S. hospitalizations during the first quarter and into the second quarter so far. With that in mind, we will monitor demand through the second quarter and evaluate our full year guidance in the middle of the year.  One housekeeping item before we wrap up. Following recent guidance from the SEC, beginning in the first quarter and similar to many of our peers, Gilead will no longer exclude acquired in-process R&D expenses from non-GAAP financial measures. Prior period results have been updated to reflect this new methodology and are shared in our supplementary data posted on the Investor Relations website.  As a reminder, our full year guidance does not include the impact of any future upfront payments related to the normal course of business partnerships or licensing deals. Going forward, we plan to update our guidance on a quarterly basis to reflect the impact of any new corporate development transactions closed in the prior quarter.  Moving to Slide 26. You can see there is no change to our capital allocation priorities. In the first quarter, we repaid $500 million in debt. Additionally, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through our dividend and repurchase of shares.  Finally, on M&A, there is no change to our philosophy here either. We are very comfortable with the breadth and the quality of the pipeline that we have built, acquired or partnered, and the growth that it will enable in the coming years. With that in mind, you can expect us to continue to opportunistically access high-quality assets through partnerships or make smaller acquisitions in the normal course of business.  With that, I'll invite the operator to open the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Michael Yee : Maybe I could ask about the planned or potential Trodelvy filing. You note that it's subject to change. Maybe you could just describe what you think the conversation is with FDA. Is it combination of a modest PFS and OS trend? And is there a magnitude of OS trend that you think will be attractive and allow a green light to a filing? Maybe just talk a little bit about that and what would drive a filing. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Michael. I'll turn it over to Merdad in just a second, but I'll just remind folks that we will be discussing the data more at ASCO coming up there in early June. We look forward to engaging with regulatory authorities in the coming months to further discuss the data and the path forward. I'll see if Merdad has anything to add on that at this stage, but... Merdad Parsey : Yes. Michael, I think as a normal course of business, we'll always discuss the data -- the totality of the data with the agency prior to a filing and have that conversation with them. As we've said, the primary endpoint was statistically significant. And so we will have that conversation with them looking at all the data and come to a conclusion based on the feedback we get. Daniel O'Day: Right. And we continue to look at earlier lines of therapy and plan those trials to move up in lines of therapy given the results we saw in TROPiCS-02 as well and hormone receptor-positive. So thanks a lot, Michael, for that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Charlie Yang : This is Charlie Yang, on for Matthew. So I guess my question is, is Veklury being -- currently being used in China and then actually benefit from the COVID outbreak there? And maybe if that's the case, can you talk about what the economics look like over there? Daniel O'Day: Thanks for the question. We'll go right to Johanna. Johanna Mercier : Thanks for your question. So Veklury has been used now with over 11 million patients worldwide, which I think is really impressive. And it's still 1 out of 2 hospitalized patients in the U.S. What we are seeing, though, is trends of less severe disease, and therefore, less hospitalizations, but also less treatments.  Specific to your question to China, we don't have approval in China at this point in time. And we're continuing those discussions with health authorities in light of the fact that what's going on in China with the pandemic, obviously. I do think the WHO guidelines being updated just most recently is also going to help those discussions as well. So more to come on that, but not currently in play at this point in time in China. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets. Brian Abrahams : Sticking with the COVID theme. Anything that - new that you're seeing that increases your level of confidence in 5245\u2019s potential for success? And are there any ways to potentially expedite future development of that asset? Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Brian. I'll hand over to you, Merdad. Merdad Parsey : Yes. Nothing new to report, Brian. It's a great question. We continue to move along really well in our Phase I study that's moving forward expeditiously. And we are working with the agency to design a Phase II/III program and really moving as fast as possible. We've got a great partnership with the agency and others and are really ready to count. So right now, so far, so good. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Simon Baker from Redburn. Simon Baker : On HIV, Johanna, you alluded to the market dynamics. I just wondered if you could give us a little bit more color and update us on how diagnosis rates are now compared to the beginning of the year. And also if you are seeing any initial impact from Glaxo\u2019s launch of CABENUVA. Johanna Mercier : Sure. So both market and CABENUVA. Thanks, Simon, for your question. So let me start with the market. So if you look at the screening and diagnosis levels, they're still somewhat below prepandemic, but they're definitely catching up. I think what we saw in the first half '21 was a really depressed market and started picking back up in Q3 and Q4 of last year. What we saw in Q1 of this year despite the Omicron surge that obviously impacts, what we saw quarter-over-quarter pretty much flat in the U.S. and overall Europe as well. Year-on-year change, though, we have a 3.6% growth. And I think that's really -- that's the signal that we need to watch for and continue to focus on. And since Gilead has close to 75% market share of the total HIV market, I think it's really -- it's part of our responsibility to ensure that we get screening and diagnosis up and make sure we [end this pandemic] (ph). So more to come on that, but there's a lot of activities the team is taking on to ensure that we get people back in and screened so that we don't have full-fledge cases of AIDS which, unfortunately, we've seen in the recent past, and you've seen that anecdotally.  On the prevention market, it's a little bit different. Prevention market bounces back a lot faster post this pandemic, and we've seen that time and time again after every single surge. So what we've seen quarter-over-quarter was about a 3% growth in the U.S. for prevention. So slightly modest growth, which declined a little bit, but that's because of the Omicron surge in January. Year-over-year, the growth was 33%. And so I think that's really telling in the sense of how it bounces back much faster post these surges. And that's been kind of consistent year-on-year as we've seen the different, I guess, variants.  On your question around CABENUVA., specific to CABENUVA., treatment share in CABENUVA. is 0.6%. So no, we haven't seen an impact. What we see is new entrants coming into the market. You always see a little bit of switching going on, which is normal. I do think that there's an [ask] (ph) from a patient standpoint, this is the first long-acting, so it is exciting. What we're also seeing is a higher-than-usual drop-off rate with CABENUVA as well. And a lot of that share is going to Biktarvy back. So I do think it's interesting to watch. And I think the more agents on the market, the better, but definitely one that at this point in time very limited impact to the HIV market share for Gilead. Thanks for your questions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Geoffrey Meacham : I had an HIV question for Merdad or maybe even Dan. So you built an increasingly broad pipeline around Lenacapavir. And I know getting long-acting right is strategically very important to Gilead. So the question is, what's been the main bottleneck so far? Is it a matter of matching up the PK/PD for lena? And would you wait to go into a larger scale trial if there is a candidate that may make an optimal doublet with lenacapavir? Daniel O'Day: Yes. Thanks, Geoff. Appreciate it. I'm going to turn it over to Merdad in a second here. But just remind -- for those of you that didn't have the chance to look at the virology deep dive day, we really did spend a lot of time in the entirety of the portfolio and the many shots on goal we have along with lenacapavir. Lenacapavir is a truly unique molecule and presents opportunities and challenges to find exactly the right partner. But we certainly have many that will be progressing to the clinic. But Merdad, maybe you want to give a little more meat to the... Merdad Parsey : Sure. Yes. I mean maybe I'll start by saying on the PrEP side, we obviously don't need to wait for a partner molecule. And really, at this point, it's about resolving the issues with the clinical hold. Once that gets resolved, we'll be back in business with the trials and we'll move as fast as possible to get the PrEP studies completed and get our filing done. In treatment, you're absolutely right. And again, I think you're right, we've built the portfolio to provide as numerous options to then combine with lenacapavir for treatment in a long-acting mode. And that's a mix of oral approaches where we could have an oral long-acting molecule or a parenteral long-acting agent. And for parenteral, we're trying to go for longer than 2 months. And for oral, we are looking at, hopefully, getting to weekly or thereabouts. So we have a number of candidates that are progressing to show us -- essentially, you said it right, which is do they have the right properties from a PK/PD standpoint for an oral agent? And do they have the right properties parenterally, including things like injection site reactions and tolerability? So it's less about the ability to inhibit HIV replication. It's more about the molecule and the formulation characteristics that allow us to get to long-acting therapy.  And I'll just say again that lenacapavir is a very unique and special molecule that enables us to do that. Finding another molecule that has those sorts of characteristics is the challenge that we're undertaking. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Do Kim from Piper Sandler. Guyn Kim : I wanted to ask about Yescarta and the launch in second-line LBCL. Was hoping you could provide some first impressions of the launch and whether your sense of the demand out there is matching with your expectations. Daniel O'Day: Yes. Thanks, Do. We're delighted to have Christi here with us. So we'll hear it from the source here. Over to you, Christi. Christi Shaw : Thanks, Do. So we're very encouraged. First, before the approval, the NCCN guidelines that changed and now put Yescarta for LBCL second-line as category 1 which, as you may know, physicians and providers use to identify standard of care. So that happened a month before approval, which is unusual in these times. And then with the approval -- right after the approval, our manufacturing site was approved in Maryland. So we really feel like we're hitting on all cylinders in terms of really bringing this important therapy to patients. And so the second-line launch was approved on a Friday at about 3 p.m. And on Saturday, orders started to come in. So we're already manufacturing commercial product in our site in the Maryland facility.  So definitely, it's really early days, obviously, but the demand was building up, I think, when the data came out at ASH in December, and we're starting to see the orders come in as soon as we get approval. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Gavin Scott : It's Gavin, on for Cory. Just on Trodelvy label expansion opportunities and lung cancer, in particular, with the EVOQUE-02 study. It looks like there's multiple cohorts in the study. And we're just curious if, one, is there evidence of synergy with PD-1 inhibitors and you plan on sharing any of that this year? And then two, are you going to utilize a Trop-2 biomarker in any of these cohorts? Daniel O'Day: Thanks for the question. Merdad, why don't you cover that? Merdad Parsey : Sure. Yes. On the biomarker side, we continue to evaluate the role of Trop-2 expression in responses. And as we discussed, actually, for the breast cancer study in our experience so far, we are not seeing a big impact of Trop-2 expression on responsiveness. So we'll -- but we'll keep looking because lung cancer may behave differently than what we're seeing. And we do expect expression patterns to be different. So maybe there'll be a different cutoff in a different tumor type. So that remains to be seen. In terms of synergy, we are -- I think that's the nature of where we're going with the studies. And that in order to see additive benefit, we need to conduct the larger clinical trials. We do think that coming at the tumors with the 2 different approaches, we'll add. I'm always careful about using the term synergy. I think that implies a different mechanistic approach. So I do think we expect additivity of the 2 components. And yes, we do feel that we will have additivity that Trodelvy should bring additional benefit to patients over and above what the immuno-oncology agents, PD-1, PD-L1 inhibitors, bring to the treatment of those patients. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Robyn Karnauskas : Congrats on the Yescarta data, by the way. So I just want to [indiscernible] a little bit on your comments around M&A. I think some investors believe that you have all these great programs, but we're not going to see them read out. And I think you did a good job highlighting that in the oncology day. So for near-term growth, are you thinking about -- would you be open to acquiring something that would provide some near-term growth to gap you before a lot of your Trodelvy trials and your magro trials like start reading out? How are you thinking about that as a company? Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Robyn, and I'll start and then maybe Andy can add. But I appreciate you bringing that up. I think it's been a really purposeful strategic approach that we've taken over the past -- last 3 years to build our oncology portfolio beyond cell therapy, which is obviously now has a history with us for almost 5 years. And I'd just remind the folks on the phone that in addition to whatever is acquired at the time of the acquisition in terms of trials and potential and capability of that size organization, naturally, when a large organization acquires particularly these pan-tumor potential molecules, you begin really the process of extending the potential for that medicine alone in late lines, earlier lines and in combinations and thoughtful combinations.  I think actually, Kite is a terrific example of that, going back now 5 years post the acquisition, and I appreciate, Robyn, that you started out with congratulations on Yescarta. But to see the potential for a technology like cell therapy and the leadership that Kite took by bringing this up into earlier lines of therapy and the number of patients, of course, then that you can impact on with a potentially curative therapy is exactly kind of the playbook that we will be -- we are pursuing right now with Trodelvy, with magrolimab, and obviously, with the combination of Arcus assets, which -- albeit a bit earlier in the process. So I think we always have to remember the time frame and which one evaluates the success of M&A.  The other thing I would just say is that, of course, we constantly are looking to complement that. I mean the bar is much higher now for Gilead than it was several years ago because the number of possibilities and opportunities we have and the bandwidth that any one company can do, but you see on the bandwidth side, we're also doing a lot of collaborations with other companies, including folks like Merck who are operationalizing, in fact, a study of ours with Trodelvy. So there's different ways, I think, to work on the bandwidth. But we will constantly be looking at different types of opportunities out there that complement our virology, our oncology and our early inflammation program to add those to the growth story that we are creating here at Gilead.  I'll just -- I know Andy spends a lot of time thinking about this. I'd love Andy's additional thoughts on this as well. Andrew Dickinson : Thanks, Dan. And thank you, Robyn, for the question. Look, I would just go back to start with fundamentally, we have a lot of confidence in where we are in our growth profile today. And I think it's fair to say that the market maybe underappreciates the growth. Even, Robyn, if you look at our first quarter results, especially when you adjust for the impact of LOE and FX, there's really reasonably strong growth in our business. And this is just the beginning from our perspective. So there are always things that we can do to work on our growth profile. But when you look at the strength of the HIV business, what we're seeing in our oncology business, hopefully, that gives you a sense of why we as a management team have so much confidence about not only where we are today, but where we're going. And we recognize, to your question, that the growth profile should get meaningfully better in the next couple of years as the portfolio matures in the way that Dan was describing.  So while we will look at things, including commercial assets, as you know, those are far and few between. Many of them are expensive, and that's not really where our focus is. We really genuinely believe we have everything that we need today to be a leading growth company in the sector, and it's just going to take a little more time. But we're definitely seeing all the right signs that we are looking for as a management team. So you should not expect that we're going to go out chasing commercial assets or large deals. The guidance is very clear. It's ordinary course partnerships, maybe smaller commercial acquisitions. Again, we'll be opportunistic. But that's not where our focus is today. Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Andy. And the last thing I'd say in addition to the molecules and the medicines, the expertise that we're bringing into Gilead is second to none. And hopefully, you saw some of that. And it's just really the -- some representation of that at both virology and oncology deep dive days because that's really critical in any company that we've all -- as the leadership team worked in is really getting the right teams together at the right time to make sure we're making the right choices and decisions on the portfolios as we move forward. So that's a really big focus for us, and we're really pleased with the progress we're making there. Operator : It comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer Raffat : I just wanted to expand on a prior question on remdesivir. And Dan, Merdad, it feels like the pace at which this program is moving forward and sort of the time line to the pivotal trial start and the amount of time it will take, it feels materially slower than how Paxlovid and [indiscernible] moved. So I guess my question is, what are the expedited pathways you guys are thinking about when talking to FDA? Because presumably, a 505(b)(2) path is not unreasonable given the public health emergency and/or maybe even an active comparator trial versus Paxlovid established non-inferiority relatively fast given the pace at which infections are happening right now. So there's a path where this could all wrap up this summer. Is that too accelerated in your view? Daniel O'Day: Yes. Umer, I'll start, and then I'll hand it over to Merdad. So first of all, I mean, just to reinforce this message for everybody on the phone, I mean, we are absolutely moving with tremendous focus and speed. And of course, we have great lessons within our organization. Remdesivir was arguably the fastest development of an antiviral that's ever occurred from standing still essentially to an approval in the United States. So -- and as you know, we've got a lot of experience from that in terms of working both property groups around accelerating trials, with the FDA around pursuing unique regulatory path. And those learnings and those lessons I just want to say are certainly being put to use now for 5 2 4 5.  Having said that, we're, of course, at a very different stage of the pandemic at this stage. And therefore, both from a regulatory perspective and also our ability to recruit clinical trials, particularly with a somewhat raining pandemic in the developed world, has implications on the path we'll take.  And with that, maybe I'll turn it over to Merdad on any other details he wants to add. Merdad Parsey : Yes. I mean not much to add other than I think our Phase I study is moving very quickly. It's moving very nicely without any issues. I know, Umer, you've asked about the 505(b)(2) approach in the past. As you can imagine, those are all -- the avenues you've mentioned are all avenues that we've thought about and explored. And so we will move with the fastest pathway available to us, and that's the nature of the discussions we're having with the agency. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Evan Seigerman : It might be a combo one for Andy and Merdad. So can you walk me through some of the -- some of the math behind the $2.7 billion write-down? Maybe how some of the data you've seen inform the magnitude of the impairment? I'm just trying to square how your assumptions may have changed from August 2020 to now based on data updates that we've had. Andrew Dickinson : Evan, it's Andy. Thanks for the question. It's a great question. Look, it's relatively simple. And just to back up, remember, this is an accounting construct that we are required to reassess the value even before we have the discussions with the regulatory authorities. So I just want to back up and reiterate what we said when the data came out. The study was positive. This is strong data. There was a range of outcomes that we expected when we did the deal. This was within the range of outcomes, but it wasn't at the point that we had modeled specifically because we are required to when we put together the intangible indefinite-lived asset schedule after the acquisition. So it's a very simple model, too.  So the key, by the way, is our valuation when we have discussions in the coming months with the FDA could change again, of course. And we'll have to continue to look at the valuation of the assets that are still sitting on the balance sheet, which is the valuation attributed to hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer over the coming years, as you'd expect, consistent with any business combination transaction. But it's relatively simple.  It's your standard probability-weighted discounted cash flow analysis where you look at the probability of approval. We are assuming, Evan -- I think this is the key for you. We took a conservative approach, and we were looking at this and assume that there is not a path forward based on the PFS data and that we need to wait for overall survival, even though we're not certain that that's the case and we will know more in the coming months. So for purposes -- for the accounting treatment, we had to make a call, and that's the call that we made, and that leads to the 2.7.  The other thing I would add is we had Trodelvy-related IP R&D of $14.7 billion at the end of 2021, a little over half of that or $8.8 billion of it related to hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer. The remainder was non-small cell lung cancer. And again, we're already -- in the other indications that are approved, we're already amortizing that. Those are now finite-lived assets. So now we have $6.1 billion relating to the cash flows expected from third line plus -- as well as the earlier line hormone receptor positive breast cancer indication. But hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color.  And again, I'd reiterate what we said on the call, which is when we did this originally, when we did the acquisition, we highlighted explicitly that we were going to explore other tumor types and combinations that were not part of our deal model. There is no need to build them into the deal model from bottoms up. So when you step back, more importantly, outside of the accounting construct, we continue to believe that there are many, many paths forward to create a lot of value for patients and for our shareholders with this. So I'm happy to take it off-line if it's helpful to give you more color. Daniel O'Day: Yes. Thanks a lot, Andy. I mean, Evan, I think the bottom line is that, again, we took a somewhat conservative approach in the absence of having regulatory discussions so far. We thought it was a prudent thing to do. And to Andy's point, I mean, this is an evaluation of value at the time of the transaction, which, of course, several years later in terms of the indications, the combinations, the potential for Trodelvy is never, as you know, reflective in the initial accounting treatment of it. So hopefully, there's plenty of information in there in our press release and more than happy to take it up with you as well. So thanks, Evan, for that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren from Cowen. Tyler Van Buren : Can you please give us your latest thoughts regarding a successful outcome for the [indiscernible] trial when we get the Phase II PFS data later in the year? And related to the readout for the upcoming Roche results, what are you most interested in seeing other than the primary endpoint? Daniel O'Day: Thanks a lot, Tyler. So over to Merdad, please. Merdad Parsey : Sure. Yes. I think our thinking has been that dominolumab as a TIGIT agent will add to the ORR. But to your point, it's not only that, that we would be looking for. And what we would be hoping for in addition to the overall response rate is going to be the depth of the responses and the durability of responses, right? So those are the factors that we'll be looking for. We will also be looking to see what the Roche data looks like when they -- when it comes out at ASCO to see what they've seen is sort of a benchmark, if you will. But those are the various factors we'll be looking for. Obviously, tolerability is going to be in there as well and the overall profile. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : Maybe a question for Andy regarding FX. So Andy, you mentioned that in 1Q, there was a $100 million impact. And then since you provided the guidance, I mean, U.S. dollar has been strong, about 7% U.S. dollar to European -- euro decline. So just what I'm trying to understand is how much of the FX impact you are absorbing in this guidance which you are maintaining right now. From my math, it could be $300 million plus. But that means that this base business is really stronger than you anticipated, if you could help us understand where this strength is coming from. Andrew Dickinson : Sure. That's a great question, Mohit. I'm happy to take it. The -- look, it's relatively simple. And that you're absolutely right. And even in April, we've seen a continued deterioration of exchange rates or strengthening of the dollar, which impacts the revenues coming from our European business. So to be clear, the $100 million impact was a year-over-year comparison Q1 to Q1. Johanna and I are watching the budget impact of the exchange rates very carefully. And part of the confidence in maintaining the guidance is that, yes, there are FX headwinds. There are also, for instance -- related to your question, there's also this change in the accounting treatment of in-process R&D, which will lead to additional expenses from upfront payments that weren't previously part of how we reported non-GAAP earnings.  On the flip side, there are parts of our business that are outperforming. Again, you think of the strength of Veklury that we've seen so far. So Johanna and I and the rest of the management team will look at the puts and takes of this in the middle of the year, and we'll provide a more thoughtful update. But I think the key for you is recognizing the couple of things that have changed that could impact negatively our EPS GAAP and non-GAAP EPS. There are also things that will have additional strength we expect over the course of the year that will offset that to some extent. And so we'll give you additional color later in the year, but we're very comfortable maintaining our guidance where we are today. Hopefully, that helps. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow from UBS. Colin Bristow : Just a quick one, just following on, on the TIGIT and adenosine asset. The -- I just wanted to really understand where your -- what is it you're most enthused about and how you're just thinking about this strategically? Is it the TIGIT and PD-1 doublet that you really see the value, but there's some concern about market timing? Or are you absolutely excited about the triplet data? Can you just help me through that? Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Colin. Merdad, go ahead. Merdad Parsey : Sure. Look, I think we obviously are going to be looking across all the data across all the assets. Maybe the way I would say it is that we're seeing the TIGIT/PD-1 combination is likely to be sort of the benchmark or the basis for treatment at least in lung cancer and potentially more broadly. And as such, our hope is to have a great combination there to make sure that we then have something to which we can add other potential agents that could bring us to even better responsiveness. So whether that's adenosine or Trodelvy or something else in our pipeline, I think those are all options for us to consider. But we're seeing -- I would say the floor is being raised is our belief and that TIGIT/PD-1 combination becomes sort of the baseline that we need to aim for. Daniel O'Day: Thanks. Very nice conceptual there. So out of respect for everybody's time, we'll take one last question. Jonathan, can we have the last question, please? Operator : Certainly. Our final question for today comes from the line of Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst : This is [indiscernible] for Salveen. Just to go back to TIGIT real quick. You and Arcus have previously noted that you'd want to see an ORR greater than 50%, but what would you like to see on PFS and, most importantly, OS? It seems like 30-plus months might be sufficient on OS given KEYTRUDA mono data and maybe a year plus for PFS. Just would be great to hear your thoughts on this. Merdad Parsey : Well, what I would say is those milestones -- I would agree with the milestones that you've got there. And it's important to remember that those milestones will take time to play out. And we are going to make our bets without being able to look at OS for 30 months, right? We're going to have a less mature data set from which to make that decision. So you're absolutely right that we will be looking at all of those things.  The driver will be to see that, again, tolerability and a benefit as far as the overall response rate is concerned and look for benefits in the depth and duration of response that we can garner from the data set at the maturity that we will have when we look at it. And there, I would just say we'll be, in a sense, watch our actions because you'll be seeing the studies will be getting underway, and that should give you a sense of our confidence in those assets. Daniel O'Day: With that, I just want to thank everybody. I really appreciate the attention today for the couple of deep dives we've had. We look forward to chatting with you at ASCO and beyond to keep you updated on our progress for the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jacquie for some final comments. Jacquie Ross : Thank you all for joining us today. We do appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and look forward to updating you throughout the year, as Dan said. Have a great rest of your day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent background noises. After today\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Jacquie Ross, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jacquie Ross : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the second quarter of 2022. The press release, slides and supplemental data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open up the call to Q&A where the team will be joined by Christi Shaw, the Chief Executive Officer of Kite. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including those related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gilead's business; financial condition and results of operations; plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations; financial projections and use of capital; and 2022 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, in our supplementary data sheet as well as on the Gilead website. Now I'll turn the call over to Dan. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everybody. We really appreciate you joining today. We look forward to sharing our second quarter results, which highlighted a quarter of strong commercial and clinical execution. This was a very strong quarter for our business, delivering revenue of US$6.1 billion. Excluding Veklury, total product sales grew 7% year-over-year. If we look at the underlying business and also exclude the impact of the HIV LOEs and the currency headwinds in the second quarter, growth was actually 11%. Our HIV portfolio continues to deliver, and this quarter was no exception with higher demand for both treatment and PrEP. Biktarvy sales grew by 28% year-over-year, and we expect to see continued market growth for treatment and prevention with the ongoing market recovery. This was a record quarter for our oncology business. Revenues topped $0.5 billion for the first time with a strong contribution from Trodelvy and a standout performance by our cell therapies. Yescarta was approved by the FDA for second-line relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma in April. This increased awareness and go demand not only for Yescarta's second-line patients but also for those in later lines of treatment. Yescarta is a potentially curative therapy, and Kite has uniquely and effectively scaled manufacturing to meet the needs of patients through the benefit. Turning to our clinical progress. Our NDA submission has been accepted by the FDA for lenacapavir for heavily treatment-experienced people living with HIV, and we are now expecting the decision in late December. If approved, lenacapavir will be the first approved cased inhibitor and the first therapy with a 6-month dosing schedule for HIV treatment. Moving to Trodelvy. We are in discussions with the FDA regarding a potential regulatory pathway for late-stage hormone-receptor-positive/HER2-negative patients, and we will update you as things progress. We have also begun screening patients in ASCENT-3 and ASCENT-4 evaluating Trodelvy in the first-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patients. We dosed the first patient in our new Phase 2 study evaluating Trodelvy in non-small cell lung cancer, EVOKE\u201002. And earlier this month, we dosed the first patient in a new Trodelvy combination arm in our ongoing magrolimab triple-negative breast cancer study. Also from magrolimab, we are targeting an interim analysis no later than early 2023 for ENHANCE, our Phase 3 study in first-line, high-risk MDS. Additionally, we dosed the first patient for ENHANCE-3, a Phase 3 magrolimab study for first-line unfit AML. Moving to Slide 5. Later this year, we expect to initiate an additional 5 studies for Trodelvy in a mix of monotherapy and combination studies. We also plan to start enrolling patients in three cell therapy trials and two domvanalimab combination trials. The extent of existing and planned studies really highlights the scale of our ambitious oncology program. I want to take this opportunity to thank the teams across Gilead and Kite for a terrific quarter of commercial execution and for the continued momentum in our clinical programs to continue to lay the critical groundwork for Gilead's future success. With that, I'll invite Johanna to share an update on our second quarter commercial performance. Johanna Mercier : Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. We had a very strong second quarter with total product sales excluding Veklury of $5.7 billion, up 7% year-over-year, driven by HIV, cell therapy and Trodelvy and offset in part by HCV. Sequentially, total product sales excluding Veklury were up 14%, driven by the seasonal pricing and inventory dynamics we see coming out of the first quarter of every year, primarily in our HIV business, as well as higher demand across our total portfolio. On Slide 8, HIV sales were up 7% year-over-year to $4.2 billion, primarily driven by channel mix associated with lower government utilization, leading to a higher average realized price as well as higher demand for both treatment and PrEP. Excluding the impact of the loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla, HIV sales increased 11%. Quarter\u2010over\u2010quarter, HIV sales were up 14%, due to demand and channel mix leading to higher average realized price as well as the favorable seasonal inventory dynamics that we typically see in the second quarter relative to the first. Year\u2010over\u2010year, the HIV treatment market grew over 4% in the U.S., and was largely flat in Europe but, sequentially grew over 2% in the U.S. and 1% in Europe. We\u2019re encouraged to see the market recovering and, on a year\u2010over\u2010year basis, continue to expect annual treatment market growth in the 2% to 3% range. Descovy sales in the second quarter were $460 million, up 6% year\u2010over\u2010year and 23% sequentially. We are pleased to see continued PrEP market growth with broader awareness and market volumes that are well above pre\u2010pandemic levels. For the quarter, the overall market growth was up 25% year\u2010over\u2010year, and 5% sequentially, highlighting both robust recovery and growing adoption of PrEP. Despite generic and other market participants, Descovy share in PrEP is holding in the mid\u201040 percent range. As awareness continues to grow and the overall market expands, we expect Descovy to continue to play an important role in PrEP, and really look forward to adding lenacapavir as a potential long\u2010 acting alternative for those seeking preventative care, as early as 2025. Onto Slide 9, Biktarvy grew 28% year\u2010over\u2010year to $2.6 billion, primarily driven by strong demand and channel mix. Biktarvy\u2019s market share in the U.S. grew from 40% in Q2 of last year to 44% in the second quarter of 2022, and continues -- by a wide margin -- to be the leading treatment for HIV, as well as the fastest growing. In fact, Biktarvy\u2019s differentiated clinical profile was once again reinforced this past weekend at the International AIDS Conference in Montreal. At five years, Biktarvy had zero cases of treatment failure due to resistance, as well as sustained efficacy and a demonstrated safety profile in people living with HIV. Notably, this 5\u2010year trial duration demonstrating zero cases of resistance is unprecedented for an HIV regimen. Share also increased sequentially, up 1% from the first quarter of 2022, contributing to 19% growth in Biktarvy revenue quarter-over-quarter in addition to the channel mix and the seasonal inventory dynamics we referenced earlier. Moving to Slide 10. HCV sales in the quarter were down 18% year-over-year due to the channel mix leading to lower average realized price and fewer patient starts, partially offset by higher volume in Eastern Europe. Sequentially, HCV was up 12%, driven by the timing of a large order in addition to higher patient start. Overall in HCV, we maintained steady market share of 50% to 60% both in the U.S. as well as Europe. For HBV and HDV on Slide 11, sales were roughly flat quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, driven by unfavorable adjustments associated with the recent volume-based procurement updates in China and offset by higher year-over-year demand and volume growth in all other regions. Veklury revenues in the second quarter were $445 million, as shown on Slide 12. As expected, sales declined both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter as hospitalization rates declined in most geographies. Additionally, U.S. revenue reflected inventory drawdown in the second quarter. While COVID-19 is still prevalent, the most recent subvariants have been less severe and contributed to pure hospitalized patients, although roughly 60% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients that are being treated in the U.S. are receiving Veklury. We continue to be committed to supporting patients with COVID\u201019 globally. Last month, we signed our second Joint Procurement Agreement with the European Commission that enables participating countries to purchase Veklury for a period of up to 18 months. Additionally, the European Medicines Agency\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, adopted a positive opinion recommending Veklury receive full marketing authorization for the treatment of appropriate patients with COVID\u201019. This builds on our prior, conditional authorization, and we look forward to the final decision by the European Commission later this year. We're proud of our track record of meeting global demand for Veklury since the fall of 2020, and will maintain a readiness to supply the clear where it's needed and have increased our full year guidance to reflect anticipated patient need in the second half. Turning to Oncology, and beginning with Trodelvy on Slide 13, sales of $159 million grew 79% year\u2010 over\u2010year and 9% quarter\u2010over\u2010quarter. Sequentially, Trodelvy grew 41% outside the U.S., with particularly strong growth in Germany and France due to increased awareness and adoption. Sequential 7% volume growth in the U.S. was offset by unfavorable pricing dynamics. We expect to see continued growth in the second half, driven by the impact of our expanded sales force in the U.S. as well as reimbursement approvals in the EU. We are committed to broadening access for Trodelvy and continue to work with regulators and payers around the world. We\u2019re pleased with the recent decisions by both NCCN in the U.S. and NICE in the UK, recognizing the significant clinical benefit of Trodelvy in patients with metastatic triple\u2010negative breast cancer based on the Phase 3 ASCENT trial. These decisions add to the building support for Trodelvy\u2019s use following positive Health Technology Assessments in a number of other countries.  Trodelvy is the first ADC to demonstrate statistically significant and clinically meaningful overall survival benefit in this mTNBC patient population. In fact, the NCCN guidelines elevated Trodelvy to a Category 1 recommendation for second\u2010line and later mTNBC, its highest recommendation available. Additionally, while Trodelvy is not approved by FDA for use in the HR-positive/HER2\u2010negative setting, we are pleased that the NCCN has issued a Category 2A recommendation for Trodelvy\u2019s use for these patients with advanced disease.  Turning to Slide 14. I'm pleased to share some incredibly strong results on behalf of Christi and the Kite team. Cell therapy sales for the second quarter were $368 million, up 68% year-over-year and 34% sequentially, driven by a very strong U.S. second-line launch for Yescarta in relapsed or refractory LBCL, which exceeded our expectations and continued strong growth in third-line plus Yescarta. As a reminder, strong data and an NCCN recommendation, which predated the second-line approval, helped drive our impressive early uptake, especially in large volume authorized treatment centers with a high familiarity with CAR T therapies. Additionally, Yescarta second-line LBCL is already available in two other large markets : in France through the early access program and in Germany through reimbursement decisions ahead of approval. The decision on Yescarta second-line LBCL approval in Europe is expected later this fall. Third-line plus LBCL deliveries also increased sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting growing overall awareness and confidence in the use of Yescarta. This follows the presentation of 5-year ZUMA-1 data at last year's American Society of Hematology meeting and more recently, our second-line approval in the U.S. For the quarter overall, Yescarta sales of $295 million were up 66% year-over-year and 40% sequentially. Of note, Yescarta deliveries increased 67% year-over-year and 39% sequentially, demonstrating the effectiveness of Kite's manufacturing expansion strategy and our ability to meet demand for our cell therapies. We're proud of our reputation for consistent and reliable deliveries that further differentiates Kite's cell therapies and was a continued source of strength in Q2. While we saw very strong demand in the first half of 2022, we expect this growth to normalize in Q3 as second-line usage expand beyond the early adopters and more towards community referrals. Turning to Tecartus. Sales for the quarter were $73 million, up 78% year-over-year and 16% sequentially, driven by continued demand and expansion into new geographies for relapsed/refractory mental cell lymphoma as well as uptake in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the U.S. Christi is available for Q&A later on the call. In summary, this was a really strong quarter for the entire Gilead and Kite commercial organization. And so with that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad for an update on our pipeline. Merdad Parsey : Thank you, Johanna. From a clinical perspective, we made solid progress in the second quarter, including a wealth of data updates spanning our oncology and virology portfolios. Starting with HIV on Slide 16, we are very pleased to share that our NDA submission for lenacapavir for heavily treatment experienced people living with HIV was accepted last week, and we now have a PDUFA date set for the end of December. Outside the U.S., we received a positive CHMP opinion for this indication, based on data from the Phase 2/3 CAPELLA trial. Week 26 data from this trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in May with updated, 1\u2010year data presented at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections earlier this year. In this very difficult to treat population, 83\u201086% of those treated with lenacapavir achieved virologic suppression at 1\u2010year, sustaining the rates achieved at Week 26. We continue to expect a decision from the European Commission later this year. Looking to Trodelvy on Slide 17. We shared new data at ASCO that increases our confidence in Trodelvy's potential applicability across a broad range of tumor types. These positive data from the Phase 3 ASCENT study reinforced Trodelvy's survival and health-related quality-of-life benefit over treatment of physician's choice in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. We also highlighted positive PFS and quality-of-life data from our Phase 3 TROPiCS-02 study, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 34% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in light-line, endocrine-resistant patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, who had received a median of three prior lines of treatment in the metastatic setting after having failed hormone therapy. This study also demonstrated a positive trend in overall survival at the first interim analysis. The TROPiCS-02 data, coupled with the NCCN recommendation, support Trodelvy's potential as a treatment option for late-line HR-positive/HER2-negative patients. As Dan mentioned, our discussions with the FDA are ongoing on the potential regulatory path, and we'll update you when we can. In the meantime, TROPiCS-02 continues with patients being followed for subsequent planned OS analyses. Separately, we continue to expand our Trodelvy clinical program. We began screening for patients in ASCENT-03, valuing Trodelvy in first-line metastatic TNBC patients who have PD-L1 negative tumors as well as in the ASCENT-04 study evaluating first-line patients with PD-L1 positive metastatic TNBC. Moving to Trodelvy in bladder cancer, the ongoing Phase 3 TROPiCS\u201004 study is our confirmatory trial designed to enable global registration for Trodelvy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. This study follows the encouraging data from TROPHY\u2010U01 supporting accelerated approval of Trodelvy in the U.S. for patients with mUC. Pending results from our first line expansion cohorts in the Phase 2 TROPHY\u2010U01 study, we plan to open two Phase 3 studies in front line mUC. In our Trodelvy lung program, we initiated the Phase 2 EVOKE\u201002 non\u2010small cell lung cancer study in the second quarter evaluating the combination of Trodelvy with Merck\u2018s Keytruda in patients without actionable genomic mutations. Looking forward to the second half of this year, we expect to begin enrolling patients for the Phase 3 EVOKE\u201003 or KEYNOTE\u2010D46 study in first\u2010line non\u2010small cell lung cancer with PD\u2010L1 expression level of greater than equal to 50%, in collaboration with our partners at Merck. Additionally, later this year we expect to initiate several other Trodelvy combinations, including evaluating Trodelvy in castrate\u2010resistant prostate cancer. Moving to magrolimab on Slide 18. We're pleased that both divisions of the FDA have now lifted the partial clinical hold on magrolimab. All magrolimab programs have resumed enrolling patients without FDA requiring any additional protocol changes. Our confidence in magrolimab's potential efficacy and safety profile is unchanged. At ASCO, we shared MDS and AML data from our Phase 1b study when magrolimab continues to demonstrate high and durable response rates in high-risk MDS with encouraging complete response rate of 33% compared with the historical rates of azacitadine alone. We also observed promising efficacy in patients with TP53 mutant AML with an ORR of 49% and a CR of 33%. Notably, our Phase 3 study in front line HR MDS, ENHANCE, is enrolling nicely and we expect the interim analysis no later than early 2023. Moving to cell therapy on Slide 19, and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, it is gratifying to see that more patients are benefiting from our cell therapies given the growing body of clinical evidence. Building on ZUMA\u20107 data, we presented real\u2010world data at ASCO that demonstrated consistent outcomes for survival and safety, regardless of race and ethnicity. And in a sub\u2010analysis of ZUMA\u20107 patients over 65, Yescarta demonstrated more than 8 times greater median Event Free Survival and a clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life.  These data further establish the efficacy and safety profile of Yescarta for patients with relapsed or refractory LBCL, and support ongoing exploration of Yescarta in more settings. We expect to enroll our first patient for ZUMA\u201024, a Phase 2 study to evaluate Yescarta in second line LBCL in an outpatient setting, as well as ZUMA\u201023, a Phase 3 study to evaluate Yescarta in first line, high\u2010risk LBCL patients in the second half of this year. Additionally, we expect first-patient-in in a new Phase 3 trial evaluating the use of Yescarta in second line HR follicular lymphoma patients, ZUMA\u201022, later this year. Now to Slide 20. As Dan mentioned, we made steady progress in the first half of the year and continue to focus on clinical execution. The key clinical milestones in the second half include : an update on our regulatory discussions for Trodelvy for late line HR-positive/HER2\u2010negative patients in the US; a number of potential regulatory decisions, including for lenacapavir, Yescarta, and Tecartus; at least six more trial initiations spanning Trodelvy, cell therapy and domvanalimab; as well as several data updates with our partner Arcus, including Phase 2 data from ARC\u20107. Later this year, we also expect to have interim Phase 2 data for etruma from the ARC\u20106 study as well as ARC\u20108\u2019s Phase 2 data for quemli. We are encouraged with early Phase 1 data for GS\u20105245, our investigational novel oral nucleoside in development for the treatment of COVID\u201019. We are discussing these early data with regulatory agencies and are planning to move into the clinic. We are also pleased to see our earlier stage pipeline with our partners, such as Tizona and Pionyr, continue to advance nicely. For example, Tizona\u2019s HLA\u2010G program is currently enrolling its dose expansion cohorts and Tizona expects to share interim data mid\u20102023. With our robust internal pipeline and external partners, we are confident our portfolio across virology, oncology, and inflammation will deliver many life\u2010changing treatments to help those patients in need.  With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Andy. Andrew Dickinson : Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I discuss our second quarter results and starting on Slide 22, I would like to remind everyone that following the SEC guidance earlier this year, similar to our peers, acquired in-process R&D expenses or IP R&D, including upfront payments for business development transactions, are now included in our non-GAAP financial measures and reported under acquired IP R&D. As a reminder, the $300 million payment associated with the Dragonfly collaboration announced in May is included in our Q2 results but was not reflected in our prior 2022 full year guidance. Additionally, we have shifted prior period milestone and opt-in payments from R&D to acquired IP R&D. We believe this presentation better reflects the total costs incurred to acquire IP R&D projects. The most notable example is the $625 million opt-in payment we made to Arcus that we reported in the fourth quarter of last year. There are a few other smaller payments that have been moved, and this slide highlights the changes that you'll now see reflected in our 2021 P&L. I'll further note that this change impacts our 2022 R&D guidance because our R&D guidance is given relative to our 2021 results. I'll touch on that again later in this call. Moving to our second quarter results, starting on Slide 23. This was a very strong quarter with a notable contribution from both our HIV and our oncology businesses. As expected, Veklury sales were substantially lower sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting the lower COVID hospitalization rates in the quarter. Total product sales, excluding Veklury, were up 7% year-over-year. Foreign currency impacted second quarter sales, excluding Veklury, by approximately $65 million net of hedges. If we exclude this impact as well as the impact of the HIV LOEs, total underlying sales growth year-over-year was 11% in the quarter. For the first half, total product sales growth excluding Veklury was 5%. Also excluding FX and the impact of the HIV LOEs, underlying growth for the first half was 8%. Back to our reported results on Slide 24. Johanna took you through our revenue results and the drivers there. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 85.6% for the second quarter, down 80 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the Biktarvy-related royalty following the settlement in the first quarter of this year. Non-GAAP R&D excluding acquired IP R&D expenses, such as milestones and upfront payments, was $1.1 billion, up 6% year-over-year, primarily due to increased investment in development and timing of clinical trial activities, primarily for our oncology business. Acquired IP R&D for the quarter was $330 million, including $300 million related to the Dragonfly collaboration. Non-GAAP SG&A was $1.3 billion, up 13% year-over-year, primarily due to increased promotional and marketing activities, including for Trodelvy as well as higher corporate expenses, including IT investments and grants. Non-GAAP operating margin was 43%, reflecting higher operating expenses and the upfront Dragonfly payment. Excluding the Dragonfly payment, non-GAAP operating margin was 47.5% for the quarter. Moving to tax, our non\u2010GAAP effective tax rate in the second quarter was 19.3%. Our non\u2010GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.58 in the second quarter of 2022, compared to $1.81 for the same period last year, reflecting the Dragonfly payment, which represented $0.18 on a post\u2010tax per share basis, as well as the Biktarvy\u2010related royalty. Overall, we had a strong first half of the year, as shown on Slide 25, with growth across HIV, cell therapy, and Trodelvy, offset in part by HCV. Of note, currency headwinds impacted first half total product sales by approximately $180 million, net of hedges, compared with the first half of 2021. Moving to Slide 26, we are increasing our full year sales guidance to reflect our year\u2010to\u2010date results and our expectations for the second half, including our expectations for FX. In addition to the impact in the first half, we expect continued FX headwinds in the second half, impacting total product sales by approximately $200 million in the rest of the year, compared to our initial February guidance For revenues, we now expect total product sales of $24.5 billion to $25 billion compared to our previous range of $23.8 billion to $24.3 billion. This reflects the strong performance year-to-date, notably very strong growth in cell therapy and HIV, and it also incorporates our expectations for the broader macro environment. In HIV, we expect modest sequential growth in the third quarter, keeping in mind the strength we experienced in the second quarter. And in cell therapy, we expect flat to modestly higher revenue in the third quarter compared to Q2. Following the launch bolus of orders we experienced in the second quarter, we expect demand to stabilize. Moving to Veklury. And with the first half revenue of almost $2 billion, we're increasing our expectations to approximately $2.5 billion for the year. Following inventory drawdown in the second quarter, we expect sales to increase sequentially in the United States and to continue to track hospitalization rates. Note that our Veklury guidance assumes no significant increase in hospitalization rates from Q2 levels. Excluding Veklury, we expect our total product sales to be $22 billion to $22.5 billion, representing growth of 3% to 5% year-over-year and compared to our prior range of $21.8 billion to $22.3 billion. As for the rest of the non-GAAP P&L, there is no change to our product gross margin guidance range of 85% to 86%. R&D, as described earlier, will no longer include BD-related payments such as milestones and opt-in fees. These will be reported as acquired IP R&D along with upfront payments. With this change, we have moved $762 million of full year 2021 expense from R&D to acquired IP R&D. As a result of this change, we now expect full year R&D expense to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage compared to the new 2021 baseline of $4.5 billion. Our expectations for full year R&D expense remained largely unchanged from the start of the year, and this guidance revision reflects only the recasting of acquired IP R&D items, including Arcus, previously reported in R&D in 2021. Moving to acquired IP R&D. We are not issuing guidance for the full year and similar to what we did with the Dragonfly deal this quarter, we'll update our EPS guidance quarterly as needed to reflect any relevant activity during the quarter. What we have included here is the year-to-date acquired IP R&D amounts. For SG&A, with our continued investment across our commercial organization and expectations for higher costs as a result of inflation, we now expect SG&A expenses to grow by a low single-digit percentage compared to 2021. Altogether, we expect operating income to be $11 billion to $11.6 billion for the full year compared to $10.7 billion to $11.5 billion previously. Similarly, we now expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to range between $6.35 to $6.75, up from $6.20 to $6.70 previously. On a GAAP basis, we expect our diluted earnings per share to range between $2.90 and $3.30 compared to $3 and $3.50 previously, primarily reflecting net unrealized losses from strategic equity investments. As a reminder, this revised EPS guidance reflects the $300 million upfront payment associated with the Dragonfly collaboration we announced in May, which was not included in our previous guidance as well as our FX expectations and operating expenses for the second half. The guidance share today does not include additional upfront payments related to normal course of business partnerships or licensing deals that we might announce in the third or fourth quarters. As discussed previously, we will continue to update our guidance as needed to reflect the impact of any new business development transactions closed in the prior quarter. Finally, on Slide 27, you can see there is no change to our capital allocation priorities. In the quarter, we returned almost $1 billion to shareholders, including $920 million in dividend payments. And just after the close of the quarter, we repaid $1 billion of debt, fulfilling our commitment to repay $1.5 billion of debt this year. I'm pleased to share that as of July 1, we have returned to the same debt level we were at prior to the Immunomedics acquisition. With that, I'll invite the operator to open the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital. Brian Abrahams : Congratulations on the quarter. I recognize that the discussions around Trodelvy in HR-positive/HER2-negative population are ongoing. But I'm just wondering, broadly speaking, if you can talk about the key things that you'll be focusing on with regards to the data and if there are certain subpopulations you might expect to gear towards from either a labeling or commercial perspective. Merdad Parsey : Brian, this is Merdad. I guess I'll start with that. For us right now, as we go forward with the study, I think we'll continue our focus on, of course, the OS evolution of the trial. And I think as we see how those data evolve over time, we will use that in our discussions with regulators as we go forward. In terms of additional subpopulations, of course, we'll keep an eye on a number of things in terms of whether it's line of therapy or those sorts of subpopulations or duration of prior therapy, which were all part of the original analysis. But those were -- it's consistent with what we've already shown at ASCO and the data that we've presented and shared with you. So it will be consistent with what we've already shown. Operator : Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Geoffrey Meacham : Johanna or Christi, the cell therapy segment which you guys called out had a huge quarter, I'm just curious how much of the demand do you think is sustainable? I mean, was it mostly driven by the new second-line label? Or did the total end market expand meaningfully? I guess I'm trying to figure out whether we reached a tipping point overall for reimbursement access in cell therapy. Daniel O'Day : Thanks, Geoff. Christi, over to you, please. Christi Shaw : Yes. Thanks, Geoff, for the question. I'll start with the second piece, reimbursement. Our reimbursement is really good. We have 98% access, and that's Medicaid, Medicare and commercial. Even with the second-line launch, in less than one quarter, we already have -- we already had 94% paid for across the three group. So reimburse in terms of the uptake, your first point of your question, the uptake that we've seen since launch is first primarily due to second line. We've seen the patients that are going for stem cell transplants are the ones that are getting referred instead of that transplant to second-line Yescarta. So that is our initial both. So what we expect is we've had this 68% year-over-year growth, 34% quarter-over-quarter. But we do believe that this is a bolus, and we expect the second half of the year going forward that -- we expect that growth to normalize to historical rates as that growth becomes more dependent on the referrals from the community. So we expect it to be still a really good growth, but we do believe that this is a bolus in the second line of the patients that exist in the ADCs and for the rest of the year. Just to reiterate that, that growth will return to more historic growth rates. Operator : Our next question comes from Tyler Van Buren with Cowen. Tyler Van Buren : Can you guys please provide your latest thoughts regarding the potential impact that drug pricing reform could have on Gilead's business and perhaps Biktarvy in particular given the significant concentration of HIV sales to the product and its longer patent life? Daniel O'Day : Yes. Thanks, Tyler. I mean I'll start. This is Dan. I mean, I think it's important for everybody on the call to note that we, as a company, and I think as an industry, are very focused on the fundamental issue in the U.S., which is reducing patient out-of-pocket costs. And there are lots of different ways to do that. Unfortunately, the current legislation falls very short of making an impact upon patients. And in particular, the negotiation part of the proposal is really a -- I think a real dangerous precedent in terms of potentially reducing forward innovation. I think in terms of how -- as you know, Tyler, the bill is still very much in discussion right now, and it's very difficult to determine the full impact. What I would say is, it's several years away, first of all, from the first impact. And of course, in the Part D area of the reform, that could have some impact on our business but also help patient out-of-pocket costs. I think when one starts to think about the negotiation aspect of the bill, it's still, I think, too premature to think about exactly how that could affect, and it is later in the decade in terms of its impact. So let's take it one step at a time, I think, to first see what happens with the current legislation, the discussions going on in Washington. Rest assured that we are actively involved in supporting what we think are patient-oriented benefits here and adjustments to the program. And then once -- and we'll see where that goes over the coming weeks and months, we'll be able to give you even more clarity on how things might impact our business. But overall, I would just emphasize the strength of our portfolio is strong. I mean we have tremendous new innovations coming out of the pipeline. We have continued growth in our HIV business and beyond. And I think the innovation cycle at Gilead is very sound. Operator : Our next question comes from Olivia Brayer with Cantor Fitzgerald. Olivia Brayer : Are you guys seeing any impact from monkeypox on the HIV business? Is that a headwind you're factoring into guidance at this point for second half of the year? Johanna Mercier : Sure, Olivia. It's Johanna. Let me take that one on. Speaking with a lot of our specialists across the U.S. but also in Europe, they have seen obviously the rising number of monkeypox. And there is a correlation with both our HIV treatment business but also with prevention because the general percentage, the higher percentage of folks that are experiencing monkeypox are actually men having sex with men. And so obviously, that's the overlap. So on the contrary, we're not seeing an impact to our HIV business. We're actually seeing more screening and diagnosis that are coming in, in light of that and because of that close association. So I do think -- and the same people are treating. The prevention piece is actually a really important piece of the puzzle to try to prevent moving forward with monkeypox and getting the vaccines in. So definitely more on the positive front of our HIV business and how ever we can support that, that's what we're trying to do right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore. Umer Raffat : I had a question on a clarification. First, maybe the question. I think, Merdad, you hinted, you are or you will be discussing early oral Remdesivir data with FDA. I'm curious if you saw any viral load benefit as well as whether the EC90 -- how much EC90 tracks above the C trough. And then clarification was on TIGIT ARC-7 because the slides on last quarter implied we're expecting PFS data -- Phase 2 PFS data in the second half, but today's slides only say Phase 2 data. So maybe if you could clarify if there's still a chance PFS could be part of the data update. Merdad Parsey : Yes. Thanks for the questions. So as far as the oral new program for COVID-19 goes, the Phase 1 study is in healthy volunteers. So we don't expect to see anything other than safety and PK in that study. And all I can say is I think things have gone very well with that trial so far both from a tolerability and an exposure standpoint. So we're very happy with where we are. And now we'll move into the proof-of-concept and clinical development stage. So no viral load data to share. And then in terms of the ARC-7 data, I don't think -- I guess I would suggest not overreading. We are working with Arcus, and we will -- as the data roll out, we will be sharing data Arcus, and we will be sharing data from the ARC-7 study later on this year and the data that we will have. We're not really detailing what those data are going to look like right now. But be assured that we'll work with them to show data later this year. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about Trodelvy demand in the U.S. Sort of sequentially, growth has slowed pretty significantly over the last couple of quarters here. Is that mostly a reflection that you've penetrated most of the triple-negative market and you need label expansion in that growth? Or are there other factors there from a sequential growth standpoint? Johanna Mercier : Thanks, Matthew. It's Johanna. Let me try to give you a little bit more context. So as you saw from a global standpoint, we had really strong growth across the board. A lot of that growth, as you're referring to, comes from some of the market launches in Europe, namely France and Germany, where there's been a bit of a bolus but also real learnings as to making sure that we increase awareness for Trodelvy early on. And so from a U.S. standpoint, we actually did see strong demand growth quarter-over-quarter. We saw it at about 7%. Unfortunately, it got impacted by unfavorable onetime pricing dynamics. And so that's where you see the net revenues are only up 1%. No concerns on our end because we do see the momentum actually continuing from a share standpoint, and we definitely haven't maximized our opportunity in Trodelvy. Let me tell you, I think that with the incredible overall survival data and the only overall survival data that's shown in this patient population, there's a real opportunity for us to educate and increase the awareness. That's something that we've been tracking really closely is that awareness piece. We got a little slowed down through the COVID era just because offices and cancer centers were quite shut down. But having said that, that picked up really quite nicely over the last three to four months and we've expanded our footprint. As you may recall, we close to tripled our footprint as of April-May time frame.  Now obviously, as you know, when you do that, you're not -- you shouldn't expect results, I would love it, but you shouldn't expect results within the first month. It usually takes about six months or so to start seeing those through, and we should see those come through in the fall as well as additional countries getting reimbursement as you've seen from some of the HTA decisions that have come through and launching in Europe as well. So looking forward to that, but definitely more opportunity ahead and definitely on track to make sure we capture that opportunity. Operator : Our next question comes from David Risinger of SVB Securities. David Risinger : Congrats on the results. So we are obviously in the unfortunate situation in which the government may be working against small molecule innovation in particular, but innovation more broadly. And in light of the possibility that legislation could be signed into law, could you comment on the percentage of Biktarvy net revenue that currently comes from Medicare Part D, just so we have a sense for the potential exposure to Biktarvy drug price controls in 2027? Daniel O'Day : Thanks, Dave. Do you want to start with that, Johanna? Johanna Mercier : Yes. Let me start with that. So thanks, David, for your question. I think we touched on a little bit about some of the potential impact. Having said that, from a split government to, I guess, commercial business, it's around -- depending on the different pieces, you're looking at around 40%, 50% versus about a 30% commercial. So that -- what I'm including in that is more your Medicaid/Medicare kind of business, and that's what's kind of playing out to your -- as well as your 340B. So I think it's really -- I don't think you should look at it more -- just looking at the percentage of the business. I think it's going to be really interesting to see how all this plays out and when it plays out because it's nothing is really going to impact us for quite some time. I would also suggest that we look at the incredible diversity of our portfolio that we're growing year-on-year and also the geographical diversity as well, which I think will really help mitigate some of these pressures as we go forward. But just from a government business, you are looking probably close to 50% of our total business is in the government setting. Operator : Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Salveen Richter : On HIV, could you just comment on what's keeping the screening and diagnosis below pre-pandemic levels and whether you'd expect a full recovery by year-end? And separately, could you give us a quick update on where you stand with [long-acting] programs? Johanna Mercier : What's the last part? Can you repeat the last part of that question? Salveen Richter : Where you stand with the long-acting programs when we might see positive data? Johanna Mercier : Yes. Thanks. You cut out a little bit. Apologies. So let me get the first part of that question, and then I'll throw it over to Merdad for the long-acting. So from an HIV screening standpoint, we're about 8% below pre-pandemic levels, so very much in line with kind of where we were pre-2019. From a diagnosis standpoint, what you're seeing is that 30% or so below pre-pandemic, but that's kind of normal. What we've seen in the past, even prior to COVID-19, we're seeing a decline of the diagnosis rate about 10% year-over-year. And so if you think about three years, that's about your 30%. So not a huge surprise there and good news, right, as you're thinking about how this HIV market is -- its evolution. What I would like to focus you on, though, is the fact that from a treatment and PrEP standpoint, we are above pre-pandemic levels from a market growth standpoint. And so we feel very confident that the market has recovered. And actually, in PrEP, it's more than recovered. It's actually higher than it's ever been before. So it's actually an expansion of the market. So I think we're in much better shape, and it's taken a little bit more time for treatment. But I think as of Q2, I can honestly say that it is really in a very good place, which is great news for patients. Merdad Parsey : And from a long-acting standpoint, I'd just reiterate with the PDUFA date at the end of the year for lenacapavir in highly treatment experience, I think that will be the first approval, knock wood, for lenacapavir, and I think that gets us started. After that, remember then we have multiple efforts ongoing. On the PrEP side, we have the purpose studies that are underway. Those are longer-term studies because they're prevention studies, so they'll take a little bit longer to read out. We're looking at few years there, a couple of years, at least for those studies. And then on the treatment side, we are -- we have a number of shots on goal there, both oral long-acting as well as subcutaneous long-acting. And there, we are -- we have our own efforts. And you may have noticed we have a number of partner molecules that are coming through our pipeline that could be partnered with lenacapavir for a full treatment regimen that would include lenacapavir. And we continue to work with Merck on the potential for lenacapavir combinations with islatravir. So a lot of different options and a lot of work that's ongoing. And as those progress further along, we'll keep you updated. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael Yee : One question but two parts. On Trodelvy, maybe Andy or Merdad, you could remind us, have you actually met with FDA on the potential filing? Or what's the holdup there? And how soon is soon to hear back at this? And I think you've already taken a write-down if it was not to be filed, so that would be a different scenario there. But I don't think there'll be any further write-downs if that was the case. And then maybe just comment on lung cancer opportunity. I think in your slide, you say there would be Phase 3 data in lung cancer next year, and I know that EGS read out next year as well. So just wanted to understand that and your confidence level in lung cancer. Merdad Parsey : Thanks, Michael. Thanks for the questions. So on Trodelvy, yes, I think nothing has changed from what we said earlier in that we are excited about the data that we generate in TROPiCS-02 and are having ongoing discussions with the agency. And I think if things continue to go well, we will discuss with them the potential for filing. We're cautiously optimistic that, that should be able to continue to go forward, and we'll be able to update you in due course. In terms of lung, the primary focus for us in lung is actually the initiation of our Phase 3 trials in lung. Whether it's the combination trials I referenced earlier with Merck or some of the other combinations that we're doing, we will have some additional data in line that will be coming -- that will be generated over time. But I think the focus should be on those Phase 3 studies that we'll be reading out. And then maybe, Andy, do you want to address the write-downs? Andrew Dickinson : Sure. Yes, I'd be happy. Michael, thanks for the question. As you recall, we took a conservative approach to the write-down that we took earlier this year as we looked at the potential path forward. We will continue to monitor on a quarterly basis as we have historically and as we should the progress on the program both in lung cancer and in hormone-receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, both of which we had caring value on the balance sheet and IP R&D, as you know. So we'll continue to monitor it over time. And each major event, whether it's regulatory discussions or filings or potential approvals, we'll look at that value. Again, we remain confident in the program overall, like where the program is going, and we'll update you as soon as we can on our discussions with the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Seedhouse with Raymond James. Steven Seedhouse : I had another one on Yescarta just given the strong second line launch. I was wondering how you view the market size or opportunity in second line versus some of the potential upcoming opportunities, ZUMA-23 or -24 populations and outpatients high-risk, first-line and if those could be similar legs up and just how you're thinking about the sort of peak overall opportunity here for Yescarta? Daniel O'Day : Great. Thanks. Christi, over to you. Christi Shaw : Thank you for the question, Steve. It's really great news for patients right now. Not only is Yescarta being used, but more importantly, we're seeing the class grow. So the use of cell therapy overall is growing, which means instead of the two out of 10 patients receiving cell therapy, more are. And that was really -- the impetus for that was really the second-line approval in April. Also all of the data that you saw at ASH with our ZUMA 5-year data -- ZUMA-1 5-year data of overall survival, ZUMA-7 second-line NCCN guidelines, Yescarta being the only Category 1 NCCN product approved for second line. So we do see that this momentum is starting to happen, where it is the only curative potential that physicians have in this grave disease safer patients. So as we look to the future, we're very optimistic that we're trying to get this closer to patients in the outpatient setting, which we are doing through clinical trials. And also some of our authorized treatment centers have already published their data on utilization of Yescarta in the outpatient setting, i.e. Vanderbilt. And as we look at the frontline setting, we're in negotiations right now with the regulatory authorities on exactly how do we define high risk for that trial. So I do think we're finally starting to realize the potential of this curative therapy for patients. And I think that this will continue. I will say, though, that this bolus is -- I'll reiterate what I said before. This is a bolus, we believe, with the second-line launch of this pent-up demand in the [HCC] treating patients who are immune to authorized treatment centers, stem cell transplant. So the heavy lifting is over. We have a lot of work to do to educate physicians in the community to ensure that they're referring patients to treatment centers at a timely fashion. So we do have work to do in education, and that's included in the community and also the -- as we launch in multiple countries across the globe. So we do see a steady growth continuing for the next quarters and years to come. Operator : Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Carter Gould : I guess one question, one clarification. First on sort of the CAR T business, can you just talk about the phasing of the supply ramp on the manufacturing side to the extent that might help out this year? Should we think about that really just sort of weighted to year-end? And I guess in answering that, if you could also address sort of the EU manufacturing side, we don't hear much on that. And then on the clarification piece, Johanna, I appreciate the comments on sort of the 50% government for Biktarvy. But could you spell out, I guess, Medicare versus Medicaid there? It's been getting a lot of incoming on that. Daniel O'Day : Great. Christi, do you want to start and then we'll move to the\u2026. Christi Shaw : Happy to. So one of the things we're probably particularly proud of is our ability to supply patients both consistently, reliably into the high-quality standards. And that started with El Segundo, California. But to your point, in the EU, Amsterdam is now supplying all of Europe for Yescarta, and they're starting to do Tecartus as well. And so we expect all of the manufacturing for European patients to move to the Amsterdam site by the end of this year. In addition, we just opened the Maryland site, which is the first time we'll actually have automation. One of our -- one of two modules of automation is up and running in Maryland. And that had -- that Maryland site has allowed us to actually increase our number of slots for patients by 50%. So we feel very confident that we not only can provide patients for what we have today, but what we have in the future and for the future ramp-up that we have plenty of capacity to supply and continue to ensure that we have the high-quality standards. The last piece I'll say on supply is we made a decision about 2.5, three years ago to bring in viral vector at Oceanside, California. So we're not at the whim of ups and downs, if you will, of viral vector supply. So we have both internal and external ability to ensure that we can keep that continuity for patients and not be disrupted. Daniel O'Day : Thanks, Christi. Over to you, Johanna. Johanna Mercier : Yes. Thanks. So just to clarify, and thanks for allowing me the opportunity, Carter, and maybe give a little bit more insight to the question. I gave you full numbers on government, but obviously, not all of those numbers get impacted by this reform or what we think might be the reform that we're talking about. And so from a Medicaid standpoint, it's less than 20% of our total business. And so that's really what we should focus on as we think about potential for impact. And again, that impact doesn't happen anytime soon. It's really later in this decade. Dan, did you want to add? Daniel O'Day : I'll just add. Thanks, Carter. I know there's a lot of moving parts here, so I just want to kind of reinforce a couple of things. As you know, there are three different aspects of the bill. I mean one is, of course, the Part D reform. And here, a major difference from what occurs today, instead of 10% in the catastrophic phase, it goes to 20% in catastrophic phase. It is potentially in the second half of the [decade]. I think something -- from our perspective, that as we look at our business is quite manageable. The second thing is inflation rebate, which I think we would have a low to 0 exposure to. And then the third one is negotiation. I just want to be clear on negotiations. There's a lot of moving parts here. And to Johanna's point, it does not affect the entirety of the government business. Much of the government business is already contracted and under negotiation. And so I really think -- and I'm sure you'll find this with most companies that it's extraordinarily difficult to measure that impact. It also compressed later in the decade. And there's quite a bit of ambiguity about what's products and how and when. And there'll be a lot of discussions should this legislation be passed about the details associated with that. So again, as much as I believe this is not the right thing to do for the industry, I also believe that we've got a very robust underlying business here and that these impacts are not short term at this stage. So, yes. And just to be clear, on that 20% figure that's... Johanna Mercier : Medicare, Medicaid. Daniel O'Day : Sorry? Johanna Mercier : Medicaid, Medicare. Daniel O'Day : Right. Jacquie Ross : Andrea, we still have a couple of minutes. So we will take one last question Andrea please. Operator : Our last question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : So maybe, Johanna, if you can talk a little bit about the COVID trends in PrEP market. So I know last couple of years, you took a little bit of price decline just to maintain market share. So where do you stand on the pricing? Has it stabilized at this point? And where does the market share of Descovy versus Truvada in this market stand at this point? Johanna Mercier : Sure. So let me take that one, Mohit. The -- so basically from a market share standpoint, we basically -- we lost maybe a point or so over the last year, but we're at about 44% market share for Descovy in PrEP, which I think is pretty incredible if you think about the generic competition that we've been facing. The balance of that market share right now is pretty much all Truvada, Truvada generics. There's about less than 1% if you think of aptitude as you think about new entrants in the marketplace. So it's really a mix of Descovy for PrEP as well as Truvada genericization. The -- from a pricing standpoint, what you were referring to, the -- it has stabilized, although the rebates are definitely higher than what we were doing in the past just because there's choice now. And we are really trying to ensure that Descovy is a choice for physicians when people at risk need something. And so we want to make sure that that's an option for them and making sure that we have the best on the marketplace with -- if you think about the bone and renal safety profile that Descovy can offer. So that's really why we've been playing in that field, and that's why it's come -- it's put a little bit of more pressure on the commercial fund, specifically on the rebate front. And so I think that's stabilizing, but every year is a new year as we enter negotiations, so more to come as we go into 2023. But for 2022, we're in good shape. And we're also leveraging the incredible market growth for prevention that's been playing out. So all the things are very positive things for Descovy in prevention as well as for people at risk. Daniel O'Day : Great. So thanks so much for joining today. I just want to thank you again. I just want to reinforce what a strong quarter this was and thank the team for really significant momentum, I would say, in our business. You saw our first quarter or second quarter. We're committed to delivering quarter after quarter on this on both the commercial execution of the pipeline side and really excited about where we stand right now and where we're heading. With that, I'll turn it over to Jacquie for some closing comments. Jacquie Ross : Thanks, Dan, and thank you all for joining us today. Please do feel free to reach out to Investor Relations if you have any follow-up questions on the quarter. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. Thank you. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Good bye.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience, and thank you for attending today\u2019s Third Quarter 2022 Gilead Sciences Earnings Conference Call. My name is Amber, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to our host, Jacquie Ross, VP of Investor Relations. Jacquie, please proceed. Jacquie Ross : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the third quarter of 2022. The press release, slides, and supplementary data are available on the investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today\u2019s call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O\u2019Day, our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier, our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey, and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we\u2019ll open up the call to Q&A, where the team will be joined by Christi Shaw, the Chief Executive Officer of Kite. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward\u2010looking statements, including those related to Gilead\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations; plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations, financial projections and the use of capital; and 2022 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward\u2010looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward\u2010looking statements. Non\u2010GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the Company\u2019s underlying business performance. The GAAP to non\u2010GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, in our supplementary data sheet, as well as on the Gilead website. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dan. Daniel O\u2019Day: Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everybody. We\u2019re pleased to connect with all of you today to share the details of another very strong quarter. Thanks to strong commercial and clinical execution by our teams, the positive momentum continues to build. Total product sales excluding Veklury were $6.1 billion, growing 6% sequentially and 11% year\u2010over\u2010year. The total including Veklury was $7 billion. If we exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the tail\u2010end of the loss of exclusivity for Truvada and Atripla in HIV, total product sales excluding Veklury grew 15% from the third quarter of last year. The majority of this growth was driven by HIV and over 40% of the $620 million increase in sales came from oncology. The team will share more details, but this has been a great quarter for commercial execution, including: continued share gains for Biktarvy, growing momentum for Trodelvy, another impressive quarter for cell therapy, and a strong quarter for Veklury. We also saw continued clinical momentum this quarter. Some of the highlights include : the FDA priority review granted to Trodelvy for late line HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, the EU approvals for Yescarta for second line relapsed and refractory Large B\u2010Cell Lymphoma, and Tecartus in adult Acute Lymphoblastic Lymphoma, and in virology, lenacapavir received its first regulatory approval, in Europe. Marketed as Sunlenca, it is approved for heavily\u2010treatment experienced people living with multi\u2010drug resistant HIV, making it the first approved capsid inhibitor and the first therapy with a six\u2010month dosing schedule for HIV treatment. We are taking multiple important steps to advance our ambitious clinical pipeline, including: in oncology, we are expanding our lung program, with 8 trials now active, and 3 more planned to start in the coming months; we plan to resume our phase two trial investigating a once\u2010weekly oral combination of Merck\u2019s islatravir and our lenacapavir. This will be one of many ongoing combination studies we have for long\u2010acting HIV treatment, in addition to our extensive program for prevention; and we continue to further strengthen our early\u2010stage portfolio, adding a BTLA agonist for inflammation from MiroBio and an option for a bispecific antibody for oncology from MacroGenics. Moving to our clinical goals for 2022 on slide 5, we\u2019re on track to start the 2 remaining Phase 3 trials, namely EVOKE\u201003 for first line non\u2010small cell lung cancer and ZUMA\u201023 for first line high risk LBCL. We continue to expect another interim readout for the Phase 2 ARC\u20107 study in first line non\u2010small cell lung cancer before the end of the year. Overall, this has been another very strong quarter in a very strong year for Gilead. We\u2019re seeing impressive growth of our base business with continued share gains for Biktarvy, an excellent performance for cell therapy and growing demand for Trodelvy. On the clinical side, we\u2019ve had the first approval for lenacapavir, a foundational asset for the future of our HIV franchise. Trodelvy is now under priority review for HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer in the U.S. and we\u2019re executing on an extensive development program across virology, oncology and inflammation. Finally, the recent TAF settlement is expected to significantly extend the exclusivity of key components of our HIV franchise in the U.S. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank the Gilead and Kite teams for their outstanding clinical and commercial execution. This consistent execution of our strategy, along with a very robust portfolio has led to some terrific progress in 2022 and we look forward to building on that momentum through the rest of the year and beyond. With that, I\u2019ll invite Johanna to share an update on our third quarter commercial performance. Johanna Mercier : Thanks Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I jump into the commercial results for the third quarter, I wanted to begin by acknowledging our teams for another exceptional quarter. We\u2019re making important progress in our goals of ensuring the strength and sustainability of our virology franchise, while also continuing to build our expertise and market presence in oncology. Turning to slide 7, we had a very strong quarter with total product sales excluding Veklury of $6.1 billion, up 11% year\u2010over\u2010year, or 15% excluding FX and the residual impact of the HIV LOEs, with growth in each of our core franchise areas, and notable strength in HIV and oncology. Sequentially, total product sales excluding Veklury grew 6%, driven by HIV, HCV, and oncology. Growth excluding FX impact and the LOEs was 8%. On slide 8, HIV sales of $4.5 billion were up 7% year\u2010over\u2010year. Excluding the impact of both FX and the LOEs, HIV revenue grew 10% year\u2010over\u2010year. Similar to last quarter, this was primarily channel mix driven by U.S. government utilization leading to higher average realized price, in addition to higher demand. Overall, despite the quarter\u2010over\u2010quarter shifts in average realized price, government plans continue to represent approximately 60% of our U.S. HIV treatment prescriptions, including Medicare in the low\u201020s. HIV revenue growth was driven by the U.S., while Europe was down year\u2010over\u2010year, due to FX and less favorable pricing dynamics, offset in part by higher demand. Quarter\u2010over\u2010quarter, HIV sales were up 6%, similarly driven by channel mix and inventory dynamics, as well as higher demand. Turning to the market more broadly, we are encouraged that on a year-over-year basis, the HIV treatment market across the U.S. and Europe has grown for five consecutive quarters. This reflects the work we have been doing with our partners to bring people living with HIV and people at risk of HIV back into care following the pandemic. The market growth we are seeing suggests that activity has returned to pre\u2010COVID trends. In the third quarter of 2022, the market grew 2% year\u2010over\u2010year both in the U.S. and Europe. Looking forward, we continue to expect annual treatment market growth in the 2% to 3% range. Descovy sales were $500 million, up 16% year\u2010over\u2010year and 9% sequentially, and PrEP market share remains stable despite generic and other entrants. For the quarter, the PrEP market continues to demonstrate robust growth, largely driven by the growing awareness for PrEP and demand well\u2010above pre\u2010pandemic levels. Overall, the PrEP market grew 19% year\u2010over\u2010year and 6% sequentially. Onto slide 9. Third quarter Biktarvy sales were $2.8 billion, up 22% year\u2010over\u2010year, driven by higher demand in both the U.S. and Europe, and favorable pricing dynamics. Sequentially, sales were up 8%, due to higher demand as well as favorable inventory and pricing dynamics. Once again, Biktarvy continues to command a leading position in the treatment of HIV, with another record quarter growing to 45% market share in the U.S., up 4 percentage points year\u2010over\u2010year. Moreover, Biktarvy remains the leading medicine for those seeking to switch to a new regimen in the U.S. as well as those starting treatment in both the U.S. and Europe, most notably, capturing 10 new starts for every 1 person prescribed another medicine in the U.S. Looking to the fourth quarter, I\u2019d like to call out a few points. First, given the historic trend towards a significant inventory build in the fourth quarter followed by inventory draw down in the first quarter, we are renewing our focus on inventory management in an effort to better align the timing of product delivery with end\u2010user demand. Second, while we continue to see strong market share gains for Biktarvy in addition to solid growth in both the treatment and prevention markets, we will remind you that some of our second and third quarter performance has been driven by shifts in channel mix that have had a favorable impact on average realized price. Given the favorable trends we observed over the last two quarters we do expect the channel mix to be more stable in the fourth quarter. With these factors in mind, and also allowing for further FX impact, we expect fourth quarter HIV sales to be roughly flat on a sequential basis, noting that full year 2022 HIV growth is therefore expected to be approximately 4%, or 7% excluding the LOEs and FX headwinds year to date. In summary, we\u2019re extremely proud of the portfolio we have built in HIV and excited about the way Gilead is positioned for 2023 and beyond. Specifically, Biktarvy\u2019s clinical profile continues to impress, evidenced by ongoing, strong growth rates even though its annual revenue run rate is now in excess of $10 billion. Descovy for PrEP, maintained over 40% market share despite competition and generic entrants. And most recently lenacapavir\u2019s approval as Sunlenca for heavily treatment experienced people living with multi\u2010drug resistant HIV in the EU. This is an important option for a group that has few treatment options, and is a great opportunity for physicians and the HIV community to get more familiar with a six monthly, subcutaneous HIV therapy. We believe this sets the stage well for our other planned lenacapavir\u2010based treatment and prevention regimens. All of this, combined with, the treatment and prevention markets showing solid recovery; the impact of the loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla now behind us; and the recent TAF settlement extending projected U.S. LOEs for Descovy and Odefsey into the early 2030s, and Genvoya\u2019s patent to 2029 in the U.S. All of this truly underpins our confidence that Gilead is well\u2010positioned for growth and continued leadership in the HIV market. Now onto slide 10. HCV sales for the third quarter were $524 million, up 22% year\u2010over\u2010year and 17% sequentially, primarily due to the favorable resolution of a prior year rebate claim in Europe and other favorable pricing dynamics in the U.S. Offsetting these benefits, there were fewer patient starts in both the U.S. and Europe, consistent with our expectations for both the quarter and the general trend that you should expect in HCV going forward. Despite the trend in patients starts, we\u2019re pleased to maintain HCV market share of more than 50% in both the U.S. and Europe, and third quarter share increased on a year\u2010over\u2010year basis. For HBV and HDV on slide 11, sales were up 7% year\u2010over\u2010year and 13% quarter\u2010over\u2010quarter, primarily driven by favorable inventory dynamics. Moving to Veklury on slide 12, third quarter revenues were $925 million. As expected, sales were down year\u2010over\u2010year given lower U.S. hospitalizations as compared to the same period last year. Indeed, though hospitalizations are below the peak seen at the start of the year, it\u2019s clear with the sequential increase that the path of the pandemic remains difficult to predict. Nonetheless, we\u2019re proud of the role Veklury continues to play in the fight against COVID\u201019. In the U.S., Veklury is used in approximately 60% of hospitalized patients who are being treated for COVID. And outside the U.S., Veklury\u2019s benefit to patients continues to be recognized by health authorities including the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency, based in part on the PINETREE data which demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalization after a three\u2010day IV treatment in the outpatient setting. These factors continue to support Veklury utilization where it is needed. Moving to Oncology, and beginning with Trodelvy on slide 13. Sales of $180 million grew 78% year\u2010 over\u2010year and 13% quarter\u2010over quarter, and we continue to work with regulators, payers and clinicians around the world to broaden access. Since its approval in second line metastatic TNBC late last year in Europe, Trodelvy is now reimbursed in 13 countries outside the U.S., with additional markets in Europe and elsewhere expected to come on line shortly. We\u2019ve also begun work on establishing the right infrastructure to support a potential launch into pretreated HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Reinforcing the significant unmet need in this population, and the clinically meaningful overall survival data demonstrated in the Phase 3 TROPiCS\u201002 study, FDA has accepted our supplemental Biologics License Application as Priority Review and we look to a decision in February of next year. We\u2019re excited by the potential for many more patients to benefit from Trodelvy. Now onto slide 14, and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, I\u2019m pleased to share that Cell Therapy sales in the third quarter were $398 million, up 79% year\u2010over\u2010year and up 8% sequentially. These strong results were driven by continued growth in large B\u2010cell lymphoma and Kite\u2019s ability to reliably meet customer demand. Together with our recently FDA\u2010approved viral vector manufacturing facility in Oceanside, Kite remains well\u2010positioned to ensure clinical and commercial supply availability while it continues to execute on its geographic expansion. For the quarter, Yescarta sales of $317 million were up 81% year\u2010over\u2010year and 8% quarter\u2010over\u2010 quarter, driven by a continued successful launch in second\u2010line LBCL in the U.S. and partially offset by FX headwinds in Europe. Just last week, Yescarta was approved in the EU for second\u2010line LBCL and we look forward to launching there in the months ahead. Tecartus grew 72% year\u2010over\u2010year to deliver $81 million in sales, driven by growth in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In early September, the European Marketing Authorization for Tecartus in relapsed or refractory ALL was granted. We continue to broaden awareness and access to our cell therapies through indication and Authorized Treatment Center expansion in existing markets as well as through geographic expansion, as demonstrated by our most recent regulatory applications in Brazil, Singapore, and Saudi Arabia. As always, Christi is available for Q&A later on the call. Overall, this was an incredibly strong quarter for Gilead oncology, with revenue of $578 million up 10% from last quarter and 79% from last year. This represents an almost $2.4 billion annual run rate as we move into the last few months of 2022, and hints at the possibilities ahead as we continue to execute on our commercial and clinical oncology goals. And with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Merdad for an update on our pipeline. Merdad Parsey : Thank you, Johanna. Before I start, I\u2019d like to recognize the strong execution of our internal team and external partners across a broad range of activities that\u2019s diversified across therapeutic area and clinical stage with milestones spanning study initiations, the sBLA submission for Trodelvy, two EC approvals in cell therapy, and our first approval for lenacapavir in the EU. On slide 16, you can see that we\u2019ve made a lot of progress so far this year, meeting nearly all our milestones. Regarding our BLA filing for Hepcludex, we received a Complete Response Letter from FDA, citing concerns about the manufacture and delivery of Hepcludex. We will take the time to fully digest the CRL, but note that no new safety or efficacy clinical trials were requested by the FDA. We plan to resubmit as quickly as possible and will work with the agency on the path forward. We remain confident in bulevirtide and the potential benefits it can bring to people living with HDV, and will share an update on the U.S. regulatory pathway when we can. Moving onto HIV on slide 17. We\u2019re thrilled that lenacapavir received its first marketing authorization from the European Commission as Sunlenca for people living with multi\u2010drug resistant HIV, in combination with other antiretrovirals. Sunlenca is a first\u2010in\u2010class capsid inhibitor. It is the first and only twice\u2010yearly, subcutaneous HIV treatment and adds a much\u2010needed option for those people living with HIV with limited alternatives. We continue to expect a decision on our NDA for lenacapavir from FDA in late December of this year. In the meantime, this first regulatory approval from the EC is an important validation while we continue to progress our other lenacapavir\u2010based treatment and prevention programs. For HIV treatment, a new clinical development plan allowing a lower dose of islatravir, Merck\u2019s investigational NRTTI, is moving forward after FDA review. As such, we are planning to resume the Phase 2 trial investigating an oral, once\u2010weekly lenacapavir and islatravir combination. Our internal combination programs are also ongoing, and we expect to share data next year from the Phase 1b proof\u2010of\u2010concept study for lenacapavir and two broadly\u2010neutralizing antibodies, or bNAbs, directed at HIV. In prevention, our clinical development continues to progress with four in\u2010process or planned clinical trials evaluating every six\u2010month subcutaneous lenacapavir. Moving to slide 18, Veklury continues to be recognized as a standard of care for patients with severe COVID\u201019, with updated guidelines for Veklury from the World Health Organization. Additionally, the CHMP issued a positive opinion on the use of Veklury for the treatment of pediatric patients with COVID\u201019. Although novel treatments and vaccinations have improved the COVID\u201019 outlook, there is a continued need for effective and convenient oral treatment options for patients. I am pleased to share that the FDA has just granted our novel oral nucleoside, GS\u20105245, Fast Track Designation, which aims to expedite development of promising new medicines. We continue to be in active discussions with the FDA and other global regulators on potential clinical pathways including a Phase 3 study that we expect to start within the next several months, either globally or outside the U.S. On slide 19, we show the Phase 3 TROPiCS\u201002 results in patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer that was a late breaking presentation at ESMO in September. Trodelvy demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 3.2\u2010month overall survival benefit. Patients with metastatic HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer who have progressed on endocrine\u2010based therapies and chemotherapy have limited options. As a reminder, the patients enrolled in TROPiCS\u201002 were heavily pre\u2010treated with a median of three prior chemotherapy regimens in addition to prior CDK4/6 inhibitors. Importantly, the FDA recently accepted our sBLA for Trodelvy in HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer and granted it a Priority Review. The PDUFA date is currently set for February 2023. We continue to work with regulatory agencies outside the U.S. to potentially make this medicine available to eligible patients. Additionally, following the acquisition of Trodelvy\u2019s Asian commercialization and development rights from Everest Medicines, we expect data from our Phase 3 metastatic TNBC China bridging trial in the next few months and our Phase 3 Asian HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer study in mid\u20102023. Moving to lung cancer on slide 20, you can see that we expect to have at least 9 active clinical trials in non\u2010small cell lung cancer by the end of 2022, including 5 with Trodelvy, as well as programs with zimberelimab, domvanalimab and etruma, Merck\u2019s Keytruda, AstraZeneca\u2019s durvalumab, and our own magrolimab. Eight trials are already underway, including the Phase 3 EVOKE\u201001 study in second to third line non\u2010small cell lung cancer and our Phase 2 EVOKE\u201002 study in first line non\u2010small cell lung cancer without actionable mutations. Our partner Merck also plans to initiate the Phase 3 EVOKE\u201003 study later this year to evaluate the combination of Trodelvy and Keytruda in first\u2010line patients with non\u2010small cell lung cancer whose tumors express high levels of PD\u2010L1. Additionally, with our partner Arcus, we\u2019re looking forward to the fourth interim analysis of the Phase 2 ARC\u20107 trial evaluating zim and dom in PD\u2010L1\u2010high non\u2010small cell lung cancer before the end of the year. Data from ARC\u20107 are expected to support our ongoing Phase 3 studies for dom\u2010based combinations in lung cancer, including STAR\u2010121 which just achieved first patient in. Lung cancer is a disease area with high unmet need, and we believe we have multiple promising MOAs and potential combinations that could help bring additional new treatment options to patients. To explore these opportunities, we plan to initiate two Phase 2 signal seeking platform studies, VELOCITY and the Arcus\u2010led EDGE\u2010lung in the coming months. Overall, we have initiated a comprehensive evaluation of the assets in our portfolio to address the significant unmet need in lung cancer, and look forward to sharing updates in the coming years. Moving to slide 21, and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, we are highlighting our expanding clinical pipeline as we build on the growing momentum and adoption of cell therapy based on the significant survival benefit that Yescarta and Tecartus are delivering to patients. We believe there are still opportunities to bring Yescarta and Tecartus to more patients by moving into earlier lines as well as new indications. As you can see, we have recently enrolled patients in several studies, including ZUMA\u201024, a Phase 2 study to evaluate Yescarta in an outpatient setting for second line LBCL, and ZUMA\u201022, a Phase 3 study for Yescarta in second line plus high\u2010risk follicular lymphoma. We also expect to begin screening patients for the ZUMA\u201023 study of Yescarta in Q4. The decision to initiate a Phase 3 trial in first line HR LBCL was based on the encouraging data from ZUMA\u201012, where Yescarta demonstrated 89% ORR and 78% CR. Additional studies include an evaluation of Tecartus in rare B\u2010cell malignancies, and KITE\u2010363 that\u2019s evaluating a CD19/20 bicistronic CAR T in post\u2010CD19 third line plus LBCL. We are committed to continuously improving the safety and efficacy of our cell therapies through both internal pipeline and external partnerships. On slide 22, we turn to hematology and highlight the breadth of our programs across MDS and AML. For magrolimab, we fully enrolled our Phase 3 ENHANCE study in MDS ahead of schedule. Our discussions with the FDA and other regulators continue, and we expect to share an update in early 2023. Moreover, enrollment for the two AML trials, ENHANCE\u20102 and \u20103, is well underway and we are targeting topline data in 2024. A few weeks ago, we announced our oncology collaboration with MacroGenics to develop bispecific antibodies. This includes the exclusive option to license MGD024, a bispecific antibody that binds to CD123 and CD3, currently in Phase 1, as well as 2 additional research programs. This complements magrolimab, and furthers our work as we explore therapies that could translate into better clinical outcomes for patients with AML and MDS. Finally, we were pleased FDA granted KITE\u2010222 orphan drug designation at the end of September. It\u2019s the first CLL\u20101 targeted CAR T and is currently enrolling patients in a Phase 1 study. On slide 23, I wanted to take a moment to welcome MiroBio to Gilead. We completed the acquisition a few weeks ago and are pleased to add the MiroBio team to the Gilead research family, and bring their proprietary discovery platform and immune inhibitory receptor agonists to our portfolio. This acquisition complements our inflammatory disease cornerstones including IBD, RA and systemic lupus and opens opportunities in other indications. We are excited to continue to explore and develop these antibody agonists, which we believe have the potential to induce immunosuppressive signaling and restore tolerance in autoimmunity. Wrapping up, I\u2019ll note that we now have 60 clinical programs underway here at Gilead, spanning a broad range of indications across virology, oncology and inflammation. We\u2019ve accomplished a lot in 2022, and yet feel we\u2019re really just getting started in exploring the possibilities offered by our portfolio. With that, Andy? Andrew Dickinson : Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon everyone. We\u2019re pleased to share another strong quarter of results, with sequential and year\u2010over\u2010year growth in every franchise across our core business. As shown on slide 25, product sales, excluding Veklury, grew 11% year\u2010over\u2010year, despite a $130 million headwind from FX. If we exclude this FX impact, in addition to the impact of previous HIV LOEs, total underlying sales growth year\u2010over\u2010year was 15%. Moving to slide 26, you can see that Veklury was down, as expected, year-over-year, although it more than doubled on a sequential basis from the second quarter. I\u2019ll note that with the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, the total FX impact on revenue, net of hedges, was higher than expected, at approximately $200 million compared to the third quarter of last year. Non\u2010GAAP product gross margin was 87%, down 320 basis points from last year, primarily due to the third quarter 2021 reversal of a previously recorded litigation reserve. Additionally, non\u2010GAAP product gross margin was impacted by higher Biktarvy\u2010related royalty expense and lower Veklury sales. Non\u2010 GAAP product gross margin improved sequentially due to higher HIV and Veklury product sales. Non\u2010GAAP R&D, excluding acquired IPR&D expenses was $1.2 billion, up 10% year\u2010over\u2010year, primarily due to investments in Oncology. Sequentially, R&D excluding acquired IPR&D expenses was up 6% driven by investments in Oncology and COVID treatments. Acquired IPR&D, reflecting acquisitions, milestones and upfront payments for the quarter was $448 million and includes $389 million of expense related to the MiroBio acquisition. Non\u2010GAAP SG&A was $1.2 billion, up 3% year\u2010over\u2010year. Non\u2010GAAP operating margin was 47%, down year\u2010over\u2010year and driven primarily by higher Acquired IPR&D expenses and lower Veklury sales. Sequentially, non\u2010GAAP operating margin increased 400 basis points due to higher HIV and Veklury sales, partially offset by higher acquired IPR&D expenses. Non\u2010GAAP effective tax in the third quarter was 22.4%, higher than normal due to the non\u2010deductibility of the upfront MiroBio payment. Overall, our non\u2010GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.90 in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $2.65 for the same period last year. Of note, the MiroBio transaction impacted post\u2010tax EPS by $0.31 a share, and this was not reflected in the full year guidance we shared back in August. On slide 27, we take a quick look at our performance year\u2010to\u2010date, which shows total product sales excluding Veklury of $16.7 billion, up 7% year\u2010over\u2010year. If we exclude the approximately $385 million of FX headwinds year\u2010to\u2010date as compared to the same period last year, in addition to the impact of the HIV LOEs, the underlying growth year\u2010to\u2010date is 11%. Veklury, as expected, is down year\u2010to\u2010date, highlighting the lower demand for COVID\u201019 treatments in this stage of the pandemic. Moving to slide 28, we are increasing our full year sales guidance to reflect our year\u2010to\u2010date results and our expectations for Q4, including our latest view of FX. For Revenues, we now expect total product sales of $25.9 billion to $26.2 billion, up from our previous range of $24.5 billion to $25.0 billion. This reflects the strong performance year\u2010to\u2010date, notably very strong growth in HIV, Veklury, and cell therapy, and incorporates our expectations for the broader macro environment, including FX which will, once again, be a headwind in the fourth quarter. In HIV, as Johanna discussed, we expect HIV revenue in Q4 to be roughly flat on a sequential basis. In cell therapy, we expect slower growth on a sequential basis, primarily due to stabilizing demand following the second line LBCL launch and FX headwinds. Additionally, we are taking a cautious view with regards to both the current shortage of fludarabine which we expect to be partially mitigated later in the fourth quarter, and to the competitive landscape as our peers improve their manufacturing reliability. Moving to Veklury, and with year\u2010to\u2010date revenue of $2.9 billion, we are increasing our expectations to approximately $3.4 billion for the full year. Note that we expect Veklury sales to continue to track hospitalization rates and our guidance assumes no significant increase in hospitalization rates from the third quarter levels. Excluding Veklury, we expect our total product sales to be $22.5 billion to $22.8 billion, representing growth of 5% to 6% year\u2010over year, compared to our prior range of $22.0 billion to $22.5 billion. As for the rest of the non\u2010GAAP P&L, product gross margin is now expected to be in the 86% to 87% range, compared to our prior guidance of approximately 85% to 86%. There is no change to our R&D guidance, where we expect full year R&D expense to increase by a mid\u2010single-digit percentage compared to the 2021 baseline of $4.5 billion. Moving to acquired IPR&D, we are not issuing guidance for the full year and similar to what we did with MiroBio this quarter we\u2019ll update our EPS guidance quarterly as needed to reflect any relevant activity during the quarter. What we have included here is the year\u2010to\u2010date acquired IPR&D amount, including approximately $0.04 per share associated with the MacroGenics collaboration that we announced last week. The guidance shared today does not include any upfront payments related to normal course of business partnerships or licensing deals that we might close in the fourth quarter. For SG\u2022&A, with our continued investment across our commercial organization, and expectations for higher costs as a result of inflation, we continue to expect SG&A expenses to grow by a low single digit percentage compared to 2021. Altogether, we expect operating income to be $11.8 billion to $12.2 billion for the full\u2010year, up from $11 billion to $11.6 billion previously. And finally, we now expect our non\u2010GAAP diluted earnings per share to range between $6.95 to $7.15 per share, up from $6.35 to $6.75 previously. This EPS guidance range is approaching our 2021 non\u2010GAAP EPS results, despite an expected $2.2 billion decline in Veklury revenue, and more than half a billion dollars in total FX headwinds anticipated through the end of the year, as compared to 2021 rates. This highlights the strength of our core business, which is now expected to grow in the 5% to 6% range in 2022. On a GAAP basis, we expect our diluted earnings per share to range between $3.35 and $3.55 per share, compared to $2.90 and $3.30 per share previously. Finally, on slide 29, you can see that there is no change to our capital allocation priorities. In the quarter, we returned over $1.1 billion to shareholders, including $928 million in dividend payments and $180 million in share repurchases. As we announced previously, we repaid $1 billion of debt early in the third quarter and have returned to the same debt level we were at prior to the Immunomedics acquisition. With that, I\u2019ll invite the operator to open the Q&A. With that, I\u2019ll invite the operator to open the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Schott with JPM. Christopher Schott : My question was on lenacapavir and in treatment. So, I want to talk a little bit about, maybe first, islatravir and the lift of the clinical hold. How interesting is that as a partnered asset relative to your internal programs? And then the second part of that, just a bigger picture one in treatment. Do you see the portfolio with lenacapavir resulting in, I guess, a number of different combos that serve different segments of the market, or is it more likely you\u2019re going to end up with one of these combos that really separates from the other and becomes an anchor type asset like we see with Biktarvy? Merdad Parsey : Hi Chris, this is Merdad. Let me first start by saying that we are really excited about the recent approval for lenacapavir in this -- in the highly treatment-experienced population. Obviously, that\u2019s a group of people who have limited options, and I think lenacapavir as a new class provides a new opportunity for them. In terms of islatravir, what we like about islatravir is that it is fairly late in its development. We are able to be in Phase 2 with that. And I think it provides us a relatively near-term opportunity to launch a partner in treatment for lenacapavir that could be given in a long-acting way. And I think that\u2019s really important in terms of where the market is going and what our goal is in terms of, as we\u2019ve said before, providing a long-acting parenteral option that is longer than in the 3 months or longer time frame. And we\u2019re optimistic about our ability to do that. So for that, we have our internal pipeline assets that are really providing our options there. For islatravir, that\u2019s part of our oral program. And for us, we do think that we have a number of opportunities in terms of oral programs to provide weekly oral treatment options for people using lenacapavir. And right now is a potential certainly islatravir is an option there, and we have other options in our pipeline that could potentially get that -- get to that level. So, the way I look at it, just to answer directly your last question, we do think that there will be a lenacapavir partner, and there will be probably one partner that will achieve our therapeutic goals in oral, potentially a different partner in parenteral. And as we go forward, if we can make improvements whether that\u2019s lenacapavir and being able to provide even longer than six-month therapy or to the partner that we could extend the duration of therapy with a different molecule or a different formulation, we\u2019ll always try to get to that longer exposure. So over time, I expect us to continue to try to innovate and move forward. Johanna Mercier : So maybe just to add to that, Chris, in light of what Merdad was just referring to, we\u2019ve done a lot of patient market research to really understand the segments within the oral market, but also with the long-acting market, specifically in treatment, which is quite different to your point, to prevention. And in the treatment setting, it is clear that you will always have a market for that daily oral, which we believe Biktarvy has really set the standard there. And then there are others that the weekly oral will be more preferred. Some people just want to make sure they\u2019re taking something every single day. Others don\u2019t want to be reminded that they have HIV. And then you have, obviously, the injectables or the subQ with lenacapavir combinations every 3 months or potentially even every 6 months that will be very appealing to some that don\u2019t want to be reminded at all. And so those are kind of the segments we\u2019re trying to play out. So, I do think as a long acting, there will be more of a split segment than we\u2019ve seen in the daily oral. Jacquie Ross : Amber, you ready for the next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Salveen Richter : On the TIGIT program, what is the likelihood that we\u2019ll see PFS data at this point? And if we don\u2019t, when could that come? And then based on the interim updates, it does seem like you already have clear benefit on ORR at least on the doublet arm versus monotherapy. So, would love to see if you could just walk us through the possible scenarios with this data readout? And if there\u2019s any outcome that could impact the recently initiated Phase 3 studies. Merdad Parsey : Salveen, this is Merdad again. Yes, maybe I\u2019ll start by saying that really, nothing has really changed in terms of the ARC-7 study and where we\u2019re headed. And the reminder make is that this is going to be the fourth interim analysis for the ongoing Phase 2 study and enrollment was only recently completed over the summer. And so, when we look at that, if you think about it in that context, to your point, we continue to look for consistency in the dom and zim combination as a doublet in the ORR to bolster our ongoing Phase 3 program, right, just to underline our confidence in the TIGIT and dom combination. Based on the data we\u2019ve seen already, and this should continue to support that. In terms of PFS, I think PFS is -- as I tried to allude to, given the fact that enrollment went on until fairly recently, the likelihood is that PFS is going to be fairly immature and may not be informative. And certainly, when we think about the triplet there as well, it\u2019s unlikely that PFS is going to be informative, but it may be. And so, we\u2019ll look at that, and our plan is to evaluate the data and then decide with our partners at Arcus what the data and how we approach it. And certainly, as we\u2019ve said before, making sure that we are sharing the data at a medical conference next year. And exactly to your point, it\u2019s really about confirming the confidence we already have in TIGIT and moving into Phase 3 with our -- with the lead programs that we\u2019re moving with. So, I hope that answers your question. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC. Brian Abrahams : Congrats on the quarter. And thanks for taking my question. A question on Trodelvy. With the maturing TROPiCS-02 overall survival data and the evolving competitive landscape, I\u2019m curious on your latest views on where you see Trodelvy fitting in, in the HR-positive/HER2-negative population. Any updates on market research on how it might be used, your commercial strategy to align with that? And curious also your latest expectations on how effective it could be post in HER2 in certain patients who may receive that first? Thanks. Johanna Mercier : Hi Brian, it\u2019s Johanna. Thanks for the question. So basically, let me start by saying with Trodelvy, the performance for the quarter has been really strong. We\u2019re seeing 78% year-on-year growth, 13% quarter-over-quarter. And we\u2019re seeing markets add in every week basically. And reimbursement kind of playing out. We have now over 13 countries ex U.S. that have gotten reimbursement. So, we\u2019re seeing really strong launches namely France, Germany right now and other markets coming in as we\u2019re speaking. So, strong foundations there. I think having OS data in both triple-negative breast cancer as well as now with TROPiCS-02 in the HR-positive/HER2-negative, patient population really helps the foundation for Trodelvy but really helps across breast cancer. To your specific question around kind of where do we position ourselves, obviously, with TROPiCS-02, we\u2019re in previously treated -- heavily-treated lines of therapy, right, when you think about this patient population, so a little bit different than some of our competitors. And so, we\u2019re excited actually because these patients have very limited options. And so, now with Trodelvy, there is a real potential for overall survival in these late-line patients. So, we do think that as we\u2019re playing it out, as we\u2019re doing our market research, we feel very confident that Trodelvy will be very well positioned in the marketplace, and we\u2019ll build on the success that we\u2019ve seen thus far in triple-negative breast cancer as well in how we\u2019re playing that out. So, we expect continued momentum in our base business. And I might have mentioned before in one of the previous calls, how we\u2019ve expanded our footprint, specifically in the U.S. to prepare for both not only the expansion of what we need to do in triple-negative breast cancer, but also what we need to do in HR-positive. And so we\u2019re well poised to make sure that we\u2019re ready for that PDUFA date coming up in February to make sure that we\u2019re successful. Merdad Parsey : And maybe -- this is Merdad. Maybe I\u2019ll add to that. We\u2019re not done, right? And I think we\u2019re excited about how much we\u2019ve been able to achieve with Trodelvy so far, and you\u2019ve seen consistent positive data across tumor types. And in particular, I think, as Johanna highlighted, the late-line therapy, certainly, those are patients who may now -- there\u2019s a potential that some of them will be getting in HER2 beforehand. We don\u2019t have data on sequencing, but I do believe that there may be those who decide to treat for those patients who may not respond adequately to in HER2 to later lines, right? So that\u2019s kind of where, certainly, there\u2019s an opportunity there. The other thing I would add is that we\u2019ve got really strong data in triple-negative breast, including the HER2 -- sorry, in HR-positive breast cancer, including the HER2 zero population. And I think that\u2019s a very important distinction and really important to remember. And then finally, based on what we\u2019ve seen so far and the clinical benefit we\u2019ve brought, we certainly believe that there\u2019s an opportunity for us to move to earlier lines of therapy as well in breast cancer in triple negative, in HR-positive and in other tumor types. I think that\u2019s -- our excitement about Trodelvy has always been the ability to go into broad tumor types, and our strategy has always been to advance into earlier lines of therapy as we generate positive data. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael Yee : Congrats on a great quarter. I also wanted to ask Merdad a question on Trodelvy in lung cancer. I mean I would think that this is an even bigger opportunity than breast cancer on EVOKE-01 which is ongoing. Can you confirm you think you would update next year and how you think about that opportunity versus second-line docetaxel? I know there\u2019s some early response rates based on the basket study when you acquired Immunomedics. And I was wondering if you had more data in lung cancer that you\u2019ve been observing to give you more confidence there? And then you commented on EVOKE-02 and EVOKE-03, which is first line. I just wanted to understand if you think we would update on EVOKE-02 next year. I would think that\u2019s pretty big trying to replace chemo. So maybe comment on EVOKE-01 and EVOKE-02. Thank you. Merdad Parsey : Yes, Michael, Merdad, thanks for the question. I think just to follow on, it\u2019s a great follow-on to the prior question around our ability to really look across tumor types and earlier lines. And in particular, I think what you\u2019re referencing is our confidence in going into early line lung cancer and starting those studies. To your point, we\u2019ve seen data, as you know, very well from our early Phase 1b study in lung cancer. And we continue to enroll and we\u2019ve initiated now studies looking at both the second- and third-line setting and we -- and then as well as in the frontline setting. As you know, we\u2019re doing a study in combination with EVOKE-03 [ph] with the PD-1 and the PD-L1 high population, which I think is really an important trial for us to proceed on. So, I think what I would say is that the timing of the data, Michael, is always difficult to predict. We have to see how the study enrollment goes, and it\u2019s early days. But we\u2019re really excited about the opportunity to bring a meaningful therapy to a group with a very high unmet need. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Skorney with Baird. Brian Skorney : Maybe perhaps for Merdad, just kind of jumping off on the long-acting HIV discussion. I noticed in the pipeline slides, long-acting bictegravir has been removed from the pipeline. Obviously, it would have been nice to have a known entity like the bictegravir part of the combo. I was just wondering maybe you could give us any insight to what happened in the Phase 1 there? Is it sort of bictegravir missing a PK threshold, or is it something that you\u2019re seeing with the 6212 or 5894 that gives you more confidence there? Thanks. Merdad Parsey : Yes. Thanks for the question. Happy to expand on that. Yes, look, bictegravir is an amazing molecule and has done a lot for patients. And one of the opportunities we looked at is in addition to thinking about bictegravir for long-acting oral was to see if we could give it as a long-acting subcutaneous. And really, what happened is we had tolerability issues just given that molecule subcu in terms of injection site reactions. So, it\u2019s not about the molecule itself. One of the challenges of developing long-acting subcutaneous therapies is tolerability. And so, I want to make sure that it\u2019s clear that bictegravir as an oral agent continues to be a huge part of where we want to go. And then maybe just to step back to your point, the way I think about it, maybe the way to think about is from a PrEP standpoint, long-acting, we are lenacapavir, it\u2019s prep for long-acting and that -- those studies are underway, moving along nicely. From a treatment standpoint, as I mentioned earlier, lenacapavir is a huge part of our backbone therapy for us. And now, we are looking at a number of different opportunities to get to long-acting oral and long-acting parenteral. And molecules like lenacapavir don\u2019t come along every day. We are looking for a number of -- at a number of molecules. We think we have the world-class expertise in chemistry and preclinical development that gives us a leg up on the competition to get to those molecules that will really get to the need that Johanna laid out, which is to get to the subcutaneous or every three-month dosing or even longer, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : I just wanted to ask a question on 5245. Can you just talk a little bit about the range of possibilities you might be thinking about in terms of what a Phase 3 might look like? And then, just sort of where you see commercially, what sort of data you might need to compete just given the fact that it may be hard to have the same kind of data set as some of those pills that were developed earlier in the pandemic? Thanks. Daniel O\u2019Day: Hey Matthew, Dan O\u2019Day here. So we\u2019ll have Merdad take the first part of your question, and then Johanna can feed into the second. Merdad Parsey : Yes. Thanks, Dan. Yes. Thanks, Matthew. So, 5245 has -- as you know, we started those trials in Phase I earlier this year. Things are going well. And as you know, the pandemic has changed a lot. And I think you make an excellent point that looking at high-risk patients is a challenge right now in looking at high-risk patients who may get hospitalized as a challenge right now, giving vaccination, other treatment options. So exactly to your point, I think the discussion we\u2019re having internally and with our regulators is what\u2019s the best population for us to establish the benefit of 5245. And how does that anticipate what might come down the road, which has been the unpredictable part, whether that is resistance to other agents, the need for combination agents, new variants that may increase the hospitalization rates. Those are all the things that we have to be prepared for. And we really see 5245 as a way -- as we move forward with that and move into clinical trials once we demonstrate its efficacy as an important tool, should the pandemic start to pick up again, heaven forbid, but that\u2019s how we think about it. So both combinations and treating resistance or a new surge. Johanna Mercier : Yes. So in line with that, Matthew, it\u2019s Johanna. I would just add to what Merdad is saying. So I think from a commercial standpoint, what we\u2019re thinking is the fact that it doesn\u2019t have a boosting agent is a real plus here as well as the fact that we\u2019re going to look at rebound effects as we\u2019ve seen with current marketed products right now have that issue, and so, -- in addition to the antiviral activity. So I think those pieces are kind of what we\u2019re thinking about. As well as you well know, drug-drug interactions has been a bit of an issue with some of the current agents today. So I think if you -- without the boosting agent, I think those will just open up a little bit more for a broader patient population potentially to really benefit. And as we\u2019ve seen with this pandemic, it\u2019s not over. We\u2019ve seen hospitalizations go up and down. We\u2019ve seen a little bit of an increase most recently, and we\u2019re tracking that very closely with hospitalizations, of course, because of Veklury. But we do believe that there\u2019s still opportunity for more options here to make sure that we curve this pandemic. Daniel O\u2019Day: And Matthew, this is Dan O\u2019Day. I\u2019ll just add one other thing in addition to my colleagues, which is in our conversations with the U.S. government, particularly the recent Fast Track designation that was applied to GS-5245, there\u2019s 3 major things that they\u2019re interested in, too. Number one is more oral antivirals; number two, to the points that both Merdad and Johanna made, working across the variance as the virus continues to mutate; and then thirdly, lack of DDI, lack of boosting and this rebound issue. So, I think it\u2019s a recognition of the fact that there is a need for the ongoing pandemic/endemic, whatever you want to call it with COVID for additional options. And I think that\u2019s expressed in the way the U.S. government wants to work closely with us as we continue to develop this program. Operator : Our next question comes from Tyler Van Buren with Cowen. Tyler Van Buren : Congratulations on the results. Great quarter. I had a follow-up, a high-level question on Biktarvy. So, the product continues to see very impressive uptake, and it looks like it will be around 60% of HIV product revenues this year. So, where do you expect the product to peak out as a percentage of HIV sales over the next several years? Johanna Mercier : Tyler, it\u2019s Joanna. Thanks for the question. I would say that we\u2019re really proud of the Biktarvy performance, but I would say even the increased momentum that we\u2019re seeing. And this is not just in the U.S., this is really around the globe. And so, we\u2019re just about 45% market share with Biktarvy. We\u2019ve seen 4% share gain year-on-year. And now, we\u2019re looking at an annual run rate in excess of about $10 billion. So, I do think we\u2019re very well poised for the future. The -- we\u2019re looking at both the na\u00efve share, obviously, just about under 60% of that share right now with Biktarvy, so really setting the standard for new patients coming into HIV. And obviously, the switch share, and you can\u2019t -- switch share is obviously a little bit lower because you can switch to Biktarvy if you\u2019re already on Biktarvy. So therefore, we\u2019re tracking that very closely as well, but making sure that when there is opportunity, either from older drugs or when there\u2019s been some issues for patients to really come on to Biktarvy just because it really does have a profile from an efficacy standpoint and safety standpoint. So, we do believe that continued growth with Biktarvy is on the agenda. And I would also add just a little bit of a note around the market as well, which also helps, right, because where the market goes, Biktarvy goes and where Biktarvy goes, the market goes. We\u2019ve seen market stabilization actually back to pre-pandemic levels and growing at about 2% or so year-on-year, both in the U.S. as well as in Europe. And so, that also really helps our momentum continue and Biktarvy is driving that as well, of course, in a lot of our efforts. The teams have worked very closely with community partners and physicians and advocacy groups to make sure that we get patients back into clinics, back into care, both from a screening standpoint and diagnosis standpoint. Now that we\u2019re -- and you really see those numbers back to pre-pandemic. So I think we\u2019re in good place moving forward and well poised for the future to continue this leadership in HIV driven by Biktarvy. Jacquie Ross : Amber, we\u2019ll squeeze in just two more, please. Maybe go to the next caller. Salveen Richter : Our next question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore. Umer Raffat : I wanted to touch up on a slightly different topic today, and I have a two-part question for Dan and Andy. And this is on the tenofovir litigation that\u2019s been ongoing. And then I guess my question really was there\u2019s a very unusual amount of plaintiffs aggregated up in this case. And I\u2019m curious, is it something you guys are looking to take to a final judgment, or would you be open to a settlement? And that brings me to sort of the second part, Andy, how much of a legal charge have you taken on this litigation to date? Because I know you\u2019ve been doing that on the Biktarvy and other indications in litigation in the past. And is there something more significant that has to happen for a more prominent charge to show up? I ask because every company handles the accounting differently. So, I was just curious. Thank you. Daniel O\u2019Day: Thanks, Umer. Let me just start before I hand it over to Andy to say, obviously, with any litigation, we\u2019re -- we don\u2019t comment on ongoing litigation in any level of detail. I do want to emphasize the confidence we have in our overall patent portfolio in general. And maybe with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Andy to answer some more specifics of your question as well. Andrew Dickinson : Yes. Thanks, Dan. Hi Umer, thanks for the question. Happy to touch base on this. This is a topic, as you know, that we\u2019ve been getting a lot of questions on with the Zantac litigation. So a number of things that I can provide some background and context. So first of all, like most companies, anyone operating in the U.S., we are routinely managing a lot of different litigation matters, as you know. Many of those are from our perspective, meritless or baseless. As a matter of practice, we don\u2019t typically -- or usually comment on specific litigation cases. What I can say stepping back is that we have won or resolved the 3 material litigation -- or 3 material litigation matters over the past year, as you know, on terms that were favorable to the Company and to our shareholders, that is the Juno Kite IP litigation, the ViiV IP litigation around bictegravir, then the third was the TAF litigation with generic companies. We have an outstanding legal team, both internally and externally. And then maybe to your specific question, I mean, we have complete confidence in the merits of the defense on the ongoing product liability case. So, it is very different than the Zantac litigation case. So just to your question on the number of plaintiffs, for instance, if I remember correctly in the Zantac cases, there were 250,000 patients in our case -- I\u2019m sorry, plantiffs. There were 25,000 in ours. But the key difference is that the issues at hand here, I mean, our TDF-based products are life-saving products that really transform care for HIV. And the side effects of the products were in the label from day one. The labels in the U.S. and Europe were slightly different but the labels were there. These were well known, well disclosed potential side effects. And I think that\u2019s an important piece of it. So, it\u2019s a very different case. Zantac, as I remember correctly was taken off the market and reformulated. So I\u2019d be careful about drawing too many parallels between what you saw with Zantac and some of the companies that were affected by that in this litigation. That doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t take it seriously. We do take it very seriously. And as I said, we have a great team that\u2019s working on it. The last thing, Umer, maybe the last two things, there are a number of amicus briefs that have been filed. Those are all publicly available. This is in the California state litigation that I would encourage you to read. I think there are 4 or 5 amicus briefs that really speak to how different this cause of action is relative to what you would typically expect to see in a case. And then finally, on the charge, no, we have not taken a charge. And as I said, we feel very strongly about the merits of our case and look forward to proceeding with the litigation over the coming months and years. So good question. Thank you. Jacquie Ross : Amber, may we go to our last question, please? Operator : Our last question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Merdad, I want to follow up on a few questions that you\u2019ve gotten on long-acting HIV. I know it\u2019s been tricky to develop a doublet that has a comparable profile to lenacapavir, but is there a mechanism that you have either in-house or that you\u2019ve seen in HIV that looks like it\u2019s more straightforward to develop long-acting? I wasn\u2019t sure if integrase would be better than nuke versus non-nuke, something of that category? Thank you. Merdad Parsey : Thanks, Geoff. This is Merdad. Yes, we\u2019re -- I think our chemistry and our virology team do favor the INSTIs as a class where we believe that we have a better shot at getting to a long-acting partner for the capsid inhibitors. So, I would say a fair bit of our effort is going into those. But -- and we are open to looking at a variety of mechanisms to achieve our goal. We just think that the INSTIs are more likely to get there. I will remind you, this may have gone under the radar, but we do have the program where we are looking at the bnAb. I did mention it in the script and that does provide us another option for people from a long-acting standpoint where we\u2019re looking at every six months potentially there. So, we are pretty open and committed to finding the right partner that will achieve our goals. Daniel O\u2019Day: Terrific. With that -- this is Dan. I just want to thank all of you for joining today. And I just wanted to emphasize how we believe our third quarter performance demonstrates the tangible impact of delivering on our strategy. After putting the right foundation in place over the past three years, we\u2019re now seeing the positive momentum that continues to build. It\u2019s an exciting time for the Company as we realize our potential to do more, to reach further and to help more patients and the communities we serve. So, I just want to take this opportunity to thank all the colleagues again at Gilead and Kite to thank all of you for joining your interest in Gilead. And as usual, if you have any additional questions, please reach out to our Investor Relations team. As you know, they\u2019re more than happy to help. And thank you for joining today. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s Third Quarter 2022 Gilead Sciences Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your line.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. Thank you for attending today\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Gilead Sciences Earnings Conference Call. My name is Henna, and I will be your moderator for today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Jacquie Ross. Please go ahead. Jacquie Ross : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. The press release slides and supplementary data are available on the investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today\u2019s call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day, our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier, our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey, and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we\u2019ll open up the call to Q&A, where the team will be joined by Christi Shaw, the Chief Executive Officer of Kite. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward\u2010looking statements, including those related to Gilead\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations; plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations, financial projections and the use of capital; and 2023 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward\u2010looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward\u2010looking statements. Non\u2010GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the Company\u2019s underlying business performance. The GAAP to non\u2010GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, in our supplementary data sheet, as well as on the Gilead website. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dan. Daniel O'Day: Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. We had the opportunity to connect with many of you a few weeks ago in San Francisco. And I\u2019m excited to be able to reconnect now to share our strong fourth quarter and full year results for 2022 in addition to our guidance for 2023. These show the tangible impact of our business transformation, notably the growth trajectory for HIV portfolio and our fast-growing oncology business. The team will take you through our quarterly results in detail, but I am very pleased to highlight on Slide 4 the strongest full year growth in our base business since 2015 when growth was driven by the peak of HCV sales. Full year 2022 sales of Biktarvy grew 20% year-over-year to $10.4 billion, exceeding $10 billion for the first time. Excluding Biktarvy, our base business in 2022 grew 8% year-over-year and I\u2019m pleased to share that our initial 2023 guidance points the base business growth between 4% and 6%. Andy will share our revenue guidance in detail, but I do want to take this opportunity to recognize the Gilead team for the progress we made in returning to growth. Thanks to their commitment to improving the health of people and communities around the world, Gilead is now poised to extend its reach to more patients and more challenging disesases and conditions than ever before. Beyond our financial results, our clinical progress in 2022 reinforces how far we\u2019ve come. At the end of the year, Sunlenca received its first approval in the U.S. for heavily treatment-experienced adults with multi drug-resistant HIV infection. This follows a European approval in the third quarter. Sunlenca is the first six monthly subcutaneous medicines to be approved and we believe it represents the most exciting innovation in HIV therapeutics in recent years, with significant potential across prevention and treatment. We look forward to partnering with the HIV community to increase awareness of Sunlenca and to advancing our portfolio of long acting options. We are anticipating an another potential approval any day now with the upcoming PDUFA date for Trodelvy in pre-treated HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. We also expect to hear from European regulators later this year. In the meantime, Trodelvy\u2019s commercial momentum is building, with full year 2022 sales growth of 79%. In cell therapy, we continue to reinforce our leadership and to execute on plans to broaden availability, with Yescarta most recently approved in Japan for a second-line relapsed refractory large B cell lymphoma. Merdad will take you through our pipeline updates and key milestones in a few moments. For now, I'll simply note the significant expansion in our clinical programs, which are more than doubled in the last four years. We continue to add further programs, including our new preclinical candidates to partner with lenacapavir for a long-acting HIV treatment programs, the new Phase III OAK CRE study for a Novel Oral COVID-19 nucleoside, and the five Phase III trials that we expect to initiate this year. Before I hand over to Johanna, I want to briefly review the clinical goals we shared with you a year ago. The Gilead and Kite teams have done a terrific job in both delivering as plan and acting with agility in response to changing circumstances. We had an impressive year of discipline and determine execution in 2022 and fully expect to further strengthen our track record of execution in 2023 and beyond. With that, I'll hand over to Johanna for a review of our fourth quarter and full year commercial performance. Johanna? Johanna Mercier : Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Before discussing our commercial results, I want to acknowledge our Gilead team for delivering another outstanding quarter and closing out a very successful year. 2022 was an exceptional year for Gilead with our virology franchise well positioned to continue its leadership for years to come. And significant progress in executing our oncology strategy and bringing new medicines to improve the lives of more patients all around the world. Starting on Slide 7, we had a very strong quarter, delivering a total product sales excluding Veklury at $6.3 billion, up 9% year-over-year, or 12%, excluding the impact of FX and the loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla. With solid growth in each of our core franchises and growth across all geographies, once again, led by HIV and oncology. Quarter-over-quarter sales grew 5%, driven by HIV, Trodelvy and cell therapy, partially offset by HCV. For the full year, total product sales, excluding Veklury, were $23.1 billion, up 8% year-over-year, or 11%, excluding the impact of FX and the Truvada Atripla LOE, driven by HIV and oncology. As expected, full year Veklury sales were down meaningfully in 2022 compared to 2021. That said, Veklury\u2019s performance has been more sustainable than we previously expected. And it's clear that it continues to play an essential role for hospitalized patients treated for COVID-19. In 2022, Veklury delivered $3.9 billion, including $1 billion in the fourth quarter. Overall, full year total product sales of $27 billion was flat compared to 2021, as growth in our base business was offset by the decline in Veklury sales. On Slide 8, HIV sales for the fourth quarter were $4.8 billion, a 5% year-over-year, driven by higher demand as well as favorable pricing dynamics. This was offset in part by a smaller than usual inventory build in the fourth quarter, reflecting our early efforts on seasonal inventory management. Sequentially, HIV sales in the fourth quarter were up 6%, primarily driven by favorable pricing and inventory dynamics as well as higher demand. For the full year, HIV sales of $17.2 billion were up 5% year-over-year due to higher demand primarily related to the continued strength of Biktarvy, in addition to channel mix, leading to higher average realized price. This was partially offset by inventory dynamics and FX. Overall, the HIV treatment market in the fourth quarter grew 1.5% year-over-year in the U.S. and over 2% in Europe. On an annual basis, the market has grown in line with our expectations of 2% to 3%. Moving to Prevention, the U.S. PrEP market grew 18% year-over-year and 3% sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting growing awareness. Descovy sales for the fourth quarter were $537 million, up 13% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Notably, despite generics and other entrants, demand for Descovy for PrEP continues to increase up more than 20% for the full year, in addition to maintaining a stable market share of over 40%. With these trends and the TAF IP settlement last year, Descovy\u2019s position in the growing PrEP market has only strengthened. Overall, this provides a strong foundation as we look to the potential launch of lenacapavir for PrEP as a true long acting every six months regimen in the middle part of the decade. Moving to Biktarvy on Slide 9, sales for the quarter were $2.9 billion, up 15% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher demand, as well as favorable pricing dynamics, offset in part by lower channel inventory. Quarter-over-quarter, sales were up 6%, similarly driven by higher demand, as well as favorable pricing and inventory dynamics. In every quarter since our launch, we've seen Biktarvy continue to gain market share, and the fourth quarter was no exception, getting more than 3 percentage points in share year-over-year. This continued momentum is a testament to Biktarvy\u2019s differentiated clinical profile, reinforced by the long-term five-year data we presented last year. Notably in U.S., Europe and other major markets, Biktarvy remains the number one regimen for new starts in addition to its number one position in treatments, which is across most of the major markets, including the U.S. At the end of 2022, there were almost 1 million people managing their HIV with Biktarvy worldwide. Taken all together, this has led Biktarvy for the first time to achieve full year sales of over $10 billion in 2022. Looking ahead, we're confident Biktarvy will remain the leading medicine for the treatment of HIV in U.S., Europe and other major markets for years to come. Now looking ahead for the first quarter of 2023 for HIV, a few points I just wanted to call out. First, with respect to pricing dynamics as we enter the New Year, we expect a typical first quarter reset in patient co-pay and deductibles. As always, these will have an unfavorable impact on average realized price in the first quarter. Second, a reminder that we've historically seen inventory build-up in Q4 that has led to notable drawdowns by wholesalers in Q1. While we've implemented new processes to better manage inventory dynamics from the fourth quarter into the first quarter, we continue to expect an inventory drawdown to occur in Q1, albeit at more modest levels compared to prior year. So with this in mind, we expect HIV sales for the first quarter to decline by low teens sequentially from the fourth quarter. This compares to the 18% sequential decline we reported in the first quarter of 2022. For the full year 2023, I'd like to remind you that some of our HIV performance in 2022 was driven by shifts in channel mix that had a favorable impact on average realized price, contributing in part to the 5% year-over-year revenue growth we reported in 2022. We expect channel mix in 2023 to be relatively similar to last year, and therefore do not expect HIV growth to benefit from changes in average realized price like we saw in 2022. As a result, we continue to expect HIV to grow in 2023, albeit at a modestly lower growth rate than 2022. As we think about the future of the HIV market, Gilead is well positioned to provide many people living with HIV and those at risk of HIV with multiple options for care. To that end, we're excited about the recent approvals for Sunlenca in U.S. and Europe for heavily treatment experienced adults with multi drug resistant HIV infection. This first indication represents only 1% to 2% of people living with HIV. There's a huge unmet medical need. These individuals have cycled through multiple antiretroviral regimen, and until now have had very few if any, effective options left available. Sunlenca is now approved in the U.S., U.K. and European markets and we're working as quickly as possible with regulators and reimbursement bodies to make Sunlenca available in many more countries. We believe that first launch of Sunlenca represents a key milestone for Gilead and looking forward in the treatment and potential prevention of HIV. With Sunlenca, a true long acting regimen is a reality as awareness and familiarity of Sunlenca every six months subcutaneous administration grow among health care providers, community groups and people living with and at risk of HIV, we believe Sunlenca is well positioned for the future. Turning to HCV on Slide 10, sales for the fourth quarter were $439 million up 12% year-over-year, reflecting timing of Department of Corrections or DOC purchases, and favorable pricing dynamics in the U.S. Quarter-over-quarter HCV sales were down 16% primarily due to resolution of a rebate claim in Europe in the third quarter of 2022 that did not repeat, as well as other pricing dynamics in the U.S. offset in part by timing of DOC purchases. Going forward, we continue to expect new starts to decline, but are encouraged that our market share remains over 50% in both U.S. and Europe. Sales of HPV and HDD for the fourth quarter were $255 million as shown on slide 11. Sales were down 4% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially, primarily due to lower than ready demand and pricing dynamics outside of the U.S. Moving to Veklury on slide 12, sales the fourth quarter $1 billion with a full year totaling $3.9 billion. It's clear that the pandemic has evolved Veklury\u2019s role in the treatment of COVID-19 has remained unchanged as a key part of the standard-of-care for hospitalized patients. In fact, Veklury is still the only antiviral approved and it's setting and in the U.S. Veklury continues to be used in over 50% of hospitalized patients who are being treated for COVID-19. We're excited to continue to work on our oral COVID-19 nucleoside which Merdad will discuss shortly. Moving to oncology, and beginning with Trodelvy on Slide 13. Sales of $195 million in the fourth quarter grew 65% year-over-year, and 8% sequentially. For the full year Trodelvy's sales were $680 million up 79% year-over-year. As we continue to broaden access to Trodelvy around the world, we're encouraged by the growing demand and existing market. Trodelvy is now reimbursed across the major European markets. And in the U.S. demand was up 13% quarter-over-quarter, a growth rate almost doubled from the prior quarter, reflecting the solid contribution of our expanded field force and growing awareness. We're also excited by the expected decision from the FDA later this month, which could expand Trodelvy\u2019s potentially clinically meaningful benefits into the pre-treated HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer setting. We estimate this represents at least 6000 addressable patients in the U.S. and our U.S. field force has just wrapped up its launch meeting and is energized for the upcoming approval. The opportunity for Trodelvy to benefit patients with pre-treated HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic disease is supported by the recent NCCN Category 1 preferred recommendation for Trodelvy based on the TROPiCS-02 data. Additionally, the European Medicines Agency recently validated our marketing authorization application for Trodelvy in HR-positive/HER2-negative and we look forward to a decision later this year. Now on to Slide 14 and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team Cell Therapy sales in the fourth quarter were $490 million up 75% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Full year Cell Therapy sales were $1.5 billion up 68% year-over-year. The growth in the fourth quarter and full year were driven by continued uptake of Yescarta in large B cell lymphoma, notably in the U.S. Growing physician familiarity with Yescarta data and Kite industry leading manufacturing continue to be key growth drivers. Yescarta sales was $337 million up 85% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and 6% sequentially. We're pleased to see not only strong momentum and second line LBCL in the U.S., but also continued uptake in third line LBCL in both the U.S. and across European market. Yescarta sales were $82 million in the fourth quarter up 2% quarter-over-quarter with growing volume demand in both mantle cell lymphoma and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Year-over-year Yescarta sales were up 44%. We're pleased to see the building momentum of CAR-T Cell Therapy as a treatment class with curative potential and Yescarta and Tecartus as the leading cell therapies of choice globally. More patients are getting access due to Kite\u2019s industry leading reliable manufacturing capabilities and the team's expanding footprint of authorized treatment centers around the world. And just last week, U.K\u2019s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence or NICE, recommended Yescarta for routine use in third line large B cell lymphoma. This makes Yescarta the first party available for commissioning in England. Approvals and reimbursement into additional indications that are currently available in the U.S. and other markets is expected to continue over the next year. Yescarta was recently approved for second-line LBCL in Japan, which has the potential to be the second largest cell therapy market outside of the U.S. And we look forward to the transfer of the marketing authorization to Gilead and Kite later this year. In the interim, other still early days, we'll continue to work with our partner Daiichi Sankyo to make Yescarta available to approximately 7000 patients in the second line plus setting. Kite will begin manufacturing supplies for the Japanese market through our El Segundo, California, facility. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad for an update on our pipeline. Merdad? Merdad Parsey : Thanks, Johanna. I'm pleased to be starting 2023 with all the momentum and 2022 behind us. The positive data readouts for Trodelvy and domvanalimab and the recent approvals for lenacapavir the team is really excited to progress our programs in 2023 and beyond. Starting with Brage [ph] on slide 16 and as I just mentioned, Lenacapavir received its first U.S. FDA approval for people living with multi drug resistant HIV in combination with other anti retrovirals. Marketed as Sunlenca, Lenacapavir is the first and only twice yearly subcutaneous HIV treatment, bringing much needed option for people living with multi-drug resistant HIV, that until now had limited alternatives. Combined with the approval from the European Commission, the FDA approval is an important validation, while we continue to progress our other Lenacapavir based treatment and prevention programs. For HIV treatment, we currently have 10 partner agents for Lenacapavir in various stages of development, including two new integrase inhibitors or INSTI in the pre-IND space. We expect to share data this year from the Phase 1/b proof-of-concept study for Lenacapavir and two broadly neutralizing antibodies or bNAb directed at HIV. And in PrEP, our clinical development of Lenacapavir as a monotherapy for HIV prevention continues to progress with two trials underway, and two additional trials expected to achieve FPI in the second half of 2023. Moving to slide 17, we continue to progress our novel oral nucleoside for COVID-19 GS-5245. Treatments such as Gilead Veklury and vaccinations have improved the outlook for patients with COVID-19. But there's still a significant need for effective and convenient oral treatment options. We've been working with the FDA and other global regulators to launch a clinical development program that could enable global filings. We've initiated a Phase III [ph] Birch trial in high risk patients defined as unvaccinated patients with one or more risk factors, or vaccinated patients with two or more risk factors. The Phase III Oaktree trial will evaluate standard risk patients, which includes people aged 12 and older with no CDC defined risk factors. We expect this trial to enroll its first patients in the U.S. in the first quarter. And we'll share progress when we can just depends in part on the prevalence of COVID-19 year study sites. Moving to oncology on slide 18, and starting with Trodelvy, we continue to build on the momentum of our TOPiCS-02 data. And we announced the European Medicines agency's validation of our marketing authorization application for pre-treated HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer in early January. As Johanna noted, we expect a regulatory decision of our sBLA in the U.S. later this month, and a decision Europe in the latter part of the year. Trodelvy has already changed the standard-of-care for many patients with metastatic TNBC and advanced bladder cancer. And we expect that these regulatory approvals will be an important step forward in bringing this potentially practice changing therapy to certain HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients. Moreover, recently presented data demonstrated Trodelvy's PFS and OS benefit was consistent across a range of tumor Trop-2 expression levels. This late breaking post-hoc analysis presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium was consistent with Trodelvy's data in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, where baseline Trop-2 expression was not associated with treatment response. Moving on to slide 19, we were pleased to share data from the fourth interim analysis of the ARC-7 trial with our partner Arcus in December, as presented at the ASCO Plenary session. ARC-7 is a randomized Phase II proof-of-concept study that enrolled 150 patients, the largest dataset in anti-digit studies released today with more than 100 patients across the 2-DOM containing arms. We were pleased to see both DOM containing arms demonstrate clinically meaningful differentiation compared to ZIM monotherapy across all efficacy measures evaluated, clearly establishing that the addition of Domvanalimab improved the clinical responses to anti PD-1 therapy in this population. We were also encouraged by the consistency of the safety data in the DOM containing treatment arms, which showed no unexpected safety signals. This is an on-going trial, and we look forward to sharing updated data at ASCO 2023. While these efficacy and safety data will mature over time, this fourth interim analysis fully supports our joint DOM\u2019s in-clinical development program, and the importance of interrupting the TIGIT pathway. Based on the totality of the data seen today, we're very confident that DOM with an Fc-silent design has the potential to be differentiated compared to other anti-TIGIT molecules in this space. The on-going Phase III trials of DOM added to anti PD-1 treatments in non-small cell lung cancer will provide the opportunity to confirm this activity. We're moving very quickly with our partners in both proof-of-concept studies, as well as late stage trials, including the 4 on-going Phase III trials. Moving to magrolimab, our anti-CD47 therapeutics on Slide 20, we have three on-going pivotal trials, and six proof-of-concept studies across six solid tumor indications. As we shared last month, the independent data monitoring committee met to review data from the first interim analysis from the enhanced study in first line high risk MDS. I'm pleased to share that there were no new safety signals, and the study continues unchanged. As a reminder, based on previous discussions with the FDA, we are now pursuing mature OS data for filing. The study is powered for the final OS analysis and Gilead remains blinded to the data to preserve study integrity. We will update you again in the second half of 2023 after the second interim analysis, noting that these interim analyses are event driven so timing is provisional. Moving on to slide 21, and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, I'm pleased to share details of another strong quarter of clinical progress in our cell therapy programs. At ASH, Kite had more than 25 data presentations, further demonstrating the transformative impact of cell therapies, including three year follow up data from ZUMA-5 showing that 52% of patients with indolent lymphomas treated with Yescarta continued to respond. Following the compelling ZUMA-12 data on Yescarta in frontline LBCL, shared at ASH in 2021, we expect to achieve FPI in our Phase III ZUMA-23 trial and Frontline high risk LBCL in the first half of the year. We are also progressing our Phase II ZUMA-24 outpatient study in second line LBCL and look forward to sharing interim safety data in the first half of this year. While there's still so much we can explore with the Yescarta and Tecartus, we are also building out the pipeline to ensure the Kite will extend its leadership into new indications and next generation cell therapy technologies. In December, we announced the strategic collaboration with Arcellx for the late-stage product candidate, CART-ddBCMA, which is currently being evaluated for the treatment of multiple myeloma. If approved, together with our industry leading manufacturing capabilities, we believe we can reliably and consistently deliver much needed therapy to patients. Additionally, we announced the pending acquisition of Tmunity Therapeutics, which adds an armored CAR T platform and rapid manufacturing technology to Kite. The Arcellx transaction closed earlier this week and Tmunity is expected to close later this quarter. Both highlight Kite\u2019s continued leadership in cell therapy, and our commitment to building a robust and exciting pipeline in cell therapies. Wrapping up on slide 22, we are sharing the key pipeline milestones that we expect in 2023 which as you can see, spans FPI, data readouts, updates and regulatory approvals across oncology and neurology. This highlights the progress that Gilead has made on its transformation journey with 59 clinical programs that are well diversified across indications in stage. As the clinical pipeline has grown, our focus on execution has intensified, and we look forward to updating you on our programs as we progress through 2023. With that, I'll hand the call over to Andy. Andy? Andrew Dickinson : Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Gilead closed out the year with a strong fourth quarter, driven by Biktarvy, Veklury and oncology. For the full year, our sales, excluding Veklury, grew 8%, which is by far the strongest full year growth rate Gilead has reported since HCV sales peaked in 2015. Of note, and excluding the impact of the Atripla and Truvada LOEs, HIV grew 8% year-over-year, driven by continued strong performance of Biktarvy, which grew 20% from 2021 to $10.4 billion. Biktarvy continues to demonstrate strong potential for further growth in 2023 and beyond. Oncology full year revenues exceeded $2 billion for the first time and grew 71% from 2021. Moving to our quarterly results starting on Slide 24. The fourth quarter demonstrated another strong performance across our business. Total product sales, excluding Veklury, grew 9% year-over-year despite an approximately $130 million headwind from FX. If we exclude FX in addition to the impact of HIV LOEs, total underlying sales growth for the fourth quarter was 12% compared with the prior year. Moving to Slide 25. Veklury was down as expected, year-over-year although it grew 8% on a sequential basis from the third quarter, highlighting that Veklury will continue to play an important role even as COVID-19 progresses into its endemic phase. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 86.8%, up more than 16 percentage points from last year, primarily due to a $1.25 billion charge related to a legal settlement recorded in COGS in the fourth quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP R&D expenses for the fourth quarter 2022 were $1.5 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the same period in 2021. Higher R&D expenses were driven by timing of clinical investments, mainly in oncology in addition to the impact of inflation on expenses. Fourth quarter acquired IP R&D was $158 million, primarily reflecting the MacroGenics collaboration and the license amendment with Jounce. And lower than prior year due to the $625 million charge related to the exercise of opt-in rights for Arcus assets in the fourth quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP SG&A was $2 billion, up 23% year-over-year, primarily reflecting a charge of $406 million associated with the termination of the Trodelvy collaboration with Everest Medicines. This $406 million charge includes the $280 million that we agreed to pay Everest to acquire the development and commercial rights to Trodelvy in China and other Asian territories in addition to some other termination-related expenses. Excluding this Everest impact, SG&A was down 2% year-over-year. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 37%, down sequentially due to the factors referenced earlier, including the $406 million Everest charge and up year-over-year. Excluding the Everest charge, non-GAAP operating margin was 42%. Non-GAAP effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 16.8%, lower than the prior year, driven by discrete tax charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.67 in the fourth quarter compared to $0.69 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Of note, the Everest contract termination impacted non-GAAP diluted EPS by $0.25 a share. This was not reflected in the guidance we shared back in October. Moving to the full year on Slide 26. Total product sales were $27 billion. Excluding Veklury, total product sales were $23.1 billion, up 8% compared to 2021, primarily driven by Biktarvy and oncology. Excluding around $380 million of FX headwinds and the $350 million impact of the Truvada and Atripla LOEs, total product sales, excluding Veklury, were up 11% as compared to 2021. I touched on the main P&L impacts in the overview, but we'll highlight on Slide 27 that our non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2022 was 19.3% and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $7.26 per share compared to $7.18 per share reported in 2021. I'll move now to guidance on Slide 28. We recognize that the macro environment continues to be uncertain. Our initial 2023 guidance assumes an overall stable macro environment and relatively stable FX at current rates. While inflation is expected to moderate, our 2023 guidance reflects a full year of higher expenses experienced in 2022 associated with inflation. With that in mind, we expect total product sales in the range of $26 billion to $26.5 billion. For total product sales, excluding Veklury, we expect sales in the range of $24 billion to $24.5 billion, representing growth of 4% to 6% for our base business year-over-year. And we expect Biktarvy sales of approximately $2 billion. As always, Biktarvy sales will continue to track hospitalization rates and will remain highly variable depending on the frequency and severity of surges. Notably, we have seen a decline in hospitalization rates in recent weeks, and we'll continue to monitor the landscape carefully. As a result and similar to last year, we will update you on our Biktarvy expectations on a quarterly basis. Moving to the rest of the P&L. We expect our non-GAAP product gross margin to be approximately 86%, just slightly below our 2022 results and primarily reflecting the growing contribution from oncology. For non-GAAP operating expenses, we expect R&D to increase by a high single-digit percentage compared to 2022 levels, reflecting our on-going investment in strategic areas of growth and an increase in activity from later-stage trials. As a reminder, we had 8 Phase III trials start in 2022, and we expect to have 23 active Phase III trials by the end of 2023. Looking ahead, we expect R&D growth to moderate although we will step up investments as needed to support promising programs based on clinical data. Acquired IP R&D includes previously announced payments for our SELEX community and milestone payments for existing collaborations. Consistent with our approach in 2022, we will continue to share our expected acquired IP R&D expenses as we announced additional transactions. Finally, we expect SG&A to decrease by a low single-digit percentage compared to 2022. However, this is primarily due to some expenses reported in 2022 that we don't expect to repeat in 2023. If we normalize the 2022 SG&A expense for these items, we expect full year 2023 SG&A expense to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage on a basis of approximately $5.1 billion in 2022. Altogether, we expect our non-GAAP operating income for 2023 to be $11 billion to $11.6 billion. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20% again this year. And finally, we expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $6.60 and $7 for the full year and GAAP diluted EPS to be between $5.30 and $5.70 per share. Moving to capital allocation on Slide 29. Our priorities have not changed. In 2022, we returned over $5 billion to shareholders. This included dividend payments and $1.4 billion in share repurchases. Fourth quarter share repurchases were approximately $800 million. For 2023, we have announced today a 2.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.75 per share and remain committed to growing our dividend over time in line with earnings growth. You can also expect to see continued judicious investments in our business, both internally and externally through select partnerships and business development transactions. Finally, we will continue to use share repurchases to offset equity dilution as well as additional repurchases on an opportunistic basis. With that, I'll invite the operator to open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren with Cowen. Please proceed. Tyler Van Buren : Hey, guys, thanks very much for the questions. It's great to see yet another impressive quarter of performance from the core business. At the midpoint, guidance assumes 5% year-over-year growth for product sales, excluding Veklury, yet non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a decline of 6%. So should we expect roughly flat earnings for the next 2 to 3 years as you continue to invest aggressively in the pipeline to set up earnings growth for the second half of the decade? Or is that too conservative? And what levers do you have to increase earnings in the near to midterm? Andrew Dickinson : Hey Tyler, it's Andy. Thanks for the question. We appreciate it. Look, what we've said and obviously, we don't provide longer-term guidance, but I'll reiterate that the -- as you highlighted, the base business is performing very well. We had another good year with Veklury, but we expect, as you heard in our prepared comments that the COVID-19 market will continue to be dynamic. And again, this year, you saw -- if you look at our EPS, the growth of the base business offset the decline in Veklury despite the increase in expenses. Going forward, again, a lot of our shareholders, as you know, focus on non-GAAP EPS, excluding Veklury, based on their assumptions. We expect using kind of that metric for our EPS to grow and for that growth to accelerate over the longer run as our products continue to deliver with additional commercial approvals, expanded indications, new products entering the market, et cetera. So again, I think what you're highlighting is the difficulty of looking through the impact of Veklury. When we look at the base business, we have a lot of confidence in terms of the health of the business and the growth it's going to deliver over time, both on the top line and the bottom line. Jacquie Ross : Hannah, may we have our next question please? Operator : The next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Please proceed. Geoff Meacham : Afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I will keep it just to one. When you look at lenacapavir in the U.S., just help us with maybe the expected kind of loss dynamics following the recent approval and just with consideration of the hurdles with regard to payer access. And obviously, you guys had a long history here, but wondering if the environment is different today versus sort of pre-pandemic. Thank you. Johanna Mercier : Thanks, Geoff, for your question. It's Johanna. I think that we're super excited with Sunlenca approval. Do remember, though, it's really for a very specific patient population for the heavily treatment experienced multi-drug resistant population. And so that's about 1% to 2% of people living without HIV. That's about 5,000 patients or so in the U.S. So just to give you a little bit of a perspective on it. The \u2013 that\u2019s one piece of the puzzle. So far, so we just launched. So it's still early days and we're excited about it. And I think physicians' response has been very strong as well. The -- I think they really see the innovation of having something every 6 months coming in and also the promise of what it could mean in future with prevention indication as well as treatment combination. So more to come on that one. I think it's an incredible opportunity for us to gain awareness for Sunlenca. How to use it the reimbursement systems. And as to your point about pre-COVID to COVID, I think that actually, we've really normalized the market. I think we're back on track, when it comes to HIV, both screening, diagnosis, et cetera, and treatment. So we do believe that, that's probably not in play as we go forward in 2023. But again, small revenue, huge unmet medical need, and an incredible opportunity for patients to have something to ensure that they don't proceed to more like Aids disease versus just saying HIV positive. Jacquie Ross : Hannah, may we have our next question, please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Michael Yee at Jefferies. Please proceed. Michael Yee : Hey thanks for the question. Maybe a question for Merdad. On Trop-2, the competitor AstraZeneca Daiichi continues to be quite bullish and actually as a Phase III lung cancer study readout and -- the Street is quite bullish on Trop-2. Can you explain your thoughts around your differentiation? Appreciating your study readout, I think in 2024, and what we should appreciate as to how you will compete there or differentiate and maybe its safety, but maybe walk me through that and help us understand Trop-2 for versus your competitor? Thank you. Merdad Parsey : Yes. Thanks, Michael. This is Merdad. You're absolutely right. We do think that there are a couple of things that we think about when we think about differentiation. The first is that -- we've now been on the market and have several approvals under our belt with Trodelvy. And I think that is an important factor for having now been on the market in important indications. To your point, with lung, we will be somewhat behind where our competition is we do think that the data will have to evolve for us and for them. And I think so far, we have been fortunate to not see ILD in our development program so far. And so we are going to continue advancing our program forward aggressively. We've had a lot of success so far -- and I think our plan is to keep going ahead with the differentiated clinical development program so we can get into the broadest population as possible. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Do Kim with Piper Sandler. Please proceed. Do Kim : Hi thanks for taking my question. And congrats on the quarter. Keeping it on Trodelvy. Merdad, I was hoping if you could provide a little more detail on 7 in pre-chemo HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer that you're initiating later this year. Just what that study design would look like? And how did you come to conclude that this was the next best study for this population. Merdad Parsey : Yes, hi thanks, that's an excellent question. And I think we haven't really talked about the design yet. In large part, we are working through both with investigators and regulators on what the best approach is going to be in that patient population. We do think that there is an important need in a large population there. And we want to make sure that we navigate that pathway carefully. So I think as we develop that program as a protocol gets developed, we'll be able to share more detail over time. Jacquie Ross : Hannah, may we have our next question, please? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Colin Bristow with UBS. Please proceed. Colin Bristow : Hey, can you guys hear me? Merdad Parsey : Yes. Colin Bristow : Good afternoon and congrats on all the progress. Maybe one on TIGIT and dompenanumab. The -- just what is it that gives you the confidence that the Fc silent construct is the right approach when I think at least the animal data suggest that this may not be preferred. And then as you think about the upcoming study, ARC-7, could you talk about the frequency of scanter [ph] because this has come up as a point of at least discussion with regards to the comparator trials and the frequency of scans. Thank you. Merdad Parsey : Sure. This is Merdad again. Excellent question. Thank you for that. We -- in terms of our confidence, I think to your point, look, I think there was a lot of debate a couple of years ago. We shared in that debate, with what the preclinical data was showing. And as you know, the data they were conflicting preclinical data, including some data that suggested maybe an FC-silent may not work. But which is why we ran the studies the way we did and very importantly, why we ran ARC-7. The objective there was really to establish whether an FC-silent now would demonstrate a benefit relative to FC-active molecule. Part of the hypothesis there is what happens in the periphery and whether depleting effector cells with TIGIT could actually be harmful with FC-competent molecule relative to an FC-nonmolecule. And our confidence really comes from our ARC-7 data. I think the ARC-7 data really answered that question. We clearly show a benefit when added on to a PD-1. The PFS data exceed our bar for moving forward. And so we really think that we've answered that question in the clinic as to whether the FC-now matters. Jacquie Ross : Hannah, let\u2019s move to our next question. Operator : The next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Chris Schott : Hi, great. Thanks so much. Just a question on the COVID business. I know it's volatile, and I know at the same time, the Street doesn't seem to model much of a tail for Veklury or GS-5245 at all in numbers beyond this year. We've got Pfizer's and others, then talking about more sustainable COVID businesses, I guess, off of 2023 level. So I just missing your thoughts on just how you're thinking about the business longer term? And is this a meaningful franchise for you over time? Or are you really thinking of this continuing to fade down beyond this year? Thank you. Johanna Mercier : Sure, Chris. It's Johanna. Yes. So definitely, we've changed a little bit. Our position on this one has evolved from 2020 to where we are today, obviously. I think we do truly believe that the Veklury business is much more sustainable than we've ever seen before, let alone as we think about kind of where we're going with COVID-19, including the oral that Merdad can speak to. The one piece that we've seen is -- it's maybe a little bit different than some of the orals that you're referring to is One is Veklury has been part of a commercial model since October of 2020. So we haven't had such big inventory lows at the government level like some others have had. So really, what you see probably 85% to 90% of revenues in 2022 are truly reflecting the demand for Veklury in 2022. And so therefore, coming into 2023, we feel very strongly that Veklury, because it's still the only antiviral indicated at the hospital level at this point in time because of the fact that in many countries around the world, it is the treatment of choice when they decide to treat hospitalized patients. I think there's really an incredible continuing opportunity for us to ensure that Veklury has is accessible to all these patients. And so that's why we think the model is quite sustainable moving forward. I would also just add that our label has broadened over the last year in some. We have a very strong body of evidence, including mortality as well as we have guidelines endorsement with the NIH as well as the WHO. So all of those people all of those pieces together actually make for a strong Veklury color position in 2023, but actually and beyond. And maybe I'll just pass it over to Merdad to talk a little bit to how we're thinking about COVID-19 as a whole with the oral. Merdad Parsey : Yes. Just 2 seconds. I think you're right to point out the uncertainties that we all have and that we've seen with outpatient COVID. And we have a lot of confidence in the mechanism of 5245 given what our expertise in the molecule itself and how well behaved it is. And we are going to push forward and do our best with both the high-risk and standard risk study and the uncertainties in terms of the pandemic will really determine what happens from here. So we will definitely keep you updated as to how that goes from here on out. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brian Abrahams with RBC. Please proceed. Brian Abrahams : Hey good afternoon. And congrats on the quarter, and thanks for taking my question. Maybe continuing on the COVID theme on 5245, the Oaktree study. Can you talk a little bit more about the assumptions you've made in powering the primary endpoint here for the standard risk patients? And then help us understand how Oaktree and Birch might fit together to support U.S. and ex-U.S. approvals across the 2 populations you're studying? Thanks. Merdad Parsey : Sure. Very briefly. The -- to your point, one is in the high-risk population, right? So I think that's important. Those are people who have risk factors, whether or not they've been vaccinated and then the standard risk, which is people without risk factors. And -- those are very different populations. The end points are different in terms of what we're looking for and the high risk we're going to be looking for the ability to prevent things like hospitalization. And the standard risk, it would be looking for things like symptom improvement. And I think, again, I'll just reiterate that I think the uncertainties in terms of those factors and importantly, the underlying event rate is real. And so we've made a number of assumptions around what that background rate will be. And we've built into the trials, checkpoints to make sure that our assumptions are correct. And we have the ability to modify our program based on what the underlying event rates are. So that sort of helps mitigate the risks and the uncertainties. So we've gone in fairly eyes open to that. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the progress. Maybe if you could comment on your overall market share in HIV space and how it has been progressing. What I want to understand is that is there a scenario where your entire business growth could be better than the market growth as you gain share at this point? Thank you. A - Johanna Mercier : Sure. Hi, Mohit, it's Johanna. I think as we look at HIV as a whole, we're looking at about a 5% year-on-year growth. And of course, that's mostly driven by demand, namely Biktarvy. And so it's probably important to talk about the share there. So our total Gilead share is still in the low 70s, and we've been quite stable at that level. We saw a little bit of the dip when we got the Truvada, Atripla LOEs, and that's the only decline that we've seen there and really held steady, where you see nice growth, of course, is Biktarvy. Our year-on-year growth for Biktarvy is 20% in 50-year post launch. And I think that's the piece of the puzzle that's really driving the overall HIV business. In addition, to what's going on in PrEP with Descovy. To your point about the market growth, we've seen market growth around 2% to 3% year-on-year, both in the U.S. as well as in Europe, and we've assumed that we're kind of assuming that for some years to come. And I do think there's still enormous opportunity for continued growth in that market. And one of the main reasons why is there's still an opportunity for increasing treatment rates so from diagnosis to treatment, but also further penetration in underserved patient populations. And so at this point in time, with United Nations goal at 95,95,95 for testing, treatment and virologic suppression we're only about 70%, 75%. So if we were to get to those goals, you're looking at over 350,000 more patients into the system. So I think you're absolutely right. I think there's a great opportunity for us to continue to grow Biktarvy and our HIV business at Gilead. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Umer Raffat at Evercore. Please proceed. Umer Raffat : Hi guys. I have a question on the model today. I feel like consensus models have a lot of operating leverage in the long-term estimates for Gilead. And don't -- consensus doesn't carry more than low single-digit OpEx growth across SG&A and R&D. So with SG&A growing mid-single digits this year after the onetimers and R&D growing high single digits, I guess, should we assume that given all the collaborations and recent acquisitions that you really do need to be growing R&D meaningfully from current levels? I'm just trying to understand where the OpEx is heading longer term. Andrew Dickinson : Hey Omar, it's Andy. Thanks for the question. maybe a couple of things. First, I'd highlight that as you'd expect, we are mindful of expenses and don't expect R&D or SG&A to grow indefinitely. That said, we're going to continue to invest thoughtfully in the pipeline, and you're already seeing, I'd highlight the tangible benefits of doing that. So that's a really important point. We started on the R&D side. As you know, we started 8 Phase III trials this year. We're going to -- as you heard, start at least another 5 in 2023. So we are in an investment cycle. Over the longer run, and maybe one other thing before I kind of talk about the long-run picture to your question, again, when you benchmark us relative to competitors, as you know, historically, for both SG&A and R&D we underspent. And it's partly why we didn't have the pipeline that would drive the top quartile sustainable growth, that we aspire to, and we think we're on track to achieve today. So we're going to continue to invest. As you've heard and especially in these late Phase III trials that have started, we'll continue to do BD not at the same pace or level that we have over the last 4 or 5 years as we've rebuilt the pipeline. But our percent, our R&D as a percent of revenue this past year was below industry averages, I think, right around 19%. Same thing is true for SG&A as a percent of revenue. And even our guide suggests, I think, reasonable spend levels relative to comps. In the longer run, to your point, so we think about things over a longer cycle, we will not -- we do not expect to grow R&D or SG&A above the rate of earnings growth. And there is a lot of leverage in the model, we expect over the long run. So we're getting to the point where you're starting to see that play through, especially at the top line and then over the coming years, we expect that you'll really see that play through on the bottom line as well. So thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Olivia Brayer with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed. Olivia Brayer : Hey good afternoon guys. Thank you for the question. What's the latest thinking with respect to the regulatory path forward for magrolimab? I guess the question really is, could we see survival data from that ENHANCE interim later this year that's actually mature enough to file on? And is there anything beyond OS benefit that FDA has pointed to for a complete submission package? Thank you. Merdad Parsey : Hi, Olivia, this is Merdad. Yes. I think maybe it's good to step back and just clarify in the sense of -- how we're approaching interim analysis for our studies. So the pivotal macro study is powered for events at the final analysis. And of course, we run interim analyses, I think, as is norm for the industry to evaluate things like safety, but also we spend a little bit of alpha in case there is a dramatic improvement in the primary endpoint and offer ourselves the opportunity to start early to benefit patients. So the OS data continue to mature. The next interim this year dependent on events, of course, is not the final analysis. So it really depends on how big the magnitude of improvement is in OS, whether that leads to a stop in the study or an unblinding in the study. Our expectation is that we go to the final OS analysis. Of course, we always hope an upside surprise at one of the earlier interim analysis. And then in terms of approval, I think we really need to have OS. We initially had hoped that we could get, for example, an accelerated approval with CR rates alone. We think we need to do both now to have both a complete response rate, but primarily be driven -- not primarily be driven but importantly, have OS data as well in order to support a file. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Simon Baker with Redburn. Please proceed. Simon Baker : Thank you. First on [indiscernible] on the NICE recommendation. Clearly, that's good from a U.K. perspective, but it's the case that NICE recommendations are closely followed by a much larger range of countries. So I just wondered if this does indeed have a spill over benefit beyond the U.K. for Yescarta. How important is this approval in the U.K.? Christi Shaw : Hey there Simon, it's Christi. Thank you for the question. So we think it's very important because first of all, it's the number of patients is still very similar at 450, but the process by which patients get approved, obviously should be much smoother and really giving access to -- this recommendation really helps patients get access much more quickly. And so to your point, we do think as you see this approval that this hopefully, will have an influence on other countries, just like we saw with reimbursement as we look at the reimbursement of Yescarta in over 20 countries, it was one at a time. And as certain countries starting to improve. We saw the other countries also do the same. So based on the second-line ZUMA-7 trial as well, that will be our next step, too to continue to provide the data that giving a patient a onetime treatment can really help the health care system and improve patient outcomes. So yes, we're very hopeful that it could have some influence. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist. Please proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. This is Nicole on for Robyn. Are you seeing any safety signals in a sense for NFLSC [Ph] with Trodelvy and pembro? Like are the safety probes comparable to both populations? And if so, would this hamper uptake in the first line? Merdad Parsey : Hi, Nicole, this is Merdad. We haven't really disclosed anything on the safety. Those studies have really just gotten underway. So I don't think we have anything to share yet. We'll, of course, be following that to see if anything emerges. Your question is exactly the one that we want to make sure we address as we move forward. But I don't -- we don't have enough data at this point to make a comment one way or the other. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will be from Evan Seigerman with BMO. Please proceed. Evan Seigerman : Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. One for Christi. You're annualizing well above $1 billion for cell therapy products. Can you talk about the recent work you've done to expand manufacturing and how you could think that could support further growth this year and beyond? Thank you. Christi Shaw : Sure. So that was our focus and has been our focus is really on the supply side and being able to ensure that we have the capacity to provide for patients. I think that's what you're seeing is our industry-leading manufacturing piece. And if you look at GCFO3 here in California, adding the new site to TCFO-4 in Amsterdam and in TCFO-5 in Maryland, we're really able to leverage that footprint to grow not only in the assets that we have today, but in future pipeline, especially as we look at the partnership we have now with our select to multiple myeloma. So we're very confident about our ability to supply and the capacity that we've built and today and for tomorrow. And really the next focus for us is we've had some really good gains on our margin improvements. But as we look at our operational -- our optimization of our manufacturing footprint. Yes, we need to continue to ensure the capacity, which we feel like we've really done. And now we're able to put a big focus too on the optimization piece, which we've made progress on but we have several levers there to pull as well. So I hope you're hearing from me a big confidence in our ability to deliver for patients from a capacity standpoint. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to the management team for any closing remarks. Daniel O'Day: Great. This is Dan. I just want to do a couple of things here. First of all, thank you all for joining and your on-going interest and questions for Gilead. As usual, if we didn't get to all of your questions, please reach out to Investor Relations. As you know, we're very happy to answer those on an on-going basis. Now let me just close by emphasizing that Gilead is in a very different place than it was a few years ago, thanks to the work the team has done to transform the company. We're going into 2023 in a very strong position with our current medicines performing well and tremendous growth potential in our neuro therapies as well as those in development. So what you can expect to see next is quarter-on-quarter execution and even faster progress and greater impact in the future. Thank you very much for your time today, and we look forward to speaking to you again soon. Operator : That concludes today's fourth quarter and full year 2022 Gilead Sciences earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, everyone, and welcome to the First Quarter 2023 Gilead Sciences Earnings Conference Call. My name is Nadia, and I'll be coordinating the call today. [Operator Instruction] I will now hand over to your host, Jacquie Ross, Vice President, Investor Relations to begin. Jacquie, please go ahead. Jacquie Ross : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the first quarter of 2023. The press release, slides and supplemental data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including those related to Gilead's business, financial condition, and results of operations, plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations, financial projections, and the use of capital, and 2023 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation is provided in the earnings press release, in our supplementary data sheet, as well as on the Gilead website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan. Daniel O'Day: Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. The Gilead team continued its track-record of strong commercial and clinical execution in the first quarter of 2023. Our base business grew at 15% excluding Veklury, with total product sales of $6.3 billion, reflecting outperformance across the portfolio. On a year-over-year basis, roughly two-thirds of the $735 million increase in our base business sales were driven by HIV and the other third was driven by oncology. Once again, we're seeing the tangible impact of our transformation, and the successful diversification of our business. We saw a year-over-year growth in HIV up 13%, liver disease, which includes therapies for HCV, HBV and HDV up 6%, cell therapy up 64% and Trodelvy up 52%. As expected, Veklury revenues continued to track lower rates of COVID-19 hospitalizations. As a result, revenue of $573 million was down 63% from the first quarter of last year. On the clinical side, we received another FDA approval for Trodelvy in early February. This latest approval was for a third indication, pretreated HR positive HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer. Its early days, but this has been a very strong commercial launch for Trodelvy in the U.S. so far. This further highlights the critical patient need that Trodelvy is addressing in this late-stage population, as well as the effectiveness of our commercial oncology team. We continue to prepare for Trodelvy's approval in pretreated HR positive HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer in Europe in the second half of this year. Another key milestone for the quarter was the announcement of the primary overall survival data from the landmark Phase 3 ZUMA-7 study. Yescarta is now the first and only treatment in nearly 30 years to show a statistically significant improvement in overall survival for initial treatment of relapsed or refractory Large B-cell lymphoma patients versus historical standard-of-care in a curative setting. Full results will be presented at this year's ASCO. Turning to clinical progress in virology, we continue to add to the body of evidence for lenacapavir's effectiveness as part of a six-month subcutaneous therapy. At this year's CROI, the team shared positive Phase 1b data on the investigational lenacapavir and bNAb combination. The bNAb combination is, of course, just one of the eight long-acting combination options that we're exploring for lenacapavir and we are pleased with our progress so far. In the meantime, following our first approval of lenacapavir as Sunlenca for heavily treatment experienced people living with HIV, we are seeing strong engagement from KOLs and physicians who are interested in the full potential of lenacapavir for prevention and treatment. As you know, this first approval addresses a significant unmet need for a small number of people living with HIV, who have very limited options available to them. And we look forward to making lenacapavir available to many more people, beginning with the potential approval and prevention in the 2025 timeframe. We see lenacapavir as having the most promising potential yet in the ongoing efforts to end the HIV epidemic, and we're looking forward to working with others to make it broadly available as soon as possible. With that, I'll hand over to Johanna for a review of our first quarter commercial performance. Johanna? Johanna Mercier : Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. The commercial organization delivered a very strong start to the year and continued to build on the momentum we saw in 2022, to set a firm foundation for continued execution and growth in 2023. As our results show on Slide 7, each of our core franchises delivered year-over-year growth led by HIV and oncology, and total product sales excluding Veklury totaled $5.7 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Including Veklury, total product sales were $6.3 billion, down 3% driven by lower Veklury sales associated with fewer COVID-19 hospitalizations. On Slide 8, HIV sales were up 13% year-over-year to $4.2 billion, driven by favorable pricing dynamics, higher demand and lower inventory drawdowns. Quarter-over-quarter, sales were down 12%, associated with the normal seasonality we typically experience in first quarter. As a reminder, at the start of the year, patient co-pays and deductibles reset, which had an impact on average realized prices and market growth. We expect these pricing impacts to normalize through the remainder of the year. And we also see typically a buildup in inventory in the fourth quarter, followed by meaningful inventory drawdowns in the first quarter. Following a focused effort to better manage this dynamic, we're pleased to see less of an impact than we have historically on both a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, highlighting our goal of better matching product delivery with end user demand. We expect these efforts to contribute to a more stable quarter-over-quarter growth in our HIV business, as compared to prior years. Turning to Sunlenca. First quarter sales of $4 million was very much in-line with our expectations. Sunlenca is an important option for the small number of people living with HIV who have developed resistance and have few, if any, other options. We are leveraging the launch to engage with providers and the community ahead of lenacapavir's potential launches in prevention and treatment. Overall, the HIV treatment market grew approximately 2% year-over-year in the U.S., and almost 4% in Europe, tracking in-line with our expectations for annual growth of 2% to 3%. And in prevention, awareness continues to grow with the US PrEP market up over 19% year-over-year. Moving to Slide 9. Biktarvy sales of $2.7 billion were up 24% year-over-year, driven by higher demand, as well as favorable pricing and inventory dynamics. Biktarvy continues to cement itself as the therapy of choice for people living with HIV, now capturing a treatment market-share of 46% in the U.S., up 3% year-over-year, and representing a growth rate that has impressively outpaced new and existing regimens. Moreover, Biktarvy has maintained its leading position for new starts across the U.S., Europe and other major markets, as well as in treatment switches across most major markets, including the US. On Descovy, sales were $449 million in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year. Demand for Descovy for PrEP remained strong at 14% year-over-year. Descovy for PrEP once again maintained its greater than 40% market share. The continued resilience of our PrEP business despite availability of other prevention options, including generics, provides a solid foundation as we make progress towards the potential approval and launch of lenacapavir for PrEP. Moving to slide 10. The Liver disease portfolio was up 6% year-over-year to $675 million, highlighting the continuing contribution of our viral hepatitis medicines to patients and the Gilead portfolio. In HCV, sales were $445 million, up 12% year-over-year, driven by favorable pricing dynamics and timing of purchases by the Department of Corrections. HBV and HDV sales we're $230 million, down 2% year-over-year, primarily due to pricing dynamics outside of the U.S. We continue to expect HCV start to trend down over time, given the curative nature of therapy, with some offset from HBV and HDV. In the meantime, we are pleased to observe solid and stable market shares across all of our Liver portfolio. On to Slide 11, and as we expected, Veklury sales of $573 million were down year-over-year, and sequentially, as COVID-related infections became less severe and hospitalizations remain below peak levels. As a reminder, the winter surge occurred earlier than we had expected, beginning in the fourth quarter and lasting only through the beginning of Q1. As Veklury's use tracks hospitalization, it's sales are volatile and highly subject to surges and the overall path of the pandemic. Veklury is backed by clinical data and real-world evidence that reinforces its clinical profile and despite the lower hospitalization rates in the quarter, Veklury's share of hospitalized patients treated for COVID-19 grew modestly, maintaining well over 50% share in the United States. Moving to oncology and beginning with Trodelvy on Slide 12. Sales of $222 million were up 52% year-over-year and 14% sequentially, driven by strong growth both in the U.S. and Europe. Following U.S. approval in early-February, we're off to a strong start with Trodelvy in pretreated HR positive HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer, as some clinicians moved quickly to make this new option available for patients in this setting. We look forward to extending Trodelvy's reach to these patients in Europe, where a decision is expected later this year. Of course, our efforts here are underpinned by the successes and learnings in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer with TNBC. From our expansion of the field force last year and a strong body of data across a number of tumor types, more physicians are recognizing Trodelvy's clinically meaningful overall survival benefit. This recognition is not just in metastatic TNBC, but also in HR positive HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer regardless of HER-2 negative status. Now on to slide 13. Cell therapy sales in the first quarter were $448 million, up 64% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter. We're pleased with the continued growth of Yescarta, with sales up 70% Year-over-year to $359 million, primarily driven by growth in the second and third-line setting for relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma. Sequentially, sales were up 6%, driven in-part by strong demand and favorable pricing dynamics, both primarily in Europe. Turning to Tecartus. Sales were $89 million, up 40% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, driven by growing demand for both relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Looking ahead, we continue to work to raise awareness of cell therapies and increase cost share. We believe that compelling data including ZUMA-7's recent positive overall survival results, in addition to peer dataset in the cell therapy space will support broader adoption over time. In summary, it's been a positive start to the year with our current product portfolio of virology and oncology medicines, delivering strong performance. We look forward to maintaining this momentum through the rest of the year and beyond. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad for an update on our pipeline. Merdad? Merdad Parsey : Thank you, Johanna. We are off to a strong start in 2023 with our first regulatory approval of the year for Trodelvy for certain HR positive HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer patients in the U.S. and an additional 10 trials initiated so far this year, including four Phase 3 studies. This brings our clinical pipeline to 61 ongoing clinical programs. Starting with virology on Slide 15, we presented late-breaking data among 83 abstracts at CROI in Seattle in February, highlighting Gilead's continued expertise and leadership across HIV, Viral Hepatitis and COVID-19. In HIV, we shared several data readouts from our lenacapavir based development programs in prevention and treatment. In prevention, we presented preclinical in-vivo data providing further validation that a subcutaneous injection of lenacapavir can confer long-acting protection in an animal model. We believe lenacapavir as a single-agent has the potential to be the first once every six month option for HIV prevention. We are currently testing this in our pivotal Phase 3 PURPOSE trials. In treatment, we shared Phase 1b proof-of-concept data on twice yearly lenacapavir in combination with two investigational broadly neutralizing antibodies. At week-26, 90% of trial participants receiving this combination maintained virologic suppression. Further, treatment with the investigational regimen was generally well tolerated. Moving to COVID-19 on Slide 16, we also shared positive data from three retrospective real-world analysis of Veklury at CROI. These analysis showed that initiation of Veklury within the first two days of hospital admission, reduced death and hospital readmission rates among all patients with COVID-19. The right hand side of the slide highlights that both of our oral Phase 3 trials evaluating GS-5245 or obeldesivir, our investigational oral COVID nucleoside in standard risk patients and in high risk patients are now enrolling. Given uncertainties in the global epidemiology of COVID-19, we continue to be cautious with regards to the length of time it could take to fully enroll these trials. Moving on to Slide 17. Trodelvy continues to build momentum as the cornerstone of our solid tumor portfolio. As expected, the FDA approved Trodelvy for its third indication. Trodelvy is now approved in adults with HR positive HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer, who previously received endocrine-based therapy and at least two additional systemic therapies for metastatic disease. This FDA approval is based on the overall survival benefit seen in the Phase 3 TROPiCS-02 trial. We've already received acceptance of our European filing, and continue to expect a regulatory decision from the European Commission in the second half of this year. The Phase 3 EVOKE-01 trial evaluating the potential for Trodelvy in second line non-small cell lung cancer is ongoing. Additionally, we recently had FPI for the Phase 3 EVOKE-03 study also known as KEYNOTE-D46. This trial is being led by Merck to evaluate Trodelvy in combination with pembrolizumab in first line PD-L1 high non-small cell lung cancer. Additionally, we're excited to announce that over 30 abstracts, including an oral presentation of the updated ARC7 trial data have been accepted at ASCO this year. Not only do these data highlight elements of our investigational Trodelvy and dombinilumab programs in breast, bladder and lung cancers, the abstracts include new insights on many of our promising targets, including our cell therapy portfolio. Speaking of which, on Slide 18, I'm pleased to discuss the clinical progress we've made within cell therapy. Recently, we highlighted new overall survival data from the Phase 3 ZUMA-7 trial evaluating Yescarta for the initial treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma. These data will be presented as an oral late-breaker at ASCO. Yescarta is the first and only therapy of any kind to show statistically significant overall survival benefit versus standard-of-care in almost 30 years. As we work to extend our leadership in cell therapy within our current portfolio, we're also building out our earlier stage programs. As mentioned in our last earnings call, we closed our agreement to co-develop and co-commercialize Arcellx's CART-ddBCMA for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Also, we closed our acquisition of Community Therapeutics in February, extending our preclinical and clinical pipeline in blood cancers and solid tumors. We are currently working to integrate the Community team with their asset into our broader innovation pipeline. Wrapping up on Slide 19, we are sharing the updated key pipeline milestones that we expect in 2023, which as you can see spans FPI's, data readouts, updates and regulatory approvals across oncology, virology and inflammation. Overall, this highlights the progress that Gilead has made on its transformation journey. The 61 clinical programs that are well-diversified across indications and stage. We have an ambitious clinical program, and I'd like to thank the Gilead team that has worked tirelessly to execute and accelerate the progress of our portfolio. We look forward to updating you as we progress through 2023. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Andy. Andy? Andrew Dickinson : Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting on Slide 21, the first quarter was a strong commercial start to the year, with total product sales, excluding Veklury, up 15% year-over-year despite continued FX headwinds. Overall, our base business demonstrated growth in each of our product families, including almost 60% growth in oncology, and 13% growth in HIV. Total product sales were $6.3 billion, down 3% due to lower Veklury sales, partially offset by growth in our base business. FX negatively impacted first quarter total product sales by $106 million, representing approximately 150 basis points of growth. Turning to Slide 22. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 86.2%, down 1.2 percentage points from last year, due to, among other things, the timing of the Biktarvy royalty initiation in the first quarter of 2022 and product mix, partially offset by inventory benefits. Moving to OpEx, expenses were higher than we anticipated in the first quarter due to R&D investments and inflationary pressures. Non-GAAP R&D was $1.4 billion, up 25% year-over-year, due to higher expenses, including the acceleration of certain late-stage clinical studies, as well as about $50 million in one-time items. As Merdad mentioned, we have started 10 new trials so far this year, including four Phase 3 programs. This brings the total number of ongoing Phase 3 studies to 22, highlighting the investment we are making in Gilead's future growth. Clinical trial enrollment for a number of new and ongoing Trodelvy and lenacapavir trials was faster than we expected, with a notable acceleration, for example, in certain lenacapavir trials in March. Our clinical team has been working hard to rapidly advance our studies and bring new therapeutic options to patients as fast as we can. This includes working to close the gap that some peers have in certain programs and we believe we are starting to see the impact of these acceleration efforts in our trials, although this did contribute to higher R&D expenses in the first quarter. Consistent with past practice, we will continue to manage expenses carefully, including the ongoing process of prioritizing programs based on potential impact and data. We have taken the last several years to build the most diverse and robust clinical pipeline in Gilead's history, now with well over 100 trials across our three targeted therapeutic areas. We are excited to see so many of these programs in later-stage trials with a number of data readouts building momentum over the next several years. Non-GAAP acquired IP R&D was $481 million, primarily driven by expenses related to our acquisition of Community, as well as upfront and milestone payments associated with the Arcellx and Nurix collaborations. Non-GAAP SG&A was $1.3 billion, up 22% year-over-year, primarily due to the commercial expansion and investments in our oncology business, in addition to higher branded prescription drug fee expenses and higher corporate expense that continue to be impacted by inflation. Moving to tax, our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the first quarter was 18.9%, lower than expected driven by discrete tax benefits recorded in the first quarter. Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.37 in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $2.12 for the same period last year, reflecting higher operating expenses and lower product gross margin. I'll move now to guidance for the full year 2023 on Slide 23. There is no change to our revenue guidance. We continue to expect total product sales in the range of $26 billion to $26.5 billion and we continue to expect total product sales excluding Veklury in the range of $24 billion to $24.5 billion, representing growth of 4% to 6% for our base business year-over-year. On Veklury, the first quarter was modestly below our internal expectations and our $2 billion full year guidance assumes an increase in infections at some point later this year, not dissimilar from what we saw in 2022. We know from experience that COVID-19 related sales are extremely volatile and are leaving our guidance unchanged pending additional data points as we move through the year. Moving to the rest of the P&L. We continue to target non-GAAP product gross margin of approximately 86%, as discussed, we now expect full year 2023 non-GAAP R&D expenses to increase a low double-digit percentage compared to 2022. This resulted in an overall R&D investment for the full year in the low 20's as a percentage of total revenue. We believe this is a more appropriate level of investment for a company with a broad late-stage clinical portfolio that is targeting attractive opportunities and sustainable revenue growth. We continue to expect non-GAAP acquired IP R&D to be approximately $700 million, reflecting previously committed acquired IP R&D amounts. Similar to prior quarters, we will continue to include expected acquired IP R&D expenses as we announced additional transactions over the course of the year. Moving to non-GAAP SG&A, there is no change to our prior guidance, where we expect a full year declined by a low-single digit percentage compared to 2022. Although we will continue to look for opportunities to partially offset the higher R&D investments, we now plan for this year. Overall, there is no change to our expectations for non-GAAP operating income in the range of $11 billion to $11.6 billion. Additionally, there is no change to our tax guidance, and we continue to target a non-GAAP effective tax-rate of approximately 20%. And finally, we continue to expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $6.60 and $7 per share, reflecting, first, that the initial guidance model we shared with you in early-February allowed for a broad range of potential revenue and expense scenarios. And second, that we're committed to finding room in our overall P&L to absorb the higher R&D investments that we are choosing to prioritize in 2023. On a GAAP basis, we expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.75 to $5.15. Moving to Slide 24, you can see there is no change to our capital allocation priorities. We returned $1.4 billion to shareholders in the first quarter through our dividend and repurchase of shares. Finally, on business development, there is no change to our philosophy, we are very comfortable with the breadth and the quality of the pipeline that we've built, acquired or partnered and the growth it will enable in the coming years. With that in mind, you can expect us to continue to opportunistically access high quality assets through partnerships or to make smaller acquisitions in the normal course of business. And now, I'll hand it over to Dan for some closing remarks. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Andy. Before we open for Q&A I'll just summarize our prepared remarks by noting that this is another quarter where we demonstrated the continued impact of our transformation. Going-forward, we are committed to building on the track record of strong commercial and clinical execution that we've shown in recent quarters, thanks to the dedication to Gilead and Kite teams, around the world. With this positive momentum, we look-forward to delivering on our portfolio, while maintaining financial discipline. With that, I'll invite the operator to open the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today goes to Michael Yee of Jefferies. Michael, please go ahead, your line is open. Dennis Ding : Hi, this is Dennis Ding on for Mike. Thanks for taking the questions. Two from us, maybe number one. What are your expectations for the competitor Trop-2 data that's coming imminently? And what would you like to see and how would you differentiate? And could you perhaps look at PFS like your competitor? And then number two, can you just talk about the progress of your long-acting oral integrase inhibitors for HIV. Are they in the clinic yet? Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Thanks for the questions. So in terms of the competitor Trop-2 data, I think it's a little early for us to be doing comparisons across data we haven't seen yet. We're really comfortable with the data we've already shown and have certainly led to approvals in breast cancer with OS benefit. So, you can see from the uptake of Trodelvy in the breast cancer market that being approved and having those OS data has had an impact for patients and we're very comfortable with where we are. Of course, we'll keep an eye on those emerging data as they become available, and every indication. And then in terms of the long-acting orals, as you know, we have a number of programs in the clinic for our long-acting portfolio, both oral and injectable, and we've moved several of them, including an oral program into the clinic and we'll be sharing those data as they become available. Very excited about that. That portfolio we remain committed to and, really excited about our long-acting portfolio to do -- to leverage [lenacapavir] (ph) profile to go into both oral long-acting as well as parenteral long-acting formulation. So stay-tuned as those data develop, we'll gladly share. Jacquie Ross : Nadia, may we have our next question, please. And can I remind all our callers to please limit themselves to one question so that we get to as many folks in the queue as possible. Thanks, Nadia. Operator : Thank you. The next question goes to Brian Abrahams of RBC. Brian, please go ahead, your line is open. Brian Abrahams : Hey, good afternoon and thanks so much for taking my question. Regarding Trodelvy, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing with regards to its use across the different lines of therapy post HR positive HER-2 negative approval? And I guess along those lines as you think about moving this to earlier lines in this indication, what's your latest thoughts on the potential trial design for ASCENT-07 to optimize -- in terms of optimizing the right patient population to expedite trial enrollment and support meaningful commercial expansion? Thanks. Daniel O'Day: Thanks so much. Brian, Dan O'Day here. I'm going to have Johanna answer the first part of your question and then Merdad the second Thank you. Johanna Mercier : Thanks, Dan. So basically, we really pleased with the early launch results that we've seen so far in HR positive HER-2 negative. And what we've been seeing is strong initial uptake, basically in fourth line plus with some share even in third line. And I think that's really important for us as we think about even earlier trials moving up lines of therapy. But I think the data with the overall survival that we've shown, in addition to the work that we've done in metastatic TNBC also showing overall survival has really helped, because we\u2019ve had strong awareness, obviously, of Trodelvy in the community as well as in academic centers, and the extended field team work that we did last year has really helped us make sure that we solidified the launch of HR positive HER-2 negative. So still early, we only have a couple of months in. But definitely on the right track and we're really seeing physicians understand the benefits of Trodelvy and what they can bring for their patients in this setting. Merdad? Merdad Parsey : Yeah. And then in terms of the ASCENT-07. Look, as we design and move into earlier lines of therapy in that study, as you know, we're going to be looking at chemo-naive population. And we do anticipate that study getting started in the second half of this year. So things are moving along very nicely, and we are really excited about that program. The final details in terms of design will be rolled out. I think we're crossing the [indiscernible] right now in terms of that final protocol. So you'll see that posted and available in short order. Jacquie Ross : Nadia, may we have our next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question goes to Chris Schott of JP Morgan. Chris, please go ahead, your line is open. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the question. I just had one on OpEx, can you just talk a little bit about how we should be thinking about Gilead's operating costs going forward? It sounds like you are obviously accelerating some R&D programs and we've got this double-digit step-up in R&D this year. As we think about operating margin dynamics kind of going forward. I guess off of the 2023 levels, can we start to think about margin expansion going forward, or do we need to maybe think about another year or two of investment before we can think about margin expansion for the company? Thank you. Andrew Dickinson : Hey, Chris, it's Andy Dickinson. Thanks for the question. That's a great question. Maybe just stepping back, again, highlight and reinforce that we've built a large and diverse portfolio that really positions us for significant growth, both in the short-term as well as in the long-run. As you heard in our prepared remarks, we're really investing and kind of leading into that, we had an accelerated -- significant focused efforts to accelerate some of our clinical development, which is starting to pay dividends. You're also seeing the validation of this approach in our commercial results that Johanna highlighted and the strength across our base business. So to your point, we are now this year, I think we already have 22 Phase 3 trials underway, which is significantly more than we have as a company, historically. It's actually frankly a healthy level, I highlighted in my comments that this year we're targeting kind of low 20's percentage point of revenue for our R&D investment. And that's a reasonably good place to be. We believe it's on line with peers over the long-run, there will be years when we have expenses that are greater than that, and years lower. But over the cycle, I think that's kind of what we're targeting. So -- and then maybe to your question on operating margin, we still have a very healthy operating margin, as you know. Again, there's apples and oranges comparisons with the new IP R&D rules. But we do expect to see our operating margin strengthened again over time, as we get through this bolus of Phase 3 trials that we have underway and that drives growth above and beyond what you've already seen in the last 18 months, which we think is off to a great start. So more to come, it's going to take a little more time to get through it, to your point, but we're in a very good spot from our perspective. Jacquie Ross : Nadia, may we have our next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question goes you Salveen Richter of Goldman Sachs. Salveen please go ahead, your line is open. Unidentified Participant : Good afternoon, this is [indiscernible] on for Salveen. Thanks for taking our question just on the TIGIT combo data at ASCO. How do you view this update? Is it more incremental? And then just on the Roche OS data, which is now expected in 3Q. How much read through do you anticipate on that front? Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Yeah, thanks. What we have said and I think what we're planning is, we will have an updated dataset from a more recent cut. So there'll be additional data compared with what was presented, what we talked about last year at the ASCO plenary. And so, there should be more mature data with a larger patient population. And so that should help reinforce our confidence. In terms of the Roche data, I think it's a great question. Look, I think, we believe in our own data, as well as, all the other public data that are out there in terms of TIGIT bringing benefit certainly in terms of response rates and other parameters. Certainly, in our dataset we've seen those PFS benefit. And our expectation is that the Roche data will continue to demonstrate benefit TIGIT -- adding TIGIT to PD-1 inhibitors, so -- PD-L1 inhibitors in their case. So we will be looking forward to seeing those OS data and I think that should help to provide additional confidence to all the TIGIT antibodies out there. Jacquie Ross : Nadia, next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question goes to Geoff Meacham of Bank of America. Geoff, please go ahead, your line is open. Geoff Meacham : Great. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Merdad, you guys have been very successful commercially with Kite and it looks like the pipeline has some logical next steps in terms of liquid tumors. I guess, what I wanted to ask you is, what's your appetite for leveraging the expertise to look at non-oncology indications like rare diseases or maybe towards solid tumors? And why do you think the field is mostly evaluated at the same targets and myeloma, lymphoma, leukemia, et cetera? Thank you. Merdad Parsey : Thanks, Geoff. Very complicated question. I'll try to give a very brief answer. Look, I think that leveraging the engineered T-Cells so far in hematology has demonstrated really great efficacy and a reasonable tolerability profile for that patient population. I think it's all about therapeutic index. As you start to go into broader indications where treatment options are different and the disease state is different. I think they are different considerations for therapeutic index. So, as we look into different populations, we're going to keep a very close eye on the appropriate therapeutic index for a given patient, whether you're talking about lupus or anything else outside of oncology related to your question. From our perspective, maybe the broader perspective that I would offer is that, we do believe that modulating the immune system will lead to better outcomes in-patients, whether you're talking about agonizing or antagonizing and in hematologic disorders, we do believe that getting to better and more targeted immune blockade is going to be better for patients. And so, from our perspective there is not only to cell therapy in play and I think that's what we like about our portfolio is that, we have -- we're not modality restricted, and you've seen the deals we've done, we have our BTLA antibody and the rest of our portfolio in inflammation. So we are going to be pursuing the best outcome for patients regardless of modality and certainly, cell therapy will be one of those. Jacquie Ross : Nadia, next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question goes to Terrence Flynn of Morgan Stanley. Terrence, please go ahead, your line is open. Terence Flynn : Hi, thanks so much for taking the question. Just one from me on Yescarta. I was wondering if you can give us any more color in terms of the breakdown between second-line versus third-line right now. Obviously, you're seeing some nice momentum. And then, on the manufacturing footprint, maybe just any color there in terms of total number of patients you can supply in a year. Obviously, that's been an issue for some of the other CAR-T therapies out there, but just want to understand kind of longer-term supply dynamics. Thank you. Johanna Mercier : Sure. So let me start and then maybe Andy can touch on the manufacturing piece of the puzzle. So thanks for the question, Terrence. I think what we've seen is really strong growth across second-line and third-line, and obviously, a little slower coming into second-line, but we are seeing nice momentum in the second-line as well and I think the OS data from ZUMA-7 coming through, that will be presented at ASCO that will only help continue that and really differentiated versus current standard-of-care. And -- but what we have seen is growth that has really picked-up quite nicely and you're seeing it both in U.S., as well as, Europe and really happy to say actually although we just got recent approval for second-line in Europe late last year, we're getting a lot of markets coming in from reimbursement, accelerating reimbursement because of the importance of the data for patients, and actually one example of that is actually just today with the NICE approval for a second-line therapy with Yescarta. And so we're very excited about where this is going. There's still a lot of growth opportunity in second-line. And obviously, the team is really working diligently to make sure that physicians are well-educated to make sure that they understand the benefits and the overall survival over long-term for these patients. So more to come on that. And with that, I'll turn it over to Andy for manufacturing. Andrew Dickinson : Yeah. Thanks Johanna. And hey Terrence, nice to talk to you again. On manufacturing, what I would say is, that\u2019s a real area of competitive strength for Kite for us. As you know, we have three approved manufacturing centers globally, two in the United States, one on each coast, and then the one in the Netherlands. All of them are fully operational, we're already moving in our Maryland facility to partial automation of our manufacturing process, which is off to a great start and we just have an outstanding team. So we have not had capacity constraints, either on the manufacturing of the cells or on the viral vectors. So remember, we have both an outsourced and an internal viral vector supply, we made a vector -- our own viral vector on our Oceanside, California biologics facility. So I don't think, Terence, we've shared specifically the capacity of our manufacturing footprint, but rest assured, we have adequate capacity to serve the market today. Our team does a great job of forecasting where the market is going. We're always one or two steps ahead and we don't expect that to change. So from a manufacturing standpoint, the Kite team has just really done an outstanding job. Jacquie Ross : Nadia, may we have our next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question goes to Tim Anderson of Wolfe Research. Tim, please go ahead, your line is open. Unidentified Participant : Hi, thanks for taking my question. This is Adam on behalf of Tim. No on Biktarvy, it doesn't need exclusivity over the next decade, but it's possible, gets targeted by the IRA before done. We know that [indiscernible] accounts are limited portion of Biktarvy\u2019s volume and is it possible that the pricing impact extends to commercial patients? Also the other aspect to the IRA that you think investors are discounting beyond the negotiation. Thanks. Johanna Mercier : I'll take that one, Adam. So yes, we do believe that the IRA will have an impact on Biktarvy. Although we do believe it will be later this decade. And probably the earliest could be 2028 or so. The -- again, what you said is absolutely true. It is only on our Medicare business and, obviously, there is a lot of things that can happen between now and then. It's still early in understanding exactly how it's going to play-out, including the pricing negotiations that will happen. As to the spillover effect that you mentioned. We believe that we've had situations, obviously, in other channels today, where we have higher discounts in our commercial channels, and we've been able to manage that specific to the patient populations within those channels. And so, we believe we be able to do that again and mitigate the risk of spillover. And -- so yes, so I think that that kind of what we're managing in addition to the fact that our portfolio as much as Biktarvy is out to 2033 and that will I think really continue to be the standard-of-care for daily orals. We're also expanding our portfolio as you think about where we're going with lenacapavir here, we have different combinations in treatment and obviously with our convention work. So more to come on that, but I think we're more than prepared to manage the situation and have a couple of more years to figure out some of the different dynamics within the IRA. Jacquie Ross : May we have our next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question goes to Umer Raffat of Evercore. Umer, please go-ahead, your line is open. Umer Raffat : Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I want to touch up on Trodelvy real quick in terms of how the prescription trends are tracking in TNBC in particular, especially in light of your competitor, Daiichi, saying they now have number one patient share in HER2-low and growing. So I'm just curious how that's shaking out, because I know you've got a new indication this quarter. And secondly also, there's a lot of renewed interest in CAR-T, especially as it relates to immunology. But as I think of immunology and the price points, maybe 3 times HUMIRA, so that will be $150,000. But conversely, I would imagine each cell therapy dose would be at least $100,000. So how do you think about economics as you head into potentially immunology indications? Thank you very much. Johanna Mercier : Umer, I'll take the first part of that specific to Trodelvy and what we're seeing in TNBC and metastatic MDC. So what we've seen is actually continued growth in TNBC for Trodelvy, and really that has a lot to do with the expansion of our field stores, but also the continued data that comes through, right? The OS data in TNBC is one piece of the puzzle. The other piece is obviously the OS that we've shown also in HR-positive. So, really the breast cancer community understanding Trodelvy better in that space. We haven't split the market and neither have physicians at this point really split the market between HER2-low kind of population. So what we look at is each indication, TNBC and HR-positive/HER2-negative. And what we're seeing in metastatic TNBC in the lines of therapy that is second line plus is really Trodelvy established itself as the standard of care in this setting, and it continues to do that. So I do think, just remembering in TNBC, the split between IHC 0 and IHC 1 and 2 is 65-35. So much more represented -- so less represented by maybe some of our competitors. Having said that, we work across a spectrum, which I think is really important to remember. So that's the Trodelvy dynamics right now in metastatic TNBC. Daniel O'Day: Great, Umer. This is Dan O'Day too. I think -- I appreciate your question on the second one. I'll dovetail on to what Merdad said before about the importance of therapeutic index. But before I do that, let me just articulate the tremendous benefit that CAR-T is providing a large B-cell lymphoma from a pharmaeconomic standpoint. The fact that we now have patients in very late-stage disease, 50% of them surviving up to five years and essentially a flat line survival curve, you can imagine the benefit from both a mortality perspective and cost of the system of the current price point in large B-cell lymphoma. I think any price point in other therapeutic areas would be based upon the clinical benefit that, that brings to those particular patients. Of course, we understand that this wouldn't necessarily be a broad-scale use across all different types of patients. There will be patient segments where the therapeutic index is more important. And for those patients, we would look at the level of benefit that brings, both to the patient and to the health care system and then price it accordingly, of course. So I think it's hypothetical at this stage. But given the benefit that we're seeing in cancer, we would take the same approach to other disease states. Jacquie Ross : As we move to our next question just another reminder, please limit yourself to one question. We do have 10 folks still hoping to ask a question on the call, and we'd like to get to as many as possible. So with that Nadia, may we have our next question, please. Operator : Of course, the next question goes to Tyler Van Buren of Cowen, Tyler. Please go-ahead, your line is open. Tyler Van Buren : Great, thank you very much for taking the question. I guess given Legend's tremendous top line data leak in the second line, I figured I would ask for your latest thoughts on that opportunity and how you plan to differentiate in that setting with the Arcellx program. Andrew Dickinson : Hey, Tyler, it's Andy Dickinson. I'll take the question on behalf of the Kite team. Obviously, we and others want to see the full data set. We read the same releases that you've read. And we continue to believe that Arcellx and now Kite have a very interesting program that has the potential to be very competitive in that area to get on par or better potentially than the J&J Legend product. And as Dan said earlier, it doesn't come as a surprise to us that cell therapy is delivering that magnitude of benefit to patients across different disease areas. And it's exciting to see where cell therapy may go in terms of becoming the standard of care in second-line BCMA potentially over time, which, of course, increases the size of the potential opportunity for the Arcellx and Kite team. So look forward to seeing more on the data, look forward to carrying our program forward together with Arcellx team and to updating you over time. But certainly, it looks like a fantastic data set and great for patients. Jacquie Ross : Thanks, Nadia. Our next question, please. Operator : Our next question goes to Hartaj Singh of Oppenheimer & Co. Hartaj. Please go-ahead, your line is open. Hartaj Singh : Great, thank you. Thanks for the question. I just had a quick question on Trodelvy in non-small cell lung cancer. I know those trials are still about a year or two years from reading out. But guys, can you just remind us of the scientific rationale behind Trodelvy in non-small cell lung cancer and just to opine a little bit on just the EVOKE-01 and 03 trials? Thank you. Merdad Parsey : Sure. Hartaj. Yes, I think there are several things that we -- give us a lot of confidence in terms of moving forward in non-small cell lung cancer. Certainly, the distribution of Trop-2 has demonstrated broad expression in non-small cell lung cancer, not too dissimilar from breast cancer. And so I think that gives us a lot of incentive to believe that the expression of Trop-2 in those tumors is going to give us efficacy by delivering the payload to those cells. Secondly, we've seen both internal and external data for Trop-2 targeted ADCs that support the value of bringing Trop-2 directed antibody drug conjugate to non-small cell lung cancer. So our approach, which has been broad and we're very excited about it. I think, is going really well is we are, as you know, in EVOKE-01 going into second line non-small cell lung cancer, and that study is going very well. We are then as well looking in front-line lung cancer in our other trials and looking at combinations of PD-1s with Trodelvy in those tumors in non-small cell. And we think that the potential for Trodelvy in those tumors is very high. We believe that we'll start to see those data start to roll out from our second-line studies first, as you would imagine. And then we'll continue to build on that as we go. Jacquie Ross : Thank you. May we have our next question, please. Operator : Our next question goes you Brian Skorney of RW Baird. Brian, please go ahead, your line is open. Charlie More : All right, thanks for taking my question. This is Charlie More on for Brian. I had a question about lenacapavir. So with regards to the recent data with the BmAb, it seemed like one case out of 20 experienced a viral rebound. So I was wondering how that might inform which combinations you are thinking about moving forward with regarding overcoming resistance. And kind of along that same line, what kind of expectations do you have for the size of the long-acting market in HIV? Thank you. Merdad Parsey : Yes. Very important that, that breakthrough was not associated with lenacapavir resistance, right? And I think that's really important to keep in mind. Look, BmAbs are relatively new clinical tools to look for, options for people in terms of treating HIV. And it's one of the many approaches we're taking. Our approach has been to move a broader portfolio of small molecules to complement that early foray into long-acting with BmAbs, where we believe that the tried and true mechanisms that we have used, again, both orally or parenterally, should provide us with an opportunity to bring treatment options to people living with HIV that will be associated with low resistance rates and high efficacy. So that's what we're testing out. As we find the ideal partners, and I use the plural intentionally, we will be moving that forward. And so, I would look at those -- the BmAb data as early -- an early first approach to a long-acting treatment for people living with HIV. A - Johanna Mercier And maybe just to cover, Charlie, the second part of your question around the size of the market. So I'm going to split it out. When you think about the market from a treatment standpoint, we do believe that the long-acting market, probably by the end of this decade, will look about 50-50 or so. We think that there are definitely patients out there that are looking for us not to be reminded that they have HIV and an opportunity to think about the next-generation long-acting to really bring to patients what they're looking for. I think that's the kind of the last unmet medical need in this space at this point in time. I also think Biktarvy will continue to be the standard of care in the daily oral market, where there's still a lot of patients that actually do want to take their medicine every single day to make sure that they know that they're taking something to put at bay their HIV. Just to touch on the expansion from a PrEP standpoint, I just wanted -- the prevention market, very different in our view. And some discussions we've had with community partners and people that are at risk of HIV, what we're seeing here is probably the split is different, but the market expansion is also very different. So the split is probably going to go towards 70-30 by the end of this decade is what we assume. That has a lot to do with the fact that these are not patients, these are people at risk, and they don't necessarily want to take a pill a day for something they don't have. And so that makes a lot of sense. So something every six months aligned with physician visits could be an ideal scenario in this setting. And then from an expansion standpoint, as you all know, we've talked about this a lot. If you look at the CDC assumptions around the number of people that are at risk in the U.S., we've only kind of captured about 25% of those folks that are currently under medication. And unfortunately, there's still 75% that are not and that are at risk. And so there's an incredible opportunity, especially with something every six months, to really expand in this marketplace and make sure that we truly work together to end this epidemic. So, very exciting times to come. And within the next two years, hopefully, we'll have lenacapavir as the data reads out and approvals in prevention and then just a bit after that in treatment with different partners that Merdad was mentioning. So very exciting time. Jacquie Ross : Super. We\u2019ll move to our next question please, Nadia. Operator : Thank you. The next question goes to Steve Seedhouse of Raymond James. Steve, please go ahead, your line is open. Ryan Deschner : Hi there, this is Ryan Deschner on for Steve Seedhouse. Thanks for the question. Just curious with the current nonhospitalized versus hospitalized usage split for the Veklury. And do you anticipate a large amount of potential cannibalization in the nonhospitalized usage coming from remdesivir if its clinical development is successful? Thanks. Johanna Mercier : Thanks. So Ryan, I'll take that question. So what we have seen in the last year or so is somewhat of a lessening of the severity of infections, and therefore, from a hospitalization standpoint, obviously, less hospitalizations as well. So we've seen a couple of different things. So obviously, much more non hospitalizations of late, and we've seen that obviously in the numbers because as you well know, that Veklury tracks very closely to hospitalization. And what we've seen is, despite the fact that hospitalizations have come down versus our expectations in Q1, the actual usage of Veklury has gone up. And that's super interesting. And a lot of that has to do with the strength of the data that keeps delivering for Veklury around the updates of guidelines, the strength of our data, real-world data that's come out continuously showing reduction in mortality and reduction in readmissions to hospitalization. So very powerful data, but definitely a bit of a play there. This is -- our outpatient use with Veklury is still quite small, in the single digit or so. Having said that, it is growing. But it's really the only antiviral that is approved in hospitalized setting for COVID-19. And so that continues to drive. I think as we think about our oral COVID program, I think we are thinking more the nonhospitalized setting, which I think would then complement what we have in our portfolio that works really nicely both in the nonhospitalized setting and the hospitalized setting to make sure that patients at risk have what they need if they do get infected. Jacquie Ross : Nadia, may we have our next caller, please. Operator : Yes. The next question goes to Olivia Brayer of Cantor Fitzgerald. Olivia please go ahead, your line is open. Olivia Brayer : Hey, good afternoon and thank you for the question. Have you guys started to think through a commercial rollout strategy for magrolimab, especially when you look beyond the initial academic centers? And is there anything you can do to help drive initial adoption for -- of transfusion guidelines in that community setting specifically? Johanna Mercier : So I'll take that one, Olivia. As we think about magro, we are excited, obviously. We're waiting for the data to read out. But we are excited, and we have started thinking about our commercial model for sure. I think a couple of pieces to that one. One is the strength of the community and making sure we understand kind of what that looks like, but also the strength that Kite brings in this play as well. So we're not starting from scratch, right? We are going to -- we partner very closely with our Kite colleagues to make sure that there's a lot of learnings there that I think we can apply and a lot of overlap from a physician standpoint that also that we've been working through. So a lot of those pieces are in play. And the last piece I would say, just to add to the commercial model and our thinking, also has to do with the fact that we're also trying to get ahead of the game and better understanding, right? These are diseases that sometimes community physicians will not see on a regular basis and how do we make sure that we understand the when and where and making sure that the commercial model support that timing as well and being a little bit smarter in our approach from an execution standpoint. So, all those pieces are coming into play. But obviously, we're excited and anxious for the data. But we will be sure that we are ready for not only the data, but the approvals as well. Jacquie Ross : Naida, will try and squeeze in just a few more here. Operator : Of course, the next question goes to Colin Bristow of UBS. Colin, please go ahead, your line is open. Unidentified Participant : Hi, this is [Ting] (ph) on for Colin. Thanks for taking our question. So on magrolimab, can you specify how many interims were planned in total for the ENHANCE trial? And for the interim update in the back half of the year, will there be actual data disclosure or just a high-level update? And for -- and what's your expectation -- also, what's your expectation of the CR and overall survival for the azacitidine control arm? There were some chatters around other side of the arm outperformed Tekada's Phase III trial, where they used a more intensive dosing regimen. So what's your thought over this? Thank you. Merdad Parsey : Sure. Thanks for the question. So the -- in terms of the interim analysis, it's a good reminder that the study is powered for the final analysis. And so our expectation for any study that has interim analysis is that we run to the final analysis, which I think we've guided to occurring next year. When an interim analysis occurs, we generally will not see the data. Generally, what happens is that the DSMB will tell us to either continue or potentially discontinue. If -- obviously, we discontinue, we'd share that. But if it's just continue, we would continue the trial, and there will be nothing other than that to share because we don't have any data to share since we won't have seen it. So our expectation is that, we run to the end of the trial. It would certainly be upside if we saw something earlier than that. And then I think in terms of the expectations, you're absolutely right. I think everyone has looked at the Takeda data and are wary as to the efficacy of azacitidine in performing in that patient population. And so we're going to have to wait and see what that looks like at the end of the trial. I'm -- I guess, buttressed by the fact that we have -- the DSMB has told us to continue the trial, it gives me a little bit of more confidence that we are going to see a treatment effect. But that's a very indirect assessment. So we're going to have to see. But we are powered for -- we've made some assumptions in terms of how we power the trial. So hopefully, we'll be able to detect the difference between the two. Jacquie Ross : Nadia, may be just time for one last question please. Operator : Thank you. Our final question guys Mohit Bansal of Wells Fargo. Mohit. Please go ahead, your line is open. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thank you for taking my question. And maybe a question on BD at this point. I mean, how are you thinking about BD? I know in the past, you talked about there's no urgency there, and you could be thinking about tuck-in. But has anything changed at this point now that you're in a good position with the growth coming back? Is there an updated thought there? Andrew Dickinson : Mohit, it's Andy. Thank you for the question. Nothing's changed from our recent updates. I mean we think that BD is an important part of the puzzle for us going forward. It's important to continue to bring new and exciting innovation and products into our portfolio over time. We don't expect that to stop. That said, and to your point, we have made extraordinary progress over the last four years that we're really proud of. And so the breadth -- given the breadth and depth of our pipeline, you should expect that we will do less over the coming years than we did over the last three or four years. But we will still be active. And what we've said recently and I'd reinforce is that we will do ordinary course licensing deals. Obviously, you saw the Community and Arcellx deals last year. We've talked about the Merrell Bio deal, all of which we're very excited about. And then we expect from time to time to do small acquisitions. But our portfolio, to your point, is in a great spot. We're very excited about what that's going to do to drive growth, and we will always look for opportunities to add to it, if we can, in a thoughtful way that we think will benefit patients and our shareholders. But that's the way I would think about it at this point. Operator : Thank you. That's all the questions we have time for today. I'll now hand back to Dan for any closing comments. Daniel O'Day: Thank you so much. I just want to thank you all for joining today for your continued interest in Gilead. Look, bottom line is we've had a very strong start to the year building on the momentum from 2022. And we collectively at Gilead and Kite believe we have a very strong and firm foundation for continued growth in 2023. As usual, if we didn't get to your questions or you have additional follow-up questions, please reach out to Jacquie and the IR team, and we'd be more than happy to support you. Thank you very much for joining. Operator : Thank you. This now concludes today's call. Thank you so much for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, everyone. Thank you for attending Gilead Sciences' Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sarah and I'll be your moderator today. All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call with an opportunity for questions and answers at the end. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Jacquie Ross, VP of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jacquie Ross : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the second quarter of 2023. The press release, slides, and supplementary data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open the call to Q&A, where the team will be joined by Cindy Perettie, the Executive Vice President of Kite. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including those related to Gilead's business, financial condition, and results of operations, plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations, financial projections and the use of capital, and 2023 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the Company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, in our supplemental data sheet, as well as on the Gilead website. With that I'll turn the call over to Dan. Daniel O'Day: Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. As always, we appreciate you taking the time to catch up with Gilead in the midst of a busy earnings period. This was another very strong quarter for Gilead in terms of both business performance and clinical execution. Thank you to the Gilead teams that drove this progress with their dedication to improving the health of individuals and communities worldwide. Total product sales excluding Veklury grew 11% year-over-year and closed a very strong first half performance in the base business. As we look to the full year, we are increasing guidance for total product sales. We now expect even stronger growth in our base business of 6.5% to 8%, which is expected to more than offset our revised expectations for Veklury. As a result, our guidance for base business product sales has increased $550 million at the mid-point. In the second quarter, HIV contributed about two-thirds of the $615 million growth in our core business, growing 9% year-over-year. Oncology grew 38% year-over-year, and with product sales of $728 million in the second quarter, now has an annual run rate of approximately $3 billion. Moving to clinical progress, the second quarter was very active on the regulatory front, with approvals, positive opinions or recommendations for six of our therapies Trodelvy, Yescarta, Tecartus, Sunlenca, Hepcludex, and Veklury. This regulatory progress highlights the strength of our increasingly diverse portfolio. It also reflects the ability of our teams to successfully navigate regulatory processes across the therapeutic areas and key geographies with speed and efficiency. In addition to this progress, we shared positive pipeline updates at ASCO, which included overall survival data for Yescarta, the only large B-cell lymphoma cell therapy to demonstrate significant overall survival benefit versus standard of care in the second-line setting, promising Trodelvy data in endometrial cancer, reinforcing our belief in Trodelvy as a cornerstone asset with pan-tumor potential, an updated TIGIT data from the full study population of ARC-7, establishing domvanalimab's proof-of-concept in lung cancer. We have also shared long-term data for Hepcludex for hepatitis delta virus showing improved response rates at Week-96 compared to Week-48. These data support new guidelines recommending Hepcludex for people living with chronic HDV in the EU. With a broad portfolio of novel mechanisms and a commitment to pursuing areas of high unmet need, we know that some pipeline setbacks are to be expected. As we announced last month, we have discontinued the Phase 3 ENHANCE study in Higher-Risk MDS due to futility and a second interim analysis. As you know, MDS is one of the most intractable forms of blood cancer and we are disappointed that the study was not able to deliver new hope for patients with the disease. We will take a thorough data-driven approach regarding next steps as we carry out the ongoing analysis of magrolimab. Overall, we were executing well on our clinical commitments and our current performance speaks to the strength of our combined oncology portfolio. We have a rich pipeline of activity in the second half, including an initial look at a subset of EVOKE-02 data on Trodelvy plus pembro in first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Before, I hand over to Johanna, I'd like to welcome Cindy Perettie, our Head of Cell Therapy to her first Gilead earnings conference call. Cindy has now been with Gilead for two months and brings a wealth of oncology and leadership experience from Roche, Foundation Medicine, and the Sarah Cannon Research Institute. We're delighted to have Cindy join our Gilead leadership team and it's great to have her with us on the call today. With that, I'll hand the call over to Johanna for a discussion of our commercial results. Johanna? Johanna Mercier : Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. The second quarter was another strong quarter for Gilead with solid performance across our commercial portfolio, leading to an increase in our full year expectations for both the base and overall business. For the second quarter of 2023, as shown on slide seven, total product sales excluding Veklury grew 11% year-over-year to $6.3 billion with year-over-year growth in each of our core franchises. This represents the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for our base business, reinforcing the strength of our Virology and Oncology portfolios. The strong growth more than offset the decline in Veklury sales, which were as expected given the lower hospitalizations. Altogether, total product sales including Veklury was $6.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Starting with HIV on slide eight. Second quarter sales of $4.6 billion were up 9% year-over-year, driven by higher average realized price in part due to channel mix and higher demand, partially offset by lower channel inventory. Quarter-over-quarter, sales were up 10%, driven by favorable pricing and inventory build following the typical first quarter dynamics. Overall, the global HIV treatment market continues to grow in line with our expectations of 2% to 3% annually. Specifically in the US, the market overall grew more than 2% in the first half of the year compared to the first half of 2022, reflecting growth in the non-retail channels more than offsetting a roughly flat retail market. HIV product sales grew 11% in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022, helped by favorable pricing dynamics, including the phasing of certain government purchases and channel mix. Looking forward, we expect HIV product sales growth to more closely mirror market growth in the second half. Therefore, we are increasing our full year expectations for HIV and now expect full year HIV product growth for 2023 to be modestly higher than the 5% we reported in 2022. Turning to slide nine. Biktarvy sales of $3 billion were up 17% year-over-year, driven by higher demand and favorable pricing dynamics, partially offset by lower channel inventory. With a market share up almost 3% year-over-year in the US, Biktarvy remains the treatment of choice for HIV with more than 46% market share. This represents the 20th consecutive quarter of share gains in the US, with the year-over-year growth rate that has once again outpaced new and existing regimens. Similarly, we continue to see solid share gains across other major markets as Biktarvy maintains its leading position for new starts as well as for those switching therapies. Descovy sales were $516 million, up 12% year-over-year. With awareness and utilization of HIV prevention higher than ever, the US market grew once again. And amidst this growth, we're pleased to see strong demand for Descovy for PrEP, up 14% year-over-year in the US, with a strong market share that has remained over 40%. With this strong foundation, we look forward to potentially adding lenacapavir as a six-monthly subcutaneous option for prevention as early as 2025. Moving to the liver disease portfolio on Slide 10, sales were up 4% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter to $711 million. We remain committed to eliminating HCV globally with our market-leading portfolio of medicines and our efforts to increase awareness contributed to higher patient starts in the US, Europe, and Asia in the second quarter. HBV and HDV also contributed to growth in the liver disease portfolio, driven by higher demand. Liver disease remains an important part of our portfolio, benefiting hundreds of thousands of patients. We're pleased to have received full marketing authorization for Hepcludex in HDV in Europe, a further recognition of the benefit this medicine brings to patients who have very limited therapeutic options. Across our portfolio of HCV, HBV, and HDV products, the liver disease contribution to our commercial performance continues to stabilize overall to a run rate of more than $2.5 billion in sales a year. On to slide 11. Veklury sales declined in the second quarter as expected, reflecting lower hospitalization rates, with sales of $256 million, down 43% year-over-year. For those patients hospitalized and treated for COVID-19, a majority continued to receive Veklury, a testament to Veklury's robust clinical profile. Most recently, this has included decisions by the US-FDA and the European Commission to expand Veklury's indication to reach patients with renal impairment including those on dialysis. Moving to Oncology on slide 12, it is remarkable to observe that in less than five years, our oncology business has grown from less than $300 million and is now approaching an annualized run rate of $3 billion, with tens of thousands of patients treated with Gilead and Kite oncology therapies to date. Beyond our well-established leadership in cell therapy, we have the only TROP2-directed ADC on the market with Trodelvy, and combined, our oncology portfolio extends the options for patients in eight indications. Looking in more detail at Trodelvy on slide 13, sales were up 63% year-over-year and 17% sequentially to $260 million, representing an annual run rate that exceeds $1 billion. We continue to be very pleased with the launch in pre-treated HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer, with strong awareness of our approval in US. We look forward to reaching even more patients in Europe following last week's marketing authorization from the European Commission. Additionally, we're beginning discussions with health authorities in Japan, with plans to file for approval in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer later this year. With a strong field force in place and robust datasets across multiple tumor types, Trodelvy remains well-positioned to maintain and expand its reach, and Gilead continues to build on our experience in breast and bladder cancers with a view to other indications over time, as the development program evolves. Turning to Cell Therapy on slide 14, sales in the second quarter were $469 million, up 27% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter. Yescarta showed continued growth with sales up 29% year-over-year to $380 million, primarily driven by strong underlying demand in the second and third-line settings for relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma, both in existing, as well as new markets. Tecartus sales were $88 million, up 21% year-over-year, reflecting increased demand for relapsed or refractory adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia, as well as mantle cell lymphoma, primarily outside the US. We are excited about the opportunity ahead as the body of evidence supporting broader adoption of cell therapies continues to grow. The work that Kite has been leading to raise awareness in the adoption of cell therapy will be accelerated by other providers as they ramp up their manufacturing capabilities. This overall expansion in supply will predictably impact our market share in the near term, but overall class share is the most important driver of our business over time. As cell therapy is offered and delivered to more patients, we are confident that Kite cell therapies will remain differentiated in terms of our manufacturing reliability and efficacy. Wrapping up the second quarter, I'd like to acknowledge the commercial teams and our partners across Gilead and Kite that once again delivered an extremely strong performance, reflecting both solid execution and a compelling portfolio of Gilead products that positively impacts millions of people around the world. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad for an update on our pipeline. Merdad? Merdad Parsey : Thank you, Joanna. I'm pleased to highlight the ongoing progress our teams have made with 64 ongoing clinical programs and 21 Phase 3 trails. Notably, we presented multiple positive data readouts at medical conferences in the second quarter, such as updated overall survival data for Trodelvy in pre-treated HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer, OS data for Yescarta in second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma, and long-term data from blabber tied in HDV. As we move into the second half of 2023, we remain focused on execution, investing in capabilities to increase our productivity and portfolio prioritization. We also look-forward to sharing an update on Trodelvy in non-small cell lung cancer, including EVOKE-02 data at World Conference on Lung Cancer in September. Turning first to Virology on slide 16, we are proud of the role Gilead has played in transforming HIV care. We continue to innovate based on our commitment to both the HIV community and to those who could benefit from prevention regimen with our ongoing work to do over new effective and convenient options. The unique profile of lenacapavir, our first-in class capsid inhibitor enables the eight prevention and treatment clinical programs, we're focused on. In HIV treatment the ARTISTRY-1 trial evaluating oral once daily bictegravir and lenacapavir your combination regimen. It's progressing well. We expect to provide an update on the Phase 2 portion of the study later this year. This novel regimen aims to provide an effective and simpler regimen for the 6% to 8% a biologically suppressed individuals who are currently on complex multi tablet regimens to manage their HIV. We continue to advance in our goal of providing longer-acting HIV treatment options through the development of lenacapavir combination regimens with integrase inhibitors, NRTIs and NNRTI as well as the Phase 2 study of our two broadly neutralizing antibodies. In HIV prevention, recruitment for our Phase 3 PURPOSE-1/-2 clinical trials evaluating every six months single-agent subcutaneous lenacapavir continues to exceed our expectations in the second quarter. We look-forward to potentially providing a data update in late 2024, to early 2025 timeframe as we target approval in late 2025. Moving on to slide 17, I'm pleased to note that the European Association for the Study of the Liver or EASL has updated its HDV guidelines to recommend that all patients in the EU with chronic HDV infection, should be considered for antiviral treatments. Recently Hepcludex was granted full approval by the European commission remains the only approved therapy for chronic HCV infection in the EU. The updated guidelines were supported by Hepcludex 's 48-week data which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in June. Gilead also presented data demonstrating the 96-week treatment with bulevirtide improved biologic and biochemical responses with no evidence of treatment-emergent resistance, including those who were previously non or partial responders. These data reinforce our confidence in bulevirtide and its potentially longer-term benefit for patients with HDV. As a reminder, bulevirtide is not yet approved in the US. Turning to Oncology on slide 18. Trodelvy remains the first and only approved TROP2-directed ADC with indications across three tumor types. It's also the only TROP2-directed ADC to show overall survival benefit versus chemotherapy in two tumor types. We've now treated over 20,000 patients and evaluate more than 2300 patients in our clinical trials. Trodelvy's robust dataset informs a well-characterized safety profile with low discontinuation rates observed across multiple indications and no required increasing monitoring for severe interstitial lung disease. At ASCO, we presented additional data demonstrating Trodelvy's potential, including in pre-treated HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. We presented the final analysis from our Phase 3 TROPiCS-02 trial supporting the marketing authorization we just received from the European Commission last week. In bladder cancer, we shared an analysis of TROPHY-U-01 supporting Trodelvy's efficacy in post-platinum post-IO metastatic urothelial cancer across a range of TROP-2 expression. With our accelerated approval in bladder cancer, we hope to provide a data update from the ongoing confirmatory Phase 3 TROPiCS-04 trail and initiate global filings for Trodelvy in metastatic urothelial cancer by the end of next year. In heavily pre-treated endometrial cancer, we presented promising efficacy data from our Phase 2 TROPiCS-03 Basket trial, demonstrating the expanding pan-tumor potential of Trodelvy. Moving to slide 19, our comprehensive clinical development program in non-small cell lung cancer includes several signal-seeking and ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials. We know non-small cell lung cancer is not only an area of significant unmet need, as the number-one cause of cancer-related death, but also an area we believe Trodelvy has the potential to transform standard-of-care as a combination partner to an IO backbone in the first-line setting, as well as a single-agent in the post-IO setting. On slide 20, we highlight the growing number of lung-related catalysts. I'm particularly excited to highlight that we've added a new milestone with a preliminary readout from our Phase 2 EVOKE-02 trial at the World Conference on Lung Cancer. This study is evaluating Trodelvy plus pembrolizumab, with or without chemo in first-line non-small cell lung cancer. We will be sharing data from the first two cohorts evaluating Trodelvy in combination with pembro in PD-L1 high and PD-L1 low patients. The abstract, expected to be released later in August, will be an initial subset of a small number of patients. Our presentation scheduled for Sunday, September 10th at World Lung will include data at a later cut-off date with more patients. Turning to domvanalimab, or dom, on slide 21, we presented data from the last interim analysis of the full 150 patients enrolled in the Phase 2 ARC-7 study at ASCO in June. The data continued to show consistent and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival in first-line PD-L1 high non-small cell lung cancer, when dom, our Fc-silent anti-TIGIT is combined with an investigational anti-PD1 agent as compared to the PD1 inhibitor alone. These data form the basis for our dom program encompassing Phase 3 trials in first-line non-small cell lung cancer and upper GI cancers. Moving to cell therapy on slide 22. Yescarta continues to strengthen its position as a cell therapy of choice for large B-cell lymphoma. At ASCO in June, we presented overall survival data from the landmark Phase 3 ZUMA-7 trial of Yescarta in second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma. At a median follow-up of four years, a one-time treatment with Yescarta demonstrated a statistically significant longer overall survival compared to standard-of-care with a 27% reduction in risk of death, representing a 38% relative improvement. Moreover, the majority of the patients in the standard-of-care arm eventually received a cell therapy off protocol. And of those, 77% received Yescarta. Overall, Yescarta is the first treatment in nearly 30 years to demonstrate a significant improvement in survival for this patient population, and these data add to the growing body of evidence that position cell therapy as potentially curative in some populations. With a strong pipeline of six ongoing Phase 2 and 3 trials across lines of therapy, new tumor types, and earlier-stage assets, Kite continues to innovate and execute on expanding the potential benefit of cell therapies to new patients, both through internal or acquired innovation and through collaborations. We are working closely with one of these partners, Arcellx, to support their efforts regarding the IMAGINE-1 clinical hold. We remain confident in the therapeutic profile for CAR-T ddBCMA and IMAGINE-1 trial based on the data demonstrated to date, and sharing Arcellx's commitment to delivering this novel therapy to multiple myeloma patients. Turning to slide 23, we highlight our progress against key clinical milestones for 2023 so far. We are of course disappointed by the outcome of the interim analysis of the ENHANCE trial evaluating magrolimab in higher-risk MDS, given the need for treatment options. We will continue to monitor and report on the other magrolimab trials. Importantly, while not every trial will be positive, our efforts at building a well-diversified portfolio gives us multiple opportunities to improve the lives of patients. We're excited about our momentum in making oncology and inflammation important contributors to our future and continue to make strong progress on delivering our key clinical catalysts for this year. Beyond our near-term milestones, I'd also like to highlight our growing pipeline of early-stage inflammation assets, including our oral alpha 4 beta 7 and the progression of our IRAK4 inhibitor that had asserted into Phase 2, as well as the advancement of the BTLA agonist program from the MiroBio acquisition into Phase 1. We are excited by this differentiated inflammation pipeline and the potential to impact important gaps in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Overall, we believe we have a very ambitious clinical portfolio that is well-diversified across indications and stage. We look forward to updating you as we progress through 2023. With that I'll hand the call over to Andy. Andy? Andrew Dickinson : Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to slide 25 and as you heard from Dan and Joanna, our base business continued to perform very well in the second quarter, with total product sales excluding Veklury up 11% year-over-year, driven by growth across all of our product families. FX was still a headwind, albeit more modest, impacting growth by approximately one percentage point. Total product sales were $6.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year, as strong execution in our base business more than offset the lower Veklury sales, as well as FX impact of $82 million. Moving to the rest of the P&L, on a non-GAAP basis, on slide 26. Product gross margin was 86.9%, up 131 basis points from last year. R&D was $1.4 billion, up 25% year-over-year, due to higher expenses associated with our broad clinical pipeline, including the acceleration of certain late-stage clinical studies. As a reminder, we have 21 ongoing Phase 3 trials, highlighting the investments we continue to make in Gilead's near and long-term growth profile. As mentioned earlier this year, we will continue to manage expenses carefully. And in R&D, with a number of significant mid to late-stage trials ongoing, we'll continue to follow the science, pivoting investment if and when the data warrants. Acquired IPR&D was $236 million, reflecting the XinThera acquisition and expansion of the Arcus collaboration into inflammation, in addition to milestone payments associated with ongoing partnerships. SG&A was $1.8 billion, up 45% year-over-year, including a $525 million legal accrual for settlements with certain plaintiffs in the HIV antitrust litigation as well as increased commercial activities in oncology and HIV. Excluding the legal settlement accrual, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $1.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Moving to tax. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 21%. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.34 in the second quarter of 2023, including approximately $0.32 of expense associated with the legal settlement accrual, partially offset by higher product sales. This compared to $1.58 of earnings for the same period last year. Overall, we had a very strong first half. And as highlighted on slide 27, with solid performance in each of our core franchises across virology and oncology, driving 13% year-over-year growth excluding Veklury. Given these strong first half results, we have updated our full year sales guidance. Moving to slide 28, we now expect total product sales in the range of $26.3 billion to $26.7 billion, up from $26 billion to $26.5 billion previously. We expect total product sales excluding Veklury in the range of $24.6 billion to $25 billion, up from $24 billion to $24.5 billion previously. This new range represents growth of 6.5% to 8% for our base business year-over-year, compared to 4% to 6% previously. On Veklury, the second quarter and first half were below our internal expectations. Based on COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations to date, we have lowered our guidance for the full year to approximately $1.7 billion to bring second half expectations more in line with our first half experience. As a reminder, Veklury is highly correlated with COVID-related hospitalizations and as such, it's utilization remains variable. We will share another update with you on our third quarter call. Moving to the rest of the P&L. We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 86%. There is also no change to our non-GAAP R&D guidance, where we expect expenses to increase by a low-double-digit percent compared to 2022. Reflecting the one-time legal settlement accrual of $525 million in the second quarter, we now expect non-GAAP SG&A expense to increase a high-single-digit percent compared to 2022. Excluding this legal settlement accrual, non-GAAP SG&A expense for 2023 is expected to be down low-single-digit percentage compared to 2022, consistent with our prior guidance. Non-GAAP acquired IPR&D has been updated to reflect the XinThera acquisition and expanded Arcus collaboration, adding about $200 million or $0.17 per share. For 2023, we now expect acquired IPR&D to be approximately $900 million, reflecting previously committed acquired IPR&D amounts, as well as known milestone payments from existing collaborations. Similar to prior quarters, we will continue to include expected acquired IPR&D expenses if we announce additional transactions over the course of the year. We now expect non-GAAP operating income in the range of $10.4 billion to $10.9 billion, or roughly $650 million lower at the mid-point, due to the $525 million one-time legal settlement accrual and $200 million in additional acquired IPR&D expense, neither of which were reflected in our previous full year guidance. Moving to tax. We now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 17%, reflecting an expected decrease in our tax reserves for the second half of the year. Altogether, we now expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $6.45 and $6.80 per share, down from $6.60 and $7 previously as shown on slide 29. The chart illustrates the underlying strength of our business with the higher product sales guidance flowing through to the bottom-line, in addition to lower expected tax rate. This is however offset by both acquired IPR&D at $0.17 per share and the legal settlement accrual of $0.32 per share in nonrecurring cost. On a GAAP basis, we expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.50 and $4.85. Moving to slide 30, you can see that there is no change to our capital allocation priorities. We returned $1.1 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through our dividend and repurchase of shares. We believe we have built a strong pipeline that will enable Gilead to deliver near and long-term growth. And of course, we'll continue to remain opportunistic as we look to access high-quality assets through partnerships or make smaller acquisitions in the normal course of business. We remain committed to growing our dividend and to using share repurchases, primarily to offset equity dilution. Although, we will also be opportunistic from time to time. With that, I'll invite the operator to open the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Please proceed. Geoff Meacham : Guys thanks so much for the question. Just maybe a quick one for Dan or for Andy, you guys have had an aspiration to have about a third of total revenue from hematology, oncology. I wasn't sure how big of a role magrolimab played in those assumptions. And if it was a small amount, where do you see opportunities in the pipeline that you think the street perhaps is underappreciating? Thank you very much. Daniel O'Day: Hey Geoff, I'll start and then turn it over to Andy, but thank you very much for the question. I want to be clear that we continue to be on track to meet our goal of oncology representing one-third of our 2030 revenues and that's on top of a growing HIV business overall. I'll just remind the team here that our portfolio is very broad. It's more than doubled since a few years ago in quantity and many-fold on a quality risk-adjusted basis as well. We have novel mechanisms and technologies and approaches across many indications precisely to allow for the fact that not every clinical card is going to turn over favorably. And Andy why don't -- I'll let you add on to that, in terms of what we -- what our initial assumptions were around a third. Andrew Dickinson : Sir, Hi Geoff, good to hear from you, and thank you for the question. You may recall that historically we've talked about this, we've highlighted that, that assumption is really tied to the cell therapy business and to Trodelvy and that we have a complete belief that we're going to get there based on those two franchises alone. Magrolimab and TIGIT and the rest of the oncology pipeline provide additional upside. So just reiterating what Dan said, we continue to be on track to meet the goal of our oncology business representing a third of our total revenue by 2030 and we remain excited about the breadth of our oncology portfolio and the exceptional progress that you see in cell therapy, and Trodelvy, which combined, as you heard in the prepared remarks, are on track to produce $3 billion of revenue roughly this year. Jacquie Ross : Yes. May we have our next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Chris Schott : On Trodelvy and the EVOKE-02 data, can you just help set some expectations for the profile that we'll see from that at World Lung? I guess specifically, would just be interested in your thoughts on what we should anticipate in terms of the ILD profile in this setting, as well as your thoughts on a potential TROP-2 expression biomarker-driven approach that your competitor has alluded to post their data. Thanks so much. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Chris. Over to Merdad, please. Merdad Parsey : Yes. We are looking forward to sharing those data. And as you can imagine, we're under embargo, so I can't share too many details until the presentation comes out and the abstract itself will come out I think in mid-August, so very shortly and that initial abstract will represent a relatively small dataset from EVOKE-02 and then there'll be more data at the time of the presentation in mid-September, so in terms of what's coming. In terms of ILD, across our programs, including all the clinical trials, we have not seen ILD to-date. We don't screen for ILD in our clinical trials, nor in the clinical practice. So, at this time, we have not seen anything from -- in an ILD standpoint. And then in terms of TROP-2 expression, as a matter of course, we are measuring TROP-2 expression in -- in all of our trials as we go forward and looking to see if we see correlations between TROP-2 expression and efficacy, and to date, we've not seen a correlation. We've seen great efficacy across TROP-2 expression levels in the tumors that we've studied today. Now that may change with different tumor types. But to date, we have not seen a correlation with TROP-2 expression on those. So, we're optimistic for that and keep to continue. I would not expect to see TROP-2 data in this upcoming dataset. It's -- this is an early dataset and those data usually trail -- the Trop-02 expression data usually trail the clinical trials. Jacquie Ross : Thank you. May we have our next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from Tyler Van Buren with TD Cowen. Please proceed. Tyler Van Buren : Hey guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Another one on Trodelvy, it looks like we're seeing a bit of a quarter-over-quarter inflection. So, would you say this is attributed primarily to the HR+/HER2- launch? And do you believe this is the beginning of a new sustainable trend? Daniel O'Day: Great, Tyler. Yes, over to Johanna, please. Johanna Mercier : Hi, Tyler. Yes, we are very pleased with the results and the early signs that we've seen from the recent launch of HR+/HER2- in the US. We've definitely seen as you say, an inflection point, so we've seen a really strong uptake in this setting. We're also kind of building on the foundation of triple-negative breast cancer where we are the standard-of-care here as well, and we're excited about the fact that Europe and the EC just gave approval for HR+/HER2- in Europe. So, building on the success of TNBC and we've seen strong uptake in Europe for TNBC. So, there's also a piece of that for the Trodelvy business performance. And we're excited to see what we can do with HR+/HER2- in Europe as well. So, we do think this is definitely on the right path from a growth standpoint and very exciting times for Trodelvy and breast cancer patients. Jacquie Ross : Thank you, Tyler. May we have our next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from Terrence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Terrence Flynn : Hi, thanks so much for taking the question. This one's for Johanna. I read that there is -- CMS could propose to have Medicare cover prep. Just wondering if you have any insight on the likelihood here and timing and then could you help us think about the size of that population? Thank you. Johanna Mercier : Yes, so thanks for the question. I think you're referring to the National Coverage Determination, the NCD, right, preparation for prep? Jacquie Ross : Yes. Johanna Mercier : I'm assuming. And that's really just because the -- right now it currently only supports oral drugs and there is an opportunity for us to add injectable drugs and I think that was a we request to CMS and so we're very supportive of course and we believe the path is actually quite central to ending HIV epidemic and fully put -- fully support the CMS proposal. As from a timing standpoint, that probably hopefully in the coming quarters that we should see something come out, but I don't have details on that, but I do think it can only help what we're trying to do in HIV prevention, let alone support as we think of launching the potential launch for lenacapavir here in 2025. Jacquie Ross : Thank you. May we have our next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist. Please proceed. Bill Jahangiri : Hi, this is Bill Jahangiri on for Robyn. Thanks for taking our question, and congrats on all the progress. I had a question about TIGIT, and since you began the ARC studies, have you learned anything by way of expression of TIGIT CD155 or any other potential prognostic biomarkers in the tumor microenvironment, that would warrant further development of dom in the upper GI indications, even if SKY1 would fail? Daniel O'Day: Thanks for the question. As I understand it, I think the question is around predictors of response as it relates to the upper GI setting. What I would say is, we of course are following biomarkers. As I mentioned, with TROP2, we are looking for biomarkers of responsiveness to various markers that could predict TIGIT responsiveness. Our interest in the upper GI is of course based on TIGIT expression levels in tumor samples and things like that outside of the clinical trials, but more based on clinical data that we -- that we've seen and others have seen for the efficacy of TIGIT in upper GI tumors. And so we'll of course across the programs be looking for any potential markers for predictive response. Jacquie Ross : And may we have our next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Brian Abrahams : Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. Maybe a question on magrolimab. Do you have any preliminary thoughts on why the trial in high-risk MDS was not successful, just given the encouraging early data and I guess what indications are you most optimistic, the drug could still be successful in going forward? Thanks. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Brian. Well, I mean I think you can imagine, we are looking thoroughly at the data and the trigger for this was a futility analysis centered on overall survival. We will of course update as we generate data and look at all those, we'll make those -- that information publicly available. To your point, the -- we're fairly far along in our AML trials. And as you know, we have some studies going on in solid tumors, and we believe that there are a number of factors that could determine success or failure in these various settings and each of these settings is represented slightly in different biological experiments. So we are going to continue to look broadly at what -- what we've learned from the initial data. We're going to continue to talk with the regulators and the IRBs in the near term and then we'll update you as we proceed down that path with where we're going to go, but we continue our efforts right now, hoping that magrolimab could have an effect in other diseases outside of MDS. MDS is a uniquely challenging indication and we feel -- we were hoping we could bring a benefit to those patients and we're disappointed that we can't do that. Jacquie Ross : May we have our next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Please proceed. Carter Gould : Great. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. As you talked about sort of the hematology portfolio, one thing you guys didn't talk on much today is sort of the ddBCMA and it being a clinical hold, your partner has talked about investigator conduct and bridging therapy being issues, are you sort of in agreement with that characterization and to what extent your sort of timely addressing of the clinical hold, critical to your underlying thesis behind the product? Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Carter. This gives us a chance for all a chance to hear from Cindy for the first time with Gilead. Cindy, over to you, please. Cindy Perettie : Thanks a lot, Carter, for the question. I think, first, it might be helpful if I can provide a little context associated with the clinical hold. On June 16th, the FDA did notify Arcellx that it was placing the CAR-T ddBCMA IND on clinical hold. That was following a patient death. The patient was treated with the ddBCMA our CAR-T and despite becoming ineligible for treatment under the trial protocol, due to the fact that they developed a secondary malignancy before the time of infusion, so they would have not been allowed technically to be on protocol. After infusing that patient, they subsequently mismanaged I would say the manner in which the protocol specified treatment of adverse events. And so we are continuing to partner with Arcellx on this. We are very confident in the molecule. We're confident in the IMAGINE-1 study design and we're looking at ways in which we can partner with Arcellx to enhance protocol adherence. All of the clinical sites to date have been retrained, so that we can again ensure that protocol adherence. And additionally, the FDA has allowed Arcellx to dose patients who had gone through lymphodepletion while on clinical hold. So again, we remain confident that the therapeutic profile of ddBCMA CAR-T and the IMAGINE-1 trial is going to be successful I think based on the data demonstrated to date. So, our commitment in delivering that therapy to patients globally is still there for multiple myeloma. Jacquie Ross : Thank you. Tia, may we have our next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. [Technical difficulty] Jacquie Ross : Salveen, we're not -- we're not hearing you very well. Maybe just try one more time. Salveen, maybe you can try and dial in on a different line. Salveen, you still there? Matthew Dellatorre : Hey guys, can you hear me? This is Matt on for Salveen. Jacquie Ross : Yes, we can hear you perfectly. Matthew Dellatorre : Okay, great. So Daiichi is expected to share full data from the Phase 3 TROPION-Lung01 study later this year. Could you guys just share what you're focused on from a competitive standpoint? And then in terms of read-through to Trodelvy? Thank you. Merdad Parsey : Sure. This is Merdad. Thanks for the question. So, as you know, our program is relatively broad and pushing forward in lung cancer as well. As I mentioned earlier, we'll be presenting our frontline data in EVOKE-02 -- preliminary frontline data from the EVOKE-02 study. And I think that will help provide everyone sort of benchmarking in terms of how Trodelvy is doing in that setting. And then what we'll be looking for I think is consistent with what our belief is for Trodelvy in the second line, which is that patients in second-line are sicker, they tend to have -- they are more difficult to manage and they are more challenging in terms of outcomes, so we are hopeful that we will see a benefit in those patients in terms of outcomes, particularly PFS and OS. So we will keep ourselves -- keep you updated on the progress of the EVOKE-01 study in the second-line as well. And we're pretty confident that we'll be in where we want to be. Our underlying hypothesis remains that we will have comparable efficacy and that we will have a better tolerability profile with Trodelvy. So, we're very confident with where we're headed. Jacquie Ross : Thank you, Tia, may we have our next question, please? Operator : The next question comes from Colin Bristow with UBS. Please proceed. Colin Bristow : Hey, good afternoon, and congrats on the quarter. So the [indiscernible] trial is expected to read out in the near-term. I'm just curious on to get your thoughts really on how you view this from a sort of competitive threat standpoint? Thank you. Jacquie Ross : I think you may just have answered that question. Johanna Mercier : So, maybe I'll pick it up. So thanks for the question, Colin. We are -- we have been expecting that data. We're off to -- very pleased with what we've seen thus far with Trodelvy and I think that's the piece that's important here. I think Trodelvy's positioning in the marketplace both in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and second-line as the standard-of-care in that setting is very well established with an opportunity to continue to make sure people move up the lines of therapy because they still use it in the third and fourth line setting when there is still an opportunity to displace chemotherapies. I think as we've seen with other ADCs in the breast cancer market, I think it does -- it's really healthy awareness of the benefits of ADCs. And with Trodelvy, is overall survival, both in triple-negative breast cancer as well as in HR+/HER2-, I do think it sets up Trodelvy incredibly well and we've seen also ADC sequencing either from in HER2 to Trodelvy or Trodelvy to in HER2. I think as a third ADC comes to market, I think it might be a little bit more challenging in light of some of the positioning that's already there, but I do think for patients, this is a great thing. I also think the safety profile that Merdad mentioned just a little bit earlier, is also something to consider when you think about a safety profile with Trodelvy where you're looking at neutropenia and diarrhea, which are very much in line with other chemotherapies already on the market marketplace, so the physicians are very confident in how to treat versus bringing in something like ILD is going to be a little bit more concerning. So, more to come and I guess we'll wait to see the data, but today, in the field today, I think Trodelvy is definitely making a difference for the patients. Merdad, did you want to add anything? Merdad Parsey : No. You hit it all. Colin Bristow : Thank you, Johanna. Jacquie Ross : Tia, may we have our next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed. Evan Seigerman : Hi, all. Thank you so much for taking my question. With I believe it's the third anniversary of the Immunomedics deal nearing us, can you walk us through how you look look-forward to BD, you've digested at that, but are you looking at oncology, inflammation elsewhere? Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Yes, Andy, do you want to start with it? Andrew Dickinson : Sure. Hi, Evan, thank you for the question. Look, I'd say, we continue to be very active in BD as you'd expect, across both Gilead and Kite. And that's across all of our areas of focus. So, again, oncology, inflammation, and virology. As we've said before, there are fewer virology opportunities externally. We have an incredibly robust pipeline and extraordinary research group. We're building out our research groups at Kite and at Gilead in oncology and inflammation. We're excited about the progress that we're making there. We're still going to be active in the outside. That being said, what you should expect over the next five years is different than what you saw over the last five years. So, using Immunomedics as an example, that's a deal that we continue to be very excited about. You've heard all the excitement about Trodelvy and where we are today with the franchise, where we see it going. But that was a unique point in time where we really needed an anchor molecule to build our oncology business around. We will continue to look at commercial assets, but you should expect consistent with what you saw last year, that our focus is predominantly on ordinary course partnerships and smaller acquisitions. Again, we will be opportunistic, we will look for ways to build our franchise and to create value for shareholders, but that's the base-case expectation. Jacquie Ross : Thank you. May we have our next question, Tia? Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Catanzaro with Piper Sandler. Please proceed. Joseph Catanzaro : Hi, everybody. Thanks so much for taking my question. I actually had a question on the XinThera acquisition and just wondering if you could share your thoughts around the plans and timelines for their PARP-1 selective inhibitor and whether in the future, there is opportunity to potentially combine it with Trodelvy given some preclinical data that supports that approach? Thanks. Daniel O'Day: Yes, that's -- I think you hit the nail on the head. We are moving forward aggressively, not sure we've disclosed the timelines yet, but we're moving forward aggressively with our efforts to move that program into the clinic and as you say, I think a key potential for the -- that PARP inhibitor is in combination with Trodelvy and -- and combining those two agents to hopefully bring better outcomes to patients. So, we will update as we go along. I think things are things are progressing very nicely there. Jacquie Ross : Tia, next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thank you very much for taking my question and welcome and congrats, Cindy on your new role. Maybe if I can ask a question to Andy, regarding -- so you have clinical trials going on in oncology especially, how should we think about the operating margin evolution from here? If I take-out the one-time items as well as IPR&D, it seems like about 45% in the first half of the year, is that a good -- good number, good proxy to go with or how should we think about it in the next few years? Andrew Dickinson : Hi, Mohit, thanks. Thanks for the question. This is an important -- an important point. What we said and we continue to believe is, we have an exceptionally strong business with a lot of leverage, a highly efficient structure, a lot of leverage in our model. We've historically had industry-leading operating margins and we certainly expect to have that in the future. We also have said and acknowledged that we're in a unique point in time as we've built-out both our R&D portfolio and our sales and marketing team with the move into oncology, where our expenses have increased in the short-run and we expect over the coming year for the expense -- the expense increases to moderate and we expect that you'll continue to see the strong growth that you've seen in our base business the last couple of years. So again, this is kind of our strategy playing out, where you see the extraordinary progress in the base business growth last year, certainly through this year, you see that with the raised guidance for the base business, we expect to carry that momentum going forward. Of course, we don't provide long-term guidance. And we as we've highlighted, have 21 late-stage Phase 3 clinical studies underway. We will get to a point over the coming quarters and years where our expense growth moderates and you should see a lot of that carry to the bottom line so. And I think the way that you've characterized the operating margin in the second quarter is it is entirely consistent with the way that I see it and we don't provide long-term guidance beyond saying that we expect to have a top-tier operating margin going forward and we think we're in a great place to achieve that goal. Thank you. Johanna Mercier : Thank you. I think we have time for one last question, Tia. Operator : Our last question today comes from Simon Baker with Redburn. Please proceed. Simon Baker : Thanks for taking my question. With respect to recent developments within the CAR-T space in non-oncology indications such as lupus. I was just interested to know what your perspectives are on the strategic clinical and commercial opportunities for cell therapy outside oncology. Thanks so much. Johanna Mercier : Thank you very much for the question, Simon. Similar to you, we are very intrigued also by the data that we're seeing in places like autoimmune disease, the lupus, and it's something of great interest to us. We have established ourselves in oncology certainly and expanded into multiple myeloma with the Arcellx collaboration and we are also looking at autoimmune disease going forward. Daniel O'Day: Terrific. So, this is Dan. I just want to close this call by thanking you all for joining. And maybe just related to some of the enthusiasm of both, the team here in the room and the colleagues throughout Gilead and Kite, we're really seeing continued positive momentum and this is just another quarter of that, related to our strategy that we set out several years ago. I mean the first thing is, the business is performing well and on a consistent basis. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth for our business excluding Veklury. Secondly, we're much further ahead than we expected to be with our pipeline delivery. Now, we are now 64 ongoing clinical programs, 21 in Phase 3 and you saw that in the news flow for the second quarter. And then finally, we have a lot to look forward to in the second half of the year and beyond. We're particularly excited about the potential to transform beyond the diseases that we're helping patients with today in lung cancer and continuing to help the epidemic for HID and the epidemic for HIV. So, I just wanted to take this opportunity on behalf of all of us to thank you for joining. As usual, if you have questions that we haven't been able to handle here today, please get in touch with Jacquie and the IR team and we're more than happy to support you. Thank you, everybody, and thanks for joining today. Operator : That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your line.",

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand over to your host, Jacquie Ross, Vice President of Investor Relations to begin. Jacquie please go ahead. Jacquie Ross : Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the third quarter of 2023. The press release, slides, and supplementary data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open the call to Q&A, where the team will be joined by Cindy Perettie, the Executive Vice President of Kite. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including those related to Gilead's business, financial condition, and results of operations, plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations, financial projections and the use of capital, and 2023 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the Company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, in our supplemental data sheet, as well as on the Gilead website. With that I'll turn the call over to Dan. Daniel O'Day: Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to share that Gilead teams have delivered another strong quarter that rounds out two years of continuous growth for our base business. Our track record of commercial execution continued in the third quarter with our base business up 5% compared to the third quarter of 2022 and up 10% year-over-year for the first nine months of 2023. In the third quarter, our growth was driven by our leading therapies across virology and oncology. Biktarvy had another very strong quarter, up 12% from the same quarter in 2022 and contributing to 9% growth overall in HIV in the first nine months of 2023. Oncology is also driving growth and was up 33% in the third quarter compared to last year. Revenue is now annualizing at more than $3 billion with growing adoption of Trodelvy, the only approved Trop-2 directed ADC and our industry leading cell therapies. HER2-: Our Phase 2 EVOKE-02 trial showed a strong objective response rate in the PD-L1 high cohort which supports proof of concept for our ongoing Phase 3 EVOKE-03 trial. Important new data at ESMO for Trodelvy's Phase 2 TROPiCS-03 basket trial in our small cell lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cohorts. All of these milestones reinforced our conviction in Trodelvy as our cornerstone oncology asset with pan tumor potential. EDGE: Gastric trial : CART: ddBCMA: Arcellx: GS-1720: In HIV prevention, we completed enrollment ahead of schedule in our Phase 3 PURPOSE-1 trial investigating once every six months lenacapavir subcutaneous injection and announced plans to initiate the Phase 2 PURPOSE-5 trial in 2024 to support access in Europe. ARTISTRY: In HIV prevention, we completed enrollment ahead of schedule in our Phase 3 PURPOSE-1 trial investigating once every six months lenacapavir subcutaneous injection and announced plans to initiate the Phase 2 PURPOSE-5 trial in 2024 to support access in Europe. 1: In HIV prevention, we completed enrollment ahead of schedule in our Phase 3 PURPOSE-1 trial investigating once every six months lenacapavir subcutaneous injection and announced plans to initiate the Phase 2 PURPOSE-5 trial in 2024 to support access in Europe. OAKTREE: Veklury remains an important therapeutic options for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We recently received approvals from both the FDA and the European Commission to extend use of Veklury in patients with mild- to-severe hepatic impairment. Looking at our pipeline overall, our aggregate progress in 2023 is such that we have already completed most of the milestone events as shown on Slide 6. Our clinical pipeline now includes 27 programs in Phase 2 and 19 in Phase 3. We are looking forward to a busy period of updates from many of these studies in 2024, including those evaluating lenacapavir, Trodelvy and obeldesivir. In summary, it's been another strong quarter of commercial and clinical execution, resulting in important progress for Gilead and the people and communities we aim to serve. With that, I'll hand the call over to Johanna to cover our commercial results. Johanna? Johanna Mercier : Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to share the details of another strong quarter for Gilead and would like to thank the teams that have delivered 10% growth in our base business in the first nine months of 2023. Our third quarter results represent the eight consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in our base business, illustrated strong commercial execution and revenue growth as our virology and oncology products impact more patient lives. In the third quarter of 2023, total product sales excluding Veklury were up 5% to $6.4 billion as shown on Slide 8, with notable growth in our oncology and HIV businesses partially offset our lower HCV sales. Total product sales including Veklury were $7 billion with a solid base business performance contributing $305 million of growth, offset as we expected by lower Veklury sales compared to the same quarter last year. Moving to HIV on Slide 9, the treatment market continued to grow in line with our expectations of 2% to 3% annually. And as we've discussed previously, a favorable pricing dynamics in recent quarters have begun to normalize with HIV sales growth more closely mirroring market and demand growth. This was evident in the third quarter where HIV sales were up 4% year-over-year to $4.7 billion, driven by higher treatment and prevention demand and higher channel inventory, partially offset by lower average realized price due to a shift in channel mix. Sequentially, sales were up 1%. Looking to the full year, we continue to expect HIV product sales to grow slightly more than the 5% reported in 2022. Turning to Slide 10, third quarter Biktarvy sales were $3.1 billion, up 12% year-over-year, driven by higher demand as well as higher channel inventory. Sequentially, sales were up 4%. Once again, Biktarvy gained market share up over 2% year-over-year in the U.S. to over 47% share in the third quarter. Thanks to its robust clinical profile, Biktarvy remains the number one prescribed regimen for new starts and number one in treatment switches across most major markets, including the U.S. Descovy sales in the third quarter were $511 million, up 2% year-over-year with strong year-over-year growth in demand for Descovy for PrEP offset by less favorable pricing dynamics to ensure broad access ahead of the potential launch of lenacapavir as early as late 2025. The U.S. PrEP market grew about 15% year-over-year and Descovy for PrEP continued to maintain more than 40% market share due to its strong clinical profile and despite the availability of other regimens including generics. Moving to the liver disease portfolio on Slide 11, sales were down 10% year-over-year to $706 million, primarily due to the resolution of a rebate claim in HCV recognized in the third quarter of 2022, as well as other pricing dynamics. From a demand perspective, HCV new starts increased compared to the third quarter of 2022 in both the U.S. and Europe, driven by our continued efforts to link HCV patients to care. Given the curative nature of our treatment, we expect HCV new starts to trend down overtime, but are pleased that we are maintaining 50% to 60% market shares in the U.S. and Europe and that our labor portfolio more broadly has stabilized from a revenue perspective. On to Slide 12, Veklury sales continued to be highly variable and declined 31% year-over-year in the third quarter to $636 million. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, sales were up 149%, driven by an uptick in hospitalizations during the third quarter. And over the last few weeks, we have seen a slowdown in COVID related hospitalization. Veklury's strong clinical profile continues to be recognized most recently by the FDA and the European Commission for use in patients with mild-to-severe hepatic impairment. While the COVID environment remains ever changing, Veklury's performance in the third quarter further reinforces its established role as a key part of the standard of care for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Moving to Slide 13, our oncology business achieved another strong quarter with sales up 33% year-over-year to $769 million, representing an annual run rate that now exceeds $3 billion. With clear momentum and a solid infrastructure in place, in addition to our compelling clinical pipeline, we look forward to providing more patients with potentially new and effective options. Looking at Trodelvy on Slide 14, sales were up 58% year-over-year and 9% sequentially to $283 million. As a reminder, Trodelvy is the only approved TROP2-directed antibody drug conjugate and to date, we have delivered this therapy to more than 20,000 patients, reinforcing the clinically meaningful benefit Trodelvy can provide across multiple tumor types. IHC 0 : Turning to Slide 15 and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, cell therapy sales in the third quarter were $486 million, up 22% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting strong demand with particular strength outside the U.S. in the third quarter. Yescarta sales grew 23% year-over-year to $391 million primarily driven by strong growth ex-U.S. in second and third line relapsed or refractory large B cell lymphoma. Tecartus sales were $96 million, up 18% year-over-year, reflecting increased demand in both the U.S. and Europe for relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma as well as adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Given the strong clinical data, it's surprising that only about 10% of eligible second line large B cell lymphoma patients in the U.S. are treated with cell therapy and it is clear that there is still a significant opportunity to drive adoption. As cell therapies are offered and delivered to more and more patients, we are confident that Kite remains well positioned to benefit from this expansion with its differentiated overall survival data for Yescarta and industry-leading manufacturing capabilities. We understand the importance of delivering these potentially curative medicines as quickly as possible to patients with severe and challenging diseases. And to that end, we continue to identify opportunities to bring our therapies to patients faster and are actively working on initiatives to shorten even further our industry-leading 16-day medium turnaround time in the US. Wrapping up the third quarter, I'd like to recognize the strong execution of commercial teams and our cross functional partners across Gilead and Kite. Thanks to their efforts, our therapies are positively impacting more and more people, driven by growing market share and expanding reach, as we bring our therapies to new geographies around the world. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad for an update on our pipeline. Merdad Parsey : Thank you, Johanna. The clinical highlight of our third quarter was the release of our promising Phase 2 data for Trodelvy in combination with pembrolizumab in first line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, highlighting Trodelvy's potential to bring a much needed treatment alternative for patients. More broadly, we continue to progress our increasingly diverse pipeline of 60 ongoing clinical programs spanning virology, oncology and inflammation. Starting with our virology programs on Slide 17, we have 10 clinical programs with our long-acting capsid inhibitor lenacapavir including two Phase 3 studies underway in PrEP. I'm pleased to share that we have completed enrollment earlier than anticipated for our Phase 3 PURPOSE-1 trial evaluating lenacapavir for prevention in adolescent girls and young women. Our Phase 3 PURPOSE-2 trial insists [ph] men and trans women and men and non-binary people continues to enroll well and we could have an opportunity to share data from one or both PURPOSE trials in late 2024 ahead of schedule. We are targeting our first approval for lenacapavir in production in late 2025, potentially making lenacapavir the first six-monthly dosing regimen available for PrEP. Turning to treatment, we continue to make strong progress on evaluating nine candidate partners for lenacapavir. Of the remaining candidates, six are already in Phase 1 or 2. We expect to share updates on at least four of these in 2024, including data from our Phase 1 trial of GS-1720, our once weekly long-acting oral integration inhibitor to be combined with lenacapavir and from our Phase 2 ARTISTRY-1 trial evaluating once daily oral combination of lenacapavir and bictegravir for virologically suppressed treatment experienced people living with HIV. We plan to share results from both trials at a conference in early 2024 and we look forward to advancing these programs into the next phase of development. We're also pleased to share that enrollment for our Phase 2 program evaluating our lenacapavir plus bNAbs combination dosed every six months is progressing very well and is another program we expect to update you on next year. Putting this all together, our data continues to support our confidence that lenacapavir has the potential to transform HIV treatment and prevention globally. Turning to oncology on Slide 18. To date, Trodelvy has been delivered to more than 20,000 patients across three approved indications since our launch three years ago. Trodelvy remains the first and only marketed TROP2-directed antibody drug conjugate to achieve meaningful overall survival benefit in two of its indications. With that said, we're seeing both growing real world evidence and clinical trial data supporting not only the approach we're taking for Trodelvy's clinical development across tumor types, but also Trodelvy's unique ADC construct. In particular, trodelvy is the only ADC to have a high 7 to 8 drug to antibody ratio that's able to deliver a highly potent SN-38 payload directly into the tumor microenvironment through its hydrolyzable linker. As a result, in our studies to date, Trodelvy has shown a potentially differentiated safety profile with regards to ILD and stomatitis. We look forward to sharing more emerging Trodelvy data in 2024 as we continue to expand Trodelvy across tumor types and lines of therapy. TROPiCS: 03: TROPiCS: 03: KEYNOTE: As a reminder, we are currently enrolling patients with first line PD-L1 high metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in our registrational Phase 3 EVOKE-03 study. Preliminary data from the PD-L1 TPS less than 50% cohort has also been encouraging, demonstrating an ORR of 44% similar to previous trials that evaluated pembro plus chemotherapy. These results inform our plans to expand into broader first line non-small cell lung cancer patient populations across all PD-L1 expression levels. We're looking forward to sharing further analysis from EVOKE-02 that will highlight the efficacy of Trodelvy and pembro across both squamous and non-squamous histologies in first line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients. 024: As a reminder, we are currently enrolling patients with first line PD-L1 high metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in our registrational Phase 3 EVOKE-03 study.

EDGE: Gastric: FOLFOX: FOLFOX: Although anti-TIGIT will not work in every tumor type, we're excited to see that DOM has shown encouraging efficacy and tolerability in the tumor types we have advanced into Phase 3 studies including first line non-small cell lung cancer and upper GI cancer. Turning to cell therapy on Slide 21, we are continuing to work to expand the benefits of cell therapy to even more patients with eight ongoing trials in earlier lines, new indications or new settings. We also have an extensive early stage pipeline where we are exploring allergenic CAR-Ts including healthy donor and IPSC derived cell therapies as well as natural killer and invariant natural killer T cell therapies. CART: ddBCMA: CART: ddBCMA: CART: Finally, and before I hand over to Andy, the teams progress on key 2023 clinical milestones is shown on Slide 22. As is expected with the diverse and large clinical portfolio, not all our programs will benefit patients the way we hope they will and the ENHANCE and ENHANCE-2 programs evaluating magrolimab have both been discontinued based on futility analyses. The ENHANCE-3 study remains under partial clinical hold in frontline unfit AML and we continue to evaluate the progress of this and other Phase 2 solid tumor trials for magrolimab. With regards to some of the remaining milestones for 2023 as referenced previously, we look forward to sharing data from ARTISTRY-1 at a medical conference in 2024. For our HIV prevention studies, we continue to expect to have our first patient in for the PURPOSE-3 and PURPOSE-4 clinical trials by the end of this year. Additionally, we remain on track to initiate our Phase 2 PALEKONA trial evaluating our potential first in class 222 inhibitor for ulcerative colitis later this year. Our 222 inhibitor represents one of our many oral agents for inflammation. Looking beyond 2023, we will share our target 2024 milestones in due course, but it's already clear that it will be a rich year for data updates for Gilead, including potential updates or regulatory filings for Obeldesivir, lenacapavir, Trodelvy and CAR-T ddBCMA. With that, I'll hand the call over to Andy. Andy? ddBCMA's: Finally, and before I hand over to Andy, the teams progress on key 2023 clinical milestones is shown on Slide 22.

With that, I'll hand the call over to Andy. Andy? Andrew Dickinson : Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. We had another solid quarter as shown on Slide 24, with total product sales excluding Veklury up 5% year-over-year, driven by growth across oncology and HIV, partially offset by lower HCV sales. Total product sales were $7 billion, flat year-over-year, with lower Veklury sales offsetting more than $300 million of growth in our base business. Our non-GAAP results are shown on Slide 25. Product gross margin was 86%, down 85 basis points from last year. R&D was $1.5 billion, up 24% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing clinical trial activities. Third quarter R&D expenses also reflected some sizable wind down costs related to the discontinuation of two Phase 3 magrolimab ENHANCE studies and faster than anticipated enrollment in our Phase 3 PURPOSE-1 and OAKTREE studies, both of which have recently completed enrollment and could accelerate timelines for data readouts in due course. Acquired IPR&D was $91 million, reflecting the Tentarix collaboration announced in August, in addition to other payments associated with ongoing partnerships. SG&A was $1.3 billion, up 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by increased commercial investments, namely in oncology. Moving to tax, our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 7% primarily reflecting a decrease in tax reserves as a result of reaching an agreement with a tax authority on certain tax position. Excluding the settlement, our non-GAAP effective tax rate would have been approximately 16%. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.29 compared to $1.90 for the same period last year. This was primarily driven by growth in our base business, lower tax and lower acquired IP R&D expenses compared to the third quarter of 2022 partially offset by lower Veklury sales and higher R&D and commercial investments. Moving to Slide 26, year-to-date base business revenue has grown 10% year-over-year, highlighting strong performance across virology and oncology. From an OpEx perspective, the investment we have made this year in R&D is notable with a robust and diverse clinical pipeline and with our commercial sales and marketing organization scaled to meet growing demand for our on market oncology portfolio, we continue to expect a moderation of expense growth in 2024 and beyond. Moving to Slide 27, we are updating many of our guidance ranges to reflect our year-to-date performance and our expectations for the rest of the year. Total product sales is now expected to be in the range of $26.7 billion to $26.9 billion, up from $26.3 billion to $26.7 billion previously. We are increasing total product sales excluding Veklury at the midpoint. We now expect the range to be between $24.8 billion to $25 billion, up from $24.6 billion to $25 billion previously. This range represents growth of 7% to 8% for our base business year-over-year and an increase of $650 million at the midpoint from the initial guidance we issued in February. On Veklury, based on our results year-to-date, we now expect full year Veklury sales of approximately $1.9 billion. As always, this remains highly variable and correlated with COVID related hospitalizations. Moving to the rest of the P&L, we continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 86%. On R&D, reflecting the accelerated enrollments and magrolimab discontinuation expenses, our full year non-GAAP R&D expense is now expected to grow approximately 15% in 2023 compared to 2022. Excluding these items, our full year R&D expense is consistent with our prior guidance in the low double digits. Reflecting the Tentarix collaboration closed in the third quarter as well as previously committed acquired IPR&D amounts and known milestone payments from existing collaborations, we now expect non-GAAP acquired IPR&D of approximately $1 billion in 2023. Similar to prior quarters, we will update expected acquired IPR&D expenses if they are incurred during the fourth quarter. We continue to expect non-GAAP SG&A expenses to increase by a high single digit percentage compared to 2022. As a reminder, this includes the one-time legal settlement accrual of $525 million in the second quarter. Excluding this, we continue to expect non-GAAP SG&A expense for 2023 to be down a low single digit percentage compared to 2022. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be $10.5 billion to $10.8 billion as compared to $10.4 billion to $10.9 billion previously, driven by higher R&D expenses offset by higher product sales. Given certain one- time tax benefits in 2023, we now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 16% for the full year. Altogether, we now expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $6.65 and $6.85 per share as compared to $6.45 and $6.80 per share previously. As shown on Slide 28, the chart highlights the continued strength of our business with higher total product sales guidance flowing into the bottom line, which together with the lower expected tax rate more than offsets the higher R&D expenses in the third quarter. On a GAAP basis, our diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.55 and $4.75 per share. Moving to Slide 29, our capital allocation priorities remain focused and unchanged. In the third quarter, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through our dividend and repurchase of shares totaling $3.7 billion year-to-date. In the third quarter, we repaid $2.25 billion of senior notes and issued $2 billion in senior notes maturing in 2033 and 2053. Overall, the third quarter was another solid quarter of commercial and clinical execution in an extremely strong 2023 for Gilead so far. Our planning for 2024 is well underway and we've taken steps in the third quarter to continue to evolve our business model and expense structure to set us up for strong execution next year. 2023 has been a year of considerable investment, notably in R&D and we are excited to finally be at the point where many of our key programs will start reading out data. With that in mind, we are preparing for a catalyst rich 2024 and we look forward to sharing more early next year. With that, I'll invite the operator to open the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today goes to Geoff Meacham of Bank of America. Geoff, please go ahead, your line is open. Geoff Meacham : Okay, great. Hi everyone. Thanks for the question. I guess this is for maybe Johanna or for Merdad. Just on lenacapavir, your competitor has highlighted some of the [derm path] (ph) and I wanted to get your perspective on what you've seen in clinical studies, really as well as the early commercial experience. I wasn't sure if you guys view that as a non-issue or something to navigate as you develop lenacapavir for PrEP or various doublets and HIV treatment. Thank you. Merdad Parsey : Sure. Hey, Geoff, this is Merdad. Thanks for the question. I would say that our DDI profile has been pretty well characterized and is in our label and laid out. As you noted lenacapavir is metabolized by CYP3A and like many other drugs in the class and we -- that's been available and labeled for quite some time. We don't anticipate any changes to our programs based on that. There are no adaptations that we are making in our clinical development program based on that. As you know, we're well on our way in our PURPOSE 1/2 lenacapavir for PrEP studies and have the approval and highly treatment experienced people and have not made any modifications based on any DDI concerns in those trials. And I'd encourage folks to take a look at the label. You can see what's laid out fairly clearly there. Johanna Mercier : Yes. And maybe just to add to what Merdad said, so we launched Sunlenca, lenacapavir for heavily treatment experience earlier this year. As per Merdad's comments, the label has no contraindication specific to what you were referring to, to opioids or ED drugs and the launch thus far is well underway and access is increasing every day across the U.S., but also other markets including Japan and Europe and we're excited to have an option for these patients that unfortunately have really no other option at this point in time. So very small market opportunity today with the potential for lenacapavir for PrEP as early as late 2025, so very excited as we continue our plans for that. Jacquie Ross : Nadia, may we have our next question, please? Operator : Our next question goes to Michael Yee of Jefferies. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Yee : Thanks, great. And appreciate the question. Maybe from Merdad coming away from ESMO and some of the recent conferences, obviously a ton of Trop-2 data, and there's a lot of talk around the benefit, particularly in lung, for non-squamous versus squamous. And some of your competitors have modified their studies to be more focused on non-squamous. Can you maybe just talk about how you see the benefits here in the different populations and whether you would consider emphasizing or modifying to be a non-squamous as well to improve probability success? Thank you. Merdad Parsey : Thanks, Michael, for the question. Yes, look, we had a really interesting ESMO, I think, for all concerned, and I think something that we've been saying for quite some time, is that not all Trop-2 ADCs are equivalent. Right? It's really important to note that there are differences between Trodelvy and the other Trop-2 ADCs in all three components. The affinity of the antibody is two orders of magnitude better. We have a different linker and we have a different payload. That has played out in many ways along the safety spectrum, where we have different adverse event profiles of the two drugs that have clearly emerged. And it's possible now that we're starting to see divergence on the efficacy side as well. Recall that we have shared our EVOKE-02 data, which comprise both squam and non-squamous patients. We have enrolled both squamous and non-squamous patients in our trials, and as one would expect, we do stratify those patients in the studies and we\u2019ll continue to do so. But we're very confident in our approach and with what we've seen so far, and really look forward to being able to share more data from EVOKE-01 next year. Jacquie Ross : Nadia, next question please? Operator : Our next question goes to Daina Graybosch of Leerink Partners. Diana, please go ahead. Your line is open. Daina Graybosch : Thank you. A question about Kite. I wonder if you can talk through the specific barriers that are limiting uptake of CAR-T and the second-line large B cell lymphoma indication. And what do you think will be required to upshift the earlier line demand for cell therapy in a large B cell lymphoma, and maybe even a multiple myeloma as well? Johanna Mercier : Thank you very much for the question, Diana. I think some of the specific barriers that we're observing are more in the U.S. So I might first talk about what we're observing in Europe where we have socialized medicine. We're seeing uptake as soon as we are granted access and reimbursement. And it goes very quickly into the system, because it's a non-fragmented healthcare system. In the U.S., things look a little bit different given the fragmentation of the healthcare system. So the barriers that we're observing in the U.S. are really our ability to treat patients where they are so moving into community oncology. Today, 80% of oncology patients are seen in the community. Most of our authorized treatment centers exist in large academic hospitals. And so what we're doing for the future, and what we think is going to be very important, is that we're able to have authorized treatment centers in the community closer to patients. So that's one important piece. And we continue to open up new treatment centers in the United States. And in fact, this year we should end with somewhere around 140 treatment centers in the U.S., and that will continue to grow in 2024. I think the second piece for barriers is converting stem cell transplants. So physicians who are transplanting patients, they will have a better outcome via the data if they have CAR-T. And so we're working with transplanters on education and really making sure those patients have access to CAR-T in the earlier lines. I think those are two of the larger barriers that we're observing today. And the last piece, I would say, is the excitement with multiple myeloma therapies coming forward. You can imagine the ATCs now we're seeing both lymphoma patients as well as multiple myeloma patients, and that's causing a crunch within those authorized treatment centers. And that's why it's important in the academic medical centers that we're able to expand the number of beds, and secondly, open new authorized treatment centers that can serve both lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Jacquie Ross : Nadia, may we have our next question, please? Operator : Our next question goes to Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Chris, please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the question. Can you elaborate a little bit more on HIV channel mix dynamics this quarter and how you're thinking about that for 4Q and beyond? I know channel has been a bit of a tailwind over the past year or two. Seems like we're now may be starting to see some headwinds, at least sequentially. And I just was wondering how you think about that progressing from here? Thanks so much. Johanna Mercier : Sure, Chris, thanks for the question. So you're right, as expected. We've seen some of those favorable pricing dynamics that we'd seen in the last couple of quarters, including in 2022, due to the channel mix, kind of begin to normalize, and you should expect to see kind of the same play from Q3 into Q4. One of the reasons for that had to do with some of the channel \u2013 specifically around the channel mix to what you referenced, having to do with some of our government channels being less utilized, where we have higher rebates, and therefore we had pricing [favorability] (ph). We believe a lot of that had to do just stabilization post-COVID around employment rates, inflation, et cetera. So we had benefits that we saw over that probably, I would say four quarters to six quarters or so. And as we kind of shared with you in Q2, we are seeing that normalize out for the second half of this year. And I think you should expect that not only for the next quarter, but then as we go into 2024. And therefore, because of all that, we believe that our HIV sales growth is closely mirroring now more of the market and the demand growth, where we're seeing real strength, both from a market standpoint in treatment and prevention, we're seeing about two points to three points growth in the market when you look at retail and non-retail market, and then, of course, 15% growth in the PrEP market. And then from a demand standpoint, I think obviously with BIKTARVY growing at 12 points year-on-year and DESCOVY continuing to hold on to a very strong share over 40% or so in a competitive market with generics and, of course, new formulations. So more to come as we go into Q4, but hopefully that gives you a better picture of some of the mix of channels. Jacquie Ross : Thank you. Maybe I have our next caller, please. Operator : Our next question goes to Tim Anderson of Wolfe Research. Tim, please go ahead. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Thanks for taking our question. This is Adam on for Tim Anderson at Wolfe Research. Also on TROP2, just in light of competitor data, can you provide some more color on just latest thoughts on the competitive dynamics within the class? For example, if AstraZeneca gets a label for HR+ breast cancer in the second-line, and Trodelvy only has a label for the third-line, won't that displace Trodelvy? Thanks. Johanna Mercier : Yes, good question, Adam. So I'm assuming you're referring to some of the data we saw at ESMO with data DXD. We don't believe there is material impact for now anyway, or even in the future for Trodelvy. And the reason for that really has to do with the data itself and the lines of therapy, to your point, I think we've proven very clearly with Trodelvy in second-line TNBC and beyond around the overall survival data that we've shown. And then, of course, showing OS again in HR+/HER2-, although in later lines. I think what we're seeing today in the marketplace is not only are we the leaders in TNBC, we're also leading from an IHC 0 population. And then, of course, looking at sequencing of ADCs posts in HER2, as expected in the HR+/HER2- populations, so quite pleased with our positioning and we don't believe the data that we've seen thus far is going to have a direct impact there. Daniel O'Day: Yes, I would just add that we continue to expand our programs and continue to want to generate additional data for Trodelvy. So we are very comfortable with where we are. I think our ability to interact with our caregivers and patients now having been on the market for quite some time, is really helping us make sure that we get Trodelvy to as many patients who could benefit from it as possible. Jacquie Ross : Nadia, may we have our next question, please? Operator : Of course, our next question goes to Salveen Richter of Goldman Sachs. Salveen, please go ahead. Your line is open. Salveen Richter : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question here on the pipeline, just given two data releases that came out. So on the TIGIT gastric data that was presented today, how do we think \u2013 or how do you think about the terms, the opportunity, the competitiveness versus standard of care combos and next steps? And then with regard to the multiple myeloma for Arcellx that was presented, it looks to be tracking a Carvykti like profile in relapse refractory multiple myeloma. Could you just walk us through next steps path to market competitive positioning here? Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Sure. Maybe I'll start with TIGIT and I'll hand it off to Cindy for the multiple myeloma discussion. Yes, I think, look, we find the data that we presented today at the ASCO plenary to really be promising for continued momentum for TIGIT. The data from an ORR standpoint, and I think importantly, the landmark PFS analysis are very promising. It's early data, it's single-arm data, and I think those are all caveats that are appropriate when looking at these. But when you think about the context around what the standard of care PFS and OS are, we think there's certainly promising signals that we could do better than that. So, obviously, what we need to do next is allow these data to mature in ARC-21. And then, of course, we have the 221 study. That is our Phase 3 study, where we will be comparing to standard of care in a randomized Phase 3 trial. We think the data shown today really will help us with momentum in accruing that trial and hopefully demonstrating the promise of TIGIT added onto standard of care, a standard of care like regimen with zim and FOLFOX. We're excited about that Phase 3 outcome, and it really gives us the opportunity to be, we think ahead on that indication compared to the competition in TIGIT. And Cindy, do you want to. Cindy Perettie : Yes. Happy to. Thank you. So, this is early days, obviously, for the ddBCMA molecule. We have 38 patients worth of data. If I compare it to Carvykti, the population looks more like the LEGEND-2 population. We have 34% extramedillary disease, which is a high risk prognosis patient. And if you look at the LEGEND-2 data, they had 30%. Our overall response rate to date in those 38 patients at 22 months is 100%, and in the LEGEND-2 data is 88% at 25 months. So I do think there is a potential to differentiate on efficacy. We're seeing a differentiation as it relates to the safety profile around the Parkinson syndrome. We are not observing that in any of our patients to date. Obviously, we're going to continue to watch that as we enroll the IMAGINE 1 study and move into our next studies as well. Multiple myeloma is a large market. There is enough room in multiple myeloma to have multiple competitors. But we also feel like we will have a differentiated molecule with Arcellx. So we're looking forward to generating more data and talking to folks about it at ASH. Jacquie Ross : Thank you, Nadia. We're ready for our next question. Operator : Our next question goes to Tyler Van Buren of TD Cowen. Tyler, please go ahead. Your line is open. Tyler Van Buren : Hey, guys, thanks for the presentation. I have another question, actually on the myeloma program. So assuming that Arcellx's CAR-T ddBCMA data continue to look great at ASH, and the IMAGINE-1 trial does later next year and leads to approval, how prepared have you guys gotten on the manufacturing front in the past year? And do you expect the launch to have a similar trajectory to Yescarta in terms of supply or be significantly better. Johanna Mercier : Hey there's a number of things that we have learned over the course of the years with Yescarta and around manufacturing, all of which we're applying that knowledge to the manufacturing of the ddBCMA CAR-T. So we plan to launch that out of our facilities at Kite and expect to have a strong launch again. We will be applying Yescarta learnings. So our goal is to be significantly better than we were at the launch of Yescarta. Jacquie Ross : Thank you, Nadia. We're ready for our next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question goes to Brian Abrahams of RBC Capital Markets. Brian, please go ahead. Your line is open. Brian Abrahams : Hi there. Thanks for taking my question. It seems like the long acting HIV combos are moving ahead really well. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the strategic role that the Lenacapavir, Bictegravir daily oral or the weekly 17/20 based combo could play in the HIV competitive landscape. Do you think these could move beyond treatment experienced patients on complex regimens into the earlier lines? Thanks. Daniel O'Day: Sure, maybe. Johanna, do you want to talk about weekly oral? And I'll do the weekly? Johanna Mercier : Sure. Thanks for the question, Brian. I think the way we're looking at lenacapavir, bictegravir in the virologically suppressed really has to do with. We've set the standard of care with Biktarvy, and the opportunity now is to ensure that if for some reason there was a reason to switch Biktarvy from a tolerability profile or anything else that they have an option to go to that has a really interesting combination. Right. When you think about a capsid inhibitor as well as an integrase inhibitor. So for us, it's really about the optionality for patients and making sure that this could offer something a little bit different in the daily oral market. And I do think that this will also be a longer term strategy for us as we think about beyond Biktarvy's LOE in 2033. So I would go there and on the weekly just to start, and then I'll kick it over to Merdad to share with you our plans there. On the weekly oral, it's clear from the patient research that we've done in treatment that we really do see benefit not only the daily oral market, but also in the oral weekly, or even potentially even a little bit longer, as we think about what patients are asking for today. So as much as we're very interested in the long actings that are every three months or every six months. We are also making sure that we meet the needs of patients and their requests as they're looking at for some really don't like any injectables or sub Q, and really looking at that weekly oral as potentially expending a little bit the time they don't think about the fact that they have HIV. Merdad Parsey : Yes, just minor things to add, I would say. We have been focusing our development on what people living with HIV and people who are looking for PrEP options have told us that they're interested in, and that's longer acting oral options and injectable options that are every three months, every six months. And that's what we've been focusing our development program on. And we want to make sure that we provide that optionality to different folks. The other thing about the [indiscernible] to Remember is remember that Lena is a new class of antiretroviral, and that provides caregivers the option to leverage that new class for the appropriate people living with HIV. So our goal as the leader in HIV is to continue to provide as many of the relevant options to people living with HIV and people looking for prevention options as we think are going to be reasonable and valuable. And remember that we think the weekly oral is important enough that we have two programs. So you mentioned 1720. Remember, we also have the program with his islatravir, lenacapavir. So we're very happy with the progress we've made, as you noted, and really on track to provide better options. Jacquie Ross : Nadia, may we have our next question, please? Operator : Our next question goes to Terrence Flynn of Morgan Stanley. Terrence, please go ahead. Your line is open. Terrence Flynn : Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering if you can provide any preliminary thoughts on 2024 spend or margins. Andy, thanks so much. Andrew Dickinson : Hey, Terrence, thanks for the question. Happy to take that. Obviously, in late January or early February, as we customarily do, we'll provide very specific guidance in 2024. What we've said, and I would continue to reiterate, is that as you've seen, our expenses increase over the last couple of years as our portfolio has increased, and again, from our perspective, a very necessary and appropriate increase as we developed what we feel is one of the best and broadest pipelines in the industry, both in virology, oncology, across cell therapy, and at Gilead. We're finally at the level where we're spending on par with our peers, especially on the R&D side. You saw that in the third quarter. So as you think about expenses, going forward, we expect that you will see more moderate growth in expenses over time. We're doing a lot to manage our expenses, as you heard on the last couple of quarters. Maybe the best evidence of that, Terrence, is if you look at our first quarter R&D expenses, our third quarter R&D expenses are essentially flat. So you saw a little bit of a step down from the first quarter. In the second quarter, in the third quarter, we're flat. So you already see that we're kind of, as we said, we're approaching kind of the peak spend, recognizing that we have 60 different clinical programs. If I remember correctly, we have 27 programs in phase, 219 programs in Phase 3. That is very different than the Gilead of prior years that you remember. And it's part of what makes it so excited about where we're going as a company. And the final thing I'd say is you're already seeing the benefits of those investments and the commercial performance that we've talked about for the last two years. So we expect that you will continue to see those benefits in our commercial performance across the entire business, and you're going to see a moderation of expense growth. And again, we'll provide much more specific detail early next year and look forward to talking about this further. Thank you. Jacquie Ross : Nadia. Our next caller, please? Operator : Our next question goes to Evan Seigerman of BMO Capital Markets. Evan, please go ahead. Your line is open. Evan Seigerman : Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I want one on kind of capital allocation as a function of competitiveness in your respective markets. For example, you have a great moat in virology. How do you think about investment there, say versus oncology, where it's a more competitive marketplace and where we're seeing incremental kind of benefit over time? Maybe some thoughts there. Thank you so much. Andrew Dickinson : Hey, Evan, it's Andy. I'll start. And others may want to jump in as. Look I mean, what we've said historically, and I'd reiterate, is we're always going to follow the science. So we are completely committed to virology, not just HIV, but virology broadly. You see that, for instance, with our progress with oral DESCOVY [ph] as well as other programs, we've also said in virology that a lot of what happens in virology happens in our internal research and that there are less opportunities externally to invest in. That doesn't mean that we won't continue to look for them. And we're going to continue to invest in oncology. We have a much larger oncology organization today, we've increased our internal research and development, and we're still very focused as the third pillar on inflammation. So I would remind people that we have a number of early inflammation programs, including a number in Phase 2 that we're excited about. Merdad highlighted the TROP2 program in his remarks earlier, but that's just one of the programs that we expect to build out over time. So we'll follow the science. We're going to apply capital to each of those areas. If you look back, our capital investment has risen and fallen over time in each of those areas as we've looked at different opportunities. And of course, we're going to continue to invest in cell therapy as part of oncology and more broadly. I should have highlighted that earlier. So the short summary is, we'll follow the science, but all of the areas will receive additional capital over time. Merdad, you want to add anything? Merdad Parsey : I would just add that our goal has been to diversify the portfolio. We remain committed and think one of our key competitive advantages is our track record and strength in virology. And I would agree with you, Evan, that's critical to our continued success and growth. And we also believe that having more diversity in our portfolio, whether its oncology or inflammation, is going to be really important to our long term future. So our capital allocation will happen on where the best data are, and we make those tradeoffs virtually every day. Jacquie Ross : Nadia, I think we have time for one last question, please. Operator : Our final question goes to Joe Catanzaro of Piper Sandler. Joe, please go ahead. Your line is open. Joe Catanzaro : Hi everybody. Appreciate you taking my question. I actually had one on Trodelvy within bladder cancer, and appreciate this is a smaller proportion of Trodelvy sales, but just wanted to ask about the potential impact of Padcev's EV-302 data and it moving into the front line and what you could potentially see there with Trodelvy, both maybe in the near term and longer term. Thanks. Johanna Mercier : So maybe I'll start and then throw it over to Merdad first from a clinical standpoint, what we're thinking from a commercial standpoint, with the data that we saw, I think the standard of care is going to change in first line, clearly, with that data, and we see that as a potential opportunity to actually move up Trodelvy lines of therapy. So right now in the U.S., we do have accelerated approval in the U.S., and we're seeing about 15%, 16% share in bladder cancer, but later lines of therapy. So third line plus, I think with the opportunity to have Padcev kind of move up in the first line setting with Pembro. I think it'll be interesting to see how Trodelvy kind of moves up as we've seen a lot of sequencing from ADCs here as well. So that's in the here and now and maybe Merdad, you want to comment on the clinical development? Merdad Parsey : Yes, I think it's great news for patients with the data that's come out and we think it does change the paradigm for bladder cancer. I think the other thing I would add to what Johanna said is that we were looking with interest. We don't have data on sequencing, but we're certainly hearing about sequencing and there were data that were shown at ESMO around combining Padcev and Trodelvy where the tolerability profile looked good and the responses looked good. Small study, but we think there continues to be opportunity there for us and having this clarity will help us design where we're going to go from here after our confirmatory trial in second line completes. Operator : Thank you. That's all the questions that we have time for today. I'll now hand back to Dan for any closing comments. Daniel O'Day: Well, just want to thank the team here and all of you for joining and just maybe end with this reflection, which is Gilead. I don't think we could be more excited about as we wrap up 2023 and head into 2024, about the evolution of our commercial and clinical execution. In particular, 2024 will be a year that's full of key clinical catalysts across our portfolio, and that's really been a culmination over the past several years of investing in a robust and diversified portfolio, many of which were Phase 2 studies that led to Phase 3 studies that we'll be reading out over the course of not only next year, but the years to come. We'll provide more details on all of our 2024 clinical milestones early next year, but in the meantime, maybe just a couple to highlight in a busy year. Obviously on Trodelvy, where the clinical data increasingly highlight that all TROP2 ADCs are not alike. We'll be rolling out data across a variety of disease states in oncology, and we're excited to share data on lung cancer in the first half of 2024 and then maybe to highlight one other one. Lenacapavir will have a rich year of data on the treatment combination candidates, and we continue to target being first to market with our six month long acting PrEPs, starting with readouts next year on our Phase 3 trials and a commercial launch as early as late 2025. With that, as always, feel free to reach out to the IR team here at Gilead, if you have any questions or feedback for the team and we\u2019ll look forward to updating you again early in the New Year. Thank you for joining. Operator : Thank you. This now concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

My name is Victoria, and I'll be your moderator today. All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call with the opportunity for questions and answers at the end. I would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Jacquie Ross. Thank you. You may proceed, Jacquie. Jacquie Ross : Thank you, Operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. The press release, slides, and supplementary data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today\u2019s call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O\u2019Day; our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we\u2019ll open the call to Q&A, where the team will be joined by Cindy Perettie, the Executive Vice President of Kite. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including those related to Gilead\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations, plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations, financial projections and the use of capital, and 2024 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company\u2019s underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, in our supplementary data sheet, as well as on the Gilead website. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dan. Daniel O\u2019Day: Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. The team and I are pleased you could join us today as we share the details of our full year and fourth quarter performance and the latest on our clinical portfolio. Starting with our full year performance, 2023 was a strong year for Gilead, with 7% growth in product sales, excluding Veklury, driven by HIV and Oncology. HIV grew by almost $1 billion, with Biktarvy sales growing 14% to almost $12 billion and increasing its market share in the US to 48%. Oncology grew 37% to almost $3 billion, an increase of almost $800 million in just one year. This growth was split evenly between our Kite cell therapies and Trodelvy. Veklury for COVID-19 contributed $2.2 billion in 2023, ahead of our expectations, but down year-over-year, as expected, given the evolution of the pandemic. In the last two years combined, Gilead\u2019s base business has grown approximately $3.3 billion, or more than 7% annually, largely offsetting the decline in Veklury revenues over the same period. The consistent growth in our base business gives us a strong foundation as we continue into 2024 and look to deliver on our broad clinical portfolio. This is a catalyst-rich phase for Gilead with more than 20 updates this year and many more to come beyond 2024. Starting with Oncology, we expect at least 12 further updates by the end of 2024. These include Phase 3 updates for Trodelvy in bladder and triple-negative breast cancer, and results from the pivotal Phase 2 iMMagine-1 study for anito-cel in multiple myeloma, for which we saw encouraging Phase 1 data at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December. Also in Cell Therapy, we are very pleased to have shortened our manufacturing time for Yescarta by another two days in the US, reinforcing our industry-leading median turnaround time, which is now at an anticipated 14 days. As you know, we did not reach the primary endpoint for EVOKE-01, our Phase 3 trial for second-line plus metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Merdad will go into detail on this later, but while we did not see the outcome we hoped for, the data are encouraging on a number of levels, namely, a numerical improvement in overall survival favoring Trodelvy, including in both squamous and non-squamous tumors, a safety profile consistent with our product label that could continue to differentiate Trodelvy versus other TROP2 ADCs, and while not statistically powered, a potential benefit for a pre-specified sub-population that saw more than three months\u2019 median overall improvement. The team is evaluating next steps given the data and the significant unmet need and we look forward to discussing the data with regulators. Based on the totality of the results in both EVOKE-02 and EVOKE-01, we are confident in Trodelvy\u2019s potential in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, including in earlier lines of therapy. In Virology, we are looking forward to a very important year for our HIV portfolio. Among the multiple updates we are expecting are the Phase 3 data for lenacapavir in HIV prevention and at least eight updates from our HIV treatment program. These are milestones that could bring us closer to our goal of helping to end the HIV epidemic, building on Gilead\u2019s decades of leadership in HIV. In COVID-19, today we are announcing that our Phase 3 trial, OAKTREE, evaluating obeldesivir did not meet its primary endpoint. We conducted this study to explore whether obeldesivir could address the public health need that existed with COVID-19 for standard-risk patients. Again, Merdad will share details later, but essentially, because of the way things have evolved, the standard-risk population is now better able to fight COVID-19 without antiviral therapy. This made it more difficult for obeldesivir to show a benefit compared to the placebo. We know that the world needs to be equipped for other viruses and the broad antiviral activity of obeldesivir shown preclinically means it has potential for other viral infections. The updates we are expecting in 2024 have the potential to unlock multiple opportunities across Virology and Oncology. With a broad portfolio where the risk is balanced, we look forward to following the science and continuing to make a positive impact for patients and communities. Gilead has set an ambitious goal of delivering at least 10 transformative therapies by 2030, and we are driving confidently to that goal. Before I hand over to the team for their updates, I\u2019ll move to Slide 6 and recap that we executed well in 2023 and achieved all the remaining targeted goals that we expected to in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ll share our 2024 milestones later in the presentation, but it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s going to be a very busy year for Gilead. I\u2019d like to thank the teams for their work in bringing us to this important catalyst-rich phase for the company, and for the strong commercial performance that gives us a firm foundation on which to build. With that I will hand it over to Johanna. Johanna Mercier : Thanks Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Beginning on Slide 8, total product sales for the full year were at the high-end of our guidance range at $26.9 billion, reflecting solid base business growth, with total product sales, excluding Veklury, up 7% year-over-year to $24.7 billion. This was almost entirely offset by the expected decline in Veklury sales. For the full-year, Veklury sales were $2.2 billion, reflecting the uptick in hospitalizations at the end of 2023, though still below levels seen in 2022. Turning to the fourth quarter on Slide 9, total product sales were $7.1 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Our base business sales were roughly flat year-over-year at $6.3 billion, primarily driven by higher Oncology sales, offset by lower HIV sales due to changes in channel mix that resulted in lower average realized price, in addition to the expected decline of our portfolio of non-promoted products. Moving to Slide 10, our HIV business delivered very strong results for the full-year, up 6% year-over-year to $18.2 billion and contributing almost $1 billion in base business growth, primarily driven by demand, as well as higher average realized price due to channel mix and inventory dynamics. More specifically, almost half of the full-year HIV growth was driven by higher demand, most notably by Biktarvy which delivered solid double-digit year-over-year growth of 14%, with annualized revenues now more than $12 billion. Already the clear market leader, Biktarvy continues to demonstrate impressive share gains, growing almost 3% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2023, to approximately 48% share in the US. This growth once again outpaced all other branded regimens for HIV treatment, and represented the 22nd quarter of consecutive year-over-year share gains. For the fourth quarter, as highlighted on Slide 11, HIV sales of $4.7 billion reflected strong demand in line with our expectations. On a year-over-year basis, this was offset by lower average realized price due to channel mix that was notably favorable in the fourth quarter of 2022, and resulted in a decline of 2%. Sequentially, sales were up 1%, similarly driven by strong demand as well as favorable inventory dynamics, partially offset by lower average realized price due to channel mix. As we have noted previously, the pricing tailwinds we saw in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023 are not expected to repeat, and will make year-over-year comparisons more challenging in the immediate term, as we saw in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, quarterly HIV growth is, in general, significantly more variable and less indicative of overall trends than the full year, particularly as certain quarterly pricing and inventory dynamics tend to normalize over the course of the year. Factors include, first, gross-to-net adjustments which can be difficult to forecast due to the lag between product sales and claim payments that frequently occur in different quarters. Second, the timing of bulk government purchases which contribute to overall demand but can have a significant, negative impact on pricing in the quarter in which they occur. For example, certain discounted government segments are unpredictable in terms of bulk order timing, and this impacts overall average realized price. And then finally, the inventory build by subchannel wholesalers and customers that typically occurs towards the end of the year. Historically, this happens in the fourth quarter. In 2023, we saw the build start in the third quarter and continue, albeit to a lesser extent relative to prior years, into the fourth quarter. Overall, despite these quarterly variables, we remain confident that overall demand trends are strong and unchanged. With our HIV treatment market share above 70% in US and above 40% in PrEP, Gilead remains well-positioned to continue delivering demand-driven growth. For 2024, we expect HIV sales to grow approximately 4%, reflecting, annual treatment demand growth of 2% to 3%, Biktarvy market share gains and continued double-digit growth in demand for HIV prevention. In terms of quarterly HIV revenue, keep in mind that the first quarter is always impacted by the reset of patient copays and deductibles. Additionally, we\u2019ve historically seen inventory build-up in the fourth quarter that has led to notable draw-downs by wholesalers in the first quarter. In the first quarter of 2023, this contributed to HIV sales declining 12% sequentially, and we expect a similar decline in the 10% to 12% range for the first quarter of 2024. The continued strong performance of both Biktarvy and Descovy for PrEP are shown on Slide 12. Overall, Gilead\u2019s leadership in HIV is unmatched, with a solid commercial portfolio and robust pipeline of potentially best-in-class regimens to serve the daily oral, long-acting oral, and long-acting injectable markets. And I can share that we are off to a strong start in terms of HIV demand, which gives us confidence in our full year expectations for 2024. Moving to Liver Disease portfolio on Slide 13. Sales of $2.8 billion for the full year highlight the consistently strong and stable contribution from our Liver Disease portfolio. In the fourth quarter, sales were $691 million, flat year-over-year and down 2% sequentially, primarily driven by unfavorable pricing dynamics, offset by higher HCV market share and our efforts to increase linkage to care, in addition to growing HDV demand in new and existing European geographies. In HCV, we continue to reinforce Gilead\u2019s leadership with market share of over 60% in the US and over 50% in Europe. While we continue to expect the rate of HCV new starts to trend downwards over time, given the curative nature of our medicines, demand growth in both HDV and HBV is largely offsetting that headwind. Onto Slide 14. Veklury sales continue to be highly variable with the fourth quarter down 28% year-over- year, though up 13% sequentially due to higher COVID-related hospitalizations in the fourth quarter. For the full-year, Veklury sales of $2.2 billion exceeded the expectations we set out at the beginning of 2023. Turning to Slide 15, our Oncology business has achieved an annualized run-rate that now exceeds $3 billion with strong fourth quarter sales of $765 million, up 24% year-over-year. In just three years, Trodelvy revenue has grown to more than $1 billion, and we continue to see strong growth across our approved indications. And in Cell Therapy, sales approached $2 billion in 2023 and Kite remains firmly established as the leading provider of CAR T-cell therapies globally. Looking more closely at Trodelvy on Slide 16, sales for the full year were $1.1 billion, up 56% year-over-year. For the fourth quarter, sales were $299 million, up 53% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. With over 30,000 patients treated to date, Trodelvy\u2019s solid demand trends continue to reinforce its robust clinical profile as the only TROP2-directed antibody-drug conjugate approved and available in multiple tumor types. Awareness and utilization continue to increase, driving notable share gains. In second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, approximately one-third of patients are receiving Trodelvy, reinforcing its position as the leading regimen across the US and other major markets. In pre-treated HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer, we\u2019re encouraged to see share growth overall, driven by increasing adoption in the IHC0 setting as well as continued use in HER2-low. Additionally, we look forward to potentially making Trodelvy more broadly available in metastatic bladder cancer. Data from the confirmatory Phase 3 TROPiCS-04 study in the first half of the year could enable global filings and subsequent launches, as well as potentially drive adoption in the US, altogether expanding Trodelvy\u2019s potential reach to nearly 25,000 second-line plus patients with metastatic bladder cancer. Turning to Slide 17, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, Cell Therapy sales of $1.9 billion in 2023 grew 28% from 2022, driven by impressive growth, particularly outside the US as we expanded our network of authorized treatment centers, and secured reimbursement following recent approvals. In the fourth quarter, Cell Therapy product sales were $466 million, up 11% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially, with strong growth in both Yescarta and Tecartus in Europe and other international markets, offset in part by near-term headwinds for Yescarta in the US, from both in-class and out-of-class competition. As previously discussed, CAR T class share of eligible second-line plus large B-cell lymphoma patients remains at roughly 15% in the US as growth continues to be slower-than-anticipated despite the compelling clinical data that suggests these therapies are potentially transformative for many patients. In Europe and other markets, CAR T class share in this same second-line plus setting continues to be stronger, at approximately 30%. Following a restructuring in November, the Kite team has been focused on extending the reach of cell therapies from primarily academic medical centers to community practices, especially in the US. In late 2023, we established partnerships with leading community networks, which include over 1,750 physicians nationally. We are certifying affiliated practices to become authorized treatment centers to provide Kite cell therapies. So far, we\u2019ve made notable headway across centers in the southeast United States, for example, that operate over 40 locations to serve cancer patients. We expect to see the initial impact of these initiatives in mid-2024. In the meantime, we expect our Cell Therapy business to be flat to slightly up in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Importantly, alongside our 96% reliability rate, we\u2019re also thrilled to share that we have shortened our manufacturing time in the US by two days for Yescarta, bringing our anticipated median turnaround time to 14 days. This further extends our industry leadership in terms of manufacturing, and the Kite team continues to innovate in this critical element of the cell therapy business. We look forward to inviting you to visit one of our manufacturing facilities later this quarter during an analyst and investor event. In conclusion, I would like to thank our teams for a strong 2023 performance and setting up such great momentum for continued growth in 2024. The team is excited to continue to make our medicines accessible to all those who can benefit from them. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Merdad. Merdad Parsey : Thank you, Johanna. We\u2019ve had a busy start to 2024, and I\u2019ll begin by discussing the results of our EVOKE-01 study in second-line plus metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and our Phase 3 OAKTREE study of obeldesivir in standard-risk, non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19. While we are disappointed that these studies did not meet their primary endpoints, we are also encouraged by what we are learning from the data to inform our clinical programs and support our commitment to deliver innovative new therapies for patients. Let me cover each of these readouts in turn. First, on Slide 19, our Phase 3 study of Trodelvy in second-line plus metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, EVOKE-01, missed its primary endpoint of overall survival in this hard-to-treat setting. We plan to share the detailed data at the earliest opportunity. In the meantime, we\u2019d like to highlight what we believe to be important set of observations from EVOKE-01 that give us continued confidence in Trodelvy as a pipeline-in-a product and its potential to benefit some patients with lung cancer : We saw a numerical improvement favoring Trodelvy, including in patients with both squamous and non-squamous histologies. This is encouraging for our ongoing Phase 3 EVOKE-03 first-line trial evaluating Trodelvy in PD-L1 high patients, in combination with pembrolizumab. Importantly, Trodelvy continues to demonstrate a potentially differentiated safety, efficacy, and tolerability profile, with an adverse event profile that is consistent with our label. Further, Trodelvy achieved more than three months of improvement in median overall survival in a pre-specified subgroup of patients non-responsive to their prior anti-PD-L1 therapy. This subgroup is defined as those who achieved stable disease or progressive disease as their best outcome to last prior I/O therapy, and represented more than 60% of the trial population. This analysis was not alpha-controlled for formal statistical testing, and we are continuing to analyze these data. We will discuss these data with regulators and KOLs to determine the best path forward. As a reminder, we required all patients to have received prior I/O therapy, regardless of driver mutation status, and responsiveness to prior I/O was a stratification factor. Additional analyses, including TROP2 expression, are ongoing and we will share these data as quickly as possible. Based on these observations and the data from the ongoing EVOKE-02 study, we remain confident in Trodelvy\u2019s potential in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. For now, given these findings, we currently do not plan changes to our Phase 3 EVOKE-03 study that is enrolling as expected. Moving to Slide 20, our novel twice-daily, oral antiviral, obeldesivir, did not demonstrate statistically significant symptom relief in standard-risk, non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in our Phase 3 OAKTREE trial. Obeldesivir was well-tolerated in this large study population, and we will share the data at a future medical meeting. Overall, the OAKTREE results reflect the decreasing severity and duration of COVID-19 symptoms observed in standard-risk patients, driven by the evolution of variants and improved immunity to COVID-19 in our trial population. The time to symptom alleviation in untreated, standard-risk patients is now less than a week, as compared to almost two weeks at the peak of the pandemic. As a result, it was challenging for obeldesivir to show a benefit in the standard-risk population. We continue to assess whether obeldesivir could address other virologic infections given the broad antiviral activity that we have observed in preclinical data. Moving to another clinical update in Oncology, the Phase 3 ENHANCE-3 trial evaluating magrolimab in front-line unfit AML has been discontinued based on a futility analysis and a higher observed incidence of Grade 5 serious adverse events. Following the discontinuation of ENHANCE and ENHANCE-2 last year, we do not plan further development of magrolimab in hematologic cancers. Wrapping up on clinical updates, I want to thank all those who were involved with EVOKE-01, OAKTREE and ENHANCE-3. Every trial adds important advancements in our understanding of the treatment of these diseases and will inform our future development plans. We look forward to sharing more on that in due course. Transitioning to our HIV program on Slide 21, we expect the Phase 3 readout of PURPOSE-1 evaluating lenacapavir for HIV prevention later this year. Along with PURPOSE-2, expected in late 2024 or early 2025, PURPOSE-1 forms the basis of our potential regulatory filing. We continue to target our first approval for lenacapavir in prevention in late 2025, potentially making lenacapavir the first twice-yearly dosing regimen available for PrEP. Looking at our HIV program more broadly, you can see we will be sharing at least nine updates this year across our next generation daily, weekly, three-monthly, and twice-yearly programs, all based on lenacapavir, our novel, first-in-class long-acting capsid inhibitor. We are excited to have over 75 presentations at CROI this year across Gilead-led and supported studies. Among them, some notable updates from our treatment pipeline include, encouraging data from our Phase 2 ARTISTRY-1 trial evaluating our lenacapavir and bictegravir once-daily oral. We are exploring this combination as a potential additional option for virologically suppressed people living with HIV, Phase 1 data on GS-1720, our once-weekly oral integrase inhibitor, and Phase 2 data on lenacapavir plus islatravir, our once-weekly oral combination in development with Merck. In the second half of this year, we look forward to providing an update on the Phase 2 trial evaluating lenacapavir plus bNAbs as a twice-yearly regimen. Turning to Cell Therapy on Slide 22, you may have seen that FDA recently proposed safety label changes for all approved CD19 and BCMA CAR T-cell therapies, including Yescarta and Tecartus. There is no change to our confidence in the benefit-risk profile of Yescarta and Tecartus. Based on analysis of our Global Safety Database, with over 16,800 patients treated with Yescarta, there has been no causal link established between Yescarta and those reported to the FDA public safety dashboard. Additionally, no cases of T-cell malignancies have been reported with Tecartus. In the fourth quarter of last year, we presented 26 abstracts at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December, showing that Yescarta and Tecartus continue to generate some of the longest follow-up and most robust datasets for cell therapies with the potential to transform patient lives. Also at ASH, our partner Arcellx presented impressive, updated data from the Phase 1 trial evaluating anito-cel in 38 patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. At a median follow-up of 26.5 months, median progression-free survival was not yet reached, despite 70% of patients having one or more high-risk prognosis factors. Given its potentially differentiated safety profile, with notably no delayed neurotoxicity to date, including parkinsonism, anito-cel has the potential to become the best-in- class BCMA CAR T. We look forward to sharing an update from the pivotal Phase 2 iMMagine-1 study and initiating an earlier-line multiple myeloma trial later this year. In terms of manufacturing, while Kite is already the clear leader, we\u2019re pleased to highlight that the FDA approved our updated process that reduces the turnaround time for Yescarta in the US from 16 days down to 14 days. This further extends our leadership in cell therapy and we continue to identify additional opportunities to reliably bring these much-needed therapies to more patients as quickly as possible. Beyond manufacturing, we have eight ongoing cell therapy trials, of which four are evaluating new indications and four are exploring earlier lines of therapy. As we formally wrap up 2023, on Slide 23, I would like to acknowledge the work of our clinical teams who executed on our ambitious and broad portfolio that extends far beyond the list shown, including, the advancement of eight new assets into the clinic, the delivery of 15 late-breaking oral presentations at major clinical congresses and the initiation of three new Phase 3 programs. For 2024, our targeted milestones laid out on Slide 24 include, an update on ASCENT-03 in first-line PD-L1 negative metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, an update on TROPiCS-04 assessing overall survival in second-line metastatic or locally-advanced bladder cancer, and an update on our Phase 3 PURPOSE-1 trial assessing lenacapavir in HIV prevention, as previously highlighted. We are also looking forward to the start of Phase 3 trials for Trodelvy in endometrial cancer, and the ARTISTRY trials evaluating lenacapavir and bictegravir oral combination for HIV treatment. Our commitment to develop innovative new therapeutic options is unchanged and we are confident that we will make progress on that commitment in 2024. And now, I hand the call over to Andy. Andrew Dickinson : Thank you Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting on Slide 26, we closed the year with total product sales of $26.9 billion, at the top-end of our guidance range due to a strong contribution from Veklury. For the full-year, total product sales, excluding Veklury, grew 7%, driven by growth in both HIV and Oncology. HIV increased 6% year-over-year, driven by Biktarvy, which grew 14% from 2022 to $11.8 billion. And, Oncology grew to $2.9 billion for the full year, an increase of $792 million or 37% from 2022. Altogether, total product sales, excluding Veklury were $24.7 billion, modestly below the lower-end of our full-year guidance range largely due to quarterly pricing variability in HIV in the fourth quarter. Importantly, HIV volumes were in line with our expectations and we are confident in our full-year revenue growth expectations for HIV in 2024. Veklury revenue of $2.2 billion exceeded our guidance of approximately $1.9 billion, and reflected higher hospitalization rates in the latter part of 2023. Compared to 2022, full year Veklury revenue declined as expected, and represented a headwind of more than $1.7 billion to total product sales. This was largely offset by almost $1.7 billion in growth from our base business, resulting in roughly flat total product sales year-over-year. On Slide 27, our non-GAAP results were largely as expected, including gross margin and operating expenses, notably R&D which showed disciplined moderation as we progressed through 2023. Non-GAAP EPS was $6.72, and within our guidance range despite the incremental $0.10 cents of acquired IPR&D associated with the Arcellx and Compugen partnerships that we announced following our guidance revision in November 2023. A quick note that our GAAP results were impacted by some restructuring expenses, primarily related to our manufacturing strategy and our activities at Kite. As we discussed in the later part of 2023, we have been taking steps to evolve our business model and expense structure to set us up for a strong 2024. As a result, our GAAP results reflect approximately $500 million of associated expenses in 2023, or $0.40 per share, and contributed to GAAP EPS of $4.40 for the full year. Moving to our fourth quarter results starting on Slide 28. Total product sales, excluding Veklury, were $6.3 billion. Including Veklury, total product sales of $7.1 billion were down 4% from the same quarter in 2022. As expected, Veklury sales decreased year-over-year due to lower rates of COVID-19 related hospitalizations. On Slide 29, you can see that on a non-GAAP basis, product gross margin was 86%, down 66 basis points from the prior year. R&D expenses were $1.5 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Acquired IPR&D was $347 million, reflecting payments related to our collaborations with Arcellx, Assembly Biosciences, and Compugen and our XinThera acquisition. SG&A was $1.6 billion, down 21% year-over-year, primarily related to the 2022 charge for the termination of the Everest collaboration that did not repeat in 2023. Excluding this 2022 charge, non-GAAP SG&A was down 1%. Operating margin was 39%, up from 37% in the fourth quarter of 2022, and effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 17%, flat compared to the prior year. Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.72 in the fourth quarter, compared to $1.67 in the fourth quarter of 2022. I\u2019ll move now to Slide 30 and our guidance which assumes a generally stable macro environment including FX at current rates. For the full-year 2024, we expect total product sales in the range of $27.1 billion to $27.5 billion. We expect total product sales, excluding Veklury, in the range of $25.8 billion to $26.2 billion, representing growth of 4% to 6% for our base business year-over-year. Within total product sales, and as Johanna discussed, we expect HIV revenue to grow approximately 4%, and we expect Veklury sales of approximately $1.3 billion although, as always, we caution you that Veklury sales remain highly variable depending on hospitalization rates. We do not expect to update our Veklury guidance until our third quarter earnings call, absent a very clear trend in COVID-19 infections. Moving to the rest of the P&L, and on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product gross margin to range between 85% and 86%, modestly lower than the 86.1% reported in 2023 due to the growing contribution from our oncology portfolio. We expect R&D to grow by a low to mid-single digit percentage compared to 2023, highlighting the substantial moderation in expense growth as we approach a steadier state of active Phase 3 programs. We expect acquired IPR&D to be approximately $350 million. Consistent with our approach in 2023, we will highlight incremental acquired IPR&D expenses as we announce new transactions and update our guidance each quarter. And we expect SG&A to decline by a mid-single digit percentage compared to 2023. Excluding the $525 million legal settlement in 2023, we expect SG&A to grow in the low-to-mid single digit percentage range compared to SG&A of $5.5 billion in 2023, excluding this settlement. As a result, we expect our operating income for 2024 to be between $11.2 billion and $11.7 billion. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. And finally, we expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $6.85 and $7.25 for the full year, and GAAP diluted EPS to be between $5.15 and $5.55. As a reminder, for the first quarter of 2024, we expect HIV to decline sequentially in the 10-12% range from Q4 2023, similar to what we saw in the first quarter of 2023, and Cell Therapy to be flat to slightly up from Q4 of 2023. Moving to capital allocation on Slide 31, our priorities have not changed. In 2023, we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders. This included $3.8 billion in dividend payments and $1 billion in share repurchases. Fourth quarter share repurchases were $150 million. For 2024, we announced today a 2.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.77 per share and we remain committed to growing our dividend over time, in-line with earnings growth. You can also expect to see continued investments in our business both internally and externally through select partnerships and business development transactions. Finally, we will continue to utilize share repurchases to offset equity dilution, as well as additional repurchases on an opportunistic basis. With that, I\u2019ll invite the Operator to begin the Q&A. Operator : Of course, Andrew. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren with TD Cowen. Your line is now open. Tyler Van Buren : Hey guys, good afternoon. Regarding the 2024 product sales guidance, I understand you guys are guiding to a near $900 million sales drop-off year over year for Veklury, but the guidance, ex- Veklury looks to be a 5% year-over-year growth at the midpoint versus 7% for this year. So what do you view as some of the levers to ex-Veklury product sales guidance in 2024 where we could see upside? Daniel O\u2019Day: Thanks, Tyler. Welcome. Let's have Andy start, please. Thanks. Andrew Dickinson : Hey, Tyler. It's Andy. Thanks for the question. You're absolutely right. Our product sales guidance for products excluding Veklury implies 4% to 6% growth year-over-year, again continuing the trend of strong growth that you've seen over the last two years. I'd also highlight that it implies a substantial moderation of our operating expense growth, which is an important piece of the puzzle that we spent a lot of time talking about. To your question specifically on product growth, the growth drivers for 2024 are the same as the growth drivers last year. You continue to see strong growth in our HIV business. As you see in the quarter, you really need to focus on the full year for the HIV to see the growth trend. And we saw another year of very strong growth across our HIV business for the full year in \u201823. We expect the same thing in \u201824. And you heard on the call that we're expecting at least 4% growth for the HIV business next year. And then of course, the Cell Therapy business and Trodelvy are expected to continue to grow as well. So those are the key growth drivers. We look forward to updating you throughout the year, but we're excited about the set up as we move into 2024. Jacquie Ross : Victoria, may we have our next question? Operator : Thank you so much. Of course, Thank you so much for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Salveen Richter : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On business development, you have noted the potential for a $5 billion to $6 billion deal in Oncology or [I&I] (ph). Where are you seeing the greatest opportunity to leverage your current clinical and commercial infrastructure? Thank you. Daniel O\u2019Day: Great. Thanks, Salveen. This is Dan. Maybe I'll start and then ask others to add, but appreciate the question. I think just to reinforce our M&A strategy, I mean, nothing has changed from a business development perspective. And particularly, that's against the context of the background of nearly doubling our clinical trials underway over the past four years, multiple late stage results. As you know, we're expecting more than 20 results still this year and against the backdrop of no significant patent expirations in our business until early parts of the next decade. So I think we'll continue to be opportunistic about pursuing business development in the three areas that we are focused on, which is obviously Virology, Oncology, and Inflammation. We'll be driven by the science. We continue to articulate that building our late research, early development pipeline is probably one of our biggest focuses and we'll continue to look at later stage deals as they fit into our portfolio and our range. It might also be important to note that we are back to pre-immunomatics levels now relative to our leverage ratios. And so we're comfortable with our ability to put capital to work. But nothing has changed and we feel we have everything within Gilead right now to achieve our ambitions over the second half of this decade. Jacquie Ross : Victoria, may we have our next question, please? Operator : Of course. The next question comes from a line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is now open. Leon Wang : Hi, this is Leon. Hi, this is Leon Wang on for Carter. Thanks for taking my question. So at this point, what conviction do you have anito-cel will differentiate on neurotox or parkinsonism versus your competitors? And if the lack of neurotox data recapitulate later this year, would that be a de-risking in your view and how important would that be in the market? Thank you. Daniel O\u2019Day: Thank you, Leon. So we've got Cindy Perettie here to handle that. Thanks. Cindy Perettie : Thank you. Thank you for the question. I think with the anito-cel data, we expect to complete the enrollment of our IMAGINE-1 study this year, where we would have then 100 patients worth of data. And obviously, we're going to continue to look for safety signals, neurotox as you suggested but to date, we have not observed any. Your second part of that question was do we see that as a differentiator and I would definitely see that as a differentiator in the marketplace if we were to come forward with a differentiated safety profile. I think the other component to remind you of is we also believe it's possible to have a differentiated efficacy profile. And today, based on the D-domain and our transduction efficiency, we're able to use half the dose that we're seeing with our competitors, and that could play both with safety and efficacy. Thank you. Jacquie Ross : Great. Victoria, we are ready for our next question, please? Operator : Of course. Our next question comes from the line of Terrence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Terrence Flynn : Thanks so much for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could speak to your confidence level in Trodelvy in the front line, non-small cell lung trial setting here, given the EVOKE-01 data, and if you're considering any potential changes to that frontline trial as a result? Thank you. Merdad Parsey : Hi, Terrence, this is Merdad. I think when we have looked at the data so far, And we're looking forward to sharing it with everyone as quickly as we can, probably one of the most important things in that dataset that confirmed where we were before is that we have not seen a difference in response rates between squamous cell carcinoma and non-squamous cell carcinoma. I think that was a bit of an overhang in the fall. And as we had mentioned earlier, we had not seen that to date, and that has been bolstered by the results of EVOKE-01. So we do think that that increases our confidence that we don't need to think about -- look at that. Now there are other analyses we need to do to make sure that there are other predictors of response or not, and we'll be doing that and we'll be sharing that over time. But right now, our overall confidence in Trodelvy, broadly speaking, remains very high. We have three approvals and we have a broad development program against which we are executing really well. We continue to have additional trials that we'll read out this year in Phase 3, specifically the [TROPHY-U-04] (ph) study that we'll be looking at the bladder cancer confirmation study with hopefully an OS signal. That study could actually give us beyond confirmatory trial in the US. It allows us to open conversations with regulators outside the US. And then we have promised an update on ASCENT-03 in breast cancer, which we also think will broaden that. And then we now have a number of trials going on in a variety of indications, including ones we've mentioned in, for example, endometrial cancer. So overall, what we've seen EVOKE-01, and we're looking forward to sharing with you, really maintains our level of enthusiasm about Trodelvy\u2019s term potential from an efficacy and safety standpoint across the board, and we have no plans to change EVOKE-03 at this time. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Your line is now open. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Look, it's very well understood for folks in the biopharma community that no one can truly understand the full safety profile of any new drug based on Phase 1 data. But this point has a lot of implications for your TAF litigation, obviously. So my question is, in a scenario where the Supreme Court takes up your petition, would that potentially be a venue where you could prove the level of evidence that's actually needed to make a decision on exception to duty and the type of decisions to make? Daniel O\u2019Day: All right. I think Andy is going to take this one. Andrew Dickinson : Hi, Umer. Yeah, thanks for the question. Yes, of course, I mean, in front of the Supreme Court, just like the appellate court, we'll be able to present the facts and our arguments as you'd expect. If you look at some of the briefing documents in the appellate court, I think they spell that out very clearly in terms of what happened over time with the development of TAF and what we knew at different points in time. And that would be available, as you'd expect, not only to the appellate court, but to the Supreme Court. And of course, those same facts would be presented at any trial if we ever get to that point. One other update on the TAF litigation, again, Umer, nothing's changed from our perspective. We continue to have a lot of confidence. The one update I can provide is that the -- one of the very first trial in the federal court has been dismissed as of yesterday, I believe. So it now looks like, and again, this is consistent, as you know, with thousands of other cases. I think it's now over 5,300 cases that have been dismissed by the courts, over 4,300 in the California state courts and over 1,000 in the federal courts before they get to trial. So the first bellwether trial in the federal courts, Umar, would now be in November instead of April. So we'll keep you up to date and thanks for your question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Brayer with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open. Olivia Brayer : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for the question. What were some of the dynamics that happened with Yescarta this quarter? And how should we be thinking about growth for 2024 from your Cell Therapy franchise, just in light of the sequentially down quarter in 4Q? Thanks. Cindy Perettie : Thanks a lot, Olivia, for the question. This is Cindy. We continue to be the leaders in Cell Therapy. And I think the piece that Johanna mentioned is that we are looking at how do we expand beyond the existing ATCs. So the dynamics that we observed this quarter were capacity constraints within the existing ATCs that we have. We saw a little bit of in-class and out-of-class competition. And in parallel, we have been continuing to work on expanding our ATCs. So today we have over 400 ATCs globally. We are moving out of urban centers and those academic centers into the community to meet patients where they are. As Andy suggested, that -- bringing up those ATCs in the community is going to be really important part of our future strategy, but it does take a little bit longer than bringing an academic center up. So we expect to be flat to slightly up in quarter one, and you'll start to see that return to growth in the second half of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Geoff Meacham : Great, thank you. We have another one on Cell Therapy but more on the profitability. This is a franchise that's almost $2 billion in sales. You guys have improved the turnaround time. You've reached scale. You've treated a ton of patients. What can you tell us about the progress that you've made to making this a profitable franchise? I'm just thinking not for the current products, but also looking out five years plus. Thank you. Andrew Dickinson : Hey, Geoff, it\u2019s Andy. Thanks for the question. It's a great question. You're absolutely right. The Cell Therapy business has made tremendous progress over the last five or six years and evidenced most recently by the faster turnaround time in manufacturing that we talked about on our prepared remarks, going from 16 days to 14 days. And again, it's just the beginning from our perspective of what we can continue to do with this business. So while we don't provide specific guidance, we have said when we announced the Kite transaction that we expected to be profitable, breakeven or profitable and accretive by the end of year four. We got there shortly after that. All of the metrics that we look at on the business have improved over time. We've continued to make significant progress on our manufacturing efficiency, manufacturing costs, despite the fact that we've opened three global manufacturing centers. And each time you do that, when you move to commercial manufacturing, it impacts your gross margin. So I'm really proud of what the team has done. And same thing on the operating costs. You see in the fourth quarter, we announced some restructuring charges, Geoff, that hit our GAAP results. Part of that was a restructuring at Kite. Cindy and her team looked at the structure and made changes to the structure that we think will continue to drive growth and efficiency in the business over the long run. So maybe the last thing I'd say is that when we look at the business, this is a business that we have line of sight to biologics margins and profitability. We're really growing the business, Geoff, as you know, for long-term sustainability and growth and less near-term profitability, but it's certainly exciting that the business is doing as well as it is. Cindy Perettie : I think the only thing I would add to Andy's comment is beyond the three manufacturing facilities, we also have our own viral vector facility. So given the fact that viral vector has had some supply challenges, That's something that we are not suffering from. So we own these sort of end-to-end cost of goods for our products. Jacquie Ross : Can we have our next question please, Victoria? Operator : Of course. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Michael Yee : Hey, guys. Thank you for the question. We have a HIV question. There were some comments around the dynamics of the channel mix as it relates to HIV pricing. And I was wondering if you could just remind us about what the driver of the benefit was in \u201822 and \u201823 and how that changed as we go into \u201824 and why the difficulty comps? Is that a change in mix between commercial and Medicaid [indiscernible] just explain that that would help us understand what's going on there for 2024? Thank you. Johanna Mercier : Sure, Michael. Hi, it's Johanna. Let me take that one. So what you're referring to is actually we saw some pricing favorability in Q4 of \u201822 and the first half of 2023. That pricing favorability was namely driven by actually just the inflation being so high and therefore some of our rebates are actually based on that inflation rate. And so therefore there was actually upside during those quarters. We knew that that was not going to repeat itself. So we had kind of shared with you, I think, from Q3 on that this was going to normalize. And so that was kind of what happened in the first half of 2023. As we think about the second half of 2023, and mainly the fourth quarter, what we did see there is very strong demand, and that continued throughout the whole year, but we had some fluctuations, some quarterly variabilities, mainly due to channel mix and more government channels resulting in lower average realized price because of higher rebates. And so you really have to look at it on a full year basis. And so that's why it's so important to know that HIV performance on it will always have some quarterly variabilities. And we always need to look at the full year to really get the full picture of what's going on. HIV for the full year of 2023 grew 6% with nearly $1 billion in revenue growth driven by Biktarvy obviously growing at 14% and at 48% share with 3% share growth in that year outpacing all competitors. And so we're really proud of the demand driven results that we've seen in 2023. And as we think about 2024 and our predictions for \u201824, we believe that our expectations is going to be in line with HIV treatment, which is still about 2 to 3 points. Layer on top of that, the demand growth from Biktarvy and Descovy for PrEP, and that's why we're expecting about a 4% growth in HIV. So that gives you the full picture of what's going on and what happened in the past. So we don't expect that on a yearly basis, but on a quarterly basis we do expect that variability and I would expect that that will continue as we move forward. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the question. Can you just talk about the TIGIT program and what drove the decision to step up your investments here? And maybe as part of that, can you elaborate a little bit more on the decision to de-emphasize the PD-L1 high population in favor of the [indiscernible]. So any color there would be appreciated. Thank you. Andrew Dickinson : Hey, Chris, it's Andy. Maybe I'll start on the TIGIT program and the revised agreement with Arcus that we announced last week, and then Merdad can answer the second part of your question. It's relatively simple. If you step back, you've heard us say this before, but I'd reiterate that we value the partnership that we have with Arcus and the programs that their team has developed. And the recent updates to your question to the partnership really allow both companies to more efficiently deploy our teams and capital. We also focused on streamlining decision-making and the additional capital allows us to expand the overall clinical study footprint. So there are a number of things that both companies accomplish through the amendment. It does reinforce our support and belief in their programs broadly, not just TIGIT. There's a lot to be excited about there that you'll see play out over the coming years. Merdad Parsey : And excuse me, this is Merdad. I think you're referring to the ARC-10 study. And as you may recall, we started that study together with Arcus back in 2021 outside the US with a chemo comparator arm. And at the time, there was really limited access to PD-1 -- PD-L1 inhibitors outside the US. And so, we subsequently updated that study march of last year to include PD-L1 inhibitors as the standard of care was evolving. It took us time to get this all going. And while that was happening, we had a number of competitors launch similar trials in the space with their TIGIT antibodies. So as a result of all that, the enrollment for the ARC-10 trial wasn't as robust as we had hoped for and as it had been. And STAR-121, which is the all-comer study, was recruiting very well. And so we decided to really prioritize our efforts for that all-comers population where we think we could be first or second in class. And it was really a prioritization to ensure that we could stay ahead and keep moving the molecules forward as quickly as possible. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Brian Abrahams : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking my question. I realize this is pending KOL and regulatory discussions, but I was wondering if you could frame the potential next steps for the PD-L1 poor responders. Do you think this is a fileable population for Trodelvy in second-line lung, or might you also consider running another study in that population? And along those lines, I'm curious what you're expecting to see from the updated EVOKE-02 data this year and how that might shape your overall plans for Trodelvy in lung? Thanks. Merdad Parsey : Sure. This is Merdad again, Brian. So maybe I'll take the second part first. On EVOKE-02, as you can imagine, we showed last year ORR data and [Technical Difficulty]",

In a moment, we'll begin our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] I'll now hand the call over to Jacquie Ross, VP, Investor Relations and Corporate Strategic Finance. Jacquie Ross : Thank you, Rebecca. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the first quarter of 2024. The press release, slides and supplementary data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open Q&A where the team will be joined by Cindy Perettie, the Executive Vice President of Kite. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. Please refer to Slide 2 regarding the risks and uncertainties relating to forward-looking statements that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan. Daniel O'Day: Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to start by thanking the Gilead teams for delivering a strong first quarter, which you see in our commercial performance and our clinical execution. Total product sales, excluding Veklury, grew 6% year-over-year to $6.1 billion, driven by higher demand across HIV, oncology and liver disease. Veklury sales continue to track with the rates of hospitalization for COVID-19 and reached a total of $555 million. Once again, sales growth for the quarter reflected the diversity of our portfolio. HIV product sales grew 4% year-over-year. Oncology product sales were up 18%, driven by Trodelvy, which is well established as the #1 regimen for second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and by our transformative cell therapies. As we outlined at the recent Kite analyst event in Maryland, we have exciting plans to build on our clear market leadership in cell therapy, such as expand into community networks in the U.S., more than double our manufacturing capacity, and move into new indications and disease areas with next-generation products. From an EPS perspective, first quarter results reflect the close of the CymaBay acquisition with an inquired IP R&D charge of $3.9 billion or an expense of $3.14 per share. Excluding this charge, non-GAAP diluted EPS would have been $1.82 for the first quarter, which is above expectations, driven by higher product sales. The CymaBay acquisition brings us an important registrational medicine, seladelpar, which has the potential to address significant unmet need in liver disease. We have filed for regulatory approval of seladelpar as a treatment for primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC, with both FDA and EMA, and we expect an FDA regulatory decision in August. If approved, we will leverage our industry-leading commercial infrastructure and long-standing expertise in liver disease to bring seladelpar a potentially transformative therapy to people with PBC who might benefit. Moving to clinical execution. We're very pleased with momentum in our HIV pipeline, which was reflected in our 80 data abstracts at CROI. Based on the strength of the data, we've initiated Phase III trials for bictegravir and lenacapavir, our novel once-daily oral regimen, and plan to advance once weekly oral programs, including lenacapavir plus islatravir into Phase III.  Later this year, we will host an HIV analyst event to share details of how we will further shape the HIV landscape with innovative options for prevention and treatment, including the next wave of long-acting therapies. Before I pass it to Johanna, I will briefly recap our 2024 milestones on Slide 6. We have already achieved first patient in for the Phase III ARTISTRY-1 and ARTISTRY-2 trials, evaluating once-daily lenacapavir in combination with bictegravir as well as Phase II first patient in for SWIFT evaluating GS-1427, our oral alpha-4-beta-7 inhibitor. We are also on track for our upcoming milestones, including updates from 3 Phase III clinical trials for Trodelvy and lenacapavir. Looking ahead to the rest of 2024, this is a time of focused execution for Gilead. We will see disciplined and agile in our approach, and we will focus the organization on both near-term execution and longer-term plans. With 54 clinical programs in play, no major patent expiration for the decade and many opportunities for growth, we have a lot of potential and a lot to deliver. My thanks again to the Gilead teams for their great work this quarter and the ongoing progress across our diverse portfolio of therapies. With that, I'll hand it over to Johanna. Johanna Mercier : Thanks, Dan, and Good after noon, everyone. With the first quarter marking the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for our base business, our teams delivered a strong start to 2024, notably navigating the seasonal first quarter dynamics and establishing a firm base on which we can continue to build this year. Beginning on Slide 8, total product sales, excluding Veklury, were $6.1 billion for the first quarter, up 6% year-one, reflecting solid growth of our HIV, oncology and liver disease businesses. Including Veklury, total product sales were $6.6 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Moving to HIV on Slide 9. Sales were up 4% year-over-year to $4.3 billion, primarily driven by higher demand as well as favorable pricing dynamics in Europe that are not expected to repeat. Quarter-over-quarter sales were down 7%, driven by the typical seasonality we experienced in the first quarter of the year, partially offset by higher demand. As a reminder, quarterly HIV growth is, in general, more variable and less indicative of overall trends than the full year. This is evident in the first quarter of every year where inventory drawdown typically occurs following a build that generally happens towards the end of the prior year and patient co-pays and deductibles start of every year, and together with shifts in channel mix lowers average realized price in the first quarter. As always, we typically see these quarterly pricing and inventory dynamics normalize as we progress throughout the year. We continue to expect approximately 4% HIV sales growth for 2024. Supporting that outlook, the treatment market grew in line with our expectations, as shown on Slide 10. Biktarvy remains the leading regimen for HIV treatment across major markets for new starts as well as for those switching regimens with sales up 10% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, reflecting strong demand. Quarter-over-quarter, sales were down 5% as the higher demand was offset by the typical seasonal factors discussed earlier. It's notable that 6 years after launch, Biktarvy continues to gain market share in the U.S. up 3 percentage points year-over-year to approximately 49% share and once again, outpacing all other branded regimens for HIV treatment. Moreover, we continue to see Biktarvy's benefit extend into broader populations of people with HIV. Most recently, Biktarvy was granted FDA approval for use in virologically suppressed individuals with known or suspected M184 resistance, a common form of treatment resistance. Turning to prevention. Descovy sales were down 5% year-over-year to $426 million, driven by lower average realized price due to channel mix, partially offset by higher demand. Sequentially, sales were down 16%, reflecting the seasonal dynamics discussed earlier, partially offset by higher demand. While market volumes in February were temporarily disrupted by the cyberattack on Change Healthcare, volumes readily recovered in March. Overall, the PrEP market continued to demonstrate robust growth, up over 11% in the first quarter, with Descovy maintaining over 40%  PrEP market share in the U.S. despite the availability of other regimens, including generics. This is a solid setup as we look to potentially launch lenacapavir as early as late next year as the first and only twice yearly subcutaneous prevention option. Given Gilead's strong commercial foundation across treatment and prevention, we are well positioned to maintain leadership in HIV as we look to the evolving marketplace of daily orals, long-acting orals and long-acting injectables. Moving to liver disease on Slide 11. Sales for the first quarter were $737 million, up 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable inventory dynamics and the timing of purchases by the Department of Corrections for our HCV products as well as higher demand across HCV, HBV and HDV. Sequentially, sales were up 7%, primarily reflecting the timing of HCV purchases. Despite fewer HCV starts globally year-over-year, our viral hepatitis portfolio overall has remained stable and continues to be a meaningful contributor to our commercial performance. This strength is underpinned by our extensive global footprint and expertise in the treatment of liver diseases. To that end, pending approval, Gilead is excited to bring seladelpar to patients for the treatment of certain adults with PBC, impacting approximately 130,000 people in the U.S. and about 125,000 people in Europe. With the sales force that covers almost 80% of the U.S. prescriber base for PBC, we expect to readily make seladelpar available to patients upon approval in the second half of this year. Seladelpar has demonstrated the potential to be best-in-class with a differentiated clinical profile to existing and emerging therapies, particularly on a key symptom of the disease, pruritus. Following its launch in 2024, we expect seladelpar to contribute modestly to sales and more meaningfully in 2025 and beyond. Turning to Slide 12. Veklury continues to be the standard of care antiviral for hospitalized patients treated with COVID-19, with market share well over 60% in the United States. COVID-related hospitalizations were lower in the first quarter with the winter wave peaking earlier than expected in the U.S. and Europe as compared to other regions such as Japan. As a result, Veklury sales overall were down 3% year-over-year and down 23% sequentially to $555 million. Shifting to oncology on Slide 13. Sales were up 18% year-over-year to $789 million and are now firmly above a $3 billion annual run rate. Having treated over 50,000 patients to date, we look forward to bringing our portfolio of medicines and future treatments across lines of therapies and tumor types to many more patients around the world. Moving to Slide 14. Trodelvy sales for the first quarter exceeded $300 million, up 39% year-over-year, reflecting continued demand. Sequentially, sales were up 3%, primarily driven by demand outside the U.S. as well as unfavorable fourth quarter pricing dynamics in Europe that did not repeat. This was partially offset by inventory dynamics in the U.S. where we saw a drawdown in the first quarter. Overall, Trodelvy\u2019's strong market share reflects its awareness amongst providers and patients. In second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, Trodelvy remains the leading regimen with approximately 1/3 in the U.S. And in the pre-treated HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer setting, Trodelvy has demonstrated continued adoption, most notably in the IHC0 setting. We are confident Trodelvy continues to differentiate itself with its safety profile and clinically meaningful survival benefits, with over 30,000 patients across tumor types already treated to date. We look forward to potentially extending Trodelvy\u2019s reach to many more patients in the years ahead particularly in bladder cancer, earlier-line breast cancer settings, and lung cancer. Turning to Slide 15, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, Cell Therapy sales were $480 million in the first quarter, up 7% year-over-year. Sequentially, sales were up 3%, in-line with our guidance of flat to slightly up. We\u2019're pleased to see continued demand for Yescarta and Tecartus in both existing and new markets across Europe and other geographies, such as in Japan where we have seen good progress in growing brand share and expanding our network of authorized treatment centers to over 20 to date. In the U.S., and consistent with our recent updates, we see opportunity for growth through expanding the number of authorized treatment centers and affiliated satellites, while also driving increased referrals from the community setting.  For example, we're proud to have established our flagship community collaboration with Tennessee Oncology in the first quarter. We\u2019've identified many critical learnings on how we can partner effectively with community oncology practices for cell therapy, and we will continue to refine this \u201cblueprint\u201d so that we become more efficient at onboarding new centers over time. We expect to start seeing the Impact from this initiative towards the end of 2024. Wrapping up the first quarter, we had a strong start to the year, primarily driven by higher demand across each of our core businesses year-over-year. We look forward to carrying this momentum through 2024 and as we bring seladelpar to market later this year following approval. I\u2019d like to thank the commercial teams and cross-functional partners across Gilead and Kite for their strong execution as we diligently expand our therapies to new populations, positively impacting more people all around the world. And with that, I\u2019'll hand the call over to Merdad. Merdad Parsey : Thank you, Johanna. We have had a busy first quarter at Gilead, with a cadence of clinical readouts that will continue throughout the rest of the year. Importantly, we anticipate an FDA regulatory decision on seladelpar and 3 Phase III updates across HIV prevention, bladder cancer, and breast cancer. Starting on Slide 17, we continue to progress our industry-leading Virology pipeline, which is building momentum following a data-rich presence at CROI in March. This included robust virologic suppression data from our once-daily oral combination of bictegravir with Lenacapavir from the Phase III portion of the ARTISTRY-1 trial. This novel combination has the potential to benefit people with HIV on complex regimens. We have since started 2 Phase III trials of this combination, one in virologically suppressed individuals and another in virologically suppressed treatment-experienced individuals. We expect to complete enrollment in the first half of 2025. We also have 2 once-weekly oral programs : first, a combination of lenacapavir with Merck\u2019s NRTTI, islatravir, in virologically suppressed people with HIV, expected to advance into Phase III later this year. And second, a combination of a capsid inhibitor with GS-1720, our novel oral integrase inhibitor. We're working to advance this combination into a Phase III study. This second program has the potential to be the first once-weekly oral regimen containing an INSTI agent. INSTIs are the standard-of-care treatment for HIV, and an important treatment option for clinicians who continue to prefer INSTI-based regimens.  Finally, we presented Phase Ib data from our twice-yearly parenteral program of lenacapavir plus our 2 broadly neutralizing antibodies for people with HIV at CROI, and we intend to share data from the Phase III study in the second half of this year. Moving to PrEP, we plan to share an update from our Phase III PURPOSE-1 trial in the second half of this year. Data from PURPOSE-01, together with data from PURPOSE-2, is expected to support the filing of Lenacapavir for HIV prevention. This PrEP option would not only offer a convenient dosing schedule as the first twice-yearly subcutaneous regimen, but could also be transformative in terms of adherence to HIV prevention regimens. Turning to Slide 18. Our Trodelvy program continues to be evaluated across a range of solid tumors with 7 Phase 3 trials currently underway across breast, bladder, and metastatic non-small cell lung cancers with plans to start the Phase III trial in endometrial cancer later this year. Abstract titles were just released yesterday for the upcoming ASCO meeting, and we'\u2019re pleased to have over a dozen Oncology presentations this year. We will be presenting late-breaking Phase III data from our second-line plus metastatic non-small cell lung cancer trial, EVOKE-01. Updated data from first-line, PD-L1 high subjects in Cohort A of the Phase III EVOKE-02 trial will also be shared. We plan on providing updates from Cohorts C and D, evaluating Trodelvy plus pembro and chemotherapy in PD-L1 all-comers at a medical congress in the second half of this year. In addition, presentations for both the Phase III EDGE-Gastric trial and Phase III ARC-9 studies will be highlighted. Depending on the timing of event accruals, we anticipate 2 more Phase III updates this year for Trodelvy. These include overall survival data from our confirmatory Phase 3 bladder cancer study, TROPiCS-04, that could support Trodelvy\u2019s submission for full regulatory approval in the U.S. and enable ex-U.S. filings. In TNBC, where Trodelvy is the only ADC to have demonstrated statistically significant improvement in overall survival in the second-line setting, we expect to share an update on the Phase III ASCENT-03 trial in first-line PD-L1 negative patients later this year. Moving on to Cell Therapy. I\u2019'm pleased to share Kite's approach to the development of novel cell therapies that Cindy and the team presented at last month\u2019's investor event. As you can see on slide 19 Yescarta and Tecartus established Kite as the leader in Cell Therapy, and we plan to potentially extend this leadership into multiple myeloma, while also paving the way for innovative next-generation constructs. On anito-cel in later-line multiple myeloma, we expect to provide a Phase III iMMagine-1 trial update in the second half of this year. This update follows the highly encouraging Phase I data presented at ASH last year, where anito-cel demonstrated durable responses with median progression-free survival not yet met at 26.5 months median follow-up \u2013and no cases of parkinsonian symptoms observed in the trial.  For our next generation cell therapy assets, we have bicistronic and optimized manufacturing constructs in Phase I trials, which are aimed at overcoming resistance mechanisms, providing potentially deeper and more sustained responses, and improving product potency. Beyond that, we have early research in allogeneic and in vivo CAR, with plans to expand into a range of other disease areas \u2013such as multiple myeloma with anito-cel, solid tumors, and autoimmune diseases. Moving to Inflammation on Slide 20. We recently completed our acquisition of CymaBay and added seladelpar, an investigational PPAR-delta agonist to our portfolio. In Phase III clinical trials, seladelpar demonstrated significant improvement in both pruritus and markers of cholestasis related to the risk of progression for PBC. As previously announced, FDA and EMA accepted our regulatory filings for seladelpar for the management of PBC in certain adult patients. We anticipate an FDA regulatory decision by August 14th and a decision from European regulators early next year. We continue to work with global regulatory authorities to expand the reach of seladelpar for PBC patients. Further, as we look at the rest of our Inflammation pipeline, we have several early phase assets that have progressed into Phase II trials, including our potentially first-in-class oral TPL2 inhibitor, a potentially best-in-class oral alpha-4-beta-7 anti-integrin, and an oral IRAK4 inhibitor. Wrapping up on Slide 21. We continue to progress on our clinical milestones for the year, and we have had 2 First Patients in and 1 data readout completed in the first quarter and we remain on-track for our remaining milestones. And now, I\u2019'll hand the call over to Andy. Andrew Dickinson : Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Beginning on Slide 23. It was a strong start to the year with our base business up 6% year-overyear. The solid growth achieved across HIV, Oncology, and Liver Disease offset the decline in Veklury, with total product sales up 5% year-over-year to $6.6 billion. As expected, our base business was down quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by seasonal inventory and pricing dynamics in HIV. Moving beyond our revenue results, 2 items significantly impacted our EPS performance in the first quarter, as shown on Slide 24. First, our GAAP and non-GAAP results included an acquired IPR&D charge of $3.9 billion or $3.14 per share, associated with the close of the CymaBay acquisition. As an asset acquisition, this transaction was fully expensed in the first quarter. This was a nondeductible expense item, and as a result, impacted our effective tax rate. Excluding this expense, our non-GAAP EPS would have been $1.82 for the first quarter, above expectations primarily driven by higher sales. The second item shown on the right hand side is an impairment charge that is included in our GAAP results and excluded from our non-GAAP results. As a reminder, this relates to the carrying value of the IPR&D indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired from Immunomedics. At the end of 2023, the carrying value was $5.9 billion, all associated with non-small cell lung cancer. As a result of the EVOKE-01 readout in late January, we have re-assessed and reduced the remaining value to $3.5 billion. This primarily reflects the smaller addressable market that Trodelvy could serve among 2L+ metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients, a delay in expected launch timing, and associated competitive activity. We remain confident that Trodelvy will deliver attractive returns over time, with sales now exceeding $1 billion a year, a strong IP portfolio, and a development program with multiple shots-on-goal in new indications as well as earlier-lines of therapy, including some opportunities not included in the initial deal model. In the meantime, you can see that the impairment impacted our first quarter GAAP EPS by $1.46 per share. Moving to the rest of our non-GAAP results on Slide 25. For the first quarter, product gross margin was down modestly to 85.4%, primarily due to product mix. R&D and SG&A were each down 2% year-over-year. This is the second consecutive quarter of operating expense declines on a year-over-year basis, reflecting our continued focus on disciplined expense management. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was a negative 30%, reflecting the nondeductibility of the CymaBay acquired IPR&D charge. Overall, our diluted earnings per share was a negative $1.32 compared to a positive $1.37 for the same period last year, primarily reflecting the $3.14 per share expense related to the CymaBay acquisition. Switching to full-year guidance on Slide 26. There is no change to our revenue expectations for 2024 at this time. We continue to expect total product sales in the range of $27.1 to $27.5 billion; and we continue to expect total product sales, excluding Veklury, in the range of $25.8 to $26.2 billion, representing growth of 4% to 6% for our base business year-over-year. Additionally, there is no change to our Veklury guidance of approximately $1.3 billion for the full year. As discussed last quarter, we do not expect to update our Veklury guidance until our third quarter earnings call, absent a very clear trend in COVID-19 infections. Shifting to the other parts of the P&L for 2024 on a non-GAAP basis. There is no change to our gross margin guidance where we continue to expect product gross margin in the range of 85% to 86%. We now expect R&D to grow at the higher end of our previous low-to-mid single digit growth range, reflecting the incremental expenses associated with the CymaBay acquisition. We continue to expect SG&A expenses to decline a mid-single digit percentage relative to 2023. On a dollar basis, SG&A is expected to be modestly higher than our previous SG&A expectations as we incorporate CymaBay expenses. However, we can manage this within the window of the previously-issued operating expense guidance. Acquired IPR&D is now expected to be approximately $4.4B, due to the CymaBay transaction as well as milestones anticipated throughout the rest of the year. Operating income is now expected in the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion, reflecting the updated acquired IPR&D guidance and the modest increase to operating expenses associated with the CymaBay transaction. Given the non-deductible impact of the CymaBay acquisition, the effective tax rate for 2024 is expected to be approximately 30%. This includes a negative impact of approximately 11% from the one-time charge for the acquisition of CymaBay. We therefore now expect diluted EPS in the range of $3.45 to $3.85. As shown on Slide 27, this has only been updated to reflect the transactions that were closed in the first quarter of 2024. Excluding these charges, you can see that we are comfortably within the range of the EPS guidance we shared back in early February. On a GAAP basis, we expect full year 2024 diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.10 and $0.50. Moving to Slide 28. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged with sufficient flexibility in our balance sheet. Specifically, as demonstrated in the first quarter, we announced a 2.7% increase to our quarterly dividend and returned approximately $1.4 billion to shareholders. In addition, we acquired CymaBay for $4.3 billion, adding seladelpar to our portfolio. Overall, we\u2019'll continue to be disciplined in our use of capital. And while we will continue to be flexible and opportunistic\u2013, it is unlikely that Gilead will be engaging in any sizeable M&A transactions in the near-term. Before I wrap it up, on Slide 29, a quick note on our expectations now that the CymaBay transaction has closed. Pending regulatory approval, we expect to launch seladelpar in the U.S. before the end of 2024, as Johanna highlighted earlier, with a modest revenue contribution expected this year. Additionally, we have shared that the transaction is expected to add to operating expenses this year as we make incremental investments to support the launch as well as other R&D efforts, all of which we are able to manage within the window of the previously-issued operating expense guidance. And as we look ahead, while the transaction will be dilutive to our EPS this year, we expect the deal to be breakeven to earnings in 2025, and significantly accretive in 2026 onwards. And now, I\u2019'll invite Rebecca to begin the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Schott at JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : Just had a question on the HIV franchise and the impact from the Medicare redesign as we think about 2025, I know this is coming from more and more conversations. Can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about that impact to your franchise? And maybe just more broadly, can we directionally still think about top line growth and margin expansion for Gilead next year despite this headwind? So any color you can provide there would be appreciated. Daniel O'Day: Great, Chris. Welcome, everybody. This is Dan. I'm going to have Johanna cover this question. Thank you. Johanna Mercier : Thanks, Chris, for the question. So we do expect an impact of the Part D redesign to be weighted towards our HIV business and expect our HIV growth in 2025 to be offset by the Part D redesign impact. So as a result, we expect our HIV sales to be roughly flat year-on-year in 2025. Having said that, overall, we expect our total business to grow despite the impact of the Part D we designed in 2025 with the top line, building momentum in 2020 -- beyond 2025, right, '26 and beyond. So we do expect growth in '25, but our HIV business, the demand of HIV will offset the impact of Part D. Andrew Dickinson : Chris, it's Andy. I'll take the question on margin expansion. As you know, we don't provide more specific guidance for 2025 beyond what Johanna just mentioned. What we have said historically, and I've underscored, is that we are very focused on disciplined expense management. That will be true in 2025 as it is today. You've seen that in the last 2 quarters. I think on a non-GAAP basis for this quarter, if you look at our operating margin, if you strip out the CymaBay transaction, you see an improvement in our operating margin and we expect that to continue over time. So we do expect broadly for our operating margin to improve over time as you see the continued top line growth and the disciplined expense management. So thanks for the question. More details, of course, to be provided at early next year when we provide our 2025 guidance specifically. Operator : Our next question comes from Daina Graybosch at Leerink Partners. Daina Graybosch : It's for Kite. FDA's ODAC recently had 2 important meetings of relevance for multiple myeloma and CAR-T there. One, dealt with the early death risk from CARVYKTI and ABECMA. And the second was to recommend MRD as an intermediate endpoint for accelerated approval in multiple myeloma. And I wonder how you're thinking about both of these ODACs in relation to anito-cel in your earlier line trial design. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Daina. We've got Cindy Perettie here, so we'll go right over to her. Cindy Perettie : Thanks, Daina. So if I start off with the early line ODAC, I think we believe this is positive for everybody. What it's shown is that people recognize the value of having CAR Ts therapies earlier in their disease. They value the disease-free intervals that they get from that. So we were very happy to see that. I think we were equally as excited to see the second ODAC around MRD, minimal residual disease, as a secondary -- as an additional endpoint. I think the piece around this is that we're really encouraged that the ODAC decision is going to open up the door for us to potentially bring anito-cel to market faster for patients. And we're in the process right now of understanding how the MRD surrogate endpoint can be used with regulatory agencies and the application of our program and so more to come on that front. Operator : Our next question comes from Umer Raffat of Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : I just thought I'll spend a quick second on CymaBay given the recent deal. My question is, did Gilead, during the diligence process, deploy independent pathologists to evaluate the cases of \"possible\" liver pathology that happened in the NASH trial previously as well as the paired liver biopsy data from the PBC trial at the lower dose where CymaBay didn't think it would need safety adjudication? I'd be very curious how you guys did that and if you would ever publish that. Daniel O'Day: Merdad is here, so I'll let him answer. Merdad Parsey : Thanks, Umer. Let me start by saying we think seladelpar is one of those medicines that will bring a lot of benefit to patients and really some near-term expansion of our liver portfolio and our -- and what we think will synergize with many of the other -- much of the other work that we're doing in liver disease overall. We obviously did thorough diligence in our approach to seladelpar and CymaBay. We didn't do a third -- I think your question was around whether we did an independent third-party review of the pathology. We did not do that. However, we did a lot of thorough diligence on the data itself and the outcomes. And we are confident around the outcome and what it means for patients over time. Obviously, we're waiting right now the -- our upcoming PDUFA date and also the file in the EMA, which we are optimistic about. And following the questions and all those sorts of items that we're in. So we're looking forward to providing an update on that as those filings proceed. Operator : Our next question comes from Tyler Van Buren at TD Cowen. Tyler Van Buren : I was hoping you could help set expectations for EVOKE-01 and 02 presentations at ASCO. For EVOKE-02, the late breaker tag is interesting. So is that related to the 3-month OS benefit in the PD-1 refractory patients? Or could we -- or should we be expecting something more? And for EVOKE-02, what should we hope to see with the Cohort A data that should leave us confident in the EVOKE-03 readout next year? Merdad Parsey : Thanks, Tyler, it's Merdad again here. So it's a little challenging because I can't share too many details now because we're under embargo for both of those. And obviously, happy to fill in a lot of the blanks once the data are released, and we can talk about it in ASCO. I think for EVOKE-01, we think there are a number of pipeline updates in our ASCO presentations that we have upcoming, which were -- we see as a real change for us and a real evolution of our pipeline overall and our ability to build our oncology pipeline and bring new options for patients. As part of the late breaker session for EVOKE-01, as you mentioned, we will include data on overall survival, on PFS, ORR and duration of response as well as the safety profile, of course. And I wish I could give you more details, but I can't at this point. As you say, we will also be providing other updates there, including the EVOKE-02 Cohort A data looking at the PD-L1 high non-small cell population. And again, it's -- I can't really talk about the details of those data, but we are looking forward to sharing those results with everyone and talking about the implications of that for our broader lung cancer and especially the frontline lung cancer EVOKE-03 study that we are conducting right now is underway with our partners at Merck. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham at Bank of America. Geoffrey Meacham : Merdad, a question for you. On the cell therapy front, you usually have the anito-cel update later this year, which is big. But beyond that, I wasn't sure what the priority was among the next-gen CAR assets that you've got kind of cartooned on Slide 19. There's a lot of competition in this space, but you guys are among the only players that have real scale and you could move the next-gen stuff, I think, pretty fast. But if you had to pick sort of a priority list, will be good to know. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Geoff. This is Dan. We're going to have Cindy Perettie answer that question, if you don't mind. So Cindy, over to you. Cindy Perettie : So we have 3 products right now, or 3 constructs that are in Phase Ia and b clinical trials. The first one is a bicistronic CD19, CD20 that has 41BB and CD28. The second one is that same construct with fast manufacturing, 3-day manufacturing. And the other one is a CD19 like Yescarta with 3-day manufacturing. So we're looking at all 3 of those in parallel with the goal of picking the winner to advance that rapidly into our pivotal trials. So that's what's coming up next. Obviously, we've shared a lot around anito-cel as well. With anito-cel, we have the iMMagine-1 readout, and we expect to move quickly into earlier lines as it relates to anito-cel, and you'll hear more about that later this year. Hopefully, that answers your question. We certainly have a number of plays in early research, but we would plan to advance our next-generation lymphoma assets quickly. And obviously, with the scale that we have at Kite as well as the integrated fact that we can create the vector as well as the construct in-house. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Yee at Jefferies. Michael Yee : Following up on the Trodelvy data coming at ASCO and your enthusiasm for frontline, can you just remind us, a, do you believe that your data in EVOKE second line that will be at ASCO is at least as competitive or better than Astra, and that is why you're excited about frontline? And b, if you are, do you have a triple therapy on top of chemo combo or is your whole first-line strategy just on top of PD-1? Merdad Parsey : Thanks, Michael. This is Merdad again. As we've noted, I think, and as you talked about, the EVOKE-01 data in second line will be something that we discuss at ASCO and show those data. And the full data set is -- does motivate us to go forward in lung cancer and including with discussions with regulators. The unmet need in this population is great, and the data give us options, including discussions with health authorities and conducting follow-up trials. We'll be able to share more once the data are provided at ASCO, and so we look forward to having those deeper discussions once we can speak directly to the data. And I'm sorry, and the second part of your question was around the front line. Again, I think once we are able to share the EVOKE-02 data, the update on EVOKE-02 data, we'll be able to talk more. But it does continue to allow us to think about the frontline and our confidence around about EVOKE-03. And then the last part of your question on other combinations. We do think about our intra-portfolio combinations. For example, we have a combination of dambinelumab and Trodelvy in a trial where we're looking to see if we can get additional efficacy from those sorts of combinations. So we do continuously look at our portfolio and look for opportunities for moving the needle with combinations from within our portfolio. Operator : Our next question comes from Salveen Richter of Goldman Sachs. Salveen Richter : So you currently have about $5 billion in cash and noted leverage is back to pre-Immunomedics deal levels. How are you thinking about meaningful or bolt-on BD post the CymaBay acquisition? And is there any preference now between virology, I&I and oncology? Andrew Dickinson : Salveen, it's Andy. Maybe I'll start with that one. In our prepared remarks, I highlighted that in the near term, we don't expect sizable M&A.  So we have a lot of execution ahead of us. We have a deep portfolio, a lot of growth drivers, including seladelpar. So we're very clearly highlighting that in the short term, we will continue to do ordinary course business development, the standard licensing deals. You saw a couple of those in the first quarter. But it's unlikely that we'd pursue any meaningful M&A in the near term. We've also said historically that deals like CymaBay are exactly what we're looking for and that we should do deals like that on a regular basis over the cycle and whether that's every 2 years on average or more or less, that's a general ballpark. So I think you're appropriately highlighting we have -- we generate a lot of operating cash flow. You saw that again in the first quarter. We will rebuild our cash over time. We're going to continue to invest in the pipeline. But at least in the short run, we don't expect any meaningful M&A in the short run. Daniel O'Day: And Salveen, this is Dan. Just to answer the end of your question. I mean, we're always therapeutic area agnostic when we approach these. I mean, first of all, we've got robust portfolios around both urology and oncology and a building portfolio in inflammation. So we look, frankly, across those spectrums. Seladelpar is a great example of finding an opportunity within our liver disease or -- franchise and be able to use that channel. But equally, we'll look for opportunities and synergies that complement our portfolio across therapeutic areas. And that's our approach. We think that makes sense. We look for the most attractive science. And as Andy said, we have a lot in our hands now to work through and to execute on. And so we'll keep the bar very high. Operator : Our next question comes from James Shin at Deutsche Bank. James Shin : I wanted to ask on Trodelvy's efforts in HR+/HER2-. DESTINY-Breast06 is going to have data pretty soon it seems. And you also have ASCENT-07. Sort of sounds similar to DESTINY-Breast04 versus TROPiCS-02. Can you share like how you think this landscape will play out with these 2 trials? Merdad Parsey : Thanks for the question, James. Well, it's -- I've learned to try to keep away from prognostication. So that's harder to do. We -- look, maybe the way I would put it is we are proud of the fact that Trodelvy is still the only TROP2 ADC that is approved, and that is in large part driven by the important role that Trodelvy plays in breast cancer right now for patients. And we do continue to want to push that, along with the ASCENT-07. We have a number of other trials ongoing to expand our footprint in breast cancer. I think we are right now in TNBC, the leading regimen. And as we are continuing to advance our HR+/HER2- and in particular, in the IHC-0 population, I think we remain confident around our place there. We've shown a benefit in randomized clinical trials there, and that's been the basis for our regulatory filings and approvals. So I don't think we can assume success. We'll have to see what the data are. But looking forward into the year that's coming with ASCENT-03 coming up, I think that will provide us additional information to further expand our potential in breast cancer. Johanna, do you want to add? Johanna Mercier : Maybe just to add to that. I would also say that the more options these patients have, these women have, in HR+ in earlier lines of therapy instead of cycling through chemotherapies, the better. So with DB06 results and moving potentially that compound up earlier, it actually allows for Trodelvy to also play a more important and a bigger population than it is today because of the profile of the TROPiCS-02 label. And so we do believe that there's opportunities for this ADC to move up and also differentiate itself versus other ADCs in this marketplace, depends effect profile, the safety profile, not only on the efficacy. And so in light of the IHC-0 setting being really our strong foothold in HR+/HER2-, we believe that will continue, whether that's in later lines of therapy or earlier lines of these studies play out. Operator : Our Next question comes from Mohit Bansal, Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : Maybe a big picture question, if you think about medium to longer term because, I mean, yes, you do not have an LOE. But I mean, HIV growth is somewhere around low single digits. And oncology, I mean, again, I mean, it dropped too and all. The expansion opportunities seem limited at this point. So just trying to understand how do you turn this low single digit to more like a high single-digit kind of growth for overall company? CymaBay is definitely an addition, but how are you thinking about it from medium to long term, which probably people like us are missing? Daniel O'Day: Mohit, maybe I'll start and then have others add. First of all, I think just stepping back and thinking about the portfolio that we've built over the past 4 years now more than doubling the size of the portfolio and with significant advances in our HIV portfolio and oncology and with outside of cell therapy. So as we think about growth moving forward, I mean, first of all, I would say on the HIV side of the business, we have to constantly remind ourselves and others that in addition to the treatment market and the potential for long-acting treatment that we have a very robust program on, and we'll update you a little bit more on towards the second half of this year with an analyst event, we've got the PrEP market that is just beginning to kind of be dimensionalized. And that is -- I think that provides significant growth opportunity when you think about your time frame, which you mentioned, which is until the end of the decade. So I think it allows us to think about accelerated HIV total growth prevention and treatment as we head towards the second half of the decade. That -- on top of that, then we have the entirety of the oncology portfolio. So both cell therapy within the large B-cell lymphoma area as well as potentially the multiple myeloma entry with the anito-cel. And then on top of that, a very robust oncology portfolio that has both Trodelvy and other novel agents that we'll read out over the course of this decade. And I'll just remind you, again, we've got close to 20 readouts this year, of which 3 of those are in Phase III, including lenacapavir for prep in the second half of this year, 2 Trodelvy Phase III readouts. And then importantly, we've added seladelpar to the mix with a PDUFA date in August. And then finally, just the opportunity to update you on the anito-cel at the end of the year as well. So we'll be providing more guidance as we continue to look at the entirety of our portfolio, but we really think we have within the company today, by the way, I'll just mention, in addition to complementing where needed from the outside. But within the company today, we have what it takes to drive a substantial growth in our business over the course of the next decade with focus on expense management as well to produce good returns for investors. Operator : Our next question comes from Simon Baker at Redburn Atlantic. Simon Baker : One on seladelpar, if I may. And a question really around the competitive dynamics at launch. If all goes according to plan, your launch in August and Ipsen will launch Elafibranor in June. So I was just wondering if that really makes any difference. You've obviously got far greater infrastructure than Ipsen. Is it too early for them to steal in March? Or paradoxically thus having somebody else on the market promoting PBC actually raise disease awareness and help the situation? So any color around the dynamics at launch would be very helpful. Johanna Mercier : Thanks, Simon. It's Johanna. Let me take that one. And I think you're absolutely right. I think the fact that there is more than one competitor hitting the market is great for patients namely around increasing disease awareness around PDC and the fact that there are 2 options available. Having said that, I also feel incredibly confident that seladelpar is well differentiated to potentially be best in disease when you think about the significant impact and clinically meaningful impact we have with the ALP normalization in the clinical jet Phase III clinical trial we've seen as well as the improvement in pruritus which is a key symptom of the disease. And today, there really is no effective antipruritic options for PBC patients. And so all of that put together, in addition to the fact that we believe our footprint, both commercial and medical is incredibly well established when it comes to liver disease. It already covers about 80% of all U.S. PBC prescribers. And with that strong differentiated profile we were just referring to, I don't think those 3 months make a difference. I think really it's about best-in-class launch and that potential with seladelpar that we look forward for our PDUFA date. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Skorney at Baird. Unknown Analyst : This is Charlie on for Brian. So again, to ask something about seladelpar. Just wondering if you have any ambitions for potentially looking at a label for first line in the future, considering there's a lot of unmet need with pruritus there. As well as any potential synergies you may be considering with the remainder of your liver portfolio? Merdad Parsey : Thanks, Charlie. This is Merdad. Frontline is a challenge given the -- what is currently the background standard of care. But as you know, we think that seladelpar is going to bring a lot of benefit to a lot of patients, especially given the pruritus and the potential for getting to patients earlier in their course will be really important for us. And so we have to see how the market starts to respond to the presence of seladelpar in the second line. And recall, I think the other thing to recall or think about is the -- how long people actually get frontline therapy before moving on to second-line therapy, given the efficacy profile of the frontline therapies and the fact that there haven't been any options, one could anticipate that patients are moved to second-line therapy relatively early in their treatment course and making -- moving up formally for registrational trials to the frontline potentially superfluous. So I think we'll see how that plays out in the market. And once we see our label and all those sorts of things, so we'll be able to update more after that. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams at RBC Capital Markets. Brian Abrahams : PURPOSE 1 is obviously an upcoming readout. So I wanted to clarify some elements of its unique design, specifically what's the sensitivity of assessing when HIV infection occurred to accurately project the control infection rate? And then how do you control for potential intrinsic differences in risk behavior that the screened out group serving as the control may have versus individuals who are -- who make it into the trial? Merdad Parsey : Brian, thanks, it's Merdad again. And I could talk about this for a long time. Let me -- I'll try to give a very concise answer. The recency assay that's been developed for HIV, it has been studied very thoroughly, and we can, based on the diagnosis at the time of screening, create a profile for anyone who's potentially HIV infected at that time as to how recently they were infected. And I think that's a key part. And that relates to the second part of your question in that the -- we don't, in a sense, need to compare risk behaviors before and after randomization and that we'll be looking at the overall incidence of HIV at the time of screening and then comparing in this counterfactual design with what happens after people start therapy. So I think between those 2 elements and all the discussions we've had with the regulators and the experts in the field, we're confident in that the design will provide the information necessary to get us to approval and for adoption. Operator : Our next question comes from Terence Flynn at Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn : Great. Two parts on the CAR-T franchise. So just was wondering, high level, your comment to a anito-cel if it proves there is parkinsonism, so meaning it's less differentiated. And then the second part is, curious where your progress stands with respect to developing the CAR-T for immunology. Obviously, a lot of focus here amongst a number of other companies in the industry. So just curious on Gilead's thoughts on the [ floor ]. Cindy Perettie : Thanks, Terence, for the question. So on the commitment to anito-cel, we're -- as it relates to Parkinson's, we absolutely feel that we're differentiated potentially on both safety and efficacy. As we noted earlier, we have not observed the neurotox that some of the other constructs have observed, and we'll continue to monitor it, but we feel great about the profile right now. And then the efficacy profile, early signals are we think we will be equivalent or could be best-in-class. So we're 100% behind anito-cel and we're looking forward to bringing those data soon. The second question around autoimmune space. So we continue to monitor the autoimmune space. And as you've heard from Andy and others before, we will play in that space. We are taking time to take a look at what's in the space versus what we have in our portfolio, and we'll be -- I don't have any updates further than that today. Operator : Our last question comes from Carter Gould at Barclays. Carter L. Gould: Maybe just to round things out on cell therapy, you flagged the same dynamics that have been kind of persisting in the U.S. as far as the -- some of the constraints of the ATCs. I also saw the Tennessee oncology reference. But I guess putting that all together, just your level of confidence you sort of hit that return to more meaningful growth in the second half of the year. I didn't hear that mentioned and clearly, that's a point of focus. Any commentary there would be appreciated. Cindy Perettie : Yes. No, we feel very confident that we're going to return to growth in the second half of the year, as we stated. I think just as a reminder, we had shared in quarter 4 our guidance was that we'd be flat to slightly down in quarter 1. And part of that is due to the restructure. So we are putting our strategy into play. We feel very confident about the approach we're taking in the U.S. And we now are looking at having almost a fully stacked sales team back out and working hard. I think a piece that we need to talk about as well as the market dynamics. So the things we're observing. We're observing out-of-class competition with the bispecifics, the ATC constraints that we've spoken about in the past based on multiple myeloma constructs coming in. But what we're seeing is a lot of the hospitals and ATCs are working through those constraints, and we feel really confident about the second half of this year. Daniel O'Day: Thank you, Cindy. This is Dan again. So I appreciate all of you joining. Maybe just a bit of a summary statement. I want you all to know we at Gilead are very focused on the near-term execution and the long-term plans. We'll continue to stay disciplined and agile in our approach. Just as highlights, we've got 54 active clinical programs, no major patent expiries through the end of the decade, a variety of opportunities for growth and a lot more to deliver. On top of that, we are on track to provide updates from 3 Phase III clinical trials for Trodelvy, lenacapavir. We've got the seladelpar PDUFA date in August. Any update on the anito-cel Phase II update with the management we'll have at the end of the year. So rest assured that we are firmly focused on the many opportunities we have, and we have a lot more potential to deliver. With that, I'll hand over to Jacquie for closing comments. Jacquie Ross : Thank you, Dan. To close, just one housekeeping item. I can share that we are tentatively planning to release our second quarter 2024 earnings results on Thursday, August 8. Please note that this is day is provisional and could be changed to accommodate scheduling conflicts that arise between now and then. As always, we will announce our confirmed date following the close of the second quarter. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the quarter. With that, we'll close our call for today. Thank you.",

In a moment, we'll begin with our prepared remarks followed by a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] I'll now hand the call over to Jacquie Ross, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Strategic Finance. Jacquie Ross : Thank you, Rebecca. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the second quarter of 2024. The press release, slides and supplementary data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open Q&A where the team will be joined by Cindy Poretti, the Executive Vice President of Kite. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. Please refer to Slide 2 regarding the risks and uncertainties relating to forward-looking statements that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan. Daniel O'Day: Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to share that this was another strong quarter of commercial execution with growth across HIV, Liver Disease, and Oncology. Biktarvy for HIV treatment was up 8% year-over-year, Trodelvy was up 23%, and Cell Therapy was up 11%. In addition, we continued to demonstrate disciplined operating expense management and delivered exceptional bottom-line growth, highlighting the leverage in our business model. Given the results for the first half of the year, we are raising our non-GAAP operating income and EPS guidance for the full year. Moving to clinical updates, this is an important time for our Virology and Inflammation therapeutic areas. A key highlight of the quarter was the readout of our Phase 3 PURPOSE 1 trial evaluating lenacapavir for HIV prevention. The results showed 100% efficacy with zero HIV infections in cisgender women. The presentation of these results at AIDS 2024 in Munich generated considerable excitement, and we\u2019re delighted to have reached this milestone with such a positive outcome. Lenacapavir, with its twice-yearly dosing, could set a new bar for HIV prevention and allow PrEP to reach a much broader population of people who could benefit from a prevention regimen. The PURPOSE program, which is expected to include more than 9,000 participants in over 10 countries, is designed to highlight the efficacy of HIV prevention in a wide range of groups, including cisgender women, transgender men and women, Black and Latino individuals, and young adults. We expect an update for PURPOSE 2 late this year or early next year, with a commercial launch as early as late 2025. The PURPOSE data were part of several updates at AIDS 2024 that highlight the strength of Gilead\u2019s innovation in HIV, for both prevention and treatment. Our pipeline has the promise to extend our HIV leadership well into the late 2030s and beyond. Updates at AIDS 2024 included data from our daily oral combination of bictegravir and lenacapavir, which is now in pivotal Phase 3 trials for people with HIV, including those on complex regimens. We also shared data from our broad long-acting program, including our once-weekly orals GS-4182 and GS-1720. We plan to start the Phase 2 study evaluating these in combination before the end of the year. This is in addition to the once-weekly oral combination of lenacapavir and islatravir in partnership with Merck that will begin Phase 3, also before the end of the year. On the immediate horizon, our PDUFA date for seladelpar is next week. The body of clinical evidence behind seladelpar for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC, continues to grow, most recently with the Phase 3 ASSURE data shared at EASL. The Gilead team is excited by the opportunity to launch seladelpar and bring a promising new treatment to the patients who could benefit. Moving to Oncology, we are ready to manufacture anito-cel for multiple myeloma at our Maryland Kite facility, and we are preparing to support the Phase 3 iMMagine-3 trial from the site starting later this year. The iMMagine-3 trial is expected to reach a broader set of 2nd- to 4th-line multiple myeloma patients with our potentially best-in-class BCMA CAR T. At ASCO, we shared new data from our Phase 2 EVOKE-02 program evaluating Trodelvy in combination with pembro in first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The results showed meaningful efficacy compared to the historical standard-of-care, supporting the Phase 3 EVOKE-03 trial currently underway. We continue to assess the path for Trodelvy in second-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic bladder cancer following the EVOKE-01 and TROPiCS-04 readouts earlier this year. In the meantime, I\u2019d highlight the strong commercial results this quarter in breast cancer where Trodelvy remains the first and only approved TROP2-directed ADC on the market and is the standard of care for second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. To date, we have served over 40,000 cancer patients, and remain confident that Trodelvy will continue to be an important treatment option. We also shared Phase 2 EDGE-Gastric data at ASCO for domvanalimab plus zimberelimab and chemotherapy in first-line upper GI cancers. These results showed compelling efficacy that supports the Phase 3 STAR-221 program, which has completed enrollment. Moving to our 2024 key milestones on slide 6, we look forward to the upcoming updates from the Phase 3 ASCENT-03 trial and Phase 2 iMMagine-1 trial. ASCENT-03 is an event-driven trial evaluating Trodelvy in first-line PD-L1 negative metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patients. A positive progression-free survival outcome would support global filings, potentially moving Trodelvy into earlier lines of triplenegative breast cancer. Our iMMagine-1 trial could support regulatory filings for anito-cel in later-line relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Overall, the second quarter was a strong performance for the Gilead team, with the highlights including some remarkable clinical results in HIV, solid revenue growth across therapeutic areas, tangible impact from our disciplined cost management initiatives, and planning for the imminent launch of seladelpar. With that, I will hand it over to Johanna. Johanna Mercier : Thanks Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m very pleased to report the continued momentum we saw in the second quarter, and would like to thank the Gilead teams who contributed to another strong quarter of execution. As shown on slide 8, total product sales, excluding Veklury were $6.7 billion in the second quarter, up 6% year-over-year, with growth across HIV, Liver Disease, and Oncology. Including Veklury, total product sales were $6.9 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Starting with HIV on slide 9, sales of $4.7 billion were up 3% year-over-year, driven by strong demand across treatment and prevention, partially offset by lower average realized price due to channel mix. Quarter-over-quarter, sales were up 9%, reflecting favorable pricing and inventory build following the typical first quarter dynamics, as well as higher demand. Looking to the full year, we remain on-track to deliver HIV sales growth of approximately 4%. Turning to slide 10, total second quarter Biktarvy sales of $3.2 billion were up 8% year-over-year, primarily due to higher demand. Sequentially, sales were up 10%, largely reflecting favorable pricing and inventory following the typical first quarter dynamics. Highlighting our leadership position, Biktarvy represents more than 49% share of the treatment market in the U.S. This was up almost 3% year-over-year, our 24th consecutive quarter of year-over-year market share gain. With a meaningful share lead over all other branded regimens for HIV treatment, Biktarvy firmly remains the HIV treatment-of-choice, particularly for those starting or switching regimens in the U.S., as well as across other major markets. Overall, the HIV treatment market continues to grow in-line with our expectations of 2% to 3% annually. Turning to Descovy, we continued to see higher demand with sales of $485 million in the second quarter. Year-over-year, sales were down 6% as demand growth was more than offset by lower average realized price due to channel mix. As a reminder, shifts in channel mix will continue to impact average realized price in addition to our ongoing efforts to ensure people who want or need PrEP have access to the prevention regimen of their choice. Sequentially, sales were up 14%, reflecting favorable inventory and pricing following typical first quarter seasonality, in addition to the higher demand. Descovy for PrEP once again maintained its over 40% PrEP market share in the U.S., despite the availability of other regimens, including generics. We\u2019re particularly excited to note that the HIV PrEP market in the U.S. continues to expand, with total volumes up more than 12% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year. With that in mind, we are thrilled with the unprecedented results seen in our pivotal Phase 3 PURPOSE 1 trial, achieving 100% efficacy with zero cases of HIV infections in a broad population of cisgender women, including those who are pregnant or lactating. This is just the beginning of our larger, landmark PURPOSE program which includes multiple populations and communities where PrEP is underutilized or more difficult to access today, such as cisgender women, transgender men and women, Black and Latino individuals, and young adults. Overall, we expect lenacapavir will emerge as the regimen-of-choice for those who want or need prevention as the first and only long-acting option with twice-yearly subcutaneous dosing. We are preparing for potential launch as early as late 2025. Moving to the Liver Disease portfolio on slide 11, sales were up 17% year-over-year and 13% sequentially, driven by higher demand and higher average realized price due to channel mix in the U.S. Our Liver Disease franchise continues to differentiate itself, with leading share in HCV despite fewer HCV starts year-over-year together with growing demand in HBV and HDV. As you know, our PDUFA date for seladelpar is next week, and we stand ready to launch commercially in the U.S. We are able to leverage our existing commercial footprint in liver diseases, and continue building upon these relationships to quickly bring seladelpar to many of the 130,000 people impacted by PBC in the U.S. who progress after initial treatment. Outside the U.S., commercial preparations are well underway, and we look forward to the European regulatory decision in early 2025. Turning to Slide 12, while severity of COVID infections and hospitalization rates remain variable, Veklury continues to be recognized as an important part of the standard of care for hospitalized patients treated for COVID-19. This includes the U.S. where Veklury has maintained well over 60% share in this setting. For the second quarter, Veklury sales were down 16% year-over-year and down 61% sequentially, as expected. Moving to Oncology on slide 13, sales were up 15% year-over-year and up 7% quarter-over-quarter to $841 million. With over 60,000 patients treated with a Gilead or Kite therapy to date, we\u2019re proud of the positive impact our oncology medicines have made across multiple cancer types. Looking in more detail at Trodelvy on slide 14, sales for the second quarter were $320 million, up 23% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially, primarily driven by higher demand in the U.S. and Europe across its metastatic breast cancer indications. Trodelvy is the only approved and available TROP2-directed ADC to demonstrate clinically meaningful survival benefits across two types of metastatic breast cancers. And with increasing awareness amongst physicians, Trodelvy has remained the leading regimen in the U.S. and Europe for second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer with growing adoption in the pre-treated HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer setting. We are working to expand Trodelvy\u2019s reach beyond the 40,000-plus patients treated to date across multiple tumor types as we look to new and existing markets, as well as new indications. In bladder cancer, we are planning to further discuss the results of TROPiCS-04 and next steps with FDA. At this time, Trodelvy continues to be available under an accelerated approval in the U.S. for second-line plus metastatic or advanced bladder cancer. Turning to Slide 15, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, Cell Therapy sales in the second quarter were $521 million, up 11% year-over-year and up 9% quarter-over-quarter, with solid growth in all regions. In the U.S., sales were up 11% sequentially as we've begun to see momentum from our focused efforts at the authorized treatment centers, including further educating providers and patients on the curative potential of our cell therapies. Despite these efforts, in-class and out-of-class competition remain a near-term headwind in the U.S. As we extend the reach of cell therapy, we are making important in-roads with key community practices, including working with national payers to unlock broader commercial reimbursement, and as a reminder, expect impact from these initiatives towards the end of 2024. We\u2019ll continue to refine this \u201cblueprint\u201d as we work to onboard new centers and patients over time. Outside the U.S., demand for Yescarta and Tecartus across Europe and other international geographies remains strong, and we\u2019re encouraged by the solid progress in our newly launched markets such as Japan and Saudi Arabia. Overall, it was a strong second quarter for our commercial portfolio, and the teams are energized by the potential to bring two more transformational therapies to market \u2013 first with seladelpar for PBC next week, and then, lenacapavir for HIV prevention as early as late next year. And with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Merdad. Merdad Parsey : Thank you, Johanna. We were very pleased to wrap up the second quarter with two New England Journal of Medicine publications and a number of important readouts across our portfolio. Most exciting was the readout of our Phase 3 PURPOSE 1 trial evaluating twice-yearly, subcutaneous lenacapavir for the prevention of HIV infection in cisgender women. As you can see on slide 17, this was the first Phase 3 HIV prevention trial to ever achieve 100% efficacy. We have since shared data at the International AIDS Society meeting in July, where our presentation was the highlight of the plenary session. The data were simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Our second registrational trial for lenacapavir, PURPOSE 2, has enrolled approximately 3,300 men, transwomen, and non-binary people who have sex with men. This trial completed enrollment globally in December 2023, approximately four months after PURPOSE 1. As a result, we expect to provide an update in late 2024 or early 2025. Assuming positive data from PURPOSE 2, we plan to file based on data from both trials, with the goal of bringing transformative HIV prevention to people at risk of HIV as early as late 2025. Beyond our registrational trials, we are generating Phase 2 data from the PURPOSE 3, 4, and 5 trials in key populations across the U.S., UK, and France, including people who inject drugs. These trials reflect our commitment to evaluate lenacapavir across diverse populations that could benefit. These studies are also intended to drive greater awareness amongst physicians and patients, including geographies where prevention options have not been effective historically. In addition to HIV prevention, we are of course intensely focused on next generation HIV treatment options, and slide 18 highlights our comprehensive HIV treatment pipeline. Our recent updates at the AIDS Society meeting included : Longer-term Phase 2 data from our once-daily oral combination of bictegravir and lenacapavir that showed the regimen was highly effective at maintaining viral suppression. These results further support our ongoing Phase 3 studies in people with HIV, including those on complex regimens. We also reported safety and PK data for both GS-4182, an oral pro-drug of lenacapavir designed to provide 2- to 3-times greater oral bioavailability, and GS-1720, our long-acting oral integrase inhibitor. Initiation of the Phase 2 trial evaluating the combination of these agents as a once-weekly oral regimen is expected later this year. Additionally, we are on-track to initiate our Phase 3 ISLEND-1 and ISLEND-2 trials evaluating once-weekly lenacapavir in combination with Merck's islatravir. This regimen is expected to be the first once-weekly oral treatment option. Looking at our longer-duration treatments, we expect to provide Phase 1 updates from our every 3- month injectable programs and to initiate the Phase 1 studies for our potentially every 6-month integrase inhibitors in the second half of the year. Moving to our Liver Disease portfolio, on slide 19, we presented more than 25 abstracts across both viral and inflammatory liver diseases at the EASL Conference in June, highlighting our continued leadership. Importantly, as shown on the right of the slide, new interim results from the open-label Phase 3 ASSURE study of seladelpar for PBC were consistent with the pivotal RESPONSE study that formed the basis of our global regulatory filings. As you know, we expect an FDA regulatory decision shortly, with a decision from European regulators to follow in early 2025. In viral hepatitis, Gilead shared final, Week 144 results of the Phase 3 MYR301 trial at EASL. These data continue to support monotherapy bulevirtide 2mg as a chronic treatment for HDV. Additionally, we presented promising Phase 2b data evaluating bulevirtide 10mg with interferon alfa-2a as a finite regimen. The post-treatment response rates were the highest ever posted in HDV and were simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. We\u2019re encouraged by the data, and continue to be engaged with KOLs and health authorities - including FDA - as we work to bring bulevirtide to patients as quickly as possible. Switching to Oncology, on slide 20, we\u2019re pleased with the progress across our mid-to-late stage programs. In the front-line setting we shared mature Cohort A data at ASCO from our Phase 2 EVOKE-02 trial with Trodelvy plus pembro, demonstrating a median progression-free survival of 13.1 months. These data exceeded the historical performance of PD-1 monotherapy in first-line PD-L1 high non-small cell lung cancer and support our ongoing Phase 3 EVOKE-03 trial where enrollment is going well. In an all-comer non-small cell lung cancer population, our Phase 3 STAR-121 study evaluating dom plus zim is ongoing. Our Phase 3 STAR-221 study in upper GI cancers evaluating dom with zim and chemo has completed enrollment. The updated Phase 2 EDGE-Gastric data presented at ASCO supported the use of this combination. If successful, dom plus zim and chemo would be the first TIGIT-based regimen for upper GI cancer patients. In addition, we have several Phase 3 programs underway in earlier settings of breast cancer, including ASCENT-03 evaluating Trodelvy in PD-L1 negative metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Turning to our second-line programs, we have discussed the results of EVOKE-01 in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with regulators, and as expected, have confirmed there is no immediate regulatory path based on EVOKE-01 alone. We are currently assessing next steps for Trodelvy in this setting. We will also provide updates on our bladder cancer program, including the full trial results at a future scientific conference, after discussions with FDA and KOLs. Moving to slide 21, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, we shared updates for Yescarta and Tecartus at both ASCO and the European Hematology Association meeting. At ASCO we shared encouraging new efficacy data from a pilot study of Yescarta in 18 patients with relapsed or refractory primary or secondary central nervous system lymphoma in collaboration with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Yescarta demonstrated greater than 26 months median overall survival with no reported treatment-limiting toxicities and no apparent additional risk of adverse events in these patients with high unmet need. Based on these results, we are engaging with regulators to expand the use of Yescarta to include these patients. Additionally, we reported that treatment with Tecartus resulted in a 40% 4-year overall survival rate and median overall survival of almost 26 months in the pivotal ZUMA-3 trial in relapsed or refractory adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. At EHA, we shared preliminary analysis from the Phase 2 ZUMA-24 trial further supporting outpatient use of Yescarta in relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma with the use of prophylactic steroids and other early intervention strategies, real-world manufacturing experience of Yescarta for second- and third-line large B-cell lymphoma, reinforces our strong manufacturing success rate of 96%. Further, on slide 22, I will highlight our promising clinical development program for anito-cel, a potential best-in-class BCMA CAR T that we are developing in partnership with Arcellx. Notably, we shared our study design for our Phase 3 iMMagine-3 trial that will include a broader set of earlier-line, relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients. We expect to have first patient in for this trial in the second half of this year. We are pleased to note that the tech transfer and transfer of the U.S. IND of anito-cel to Kite are now complete. The Kite manufactured product will be used in the iMMagine-3 trial, and we anticipate the turnaround time for anito-cel to be on par with Kite\u2019s commercially available products. Wrapping up with our key 2024 milestones on slide 23, we completed all of our first half milestones, and are pleased with our program execution overall. We\u2019re off to a good start for the second half with the readout of PURPOSE 1 occurring ahead of our committed timeline. We look forward to the FDA decision next week for seladelpar in PBC, as well as an update from the pivotal Phase 2 iMMagine-1 trial in later-line relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, in addition to an update on the pivotal Phase 3 ASCENT-03 study in first-line PD-L1 negative metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Along with these updates, we have a maturing inflammation pipeline that includes several Phase 2 programs, such as a once-daily oral alpha-4-beta-7 integrin inhibitor and an oral TPL2 inhibitor for inflammatory bowel disease. And now, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Andy. Andrew Dickinson : Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting on slide 25, the team delivered an excellent quarter, with our base business up 6% year-over-year to $6.7 billion. Product sales growth across HIV, Liver Disease and Oncology more than offset the expected decline in Veklury, with total product sales up 5% year-over-year. Moving to our non-GAAP results on slide 26. Product gross margin was 86%, down 84 basis points from last year. R&D expenses were down 3% year-over-year, primarily due to the wind-down of certain magrolimab, obeldesivir and Trodelvy studies following recent data and regulatory updates. Sequentially, R&D was down 5%, primarily due to the timing of clinical and manufacturing activities, partially offset by the initiation of new studies. These savings reflect disciplined management of R&D resources towards the most meaningful opportunities. Acquired IPR&D was $38 million, reflecting new and ongoing collaboration payments in the second quarter. SG&A was down 27% year-over-year, primarily due to the $525 million legal settlement in 2023 that did not repeat in 2024. Excluding this payment, SG&A was up 2% year-over-year, and includes commercial investments ahead of the launch of seladelpar. Operating margin for the second quarter was 47%, our strongest operating margin since the third quarter of 2022, highlighting the leverage we have in our business model. Turning to tax, our effective tax rate was approximately 18%, reflecting settlement with a tax authority in the second quarter. On a reported basis, our non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 50% year-over-year from $1.34 to $2.01 per share. As mentioned earlier, we had a $525 million legal settlement, representing $0.32 per share, in the second quarter of 2023 that did not repeat in the second quarter of 2024. Excluding this settlement, EPS grew 21% year-over-year, reflecting higher product sales and lower expenses including acquired IPR&D expenses. As highlighted on Slide 27, we had a strong first half of the year, with solid performance in each of our core franchises across Virology and Oncology, driving base business growth of 6% year-over-year, which is at the upper-end of our full-year guidance of 4% to 6%. Switching to our expectations for 2024 on Slide 28, we continue to expect total product sales in the range of $27.1 billion to $27.5 billion, and total product sales, excluding Veklury, in the range of $25.8 billion to $26.2 billion. Given the inherent variability experienced historically, and as stated previously - we are not updating our Veklury guidance at this time. As we think about the second half of the year, here are some of the factors that we are continuing to monitor. First, we continue to expect the normal, quarter-to-quarter variability in our HIV business that we have always experienced relative to average realized price associated with channel mix. Second, we expect quarterly variability in cell therapy due to continued in-class and out-of-class competition. Third, there is some uncertainty associated with Trodelvy bladder revenue following TROPiCS-04. As a reminder, bladder represents less than 10% of total Trodelvy sales today; and finally, there is a possibility of incremental FX headwinds in the second half of the year. For the rest of 2024, we continue to expect to deliver strong volume growth across all therapeutic areas, and assuming approval seladelpar as an incremental contributor to revenue growth. Continued HIV volume and revenue growth, consistent with our full year expectation to grow HIV product sales by approximately 4%; and continued focus on disciplined operating expense management. Moving to the non-GAAP guidance, there is no change to our non-GAAP gross margin range of 85% to 86%. For R&D, we now expect total R&D expense to increase by a low to mid-single-digit percentage compared to 2023, reflecting lower than previously expected R&D expenses in 2024, despite absorbing the late-stage seladelpar program. For SG&A, there is no change to our prior guidance pointing to a mid-single digit decline compared to 2023. Consistent with our expectations last quarter, we have been able to absorb the incremental expenses associated with the CymaBay transaction. For acquired IPR&D, we now expect full-year expenses of $4.7 billion, up from $4.4 billion last quarter to reflect a $320 million transaction with Janssen to buy out the global seladelpar royalty. This expense will be included in our third quarter results. Finally, with the strong operational expense control demonstrated in both the first and second quarters, and despite this new $320 million acquired IPR&D expense, we are increasing our operating income guidance to $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion, and increasing our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $3.60 to $3.90. Slide 29 highlights that the increase to our EPS guidance fully absorbs the $320 million, or approximately $0.20 per share, expense associated with the buyout of the seladelpar royalty from Janssen. This transaction removes Gilead\u2019s royalty obligation to pay 8% of seladelpar sales. Excluding this transaction, our EPS guidance increase would have been even more significant today, up $0.30 or 8% at the midpoint, again highlighting the financial discipline that has translated into operating leverage. Moving to slide 30, we continue to have sufficient flexibility in our balance sheet to execute on our capital allocation priorities. In the second quarter, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders, repaid $1.75 billion of senior notes, and paid $1.2 billion as part of the federal transition tax associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The remaining transition tax payment of $1.3 billion is scheduled for April of 2025. Overall, we believe that Gilead is well-positioned for near and long-term growth and we continue to be focused on commercial execution, expense management discipline, and to delivering on our strategic commitments. And now, I\u2019ll invite Rebecca to begin the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] [Audio Gap] Please go ahead your line is open. Evan Seigerman : Hi there, this is Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. I wanted to touch on TIGIT. There's been a lot of updates in the TIGIT space in ASCO. We had the Roche update and most recently Merck discontinued their KeyVibe study in small cell lung cancer. So Merdad, you could walk us through how you think about the opportunity for TIGIT? And what looks good, what good would look like for you in terms of safety and efficacy with the STAR-121 program? Thank you so much. Merdad Parsey : Thanks, Evan for the question. Yeah, I think as you know as you noted, there have been a lot of updates on TIGIT over the past six months or so. And I think that gets to our approach which I think is somewhat differentiated from our competition in that. As we've said along, we have a differentiated molecule first off and that is that we have an Fc-silent molecule relative to an Fch-active molecule that the competition has. And I would note that that is demonstrating a difference in terms of the adverse event profile including the data that we've highlighted today. Additionally, I think we've tried to stay focused in areas where we believe that there is the best chance of activity and so for example, we have not initiated any trials with small cell. We look forward to. Capitalizing on the data, we have seen so far both and non-small cell lung cancer and gastric cancer. As you know, we provided an update on the EDGE-gastric study ASCO. And as I noted in the call we have completed enrollment of that of the Phase 3 trial of that. So we've - we continue to be cautiously optimistic about TIGIT and are doing it in a data-driven way based on the data we've generated in our trials so far. Operator : Our next question comes from Terence Flynn at Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, your line is open. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks for taking that question. A two part for me. Just Merdad, wondering if you can help frame expectations for the Purpose 2 trial, just given this is a slightly different population relative to Purpose 1. So just as we think about level setting their ahead of that data. And then, the second part is for Johanna, so obviously, you guys noted that you've seen growth in the PrEP market recently, which is encouraging. But what other steps can you as a company take to maybe help alleviate some of the payer roadblocks that are really still in the way of branded PrEP use given the still high level of generic truvada use? Thank you. Merdad Parsey : Thanks, Terrence. I'll start and then I'll hand it off the Johanna as you said. It's a great question and a good thing for us to make sure that everyone remembers. Our Purpose 1 was the trial that was in cisgender women and as I noted Purpose 2 is our ongoing study in the cisgender gay men transgender women and men and gender non-binary people. Now that study is ongoing. It is the second trial that's necessary for filing and like Purpose 1, Purpose 2 is designed to evaluate the superiority of lenacapavir against the background HIV rate. That\u2019s the primary endpoint and the secondary endpoint would be similar to Purpose 1 will be superior to truvada as a secondary endpoint. So, once we \u2013 if hopefully we\u2019d demonstrate a positive results in Purpose 2, we will combine this data with Purpose 1 and move as quickly as possible to filing those data to lenacapavir for PrEP. Johanna Mercier : So maybe just to complete the second part of that question around the growth in PrEP and like the opportunities lies ahead despite some of the payer roadblocks that you are referring to just a couple of points on that, one is, today the market for PrEP is growing at about 12% or so year-on-year, so nice consistent growth that we have seen over the last couple of years. Descovy coverage is over 90% of all lives are covered from an access standpoint. So today the daily orals do not have any concerns from an access standpoint. I think maybe what you're referring to is potentially as we think about medical benefits versus the pharmacy benefits that might create a little bit more access headwinds from a payer standpoint and we've seen that already with some of our competitors. As we think about lenacapavir, in light of not only the data, just most recently with Purpose 1, but also just the profile that it offers with a twice yearly sub cu I think it really allows us to redefine the PrEP market as a whole. And as much as we're seeing today maybe over 400,000 users in the US. We really see three major growth opportunities. One is around market size growth, the other one's around market share growth and the third one is on endurance. So if I just break those down a little bit, the market size growth is around reaching more users. So we'll beyond just white MSMS thinking about cisgender women, transgender men and women Latino black individuals, as well as young adults, reaching more prescribers in different settings than we are today and over time reaching more countries, right? Because right now PrEP revenues are really coming primarily out of the United States. From a market share growth standpoint Descovy is the number one branded daily oral today with over 40% share. And we believe lenacapavir will be number one from a long-acting standpoint and between the two together, we believe the Gilead presence in HIV prevention will also be leading and greater than where we are today. And then last but not least, it\u2019s hired adherent and not just has to do with a domestic - the frequency of administration when you think about a twice the early subcu has much adherence than a daily oral and obviously, better outcomes. So all of those pieces together is what we are focused on as an opportunity for the future of prevention and with not only Descovy but obviously with lenacapavir around the corner potentially. And from an access standpoint we are thinking ahead as we think about even the work that CMS is doing when they think about making it our Part B drug, for a medical benefit in PrEP to ensure greater access, but we're also thinking through how is this going to impact from both from a prescriber standpoint and how do we support that reimbursement, challenges that I think others have been facing and how we basically do a very high touch approach here to make sure everyone who needs or wants PrEP gets access to their drug of choice. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from [Inaudible] Leerink Partners. Go ahead, your line is open. Daina Graybosch : Hi, thanks for the question. I want to ask on Anito-cel, a two-part. One is just the process fact. So I wonder if you can confirm whether you have completed enrollment in Imagine 1 and that\u2019s what kind of follow-up time we can expect from the data should it be accepted at ASH? And then a deeper question on Imagine 3. I wonder what your approach is in Imagine 3 to bridging therapy so as to avoid the higher risk of death that was observed in the competitor trials soon after enrollment? Thank you. Thanks, Daina, so we've got Cindy Perettie here. We'll turn it up and heard answer that thank you for the question. Daniel O'Day: Thanks Daina. We sort of got Cindy Perettie here. We\u2019ll turn over to her to answer that. Thanks for your question. Cindy Perettie : Thanks, Daina, we continue to be really excited about the potential with Anito-cel with a best-in-class profile and our enrollment target for Imagine 1 has been met. I think the second question you asked is what type of follow-up would we expect to see at ASH, and I think we're in the process of we did an initial cut obviously for the abstracts we'll do the second cut for the final sharing of the data. So I don't have the exact follow-up time. But we can certainly look to follow-up with you once we have that. Your second question was around Imagine 3 and bridging therapy. Right now, we will be moving - so we were able to complete the tech transfer as you heard from Dan into our Maryland production facility. So we will be supplying therapy out of our Maryland facility and we expect to apply a lot of the learnings that we have with our existing products on the market today and be able to get Anito-cell back to those patients in Imagine 3 as it relates to having time upfront to do bridging therapy. However, with the protocol design today, we do have the option to do bridging therapy if necessary for patients. Operator : Our next question comes from Umer Raffat of Evercore. Go ahead, your line is open. Umer Raffat : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'm very intrigued about your lenacapavir plus bictegravir trial heading into Phase 3. And I'm just trying to understand could this regimen possibly replace Biktarvy to a meaningful extent? Or would you rather have some sort of a low-dose nuke in that combination as well as a second alternative? I'm just thinking back to some of the [Indiscernible] experience, as well. Johanna Mercier : So maybe I'll take that one Umer. So the len-bic combination is a single treatment regimen that really combined a best-in-class integrates inhibitor with the first-in-class capsid. The studies that we are doing both Phase2 and 3 are really first, that we looked at the complex regimen which that was kind of the first step and as we go into Phase 3, we believe we can get a broader label indication to also include all of our allergically suppressed. So as we think about that opportunity, we think it's an opportunity for an FTI that's optimized, simplified for complex regimens but also provides optionality in the viral decree to press the switch segment of the marketplace, So as we think about it as a portfolio perspective, we still believe that today Biktarvy is the standard of care and will remain as the standard of care from a daily oral standpoint. But we also see that's an opportunity in the switch segment. So na\u00efve is a big piece probably the biggest piece for Biktarvy\u2019s growth. And the switch because we have such a large share obviously, right? So from a switch segment that offers us another opportunity for us to play bigger market space in HIV. Operator : Our next question is from Carter Gould at Barclays. Go ahead Carter. Your line is open. Carter Gould : Great, thank you. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe another one on Purpose 1. So again, the efficacy was very impressive. However we could see that north of 20% of patients that have nodules out to week 52. And I guess for Johanna, as you think about that profile in this setting recognizing they were only grade one, but sort of the long-term nature of those nodules, how do you see that influencing or impacting the profile, its demand and the potential for those patients then go back and you get retreated after six months? Thank you. Johanna Mercier : Sure and Carter, just to explain a little bit, the nodules are because it's a drug depot, right? So the nodule actually gets smaller over time. What we've seen is actually very little discontinuation in Purpose 1 due to that. That's number one. Two is the nodules are sometimes palpable not all? But sometimes palpable but not visible and generally speaking. And so we believe that actually we will have some. flexibility as well as to where those injections play out and where because I think, they've been studied in different places not just in the stomach in the site. And so, I think that'll be an opportunity as well for people to be a little bit more flexible as to where they get their injections. So we're not overly concerned there at all. Actually, and really we're taking it from the data that we're getting from Purpose 1 and hopefully, we'll have similar data to learn from Purpose 2. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Yee at Jefferies. Mike, go ahead your line is open. Michael Yee : Thank you, guys. We have one question on long-acting HIV, specifically. The potential for a Q6 month which I think could be a game changer. I think you have one or two of them on your slide and they are advancing. Can you tell me your confidence level on what you have there? Because if you follow HIV development you know that if it's generally safe and of all taller than significant barrel over reduction. You're in a pretty good spot in Phase 1, 2. Thank you. Let me know. Merdad Parsey : Hi, Michael, it\u2019s Merdad. Thanks, yeah. I think you raise the right question, which is that whenever we're looking at the long-acting, new long-acting agents, we have to be cautious about the transition from preclinical to clinical. We don't - we're not always able to predict the injection site reactions that you might get from the long-actings in particular. We were just talking about the nodules for lenacapavir but other more severe injection site reactions and then the human pharmacokinetics. So, I think we need those to play out to allow us to move forward and that's why you see multiple agents going into Phase 1. We have generated the number of molecules. We move them forward. We've been pretty aggressive in moving them forward in order to maintain our leadership in long-acting HIV treatment and prophylaxis. And so, once we start to see those data in Phase 1, I think that will help us decide both choosing between those molecules and where we want to go forward. Remember we're also moving our bNAb program forward, which will be our - which is our most advanced long-acting program with lenacapavir plus bNAbs and we should - we expect to get Phase 2 data from that that study, as well. So for those early programs, it's the usual risks and that which is why we take multiple shots and hopefully we'll be able to advance one of them quickly. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams at RBC Capital Markets. Brian, go ahead. Your line is open. Brian Abrahams : Hi, there. Thanks so much for taking my question. You guys have an oral GLP-1 GS 4751 in your preclinical pipeline. Are you planning to move it forward? And as you've continue to diversify that portfolio, how are you guys thinking about the obesity landscape and potentially participating? Or are there other metabolic areas in adjacencies that you may be more interested in pursuing? Thanks. Merdad Parsey : Thanks, Brian. Yes, we have shared some preclinical data on 4571. As you know, it is an internally developed oral GLP1 agonist which came out of our initial interest in our NASH program. And based on the data so far both preclinical and the toxicity we are planning a Phase 1 study for that molecule and that'll help us evaluate 4571 for weight management, obesity and other metabolic diseases. Once we generate those data, we will decide in a data-driven way, how best to proceed from there. And we'll just have to see how that plays out. We want to make sure if we dealt something as best-in-class and allows for a best-in-class profile. So we will update more as the data are generated. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Schott at JPMorgan. Chris, go ahead, your line is open. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks, so much. My questions or just my other question was just on the US CAR-T franchise. Just want to get your latest view on how we should be thinking about sequential growth from here and maybe as part of that can we just get an update on kind of your community physician engagement with the CAR-T is any leading indicators that you're seeing there that'll help could move the guide some of the efforts or when we could start seeing the impact from some of these efforts in the US? Thank you. Johanna Mercier : Thanks, Chris. We are really pleased with our strong cell therapy growth this quarter. And this is really part and parcel to our US refresh strategy. So as a reminder we restructured our sales team at the end of last year and we got our new sales team in place and trained and ready to go. And as part of that strategy we also focused for the next couple of quarters on really within the authorized treatment centers making sure those referrals occur between the lymphoma specialist to the CAR-T specialist. And that's what you're seeing as part of the excellent performance that we had this quarter. And we'll continue to deliver and really focus on the referrals within the AGC. We are also in parallel building up that those community practices and spending time educating both the community practices, I'd say regional hospitals and those institutions about the curative potential of CAR-T and why it's important to bring this into the therapy that they're offering to their patients. And we're making really good progress there including a lot of work with national payers. But despite all this, as you heard earlier from both Dan and Johanna, we are facing, it's a dynamic market. We're remaining cautious for the second half of this year as we continue to see some competitive headwinds both in cost competition. So we have new indications that came out in late May, early June time frame which are capturing physician mind share initially and we're also seeing out of cost competition with the bispecifics. But with all of that said, we are focused on execution and working with our physicians and institutions to raise awareness of the curative potential for CAR-T and will continue to do so in the second half of this year. As it relates to community practices, I shared last quarter that it's taking us a little bit longer than we had expected to get them up and fully operating. But we're making great progress as it relates to that and learning a lot along the way. So we're continuing to refine our blueprint as we onboard new centers. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Seedhouse at Raymond James. Steve, go ahead. Your line is open. Steven Seedhouse : Yes, thank you very much. Just given some of the newer tailwinds out of oncology, so lenacapavir obviously which you indicated could redefine the PrEP market and then seladelpar, of course as well. When you just combine that with the updated view of oncology pipeline, are you still expecting the 2030 revenue mix to be about a third of oncology? Or is that more of a moving target? So when you could comment on the long-term outlook. Thank you. Merdad Parsey : Yeah, thanks Steven for the question. So one-third of sales remains our target with the portfolio that we have today and what we believe is achievable without additional BD. I'll just remind you - keep in mind that the indications in that target are probability adjusted and many of them around 50% So, you'd expect to see puts and takes in that pipeline evolution. We certainly expected that when we when we set that target. So it allows for some programs to fail or fall short of initial expectations and others obviously succeed to support achieving that goal. I would just note that our oncology sales today are already more than a third of the way there. In quarter two 2024, they're about 12% of the total product sales growing nicely. So it's highlighting the progress we're making on this on this overall goal. I think you're right to point out also the progress and as you put at the tailwinds with a virology business and lenacapavir data as well as seladelpar, obviously, as that grows that that puts even more stretch to our ambition. It's a good problem to have. But I think the ambition we have is very much along the lines of diversifying our business as well as solidifying our base in virology and we're firmly committed to that strategy. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Anderson at Wolf Research. Tim, go ahead. Your line is open. Tim Anderson : Thank you. I have a question on the tro toothpaste, so sometime before or around your end will get your phase 3 first line triple negative readout with trodelvy from the ASCENT-03 trial and we'll also be getting Astra's TROPION-Breast02 and the design of those trials are quite similar, which will allow try for the best side-by-side comparisons thus far of your drug versus Astra\u2019s. And I'm sure you thought about this a lot. What's your prediction for how those results will likely stack up against each other? I'm guessing you'll show less ILD as one benefit, but how do you think efficacy and other safety metrics will compare? Merdad Parsey : Sure, this is Merdad. Maybe, like I think you hit the highlights. We are \u2013 trodelvy has demonstrated great efficacy in the triple negative breast cancer space and we remain I think the only approved Trop-2 ADC and that space in triple negative is definitely where trodelvy is doing very well and has become the standard care for most physicians. So, I think that sets us up nicely and ASCENT-03 as we update the status of that trial as the end of the year rolls around I think will be part of the continuation of that story and our expectation for trodelvy\u2019s success in triple negative breast cancer. We have felt that there are areas where our programs aren't differentiated and for Trodelvy as you mentioned our adverse event profile has remained largely predictable and very manageable on the part of physicians we certainly both the ILD you mentioned as well as stomatitis has been very different in their manifestations and mostly for trodelvy it's been neutropenia and diarrhea, which I think clinicians have gotten very comfortable with managing certainly when we speak to our KOLs. So we'll be looking for those data and we'll look for our data and in particular and I think is a continuation of where we think trodelvy can go and really solidify our position in triple negative breast. Johanna Mercier : Yeah, I would just re-emphasize what Merdad said, I think just the fact we are the ones on the market today and so well established as the number one standard of care and triple negative breast cancer second line. I do think that that is a big differentiator here as we think about some of these data points. Operator : Our next question comes from Salveen Richter at Goldman Sachs. Salveen, go ahead. Your line is open. Salveen Richter : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. With regard to the long-acting program, could you speak more about potential read through from Purpose 1 to Purpose 2 and whether they're typically any differences in responses to HIV drugs in these different patient populations? And regarding the strategy to expand the PrEP market, could you speak to specific strategies here? And why you haven't been able to reach these patients already? Thank you. Daniel O'Day: Thanks, Salveen it\u2019s kind of a two-part. So I'll have Merdad start and maybe have Johanna add, as well. Merdad Parsey : Yeah, Salveen, you're absolutely right that the patient populations are different is why we did the broad Purpose program to really get a diversity of patients early in our program to ensure that we can bring PrEP to a variety of populations early on in our in our development. And the patient populations are different we're talking really cisgender women relative to the Purpose 2 population, which is a different population. And our expectation is that those populations have different levels of awareness, different levels of compliance and there are use of PrEP otherwise for example with the oral PrEP agents. And despite that, I think the strength of the Purpose 1 data and the fact that you have people who are essentially protected for six months with no infections occurring in the cisgender women so far I think give us a lot of confidence that with I would expect some variability in the background infection rate in the population. If we are able to maintain that degree of protection in Purpose 2 we remain really confident that the outcome will be very powerful. Johanna Mercier : And maybe to pick up on the second part of that, Salveen. So just to take a step back, I think it\u2019s important to understand how much we have moved the needle actually when you think about the penetration in the prevention market. Just a couple of years ago, you were about 25% penetrating when you if you consider it from a CDC standpoint estimate, we're now over a third of that. So we have really grown this market and expanded it. I think one of the challenges has definitely been this is not a typical market that you it's not HIV treatment. It is a market where these are individuals that are not sick. They have no asymptomatic, obviously they have nothing and so therefore it's very challenging when you think about a daily oral pill, which is today over 95% of the total market where you think about current generics or Descovy share. And taking a pill every single day is incredibly challenging. So many use PrEP on demand. And I do think and in that the biggest population that we see are actually wide MSMs so very much a high commercial market here. And we believe that there is a real opportunity to whip something that has the profile of lenacapavir with a twice yearly subcu that we can truly expand the reach of the people, the individuals that could truly benefit from prevention for the future. And so, so that's kind of the steps. So I think it's an ongoing growth that we've been seeing. I think we have to do a step change here as we think about the future of prevention. I think we have to think completely differently about what lenacapavir could offer all of these people and really make a dent in this HIV epidemic. Operator : Our last question comes from Olivia Brayer at Cantor Fitzgerald. Olivia, go ahead. Your line is open. Our next question comes from James Shin at Deutsche Bank. James, go ahead. Your line is open. James Shin : Hey guys, thanks for the question. For PrEP, is the move to PARPI a net positive to access and when Len is eventually proved for PrEP. Do you expect the markets remain mostly by and bill? Thank you. Johanna Mercier : Sure. I\u2019ll take that one. So the move the entity for PrEPs that CMS is working on, I do think it's positive. I think it's really around providing greater access and potentially providing also the services that go with it. So the D2B could actually be a nice move despite the fact that today Medicare is a very small piece of the total prevention market. As we think about lenacapavir, I think it'll be both. I think there's probably opportunities for it to be both a pharmacy benefit as well as a medical benefit and be a buy and bill and I think we just need to think very differently because buy and bill in the current users of prevention this is not something that they're familiar with. And so this is something we're really thinking about today for tomorrow is to setting up that system to make sure they understand how to do this, if they want to do it, but that they have an option if they don't want to do it. And I think that's what we're kind of planning for us as we think about the future of lenacapavir. Operator : That concludes the time we have for questions. I\u2019ll invite Dan to share any closing remarks. Daniel O'Day: Thank you, everybody. In closing, we the team here would like to summarize the quarter as follows : we had a very strong quarter of revenue growth and impressive bottom-line growth that highlights the leverage in our model. Secondly, we made progress that should enable us to build on that growth in the future including really remarkable data from the Purpose 1 one trial and from across the HIV portfolio with the promise to extend our HIV leadership well into the late 2030s and beyond; the imminent launch of seladelpar in the US and continued progress in oncology; and all this leaves us well positioned for the second half of 2024 when we will continue to focus on quarter after quarter of strong clinical commercial and financial execution. My thanks to the Gilead teams and to all of you for joining today. I want to hand it over to Jacquie Ross for some final comments. Jacquie Ross : Thank you, Dan and thank you all for joining us today. One final housekeeping item. I can share that we are tentatively planning to release our third quarter 2024 earnings results on Thursday, November 7th? Please note that this date is provisional and could be changed to accommodate scheduling conflicts that arise between now and then. As always, we will announce our confirmed date following the close of the third quarter. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and look forward on updating you on our progress throughout the quarter.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Gilead's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Rebecca, and I'll be your host for today. In a moment we'll begin with our prepared remarks, followed by our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now hand the call over to Jackie Ross, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Strategic Finance. Jackie Ross : Thank you, Rebecca. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the third quarter of 2024. The press release, slides and supplementary data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey, and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open the call to Q&A, where the team will be joined by Cindy Perettie, the Executive Vice President of Kite. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. Please refer to Slide 2 regarding the risks and uncertainties relating to forward-looking statements that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan. Daniel O'Day : Thank you, Jackie. And good afternoon, everyone. The team and I are pleased to share Gilead's third quarter results, highlighting another very strong quarter of commercial and operational execution with robust year-over-year revenue performance across HIV, Oncology, and Liver Disease, including 9% growth in HIV. We also delivered strong bottom-line results that highlight the leverage in our business model and reflect our ongoing commitment to disciplined expense management. Based on our financial results year-to-date, we are increasing our 2024 guidance across almost every metric, including revenue and non-GAAP gross margin, operating income, and EPS. We continue to make excellent progress in our Virology and Inflammation programs in the third quarter. The results from the PURPOSE 2 study, which build on the 100% efficacy shown in PURPOSE 1, demonstrate lenacapavir's unmatched clinical profile observed for HIV prevention. If approved, lenacapavir, as the first twice-yearly subcutaneous injection for HIV prevention, could make a major impact on global public health and significantly catalyze the prevention market. I'm pleased to share that the FDA recently granted breakthrough therapy designation to Lenacapavir, and we are on track to file before the end of this year. We look forward to sharing information on our plans for lenacapavir and the rest of our leading HIV portfolio at our HIV Analyst Event on December 10th. We are very encouraged by the launch of Livdelzi for primary biliary cholangitis or PBC, which was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in August. Livdelzi is a highly differentiated option for people with PBC who do not respond well to first-line therapy. Demand in the third quarter was ahead of our internal expectations, and we expect to see growing momentum into 2025 and beyond. Livdelzi brings the number of innovative therapies launched by Gilead since 2019 to six, representing another step towards our goal of delivering at least 10 transformative therapies by 2030. Moving to Oncology, we are excited to share preliminary data from the registrational Phase 2, iMMagine-1 study of Anito-Cel for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma at ASH next month, in addition to updated data from the Phase 1 study, together with our partner Arcellx. We're also pleased to have begun the Phase 3, iMMagine-3 study in earlier-line patients. The combination of Anito-Cel\u2019s potential best-in-class clinical profile with Kite's leading cell therapy manufacturing has the ability to transform care for a large number of multiple myeloma patients. We continue to evolve our Oncology program in response to clinical data, regulatory feedback, and the competitive environment. We are carefully prioritizing our resources for the most promising programs. For example, we are advancing Trodelvy in first-line PD-L1 high metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, where we have seen supportive data in combination with pembro, while discontinuing development in second-line plus. We are also starting a new program for small cell lung cancer based on promising efficacy data from the Phase 2 TROPiCS-0 basket trial. Touching briefly on Slide 6, we have completed all of the clinical milestones and updates we targeted for 2024 and look forward to a strong end to the year, with key presentations coming up at ASH and our HIV Analyst Events in December. Those are the main points I wanted to share for now in what has been a very strong third quarter, thanks to the tremendous efforts of the Gilead teams. I look forward to our Q&A session at the end. And now I will pass it on to Johanna. Johanna Mercier : Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. It was another strong quarter of commercial execution across the business, and I'm proud of the work the teams continue to do to expand the reach of our medicines to many more people and patients around the world. As shown on Slide 8, total product sales, excluding Veklury, were $6.8 billion in the third quarter, up 7% year-over-year, reflecting strong growth across HIV, Oncology, and Liver Disease. Including Veklury, total product sales were $7.5 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Starting with HIV on Slide 9, sales of $5.1 billion were up 9% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, primarily driven by higher average realized price due to shifts in channel mix and higher demand across treatment and PrEP. The third quarter once again demonstrated the quarterly pricing variability we see in HIV. Specifically, we saw adjustments to government channels where there's a multi-quarter lag for certain claims data. As a result, the quarter reflected more favorable average realized pricing. Year-to-date, HIV sales have grown 5%, well above our prior full-year growth target of 4%. With that outperformance in mind, we're increasing our full-year HIV growth expectation to 5%, and we remind you to focus on full-year versus quarterly trends. To that end, for the fourth quarter in particular, we expect HIV sales to be roughly flat, quarter-over-quarter, with continued demand growth and modest seasonal inventory builds, offset by the third quarter pricing dynamics discussed earlier that are not expected to repeat. Turning to Slide 10, Biktarvy third quarter sales of $3.5 billion increased 13% year-over-year, driven by higher demand as well as higher average realized price due to shifts in channel mix, partially offset by inventory dynamics. Sequentially, sales were up 7%, primarily driven by channel mix and higher demand. In the U.S. and across major markets, Biktarvy continues to be the regimen of choice for those starting treatment and switching therapies, and has grown for 25 consecutive quarters. In the U.S., Biktarvy's share grew to over 49%, up more than 2% year-over-year, and remains the leading regimen for HIV treatment. Gilead is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in the HIV treatment market with four new regimens by the end of 2030. Overall, the HIV treatment market continues to grow in line with our expectations of 2% to 3% annually. Moving to Descovy, third quarter sales were $586 million, up 15% year-over-year, reflecting higher demand and average realized price due to channel mix, partially offset by inventory dynamics. Sequentially, sales were up 21%, primarily driven by channel mix and higher demand. The U.S. PrEP market continues to demonstrate robust growth, up 13% year-over-year, and Descovy for PrEP remains the leading branded option, capturing over 40% market share despite the availability of generics and other regimens. Overall, Descovy for PrEP sales make up an increasing portion of total Descovy sales, representing roughly 80% in the third quarter. This is a strong foundation as we prepare for the first anticipated commercial launch of lenacapavir for PrEP next year. Lenacapavir's remarkable clinical profile and unmatched twice-yearly administration offer the potential to redefine the HIV prevention market, and we look forward to sharing more details on our commercialization plans and treatment programs at our HIV analyst event in December. In the meantime, we look to file for approval in the U.S. before the end of the year and are well underway with our preparations for the first commercial launch in 2025. In addition to our commercial plans, we're particularly proud of our commitment to make lenacapavir available in 120 high-incidence, resource-limited countries as quickly as possible, ensuring access for lenacapavir for PrEP is made as broadly available upon approval. Moving to the Liver Disease portfolio on Slide 11, sales of $733 million in the third quarter were up 4% year-over-year, driven by increased demand across our viral hepatitis portfolio, partially offset by pricing dynamics, including shifts in channel mix in the U.S. Sequentially, after an incredibly strong second quarter, sales declined 12%, primarily driven by inventory dynamics and fewer patients starts in HCV. Turning to Slide 12, in mid-August, we launched Livdelzi in the U.S. for PBC, with the first prescription written within a few hours of the accelerated approval. Furthermore, with 100% of our U.S. commercial organization trained by the time of launch, we quickly reached more than 1,000 of our target prescribers within the first several weeks. Overall, we're very encouraged with the patient demand we're seeing so far, which is ahead of our internal expectations. We believe this reflects the differentiated profile of Livdelzi as the only approved therapy, with statistically significant improvements in both ALP and pruritus, as well as an established safety profile. Sales in the third quarter were modest, as we expected, in the low single-digit million, and reflective of the ramp-up time required to onboard patients and providers, and to work through step-edits and prior authorizations that are normal for a rare disease launch. We expect to start building momentum as we enter 2025, when we look to a more meaningful sales contribution. Outside the U.S., launch preparations are ongoing, and we look forward to the European Regulatory decision in early 2025. Moving to Slide 13, Veklury has continued to remain the antiviral standard of care for hospitalized patients treated for COVID-19, including in the U.S., with more than 60% share in this setting. Altogether, with higher than expected hospitalizations in the summer months, sales in the third quarter were up 9% year-over-year to $692 million. Year-to-date sales of $1.5 billion are now well ahead of our initial full-year guidance of $1.3 billion. As a result, we're raising our full-year guidance for Veklury to approximately $1.8 billion. Now, turning to Oncology on Slide 14, Gilead or Kite therapies have treated more than 65,000 patients globally, highlighting our continued growing reach. Sales for the quarter were $860 million, up 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by Trodelvy growth. Sequentially, Oncology sales were down 3%, with growth in Trodelvy offset by a decline in cell therapy. Beginning with Trodelvy on Slide 15, sales of $332 million were up 17% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting higher demand in all regions. In breast cancer, Trodelvy remains well-positioned as the only approved and commercially available TROP2-directed ADC to demonstrate clinically meaningful survival benefits across two types of metastatic breast cancers. Notably, Trodelvy is the standard of care for second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, with ongoing adoption in the pretreated HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer setting. We're pleased to see both indications contribute to Trodelvy's growth year-over-year, despite an evolving competitive landscape. Turning to Slide 16, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, cell therapy sales of $485 million in the third quarter were flat year-over-year, with strong 23% growth outside the U.S., offset by the U.S. Sequentially, total cell therapy sales were down 7% due to competitive headwinds both in and out of class in the U.S., which we expect to continue into 2025. As a pioneer in cell therapy, Kite\u2019s focus is to expand overall utilization and increase class share. As part of this work, we're partnering with government agencies and healthcare associations to amplify education of the benefits of CAR-T and remove barriers to access. To date, only two of every 10 eligible patients receive CAR-T in second-line plus large B-cell lymphoma in the U.S., and we are committed to removing these barriers so we can deliver potentially curative therapies like Yescarta to more patients. In the community setting, Kite is leading the way in identifying and lowering barriers and building the right ecosystem to enable more people to receive CAR-T beyond the reach of an academic medical institution. Today, CAR-T sites often need to be accredited, typically by the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy, or FACT, and this requirement has been highlighted as a hurdle for our community partners to achieve national pay reimbursement. In the meantime, we're pleased to share that we have treated our first few patients as part of our community strategy, demonstrating that we can deliver Yescarta in this setting. Outside the U.S., we saw year-over-year demand growth as we continue to expand into the second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma setting in Europe and launch a new market. In particular, we're encouraged by our progress in Japan, where we have on-boarded more than 50 authorized treatment centers in little over a year, with more to come in the near future. Overall, I would like to thank the commercialization teams for their hard work to deliver another strong quarter and first nine months of the year. With launch activities underway in PBC and for HIV prevention launch next year, our teams are excited to bring our transformative medicines to many more people and patients globally. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad. Merdad Parsey : Thank you, Johanna. We're very pleased to wrap up the third quarter with another exciting update from our PURPOSE program, evaluating Lenacapavir for HIV prevention. As shown on Slide 18, we shared two oral presentations on our PURPOSE 2 HIV prevention trial at the HIV Research for Prevention Conference in October. Following the remarkable 100% efficacy reported from an interim analysis of the PURPOSE 1 trial in cisgender women in June, PURPOSE 2 was also stopped at the interim in September. Notably, twice yearly subcutaneous Lenacapavir significantly reduced incidence of HIV infections compared to both background HIV incidence and Truvada in the exceptionally diverse population of cisgender men and gender diverse people in a Phase 3 prevention trial. These PURPOSE 1 and 2 results demonstrated Lenacapavir's unprecedented results for HIV prevention. We look forward to sharing additional insights at the HIV Glasgow meeting next week, including persistence data from PURPOSE 1 and a deeper look into the efficacy data from PURPOSE 2. Based on these data, FDA has now granted breakthrough therapy designation for Lenacapavir for HIV prevention. We continue to target regulatory submission before the end of the year in the U.S., while at the same time preparing for filings with other global regulatory authorities. Beyond our registrational PURPOSE 1 and 2 programs, we continue to generate additional data from the Phase 2, PURPOSE 3, 4, and 5 trials in key populations across the U.S., U.K., and France. These studies are intended to contribute additional data in communities where the use of or access to prevention options have historically been challenging. Turning to our HIV treatment pipeline on Slide 19, we continue to make strong progress in developing novel regimens, including a once-daily oral regimen with two backbone therapies, Lenacapavir and Bictegravir. This novel combination has the potential to provide another effective daily oral option for people living with HIV, including the 6% to 8% of people currently on complex regimens. Recently, we completed enrollment of the Phase 3, ARTISTRY-1 trial within nine months of FPI and are on track to complete enrollment in ARTISTRY-2 by early 2025. Further, we've made strong progress for our two once-weekly oral programs. The Phase 2 study of our wholly owned combination of GS-4182, a pro-drug of Lenacapavir with enhanced oral bioavailability, and GS-1720, a long-acting integrase inhibitor, has now completed enrollment within two months of FPI, and we've enrolled our first participants into the Phase 3 ISLEND-1 and ISLEND-2 trials, evaluating the oral combination of Lenacapavir with Merck's NRTTI, Islatravir, for biologically suppressed people with HIV. We presented Week 48 data from the Phase 2 trial evaluating this once-weekly combination in a similar population at IDWeek. Participants in both, the Lenacapavir plus Islatravir and Biktarvy treatment arms maintained high rates of virologic suppression and no participants discontinued due to lymphocyte count decreases. Moving to our Liver Disease portfolio on Slide 20, FDA granted Livdelz an accelerated approval for the treatment of PBC in combination with UDCA in certain adults who have an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in certain patients unable to tolerate UDCA. We have already filed with EMA and expect a decision early next year. As part of the accelerated approval process, we continue to recruit for our confirmatory Phase 3 AFFIRM trial evaluating Seladelpar for improvement in event-free survival. Further, our Phase 3 IDELA trial is ongoing and offers us an opportunity to understand the effect of Seladelpar in normalizing alkaline phosphatase in a broader set of PBC patients who had an incomplete response to UDCA. Switching now to Oncology, on Slide 21, we continue to evolve our late-stage clinical programs in lung cancer in response to clinical data and the changing landscape. Reflective of our commitment to prioritizing the most significant opportunities across all our therapeutic areas, we've decided to discontinue further evaluation of Trodelvy in second line plus metastatic non-small cell lung cancer based on discussions with regulators following the EVOKE-01 readout earlier this year. In the front line, based on the totality of the data from the Phase 2 EVOKE-02 trial, we believe Trodelvy in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor without the addition of chemotherapy may have the greatest potential in this setting. To that end, our Phase 3 EVOKE-03 study of Trodelvy plus Pembro is ongoing in first-line patients with PD-L1 high metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Separately, we shared promising data for Trodelvy in extensive stage small cell lung cancer from our Phase 2 TROPiCS-03 basket trial and plan to advance development of Trodelvy in this population to a Phase 3 trial. We also look forward to sharing the results from Part I of the Phase 2 ARC-10 trial at the SITC meeting later this week, further adding to the body of data on Domvanalimab, our Fc-silent anti-TIGIT. As a reminder, we discontinued enrollment of ARC-10 earlier this year to prioritize the ongoing first-line Phase 3 DOM studies, STAR-121 in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and STAR-221 in upper GI cancers. Moving to Slide 22, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, we are excited to share updates at the upcoming ASH Conference, including our Phase 2 iMMagine 1 results for Anito-cel in fourth-line or later relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The ASH abstract shared yesterday reflects 58 patients who received Anito-cel with a median follow-up of 10.3 months as of the June 2024 cutoff. Treatment with Anito-cel demonstrated deep and durable efficacy with an objective response rate of 95% and a complete response rate of 62%. Of those available for MRD testing, 92% achieved MRD negativity. The median progression-free survival and overall survival had not yet been reached. Additionally, Arcellx announced yesterday that updated data from the Phase 1 study will be presented at ASH. In the meantime, Arcellx has already shared that an even later data cut from Phase 1 has shown that Anito-cel achieved a 30.2 month median progression-free survival, and median overall survival was not yet reached. In summary, we are encouraged by the compelling results so far, and with over 140 patients dosed across both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 iMMagine 1 studies, we have not yet seen any cases of delayed neurotoxicities. This includes no Parkinsonism, no cranial nerve palsies, and no Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. We'll be sharing updated data at the ASH conference and look forward to potentially offering Anito-cel\u2019s best-in-class profile to these late-stage multiple myeloma patients. Separately, we're pleased FDA has granted Kite the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designation, or RMAT, for the evaluation of Yescarta for newly diagnosed high-risk large B-cell lymphoma who have a positive PET scan after two cycles of first-line chemotherapy. Under the RMAT designation, the Yescarta development program for first-line treatment of high-risk large B-cell lymphoma will be able to access the benefits of the FDA's accelerated pathways, including fast-track and breakthrough designations. Our Phase 3 ZUMA-23 study in this setting is ongoing, and we look forward to sharing updates in due course. Moving to our milestones on Slide 23, a brief update on ASCENT-03. As a reminder, this is an event-driven trial, and I can share that we are continuing to accrue events at this time. With that in mind, it is possible we will not reach data cutoff this year, and we look forward to updating you in due course. Other updates this quarter included the readout of PURPOSE 2 data ahead of schedule, the review of our Phase 2 data for Lenacapavir plus our broadly neutralizing antibodies with plans to share the data at an upcoming scientific conference in 2025. The initiation of several key HIV, Trodelvy, and cell therapy trials, including enrollment for ISLEND-1, ISLEND-2, ASCENT-GYN-01, and iMMagine-3. In closing, I'd like to thank the Kite and Gilead Research and Development teams for a stellar quarter of execution. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Andy. Andrew Dickinson : Thank you, Merdad. And good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter results represent a strong quarter for Gilead. As shown on Slide 25, with our base business up 7% year-over-year to $6.8 billion, driven by growth in each of our core businesses. Veklury also delivered substantial growth, resulting in total product sales up 7% year-over-year to $7.5 billion. Before moving to non-GAAP, I'll highlight the impairment charge that impacted our third quarter financial results on a GAAP basis, as noted on Slide 26. As a reminder, this relates to the carrying value of the IPR&D indefinite live intangible assets acquired from Immunomedics in 2020. During the third quarter, we decreased the fair value by $1.8 billion, or $1.04 per share net of tax impact, reflecting the removal of the second-line non-small-cell lung cancer indication. The remaining $1.8 billion carrying value reflects Trodelvy's opportunity in the first-line setting. Note that the potential indications that we've begun to explore since the acquisition are not reflected in the carrying value, such as endometrial or small-cell lung cancer. Moving to our non-GAAP results for the third quarter on Slide 27. Product gross margin was 87%, up 84 basis points from last year, primarily due to product mix. R&D expenses were down 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by timing of clinical activities, such as the wind-down of the magrolimab program and the obeldesivir oral COVID studies, and supported by our broader expense management initiatives. Acquired IPR&D was $505 million, which reflects the $320 million buyout of global Livdelzi royalties from Janssen announced in August, and the $35 million upfront expense to initiate a new AI partnership with Genesis, in addition to ongoing collaboration expenses. SG&A was up 8% year-over-year, primarily due to timing of commercial and corporate activities, including the launch of Livdelzi in the United States, and other initiatives, including prelaunch preparations for Lenacapavir for PrEP. Operating margin for the third quarter was 43%. Excluding the impact of the royalty buyout charge from Janssen, operating margin would have been 47%. While there will always be some quarterly variability, recent results demonstrate a consistent trend of our operating margin firmly in the 40% plus range, and we remain focused on being an industry leader in terms of operating margin. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%, as compared to 7% in the same period last year. As a reminder, the tax rate in the third quarter of 2023 benefited from decreased tax reserves as a result of reaching an agreement with a tax authority on certain tax positions. In total, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.02 per share, as compared to $2.29 per share in the same period last year, primarily reflecting higher acquired IPR&D and tax expense, partially offset by higher product sales. As mentioned earlier, the $320 million expense related to buyout of global Livdelzi royalties from Janssen impacted our EPS by $0.20 per share. As highlighted on Slide 28, we had a strong first nine months of the year, with solid performance in each of our core franchises across HIV, Oncology, and Liver Disease, driving base business growth of 7% year-over-year, with Veklury already exceeding our initial full-year guidance of $1.3 billion. Altogether, total product sales for the nine months of 2024 were up 6% year-over-year. Moving to guidance on Slide 29. We are updating much of our guidance to reflect the very strong performance in our business so far this year. We are increasing our guidance for product sales, excluding Veklury, by $150 million at the midpoint from the prior range to a new range of $26 billion to $26.3 billion. In addition to our strong year-to-day performance, this guidance accounts for evolving competition in our cell therapy business. The increased revenue guidance also reflects higher full-year expectations for HIV, now expected to grow approximately 5% from 2023, compared to our prior expectations of 4%. This guidance implies that fourth-quarter HIV could be roughly flat, which we believe is prudent given the strength in the third quarter and the normal variability we can see with HIV pricing. We expect full-year Veklury revenue to be approximately $1.8 billion. We therefore expect full-year 2024 total product sales in the range of $27.8 billion to $28.1 billion, an increase of $650 million at the midpoint compared to the prior range. Turning to the rest of the P&L on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product gross margin to be approximately 86%, narrowed from our prior 85% to 86% range, and reflecting year-to-date results as well as our expectations for a more favorable product mix in the fourth quarter. We now expect R&D expense to decline a low single-digit percentage as compared to our prior outlook of low-to-mid single-digit growth, reflecting the discontinuation of certain programs and careful expense management. And there is no change to our prior expectations for both acquired IPR&D and SG&A. Reflecting these updates, we now expect operating income in the range of $8 billion to $8.3 billion, up from $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion previously. Full-year tax is expected to be approximately 27%, slightly lower than our prior 30% guidance, and reflecting the higher operating income for the full year as well as the negative impact from the one-time charge for the acquisition of CymaBay in the first quarter. As a reminder, this compares to our initial guidance in February of approximately 19% prior to the CymaBay impact. Altogether, we've raised our earnings per share guidance to a range of $4.25 and $4.45. This compares to our prior guidance of $3.60 to $3.90, and reflects both revenue outperformance and continued operating expense discipline. At the midpoints, our updated guidance represents an increase of $750 million in non-GAAP operating income and an increase of $0.60 in non-GAAP earnings per share. On a GAAP basis, EPS is expected to be $0.05 to $0.25. Moving to Slide 30, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the third quarter and a total of $3.7 billion in the first nine months of the year. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged with significant balance sheet flexibility. Overall, Gilead is on track to deliver an extremely strong 2024, and we're particularly pleased with our progress on operating expense management, which we believe sets us up well as we enter 2025. And now, I'll invite Rebecca to begin the Q&A. Operator : Thank you, Andy. At this time, we'll invite your questions. We ask you to be courteous and limit yourself to one question so that we can get to as many analysts as possible during today's call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Courtney Breen at Bernstein. Go ahead. Your line is open. Courtney Breen : Hi, there! Thank you so much for taking my question today. I'm interested in talking a little bit about the CAR T space. Specifically, can you help to dimensionalize the in-class versus out-of-class impacts on Yescarta this quarter, particularly as we think about Breyanzi and whether these results establish any need to kind of pivot the focus of the commercial strategy that you outlined in the presentation today? Daniel O\u2019Day: Thanks Courtney. So, we have Cindy Perettie here. I'll turn it over to her to respond. Cindy Perettie : Thanks Courtney for your question. So, if I look at the in-class competition that we face this quarter, it boils down to two things. One is two new indications, both in follicular lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma. And the second is an increase in capacity within manufacturing. So, that's the in-class space that we're facing. Out-of-class, we continue to face competition through bi-specifics. And I would put them probably at about 50-50 on what we're seeing today. From our strategy standpoint, we do not believe we have to pivot it. I think in the Oncology space, when new therapies get approved and new indications, it's very common for physicians to try out the new therapies, and we expect to see that, and we've seen that both with in-class and out-of-class competitors. We're continuing to focus on driving both, our class share and our brand share, and feel very confident in the plans that we have to-date to continue our expansion into the community and elsewhere. And I feel confident that we're going to build on our leadership, both for YESCARTA and TECARTUS, but also recognizing as we look ahead, anito-cel will be coming in 2026. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Yee at Jeffries. Mike, go ahead. Your line is open. Mike Yee : Great. Thanks. Congrats on a great quarter. Thinking about lenacapavir for PrEP, based on feedback from docs, we're hearing that there could be a good market and good adoption for swapping from current Descovy. Can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the launch of lenacapavir for PrEP next year? Could that be a fast launch? And think about the dynamics there, and is it buy-and-build? So, can you talk a little bit about how well you think that could launch and where the opportunity is? Thanks. Daniel O\u2019Day: Thanks Mike. We've got Joanna here, so let her take that question. Johanna Mercier : Thanks for the question. Yeah, I think we're very excited about the potential launch for lenacapavir for PrEP. The growth opportunities are clear for us, right. It's around market-size growth, when you think about more consumers using PrEP, and more prescribers prescribing it, so more physician-based, and then of course more countries, because thus far it's really been very U.S. focused. We do think there's a real expansion just in the consumers, when you think about right now the market is primarily white MSMs. We think there's a real opportunity to expand that to include Black, Latino individuals, young adults, cisgender women, transgender. So, there's a lot there, let alone prescribers. Right now, the prescribers we have are currently the ones that prescribe, generally speaking, for HIV treatment, and we think the market can be expanded much more broadly than that. And then of course countries, and as I was mentioning, I do think there's real opportunities when you think about a Lenacapavir for PrEP and the profile that it offers, quite differentiated. From a market-share growth, I think it'll be mixed. I think you are right. I think Lenacapavir, twice yearly SUBQ profile offers a lot, for people looking for HIV prevention who may want or need it, and I do think it will have some impact on both, Descovy from a daily oral standpoint, but also 55% of the market is actually generic oral. And I do think it's going to have a big impact across the whole daily oral market to see Lenacapavir come in. As to your question about how quickly we can do that, I mean, the plans for commercialization are well underway. We are thinking through, how do we make sure we make this a seamless experience for all of our customers? So that includes providers when they prescribe Lenacapavir, but also for consumers to make sure they have access to Lenacapavir, and that's looking at our distribution system, our reimbursement, and making sure that we just provide that seamless experience for all. So, more to come on that. We have the HIV analyst event coming up in December, and we'll be able to share a little bit more data there, but definitely an opportunity for us to grow overall Gilead's share in the prevention market, both with Descovy for those who prefer daily oral, but obviously the growth is really going to come from Lenacapavir for prevention. Operator : Our next question comes from Umer Raffat at Evercore. Go ahead. Your line is open. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus on anito-cel and delayed neurotox for a quick second, and it's a two-part question. First, I'm just curious, do you think is it the construct or the trial design or any other reason which explains the lack of delayed neurotox, GBS, etcetera? And secondly, do you think we now have sufficient data from the existing data sets in Phase 1, to rule out any delayed neurotox when the sample size expands to 500 to 1,000 patients in Phase 3 trials? Thank you very much. Cindy Perettie : Thank you, Umer. So, your question about our perspective on whether it's the construct or the trial design that relates to the delayed neurotoxicity that we haven't observed, we believe it's the construct. As a reminder, we have a very compact DD domain, and we think that that is a big piece of why we aren't seeing the delayed neurotoxin or continuing to look with our translational medicine group to uncover sort of pieces of that, but we're having increasing confidence that it's the construct. I think the second piece that you asked is, do we have sufficient data. Look, we're at 100 patients' worth of data between the Phase 1 of 38 patients and what we just shared in the ASH abstract. Coming forward to ASH, we're going to have a larger data set. We've done another data cut that we're cleaning now that we'll be presenting at ASH. So having that confidence of over 100 patients to-date and not observing the neurotoxicity, makes us recognize that we have a best-in-class construct, and we're really looking forward to sharing that data at ASH. Operator : Our next question comes from Tyler Van Buren at TD Cowen. Go ahead, your line is open. Tyler Van Buren : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Congratulations on the results. I just had another one on Anito-cel since the data reported yesterday were very exciting. So, with the expectation to be on the market in 2026, can you talk about the ability to scale the product upon launch? And to be more specific, is the manufacturing process similar enough to Yescarta and Tecartus, where the FDA will allow you to scale manufacturing at a faster pace, or will Anito-cel have to scale at the same initial pace that Yescarta and Tecartus did? Cindy Perettie : Yeah, so we have taken all of our learnings from Yescarta and Tecartus and applied that to the Anito-cel production. And as we shared last quarter, we have done the full tech transfer into our Maryland facility, and we're producing Anito-cel for iMMagine-3 study, where we have successfully dosed two patients now. And our turnaround times are looking very similar to our commercial product that we have today, again, having applied all those learnings. So, we don't have any concerns about our ability to scale. We've also not had feedback from the FDA that we would have to use the same approach as other competitors in this space. Operator : Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal at Wells Fargo. Mohit, go ahead. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Saadi on for Mohit. Thanks for taking our question. Maybe one on seladelpar. Could you share any early insights, especially regarding payer coverage into this launch, given that the other PPAR agonist is priced at a slight discount to seladelpar? Do you see this impacting payer preferences between these two options? Thank you. Johanna Mercier : Sure. I'll take that one. It\u2019s Joanna. So, we're really quite pleased with our initial launch. So, it's only been a few months. We launched mid-August, but so far we've exceeded our internal expectations for patient demand. And I just want to take a moment, and then I'll address your payer coverage question specifically. I'm just really pleased and proud of the cross-functional team that's come together so quickly. They were fully trained and mobilized within 24 hours of our approval, and we had our first script within hours of the approval from the FDA. We've reached over 1,000 of our key targets in the first two and a half weeks post-launch. And obviously, you can appreciate that our history in Liver Disease and our credibility here really opens the doors for the access to these key stakeholders for PBC, which really obviously is critical as you think about early launch dynamics, and so we're very excited about that. We also took a very clear strategy when it came to what we were looking for, for reimbursement, but also distribution. And so from day one, we enabled direct purchasing with a specialty distributor, which was actually quite pivotal when you think about key academic centers. And if you think about the business, it's probably a mix about 50-50 or so between the academic centers and in the community. The coverage so far with payers is very much in line with our expectations for rare disease, and we're really quite encouraged to see that no major barriers are happening to actually get access to Livdelzi outside of the typical ones that happen. But really, for appropriate patients, it takes a little bit more time, because we have to get through the step edits and the prior auth. But we are getting through and patients are having access to seladelpar and Livdelzi. So, we're excited and more to come as we think about 2024, but more importantly, as we ramp up into 2025, right. We've always said it would be a modest contribution in \u201824 with a more meaningful contribution to sales in 2025, so stay tuned. Operator : Next, we have Daina Graybosch from Leerink Partners. Go ahead. Your line is open. Daina Graybosch : Hi. Another one on anito-cel for me. I wonder what's gating the regulatory filing and also what will be required to build the market for anito-cel and myeloma beyond the stubborn sort of 20% penetration you are hitting your heads against in NHL second-line setting. Cindy Perettie : Thanks a lot, Dana, for the question. So, I think the components around the regulatory filing as you're aware, what we've seen with others in the space is that the FDA would be looking at 12 months' worth of data, where this will be a filing discussion that we have with FDA. We do believe we have a very differentiated safety profile, and we'll be talking to the agency about that review cycle based on that. The second question that you asked was around that today, only two out of 10 patients receiving CAR T. We know in multiple myeloma it's one out of 10, so we have our work to do. The work that we're putting towards the community practices and ungating some of the reimbursement access challenges, are the same challenges we will face, whether it's lymphoma or multiple myeloma. So all the applications we're putting forward in our plan today will apply to Anito-cel, and that's why it's really critical as we execute over the next 12 to 18 months, because we're really excited to bring Anito-cel to more patients. Operator : Our next question comes from Carter Gould at Barclays. Carter, go ahead. Your line is open. Carter Gould : Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Love all the Anito-cel questions, but I'm going to bring it back to HIV. I'm not sure who wants to take the question, but how should investors maybe gauge expectations of what we're going to hear at the analyst event? Should we expect an explicit peak sales target for Lenacapavir and PrEP, or how do you think about the long, maybe a long-term treatment market objective, or should we expect more of the qualitative market color that maybe Joanna referenced earlier? Thank you. Daniel O\u2019Day: Thanks Carter. This is Dan. So, first of all, we really look forward to hosting as many of you as possible at our HIV analyst event in December. And our intention is to start sharing some more of our plans on the commercialization for Lenacapavir with PrEP. Joanna has started to outline that on our quarterly calls, but we really need some more time to dimensionalize that market, to begin to discuss how we will approach different aspects of the Lenacapavir for PrEP market. I think you can expect them to be qualitative, but also quantitative from the opportunity. I think to your point about peak sales and things, that would come more into our guidance that would come more at the beginning of next year in terms of how we might see 2025 and beyond. But in addition to the commercialization, we're going to spend a lot of time on highlighting the progress of our long-acting treatment combinations. Merdad covered this in some of the prepared remarks, but we intend to bring you into even more detail about the progress of our long-acting treatment combinations in addition to what we've already disclosed. So we will have some new disclosures there. We'll also be able to share our perspective on how we see the treatment market evolving in the coming years, and I think that's an area of tremendous strength in terms of our overall program. As you know, we're processing a variety of long-acting treatment programs in parallel, to make sure that we have multiple options for patients from longer-acting orals to longer-acting injectables, and you can expect to get an update on the R&D progress of those, and some further update on timelines as we move forward. Again, just to remind you of course, the totality of our HIV business is such that we really don't have any significant patent expiries until Biktarvy in 2033. And really by that time, we will not only have the lend for PrEP unfolding over that period of time, but significant progress with potentially four new modalities for long-acting treatment even before 2033. So the intention is to really pull through and to show you the durability of our HIV business, well into the late 2030\u2019s. Operator : Our next question comes from Terence Flynn at Morgan Stanley. Terrence, go ahead. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Good evening. Thanks for taking our questions. This is Chris on for Terrence. Just one question for Andy. Are you confident that you can drive operating margin expansion in 2025 on an ex-IPR&D basis? Thank you. Andrew Dickinson : Hey Chris. It's Andy. Thanks for the question. We'll provide more specific guidance on 2025, of course, on our year-end call. What we've said though consistently and you see in the last two quarters is real progress in terms of letting the operating margin expand again as we now kind of enter a new phase of having now built the portfolio, executing both clinically and commercially, and really focusing on expense management. You see the strong operating margin both in the second quarter and the third quarter. Again, you heard my prepared remarks that the operating margin would have been 47% this quarter if you backed out the impact of the royalty purchase from Janssen on seladelpar. So we're off to a great start. Our ambition and expectation is that we will have an industry-leading operating margin over time. So again, it's too early to give any specific guidance on 2025. More to come, but we're really pleased with where we are and the progress that you've seen in the last couple quarters, and we're already in a very strong spot, and we'll continue to work to improve it over time. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Schott at JP Morgan. Chris, go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much. Just another HIV question on combos. I think you said you\u2019ve got a number of one of the capavir combos in development. I guess I'm just trying to get my hands around, when you think about the portfolio, where do you see SUBQ injectables playing in the treatment market relative to some of your weekly oral options? I looked at that chart and it seemed a lot of the programs by 2030 in the bNAbs were on the oral side. So I was trying to get a sense of like how important is SUBQ injectable there, or do you see this mostly as a longer-acting oral opportunity for the company? Thank you. Daniel O\u2019Day: Merdad is here Chris. We'll let him answer that. Thanks. Merdad Parsey : Hi, Chris. The way we're approaching this is really to take a very broad approach. With the success with lenacapavir so far in what we've seen. We think that really forms a great foundation for us. And we believe that there is enough demand in both the oral and the injectable areas for us to be developing in both. So to your point, we really do see an opportunity for PrEP on the oral side for us to provide either weekly or monthly options, potentially also then going into the treatment market farther down the road, and in subcutaneous, and the key differentiator being the durability of the treatment. So, on the oral side, weekly to monthly. On the injectable side we think we can get to every three months and hopefully even up to every six months and beyond. So I think that's the key differentiator for us in terms of how we think about the opportunity. And of course, different people will be looking for different approaches, and our goal, our aim is to provide those options for them. Johanna Mercier : Yeah, maybe just to add to Merdad's comments, our approach is truly patient-centric. The opportunity is just to make sure that we answer and address the needs, and the needs have been mixed. I think there are some that really do prefer to be reminded and can take an oral pill only and don't want an injectable. And others don't really want to think about HIV if they don't have to, and if they can take four injections a year, that could do it as well or two even, as to Merdad's comments as well. So more to come on that as to what we're doing, but the intent is truly, as we're leaders today in HIV, both across treatment and prevention, the intent is to continue to remain leaders for the future, and that's really with the pipeline that we have in our portfolio and the combinations that we have. So we're excited about the future and what it holds. Andrew Dickinson : And Chris, it's Andy. Maybe I'll just add one thing. The slide references the products that we expect to have approved by 2030. You should not read into that, that we don't expect these long-acting subcutaneous products to come to market even shortly after that. So we'll provide more guidance over time. Again, we'll talk more about the portfolio at our HIV day as Dan mentioned, but we were just focusing purely on that slide to the end of the decade. It doesn't mean that we don't see a series of potential product launches beyond that as well, so more to come. Thanks for the question. Operator : Next, Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Salveen, go ahead. Your line is open. Salveen Richter : Hi. Can you hear me? Operator : Salveen? Salveen Richter : Yes. Thank you. Sorry about that. Good afternoon. So you've noted that prior, with regard to your long-acting HIV PrEP market, that about 400,000 people are on PrEP today, and that could increase to 600,000 by 2030. Is that still a fair assumption? And if so, where does this growth likely come from? And what do you view as a fair estimate for the portion of that 600,000 that'll prefer an oral option? Thank you. Johanna Mercier : Yes. So Salveen, I'll try to address that one and you'll hear more about that actually as we go into the HIV analyst event as well in early December. So we do believe that it's at least 600,000 by 2030. Now, this is a market in the past that we've really worked at through social media, direct-to-consumer, etc., to really make sure we activate it and that's how it's grown thus far to about 350,000 to 400,000 consumers today. We think there's a real opportunity and most of the growth is going to come from different consumers to be honest. So thus far, the vast majority of consumers of HIV PrEP are white MSMs. And so we think with PURPOSE 1, PURPOSE 2, and actually other PURPOSE studies to follow, this is the broadest clinical trial program that we've ever done in prevention or that's ever been done in prevention. And it includes many other consumers that I think really may need or even want prevention, and that includes Latino, black individuals, women, cisgender women, transgender, and then even young adults right. And so a lot of that growth is going to come from there. So could it be beyond the 600,000? Absolutely, 600,000. And we do think that most of that is going to be driven by a new option on the market, and that is Lenacapivir for prevention. To have something that you don't need to think about when you are not ill to take every single day versus twice a year is a big differentiation, let alone with the data and efficacy that we've shown in both PURPOSE 1 and PURPOSE 2. So, more to come on that. I do think we have a lot of opportunities here. And the intent is to truly work on expanding this market for the future. I think it's not about thinking about what's currently in play today, but actually what it could be by 2030 with a little bit of investment and education and awareness. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Biegler at Oppenheimer. Matt, go ahead. Your line is open. Matt Biegler : Great. Thanks so much for the question. I had a question on ASCENT-03 with that coming up. Can you just comment on how much larger you think that frontline opportunity is in triple negative breast cancer? Thanks. Johanna Mercier : Yeah. So as you move up earlier lines of therapy, obviously, as TNBC progresses unfortunately quite rapidly, the market is actually quite larger. It's probably just about double more. And then of course, the split between PD-L1 negative and PD-L1 positive, and that's ASCENT-03, ASCENT-04, that's a bit of a split as well. A little bit more on the negative than the positive in TNBC. And so we do think with ASCENT-03, and then the future with ASCENT-04 moving up in earlier lines of therapy, it can really make a difference for these women. If we can show overall survival in this setting as well, I think that can be incredibly powerful for us. As we've really established our place in second-line plus as the standard of care, really the opportunity would be to move up with those women to really make a difference earlier on in their metastatic disease. Operator : Next, we have Asthika Goonewardene from Truist. Go ahead. Your line is open. Karina Rabayeva : Hi, this is Karina for Asthika. I had a couple of questions. You mentioned that you had three patients, those on iMMagine-3 study. Just wondering how many of the 130 clinical trial sites are including patients? And another one is also, you expect anito-cel to be used in outpatient settings since the time to onset of CRS was only two days. And Legend had previously mentioned that 45% of their patients are being used in outpatient settings, so your thoughts on that as well. Thank you. Cindy Perettie : Yeah, we don't usually share the number of clinical sites that we have recruiting, but trust that the team is working hard to get all 130 up and going. You were asking a little bit about the outpatient profile. We believe that this therapy has an outpatient profile. You can tell by just looking at the ICANNs and CRS rates that we're seeing, and we've actually designed that into our phase, iMMagine-3 Phase 3 programs. So we'll have data generated in that outpatient setting. As you talked about the onset, I think that's the component that we've designed into the trial. Operator : Our last question comes from Brian Abrahams at RBC Capital Markets. Brian, go ahead. Your line is open. Brian Abrahams : Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. Given the potential for Medicaid cutbacks under a new administration, can you remind us around the degree of Medicaid exposure across your HIV franchise and the mechanics of how access and reimbursement work for these patients with respect to a federal budget, and also how such cuts might impact your outlook if at all? Thanks. Johanna Mercier : Sure. So let me try to address that one, although I think there's still more to come right, so we need a little bit more to see how this plays out for Medicaid specifically. At this point in time, patients that are in HIV always have a fallback position. So if Medicaid is where we go, that's probably about mid to high 20% of our total HIV business, and that is a percentage of our business that we watch very closely. There's also A-DAPT [ph] that supports through the same system. So there are different ways to get access for patients in this setting. And honestly, what we're tracking more closely in the overall channel mix that we think about HIV is more the growth that we've seen in 340B settings, which also can impact the Medicaid patient population. So from an access standpoint, it's never an issue to get HIV. There's different parachutes that are available for all of these patients, and we're going to watch very closely any Medicaid cutbacks at this point in time, but nothing's yet been announced. Operator : That completes the time that we have for questions. I'll invite Dan to share any closing remarks. Daniel O'Day : First of all, thank you all for joining. This has really been the strongest quarter for us of the year. The key highlights you've heard over the course of the discussion, both commercially but also clinically, the promise of our portfolio, the remarkable Phase 2 PURPOSE \u2013 sorry, excuse me, the PURPOSE 2 data on Lenacapivir, the very encouraging initial launch of seladelpar, and the data on anito-cel. I just want you to know we're firmly focused as a team on strong commercial and clinical execution. We'll continue to prioritize resources, and we have a commitment to ongoing OpEx management. I'll just flag two things between now and the end of the year. That's obviously what we've spoken about, the HIV analyst event in December, and also the upcoming presentation of anito-cel at ASH. And with that, I thank you for joining. I'll turn it over to Jackie to close the call. Jackie Ross : Thank you, Dan, and thank you all for joining us today. One final housekeeping item. I can share that we are tentatively planning to release our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings results on February 11, 2025. Please note that this date is provisional and could be changed to accommodate scheduling conflicts that arise between now and then. As always, we will announce our confirmed date following the close of the quarter. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the quarter.",
